She had initially alleged that Cosby assaulted her in 1974 when she was 15, but later revised that claim.</p> <p>Huth first filed the lawsuit in 2014, as Cosby faced accusations from dozens of women, but the case was delayed due to a criminal trial in Pennsylvania.</p> <p>In that case, a Pennsylvania jury convicted Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004. Cosby had previously agreed to pay Constand more than $3m as part of a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/arts/cosby-trial-juror-protest.html\">civil settlement</a>.</p> <p>The state’s supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/30/bill-cosby-sexual-assault-conviction-overturned-by-pennsylvania-court\">overturned</a> Cosby’s conviction on a legal technicality last year and released him from prison just two years into his sentence. The move dealt a painful blow to the dozens of women who have accused the TV star of sexual assault, attempted abuse and harassment.</p> <p>Huth has said she and a friend met Cosby at a park, according to her filings, and that the actor days later took her and her friend to the Playboy mansion. At the mansion, Huth alleges, Cosby assaulted her, “putting his hand down her pants, and then taking her hand in his hand and performing a sex act on himself without consent”<strong>.</strong> </p> <p>Cosby has acknowledged meeting Huth, but since 2014 has denied her allegations of assault or that she was a minor when they met. His legal team has called Huth’s revision of the year the alleged assault took place a “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-cosby-sexual-assault-trial-plaintiff-judy-huth-evidence-change/\">trial by ambush</a>”.</p> <p>Gloria Allred, Huth’s attorney, challenged that claim. “It is a trial by evidence. We believe that the defense was well aware of the fact that the incident at the Playboy mansion occurred in 1975 when Judith Huth was 16 years old prior to our notifying the defense in a court filing in early May.</p> <p>“What we believe they are upset about is that they were intending to ambush Ms Huth on the witness stand by proving that the event at the mansion could not have occurred when she was 15 years old and we upset their plans.”</p> <p>Huth’s case is one of several civil suits to have been filed by women against Cosby, but the first to reach the trial stage.</p> <p>The statute of limitations for criminal charges in Huth’s case has long since expired, but she is able to seek damages due to a recent California law that extended the time period in which victims of child sex abuse can file civil lawsuits.</p> <p>Cosby does not plan to testify in the trial, a spokesperson told <a href=\"https://people.com/crime/bill-cosby-sexual-assault-trial-begins-jury-selection-defendant-will-not-testify/\">People</a>. “Since he is 100% blind with glaucoma and the Covid numbers are going up, we just don’t want to take any chances,” Andrew Wyatt said.</p> <p>The 84-year-old is hopeful about the trial and “feels he is in capable hands”, Wyatt added. “He feels he will experience the same vindication he experienced in Pennsylvania. The jurors will pay attention to the facts of this case and they will make their decisions without any prejudice towards him … We do believe he will be vindicated”.</p> <p>Cosby’s representatives did not immediately return a request for comment.</p> <p>The trial is expected to last two weeks.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/may/24/pliskova-and-halep-battle-into-second-round-french-open","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T19:29:57Z","webTitle":"Karolina Pliskova criticises ‘unfair’ WTA Wimbledon ranking points withdrawal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/24/pliskova-and-halep-battle-into-second-round-french-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/may/24/pliskova-and-halep-battle-into-second-round-french-open","fields":{"headline":"Karolina Pliskova criticises ‘unfair’ WTA Wimbledon ranking points withdrawal","trailText":"Karolina Pliskova, who reached last year’s Wimbledon final, has said the WTA’s withdrawal of ranking points is ‘a bad decision’","body":"<p>Karolina Pliskova continued her search for her top form following surgery to her right hand as she recovered from a set down to defeat French wildcard Tessah Andrianjafitrimo 2-6, 6-3, 6-1 and reach the second round of the French Open.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/24/jo-wilfried-tsonga-bids-emotional-farewell-as-career-draws-to-a-close\">Jo-Wilfried Tsonga ends tennis career with emotional French Open farewell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Afterwards, Pliskova expressed her disapproval at the WTA’s decision to withdraw their ranking points from Wimbledon.

She said overall performance was high, however there were incidences where advice was too risk averse or took a computer says no approach to dealing with challenging policy areas.

It was longer and more informative than usual, with a lot of questions on Partygate, but also plenty of exchanges on other topics too.</p> \n  <p>Here are two of the main lines.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>No 10 has played down, but not firmly denied, reports that Boris Johnson floated with Sue Gray the idea of shelving her Partygate investigation.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/may/24/boris-johnson-sue-gray-report-partygate-photos-uk-politics-latest?page=with:block-628c84618f089d657c064fd6#block-628c84618f089d657c064fd6\">9.14am.)</a> Asked if it was true that at, as the Times reports, Johnson suggested the idea when he met Gray several weeks ago, the PM’s spokesperson replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don’t recognise that characterisation. This is a private meeting. This was a meeting about process, rather than the contents of the report. The prime minister wants the report to be published. He is looking forward to the conclusion of the report and it being put in the public domain.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked a second time if the PM made that suggestion, the spokesperson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister did not ask her to drop the report or not proceed with the report. As you know, it’s the prime minister who commissioned the report. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the Times did not say Johnson asked Gray to drop the report. Instead, it says he floated the idea more obliquely. <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-pictured-with-drink-at-lockdown-party-bhvwjn8hh\">It says:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>“[Johnson] asked her, is there much point in doing it now that it’s all out there?” a Whitehall source said. “He was inferring that she didn’t need to publish the report.” Another added: “They were exploring this idea of not having any report. It was being talked about [in Downing Street]. But politically they realised they couldn’t do it.”</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Public sector workers may have to accept “limited” pay restraint to avoid the risk of inflation spiralling, the spokesperson hinted.</strong> Describing what was said at cabinet this morning, the spokesperson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Cabinet held a discussion on public sector pay. The prime minister said the public are understandably anxious about global cost of living pressures, and that the government will continue to support those most in need. The government has already pledged to increase public sector sector spending and is awaiting decisions by public sector review bodies. However, ministers made clear that the risk of triggering higher inflation must be part of considerations when deciding pay awards this year.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When asked if this meant the government would overrule recommendations from the public sector pay review bodies, the spokesperson said that that was not what he was saying. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The point that ministers were emphasising that spiralling inflation will do more to damage people’s take home pay than the limited pay restraint that we’ve seen previously.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if public sector workers would have to accept below-inflation pay increases, the spokesperson replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Obviously, I can’t predict exactly where inflation will go. But with inflation running so high, it does present a significant challenge to things like public sector pay. That said, it would be entirely wrong for me to jump ahead of the process. There is an independent process ongoing, and the first stage of that is for [the pay review bodies] to make recommendations to government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>I will post a full summary shortly.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-24T12:13:23.946Z\">at 1.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-628cbc298f08b48a6e743097\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-24T11:10:21.616Z\">12.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Conservative MP <strong>David Simmonds</strong>, who has been critical of Boris Johnson over Partygate without directly calling for his resignation, told Times Radio this morning that it would be “very difficult” for Johnson to explain why he was not lying when he told MPs that a party did not take place in Downing Street on 13 November 2020 - when he was photographed drinking at a leaving do that night.

From the pictures, it certainly looks like a party. But when Johnson <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/23/what-do-new-partygate-photos-reveal-pm-rules-were-followed-claim-boris-johnson\">was asked, at PMQs a year later</a>, if a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/partygate-photos-boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-lockdown-breaches-sue-gray-report\">party had taken place in No 10 on that date</a>, he said no.</p> \n  <p>Shapps is probably the most accomplished media performer in the cabinet – he is certainly the most capable of sounding reasonable in the face of persistently hostile questioning – but even he was struggling this morning. On certain points he could not really defend Johnson at all. Here are the key lines.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shapps would not deny reports that when Boris Johnson met Sue Gray a few weeks ago to discuss her report into Partygate he suggested she should abandon plans to publish it.</strong> This claim is in a story by Steven Swinford and Oliver Wright <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-pictured-with-drink-at-lockdown-party-bhvwjn8hh\">in the Times </a>who report:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>The Times </em>has been told that Johnson suggested Gray should drop her plans to publish her report during a secret meeting with him earlier this month. Steve Barclay, his chief of staff, was also said to have been present.</p> \n   <p>“He asked her, is there much point in doing it now that it’s all out there?” a Whitehall source said. “He was inferring that she didn’t need to publish the report.” Another added: “They were exploring this idea of not having any report. It was being talked about [in Downing Street]. But politically they realised they couldn’t do it.”</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if this was correct,<strong> Shapps</strong> told Sky News:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I wasn’t in the room so I don’t know that’s the case. Exactly what was discussed, I don’t know.</p> \n   <p>Occasionally things get reported that are not entirely accurate. The civil service were there to make sure that all the correct processes were followed so I have no particular reason for concern about the two of them meeting.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shapps refused to accept that the event where Johnson was photographed was a party. </strong>He told Sky News:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The question is, was [Johnson] down there partying? No, clearly not. He’d gone by to say thanks and raise a glass to a colleague who was leaving.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On BBC Breakfast, when asked to accept it was a party, Shapps said: “It’s certainly a leaving event.” And on the Today programme he explained why he did not think the picture showed Johnson partying:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It looks to me that he was asked to go and thank a member of staff who was leaving, raises the glass to them, and I imagine comes in and out pretty quick, which is presumably why the police have not issued a fixed-penalty notice to the prime minister for a moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Shapps also said the photographs showed Johnson standing by his ministerial red box. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Those are the boxes that ministers carry their work in. It rather suggests that he potentially left his office, came via that office, thanked a member of staff who was leaving [and left soon afterwards].</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shapps could not explain why Johnson told MPs that there was no party in No 10 on 13 November 2020.</strong> Asked why Johnson said that, Shapps replied: “The prime minister will answer for himself. He has said that when the Sue Gray report comes out, he will come to the house and answer fully.”</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shapps said Johnson would be “disappointed” by what happened and that he would now wish he had not attended the event.</strong> Shapps said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I also accept the prime minister has long since apologised, has made fundamental reforms in No 10 and have no doubt if he had his time again he wouldn’t have dropped by to say thank you to a member of staff leaving.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Shapps refused to back calls for the Metropolitan police to explain why Johnson was not fined over this event.</strong> Earlier <strong>Sadiq Khan</strong>, the mayor of London, told the Today programme the Met should explain its decision-making. But, asked if he agreed, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Shapps </strong>said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don’t think the police should fight running commentaries, no.

Rishi Sunak needs to stick or twist on windfall tax | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Treasury officials have been working up plans for a windfall tax that could fall on not just North Sea oil and gas producers but also electricity generators, including windfarm operators, which have also benefited from soaring global prices in recent months.</p> <p>That is likely to be used to fund a direct energy bill rebate as part of a package that could be worth up to £10bn.</p> <p>Alongside targeted help for low-paid workers, Boris Johnson is believed to favour steps that would benefit middle earners, such as a VAT cut or bringing forward the 1 percentage point income tax cut that Sunak has promised for 2024.</p> <p>The pair have competing economic visions, and Tory MPs have become increasingly frustrated that a standoff between them has delayed radical action to help the struggling families they are seeing in their constituency surgeries.</p> <p>Several cabinet ministers, including the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the Brexit opportunities secretary, Jacob Rees Mogg, have made clear their objections to a windfall tax, fearing that it will deter investment.</p> <p>Sunak had repeatedly said he was awaiting more information on what would happen to energy bills in the autumn before setting out how the Treasury would respond, even suggesting it was “silly” to act before that.</p> <p>After Ofgem’s intervention, the Resolution Foundation thinktank warned of the cap increase’s potentially devastating impact. It said a rise to about £2,800 in October could mean 9.6 million families across England falling into fuel stress this winter, defined as spending at least a 10th of their total budgets on energy bills alone.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said Ofgem’s warning was “ extremely concerning”. She said: “[It] will cause huge worry for families already facing soaring bills and rising inflation. How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts?

The missiles can have a range of 1,200 miles, able in theory to strike virtually anywhere in Ukraine.</p> <p>But if anything it is the economic aspect that has come to the fore. “In a conflict of attrition and erosion, the ability to maintain an economic blockade can become significant.

It previously moved <a href=\"https://www.agcs.allianz.com/news-and-insights/expert-risk-articles/shipping-safety-22-ukraine-war.html\">70% of its exports by sea</a>, including 99% of its grain deliveries to countries including Egypt, Ethiopia, Lebanon and Yemen. Although some grain is now moving by land, it will not be enough.</p> <p>Discussions have turned to the idea of creating a protective naval convoy for merchant shipping bound for Ukraine, as proposed by Lithuania this week. But while the UK and others are sympathetic, it would require broad international support, including, Royal Navy sources suggested on Tuesday, from China.</p> <p>It would also require the involvement of Turkey, which closed the straits to all warships – except those returning to their home port – at the end of February, a situation welcomed by Ukraine at the time because it prevented more Russian warships from entering the Black Sea.</p> <p>Opening the straits would allow limited access for Nato warships, for up to 21 days at a time under the 1936 Montreux convention, but also for Russia – meaning any convoy solution may have to be agreed with Moscow. It would also require a de-mining of the Ukrainian coast, somewhat hastily defended when the war broke out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amid such complications, attention remains focused on military solutions.

called as a witness","body":"<p>The judge in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial has rejected an effort by Depp’s lawyers to dismiss Heard’s $100m counter-suit against the actor, a day before the British supermodel Kate Moss is expected to testify followed by a final return of Depp to the stand.</p> <p>Depp’s attorneys, who are rebutting after Heard’s lawyers rested their case on Monday, had argued that Heard failed to prove any “actual malice” had occurred when Depp’s former PR person Adam Waldman told the Daily Mail she had created an “abuse hoax”.</p> <p>But Penney Azcarate, the judge in Fairfax county, Virginia, rebuffed Depp’s motion to reject Heard’s claim outright, saying there was “more than a scintilla of evidence” that Waldman could have been knowingly making statements that were “false, or with a reckless disregard for their truth”.</p> <p>Azcarate said she was not weighing in on the evidence, but merely whether each side had met its threshold for their case to continue.</p> <p>Depp’s attorneys also called a witness to challenge the idea that Depp was physically abusive to Heard: the surgeon David Kulber, who operated on Depp’s injured finger. Asked if Depp could have grabbed someone with a splint on the finger, Kulber said Depp “could attempt to grab someone. But I don’t know how successful he would be.”</p> <p>Outside the central question of domestic abuse, much of the dueling defamation trial – now in its sixth and final week – has focused on accusations that Depp and Heard each lost earnings as a result of the respective accusations against them.</p> <p>Tuesday’s testimony focused on Heard’s claims that she lost $45m to $50m in additional earnings. A day earlier, a witness for the actor said Heard had not seen salary jumps enjoyed by other actors of her generation, such as Zendaya, Gal Gadot and Ana de Armas. Last week, Heard’s agent Jessica Kovacevic testified that she believed a decision to reduce Heard’s part in the Aquaman movie sequel was because of negative press and reputational damage.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Walter Hamada, the president of DC-based film production at Warner Bros, the studio that makes the Aquaman movies, disputed that assertion, testifying that Heard’s contract was not renegotiated because of negative statements made by Depp or his press agents, as Heard alleges, but because of her performance.</p> <p>In an unusually frank exchange for a Hollywood studio executive, Hamada said the studio had concerns over whether Heard was the right fit for the sequels, and that there had been discussions about casting another actor because of Heard’s lack of chemistry with Jason Momoa, who plays Aquaman.</p> <p>“You know it when you see it, and the chemistry just wasn’t there,” Hamada said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"179c841d4d32a8bda13fc01336290e82b8640e9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/179c841d4d32a8bda13fc01336290e82b8640e9a/0_147_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Heard speaks with her attorney Elaine Bredehoft in court.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Heard speaks with her attorney Elaine Bredehoft in court.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Watson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Richard Marks, the veteran Hollywood lawyer and Depp witness whose turn of phrase have been one of the highlights of the trial – “My job is to get to yes,” he said in earlier testimony about his role of a dealmaker – that Heard’s earnings from $1m for Aquaman to $2m for Aquaman 2 were typical to the industry.</p> <p>Marks acknowledged that outside of Aquaman, and an eight-episode series at $200,000 an episode, Heard had not been flooded with film offers or endorsement deals. “The ‘star-is-born’ phenomenon didn’t happen,” he said. “This is a business of personalities. We didn’t see endorsement deals flocking to Ms Heard.”</p> <p>But he rejected Heard’s attorneys’ claim that Depp’s press agent “hoax” claims had been “the stake through the heart of the star-is-born moment”.</p> <p>Heard witness Kathryn Arnold had said that Momoa had the opportunity to renegotiate his salary for the sequel from $3m to $15m, while Heard’s increase was not renegotiated beyond the terms of her option agreement.</p> <p>In another flourish, Marks said Arnold’s comparisons to other actors’ earnings were “not worth the paper they’re not written on”.</p> <p>All eyes will now turn to Wednesday’s video testimony from Moss, who dated Depp from 1994 until 1997 and will reportedly testify that Depp “caught her and tended to her” after she slipped, wearing flip-flops, and fell down some steps while the then couple were in Jamaica.</p> <p>The supermodel was invited to testify after Heard said she hit Depp to protect her sister Whitney Henriquez during a dispute in the couple’s penthouse. Heard testified that Henriquez was standing near a staircase, and immediately thought about rumors that Depp had pushed Moss down a flight of steps.</p> <p>“[Whitney’s] back was to the staircase, and Johnny swings at her,” Heard testified. “I don’t hesitate, I don’t wait – I just, in my head, instantly think of Kate Moss and stairs … And I swung at him.”</p> <p>Depp’s legal team were seen celebrating the mention of Moss, which gave them an opportunity to call her as an impeachment witness.</p> <p>Likely to come up when attorneys question Moss is a story Depp once told about talking to Hunter S Thompson, the journalist and a hero of Depp’s. In a 1998 Rolling Stone article, Depp was quoted as saying: “I was with Kate, and I think he [Thompson] went straight for the romance jugular, shit like whether I beat her enough. I probably told him, ‘Yeah, she gets a severe beating.’”</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/may/24/unions-angered-by-no-10-remarks-about-public-sector-pay-stoking-inflation","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T18:43:30Z","webTitle":"Unions angered by No 10 remarks about public sector pay stoking inflation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/24/unions-angered-by-no-10-remarks-about-public-sector-pay-stoking-inflation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/may/24/unions-angered-by-no-10-remarks-about-public-sector-pay-stoking-inflation","fields":{"headline":"Unions angered by No 10 remarks about public sector pay stoking inflation","trailText":"TUC says suggestion that higher pay for workers this year will push up inflation is ‘nonsense’","body":"<p>Unions have warned of a “hammer blow to morale” across the public sector after Downing Street said ministers would have to take into account the risk of stoking inflation when deciding this year’s pay awards.</p> <p>A readout of Tuesday morning’s cabinet meeting revealed that ministers “held a discussion on public sector pay”, which would affect government officials, nurses, police, teachers and NHS workers struggling during the cost of living crisis.</p> <p>It came as the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) became the first Whitehall department to announce a recruitment freeze, with the threat of more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/12/boris-johnson-plans-to-axe-90000-civil-service-jobs-to-fund-tax-cuts\">90,000 job cuts looming across the public sector</a>.</p> <p>According to Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson, at the cabinet meeting “the prime minister said the public are understandably anxious about global cost of living pressures, and that the government will continue to support those most in need”.</p> <p>The spokesperson added: “The government has already pledged to increase public sector spending and is awaiting decisions by public sector review bodies.

Making sure people can afford to pay their bills and put food on the table is not going to push up inflation. Inflation is being driven by rising energy costs, not pay demands.”</p> <p>He added: “Key workers in the public sector have endured a decade of wage cuts and freezes. At a time when staff shortages are crippling frontline services this would be a hammer blow to workers’ morale.”</p> <p>A cap on public sector pay awards, imposed by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, during the pandemic, was only lifted last October, with effect from April.</p> <p>The main civil service union, the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, on Tuesday backed strike action over the government’s plans to peg pay rises at only 2%. The vote, which took place at the union’s annual conference in Brighton, demonstrates the scale of anger in Whitehall and beyond at the government’s offer.</p> <p>The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said that throughout the pandemic officials had “worked hard providing critical frontline services”. He added: “Unlike the prime minister, we weren’t being distracted by cheese. We kept the country running, providing universal credit to almost 10 million people, furlough to almost 6 million people, keeping our borders open, keeping the roads safe.”</p> <p>The row over pay restraint came as it emerged that Defra had frozen recruitment, initially for several months. An “official sensitive” briefing leaked to the Guardian revealed an effective recruitment freeze for all but essential roles in the department would come into effect on Wednesday.</p> <p>Senior officials who drew up the document admitted redundancies may be used “as a last resort”. They added: “Given what we will need to do over the coming years, we need to recognise that after this three-month period, our approach to recruitment won’t return to how it was.”</p> <p>Only certain roles approved by the department’s director general or chief executive in its arm’s-length bodies will be allowed to be filled.

Defra was contacted for comment.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said they were “incredibly grateful to the civil service for the outstanding job they do in delivering for the public”, but that given the cost of living crisis, “the public rightly expect their government to lead by example and to run as efficiently as possible”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-electricity-generators-oil-gas\">Rishi Sunak reportedly considering windfall tax on electricity generators</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ministers have been asked to model job cuts of up to 40% in their departments as part of a cost-cutting drive being spearheaded by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency.</p> <p>When Johnson’s spokesperson was asked whether public sector workers would have to accept below-inflation pay increases in the coming months, he said: “Obviously, I can’t predict exactly where inflation will go.

We’re committed to helping there in any way we can.</p> <p>“But I really admire in my Ukrainian counterparts that they’re thinking about the short and the long term at the same time – how to shore up infrastructure in the immediate term – the heroic work by the railway workers to restore connections so that goods can be moved from west to east and people from east to west.</p> <p>“But they’re also thinking about very long-term questions and recognising that what they rebuild towards will not simply be a reconstruction of the Soviet-era infrastructure that this generation of Ukrainians has inherited.”</p> <p>Buttigieg was speaking on the sidelines of an event hosted by the German Marshall Fund NGO in Berlin to mark the 75th anniversary of the Marshall plan, a multibillion-dollar recovery programme initiated by the US in 1947 that provided humanitarian and economic assistance to millions of Europeans to ease their recovery after the second world war.</p> <p>The plan was named after George Marshall, the man who was then US secretary of state.</p> <p>Buttigieg, who is in charge of implementing and overseeing a large swathe of projects in the US enabled under the $1tn (£800bn) infrastructure bill that passed six months ago, stressed the relevance to the US as well as Ukraine of Marshall’s insistence about the need to create a “virtuous circle” between the economic security of a nation and its political stability based on its capacity to deliver.</p> <p>He said that decades of disinvestment in the US had turned the virtuous cycle into a vicious one, with political institutions that lacked the resources to deliver well losing their legitimacy, leading to an erosion of trust, “which has given credence to those who would undermine those institutions, further diminishing their capacity to deliver”, he said.</p> <p>The infrastructure fund was intended to break that cycle, he added. “If we can deliver as we’re setting out to do … then citizens will see what it means for them. We’ve got all kinds of things that have scrambled up our political and social life right now, including the information environment, the forms of extremism … and shocks like the pandemic, and economic reverberations from the war in Europe. It’s all the more reason for us to focus on delivering for people.”</p> <p>He said that the stakes included not just comfort and convenience, but “perhaps also the credibility of governance itself”.</p> <p>“In the 1930s, another season when democracy was in doubt, and when it had become fashionable in some circles in Washington to point approvingly to the rise in dictators, some would say by way of praise for fascism that Mussolini makes the trains run on time.</p> <p>“This turns out to not be particularly true, by the way … but how revealing it is that this excuse for autocrats comes on the basis of their supposed prowess in providing transportation.”</p> <p>Regarding Ukraine, Buttigieg said he was interested in President Volodymr Zelenskiy’s calls for reconstruction on a cities and regional level, under a plan apparently gaining traction, by which cities and communities across the world would adopt similar communities in Ukraine to their own ones.</p> <p>“Understanding the needs and different capacities of different parts of the country is going to be very important,” Buttigieg said.</p> <p>Asked if his government’s legitimacy over helping to rebuild a country was to be trusted after its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, Buttigieg, who served in the country as an officer in the US Navy Reserve, said:</p> <p>“Part of what we were up against in Afghanistan is just how fundamentally different the society, the values, the governance culture and the economics of that country are … it’s very different in Ukraine … one of the things that unites us to Ukraine are some of those core values around democracy.</p> <p>“It’s so early to know what will be at the end of this upheaval. What we know is that the kind of united approach we have that reflects shared values among our partners and with Ukrainians is a very powerful one and will be an important basis of the relationship.</p> <p>“Not just in getting us through this war, whatever the endgame looks like, but in a reconstruction that really does hold the promise of leading to new and innovative things.”</p> <p>He praised the leadership he said Germany had shown since the start of the invasion, contrasting with the criticism the government of Olaf Scholz has received.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/the-520-from-kyiv-restored-suburban-rail-offers-hope-as-clean-up-intensifies\">The 5.20 from Kyiv: restored suburban rail offers hope as clean-up intensifies </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I think it’s understood in Washington that the new steps that Germany has taken are major steps in security and energy policy … none of us knows what lies on the other side of this <em>Zeitenwende,” </em>he said, adopting the phrase used by Scholz meaning “turning point”, “but all of us should recognise that the only way for it to lead to a good place is for us to find our way to it together.”</p> <p>Earlier on Thursday, Buttigieg took a tour of Berlin’s Hauptbahnhof or central station, a symbol of German unification, and met a group of Germans and US citizens of Ukrainian origin working as volunteers to receive refugees, about 2,000 of whom are arriving on trains from Ukraine each day. </p> <p>“Just make sure you help us by keeping the narrative alive back home,” one of the volunteers, Natalia, from Minnesota and of Ukrainian descent, told him as Buttigieg thanked the women for their work.</p> <p>Buttigieg, who ran for the US presidency in 2020 but withdrew in favour of supporting Joe Biden, would not be drawn on whether he had plans to run again in 2024.</p> <p>“Right now my ambitions are to be the best secretary of transportation that I can,” he said. “I think there’s never been a better time to have this job.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 23 May 2022.

The world has been increasingly engaged in a struggle between two systems of governance that are diametrically opposed to each other: open society and closed society.”</p> \n<p>The 91-year-old former hedge fund owner said the tide had started to turn against open societies in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US in 2001. “Repressive regimes are now in the ascendant and open societies are under siege. Today China and Russia present the greatest threat to open society.”</p> \n<p>Soros, who led the speculative financial attack that drove the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1992/sep/17/emu.theeuro\">pound out of the European exchange rate mechanism</a> 30 years ago, said Europe had responded well to the crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion.</p> \n<p>“It will take a long time to work out the details, but Europe seems to be moving in the right direction. It has responded to the invasion of Ukraine with greater speed, unity and vigour than ever before in its history.”</p> \n<p>He added: “But Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels remains excessive, due largely to the mercantilist policies pursued by former chancellor Angela Merkel. She had made special deals with Russia for the supply of gas and made China Germany’s largest export market. That made Germany the best performing economy in Europe but now there is a heavy price to pay. Germany’s economy needs to be reoriented. And that will take a long time.”</p> \n<p>Soros said Putin had won Xi’s agreement to the Russian invasion at the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics in early February. But he insisted the Chinese leader was not as strong as he believed.</p> \n<p>“Xi harbours a guilty secret. He never told the Chinese people that they had been inoculated with a vaccine that was designed for the original Wuhan variant and offers very little protection against new variants.”</p> \n<p>Soros said Xi was unable to “come clean” because he was at a delicate moment in his career. “His second term in office expires in the fall of 2022 and he wants to be appointed to an unprecedented third term, eventually making him ruler for life.”</p> \n<p>China’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/24/airbnb-to-close-in-china-amid-repeated-covid-lockdowns\">lockdowns </a>to combat Covid-19 had pushed the economy into freefall but Xi was unable to admit he had made a mistake, he said.</p> \n<p>“Coming on top of the real estate crisis the damage will be so great that it will affect the global economy.

It’s very simple and looks effective, though I haven’t tried it. Wouldn’t want to run the risk of it going wrong.</p> <p>Thinking about the exchange with young Hamlin, Hamlin &amp; McGill staffer Cary, it had a dramatic irony that I hadn’t clocked at first. The tip about the cans, picked up from Chuck (a signifier of McGill Sr’s illness), was not just a piece of trivia delivered in a condescending but well-intentioned manner by a man about to endure a professional humiliation. It was the last act of good will Howard Hamlin would engage in on this Earth. You know those scenes where a character who is about to die gets to show the best of themselves, share their hard-won wisdom? Well this moment of bathos, for Howard, was it.</p> <p>A few hours later, the brains of Albuquerque’s most charismatic lawyer are all over Kim and Jimmy’s floor. Did Lalo really have to do that? Is there any logic in the Mexican’s decision to strap on a silencer and take out a civilian he had only just met? Surely the answer to both questions is no. But that’s what happens when you pal around with impervious psychopaths: they’ll do what they want on an impulse and have no regard for the consequences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d29ab9f71f9bfe1739531d5f3d9fe8f3e6cfc58c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d29ab9f71f9bfe1739531d5f3d9fe8f3e6cfc58c/0_222_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rhea Seehorn as Kim Wexler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A piece missing … Rhea Seehorn as Kim Wexler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Howard had shown up at Kim and Jimmy’s to let them know that he had sussed every detail of their devious Sandpiper masterplan. That the plan had come off without a hitch, leading the long grift of the class action to collapse, made our antiheroes horny and meant disaster for Howard’s career. But he seemed confident he would come out of it. In fact, the animus for revenge would be enough to keep him going. Revenge over Kim, in particular. Of Jimmy and his part in the plot, Howard was unsurprised and dismissive. But of Kim, he said: “One of the smartest and most promising human beings I’ve ever known, and this is the life you choose. You have a piece missing … you’re a sociopath.”</p> <p>It’s at the peak of Howard’s peroration that the missing Salamanca walks in. He has been hiding in the drains watching Lavandería Brillante for the past four nights, but he remains laid-back and unflappable. Howard has a five-second window to read Kim and Jimmy’s body language (they’re clinging to each other) and get out of the room. Typically, he doesn’t spot the signs and chooses to linger. And that, tragically, is that.</p> <h2>The flickering candle</h2> <p>The killing of Howard Hamlin was an awful sequence to watch and not something I’m keen to see again. It was the death of another key character in Better Call Saul, but it had a different tone from Nacho’s demise. There was no sense of it being a just or appropriate end. No sense that it was even coming. It was tragic, and slightly pathetic, but also terrifying. It’s the first moment that the worlds of Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad truly crossover: an episode largely conducted as farce, ends in horror.</p> <p>The scene is played like something from a horror movie, starting with a quiet knock at the door. Our post-coital couple are complacent, and neither betrays the slightest anxiety as to who it could be (they were maintaining a midnight vigil on their door only two episodes ago). The fact that it’s Howard, ready to give them a tongue-lashing is bad enough, as they are forced to double down on acting innocent, and add more lies to the pile. But that wasn’t the twist. The flickering of a candle betrays another arrival, outside the camera shot. Kim and Jimmy freeze and the colour drains from their faces: they have seen a ghost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f219132a038dce0e073458eddf54fd99d5afae3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f219132a038dce0e073458eddf54fd99d5afae3a/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Odenkirk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy has seen a ghost … Bob Odenkirk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After Howard misses his chance to escape, his head bounces off the hardwood floor. What happens next to Kim and Jimmy, we do not know. Lalo says he wants to talk and there may be a part in a further scheme for the couple to play yet (most likely involving Gus Fring). But after all the discussion over whether Kim was breaking bad or about to go to jail for her husband’s sins, something worse has happened.</p> <p>Jimmy has watched people die before and he was traumatised by his experience in the desert. Kim, however, has never come into contact with the reality of the cartel and the life she has been playing at. She met Lalo once and saw him off through the power of argument. This may have led her to adopt a comforting falsehood about the nature of the man she was facing and the world he represented. She has now been disabused of that notion and also has the death of an innocent man on her hands. If the good outcome is that Kim and Jimmy remain together some years later in Nebraska, it will be one that’s haunted by shame. They had better hope those cinnamon twirls taste good.</p> <h2>Albuquerque incidental</h2> <ul> <li><p>Gus and Lalo continue to be one step ahead of each other.

Unfortunately, as the <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/22344/documents/165210/default/\" title=\"\">inquiry by the Commons foreign affairs committee</a> – chaired by the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat – makes clear, they were utterly let down by both ministers and top officials. It describes the British withdrawal as a disaster and a betrayal, and is particularly damning about the evacuations.</p> <p>Politicians and senior officials showed too little interest, were absent at key moments, took inadequate or misguided action and failed to record what they did. MPs found that the “chaotic and arbitrary” Foreign Office response probably cost hundreds of people their chance to leave, and thus is likely to have cost lives. Yet those who are to blame have utterly failed to take responsibility. Indeed, when challenged, the Foreign Office provided answers that “in our judgment, are at best intentionally evasive, and often deliberately misleading”.</p> <p>The chaos in the days before and after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on 15 August 2021 looked appalling enough at the time. The detail provided by Foreign Office whistleblowers and others shows it was worse. The government should have begun planning when the US withdrawal was announced in February 2020, instead of simply hoping the US might change course. What action it did take was late, inadequate and often incompetent. It was hopelessly slow in addressing the cases of Afghans who had worked for it, and failed to design a scheme to help others who had supported UK objectives until Kabul fell. Emails from desperate people went unread. Sensitive documents were left to fall into Taliban hands. Multiple senior officials believe that the prime minister played a role in the disgraceful decision to prioritise the case of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/security-chief-denies-consulting-no-10-over-afghanistan-charity-evacuation\" title=\"\">Nowzad animal charity</a>. While Downing Street has denied that, the report notes that “we have yet to be offered a plausible alternative explanation”.</p> <p>Dominic Raab, then foreign secretary, had a single one-to-one conversation with the British ambassador in Kabul in the two weeks before the city fell, as the Taliban advance accelerated. He – like the prime minister, the minister for Afghanistan, Lord Ahmad, and the Foreign Office’s permanent secretary, Sir Philip Barton – were still on holiday on 15 August. Though Sir Philip, like Mr Raab, has expressed regret for not returning sooner, his failure to come back until 26 August, the day the civilian evacuation ended, is – as the committee notes – impossible to excuse; it is right to call for his resignation. Mr Raab, demoted to justice secretary (with the consolation title of deputy prime minister), has surely proved himself unfit for high office.</p> <p>Beyond holding those who failed accountable, three issues are paramount. First, as the human rights group Global Witness <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amyhsrichards/status/1529032326134521856\" title=\"\">says</a>, the failure continues; people are still waiting for visas and the criteria have been tightened to bar some of those originally told that they had valid claims. Second, those who have made it to the UK must be properly supported to make their home here; thousands of Afghans remain <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/05/12/uk-afghan-women-evacuees-limbo\" title=\"\">in temporary accommodation.</a> Finally, Afghanistan is in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/23/the-guardian-view-on-afghanistans-struggle-it-isnt-just-the-taliban\" title=\"\">desperate straits</a>. Development as well as humanitarian aid is necessary, along with serious consideration of how to get the economy back on to its feet. Britain has failed Afghans appallingly. It must not continue to do so.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/24/the-guardian-view-on-public-order-criminalising-protest-is-bad-for-democracy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T17:49:06Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on public order: criminalising protest is bad for democracy | Editorial ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/the-guardian-view-on-public-order-criminalising-protest-is-bad-for-democracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/the-guardian-view-on-public-order-criminalising-protest-is-bad-for-democracy","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on public order: criminalising protest is bad for democracy","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> Boris Johnson criticises repressive laws in dictatorships but is emulating them at home","body":"<p>This government’s public order bill would not be out of place in the statute books of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/2022-05/Amnesty%20International%20UK%20Briefing%20Public%20Order%20BIll%20Second%20Reading%202022-05-22.pdf?VersionId=Fkz41sLHcqAPqxCNnLwOYKboIeg5TpDs\" title=\"\">Russia</a> or Belarus. Yet the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/21/priti-patel-in-fresh-bid-to-push-through-strict-anti-protest-measures\" title=\"\">bill</a> passed its second reading in parliament this week. Why does Boris Johnson criticise repressive policies in authoritarian regimes – and then emulate their tactics? One would hope he is more tolerant of dissent. Yet last year, a series of protests by Insulate Britain that blocked major roads in London led Mr Johnson’s home secretary, Priti Patel, to respond by trying to make her illiberal policing bill even more illiberal.</p> <p>Peers in the upper chamber thankfully <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/18/government-defeated-as-lords-vote-to-make-misogyny-a-hate\" title=\"\">voted</a> down the amendments. But Ms Patel’s impulse to outlaw demonstrations did not go away. The public order bill repackaged the amendments, which the Labour peer and former Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti said were “<a href=\"https://bylinetimes.com/2021/12/07/terrifying-johnsons-government-following-far-right-playbook-on-crushing-dissent/\" title=\"\">modelled on anti-terror legislation – except they’re for protest</a>”.</p> <p>Lady Chakrabarti has a point. The bill gives the police wide discretion to proscribe innocent behaviour and introduces a thoughtcrime that penalises the possession of material used in a sit-in protest. Members of the public – who may just be in the wrong place at the wrong time – face being convicted of a new offence of “<a href=\"https://netpol.org/2022/05/17/public-order-bill-2022/\" title=\"\">going equipped for locking on</a>”. The offensive equipment could be a tube of superglue or a bicycle lock. The proposed maximum penalty is an unlimited fine.</p> <p>The bill also, sinisterly, proposes control orders for protesters, presumably to shield the public from unwanted opinions. Individuals could be banned from participating in protests if they have twice before caused “serious disruption” (without even being convicted). Last year, parliament’s <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/8078/documents/83028/default/\" title=\"\">joint committee on human rights</a> pointed out that it would be hard to justify pre-emptive action on individuals who may be intending to protest because it would be almost impossible to determine whether a particular restriction is necessary, let alone proportionate.</p> <p>Police will also be able to use <a href=\"https://www.bigissue.com/news/activism/public-order-bill-explained-protest/\" title=\"\">suspicionless stop and search</a> in almost any demonstration, flying in the face of evidence that stop and search is an overused and ineffective tool. This measure threatens to erode the trust between the police and communities that are disproportionately targeted by this tactic.</p> <p>The bill is an unwarranted crackdown on political life. While new forms of protest can present police with challenges, those encountered last year are not particularly novel. In the past police have used<a href=\"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-9525/CBP-9525.pdf\" title=\"\"> existing powers</a> to deal with such demonstrations. Public confidence in the police is also at its <a href=\"https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/public-confidence-police-new-low-service\" title=\"\">lowest</a> in more than a decade. It is a strange time to be handing officers – with few safeguards – excessive discretion and increasing the possibility of misuse of powers.</p> <p>Freedom of expression – and freedom of assembly – lie at the heart of Britain’s democracy. These liberties should be guaranteed, however inconvenient it might seem. The bill seems unlikely to be compliant with <a href=\"https://justice.org.uk/public-order-bill/\" title=\"\">human rights law.</a> It also risks the police becoming increasingly politicised, as protest is cast as a flashpoint rather than a democratic safety valve.</p> <p>Politics has progressed because of disruptive demonstrations. Governments often need to hear what protesters have to say. People thought harder about the environment because of <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/xr-extinction-rebellion-unpopular-climate-change-net-zero-b953212.html\" title=\"\">direct action</a>; racism moved up the political agenda because of <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/black-lives-matter-britain-take-knee-popularity-1118702\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> marches. Criminalising peaceful dissent is a threat to the right to stand up for what an individual believes in. England and Wales do not need this bill. Protests are not something outside the democratic process – they are a vital part of it.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2022/may/24/canelo-alvarez-gennady-golovkin-fight-third-trilogy","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T17:45:36Z","webTitle":"Canelo Álvarez and Gennady Golovkin set for September fight to cap trilogy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/24/canelo-alvarez-gennady-golovkin-fight-third-trilogy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/may/24/canelo-alvarez-gennady-golovkin-fight-third-trilogy","fields":{"headline":"Canelo Álvarez and Gennady Golovkin set for September fight to cap trilogy","trailText":"Canelo Álvarez will meet Gennady Golovkin for a third time on 17 September in one of the biggest fights that can be made in boxing today","body":"<p>Canelo Álvarez will meet Gennady Golovkin for a third time on 17 September in one of the biggest fights that can be made in boxing today.</p> <p>Álvarez, the sport’s biggest star who holds all four major belts at super middleweight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/dmitry-bivol-canelo-alvarez-fight-upset\">suffered his first defeat in nine years</a> earlier this month when he moved up to light heavyweight to challenge for Dmitry Bivol’s title. </p> <p>Rather than exercise his contracted rematch clause, the 31-year-old Mexican star will move back down to 168lbs to defend his undisputed title against Golovkin, the WBA and IBF middleweight champion who will be moving up a division.</p> <p>Many thought Golovkin won their opening bout in September 2017 only for a draw to be declared while Álvarez claimed a narrow points decision 12 months later, with both contests held at 160lbs.</p> <p>“I feel very happy and proud to be able to give the best fights and this fight won’t be an exception,” Álvarez said.</p> <p>The venue for the third fight will be announced “soon” according to promoters Matchroom Boxing although Las Vegas is the early favorite, with the city’s T-Mobile Arena having staged the first two showdowns.</p> <p>“The Canelo v GGG trilogy is the biggest fight in boxing and I am delighted to get this made for September 17,” said promoter Eddie Hearn. “These are two men that bitterly dislike each other and want to end this incredible series with a blistering KO.</p> <p>“I truly believe this will be the most thrilling fight between these two great champions and it will be fireworks from the first bell to the last man standing.”</p> <p>The heavy-handed Golovkin, who at 40 is nine years older than his next opponent, has won all four fights since suffering the only defeat of his professional career against Álvarez.</p> <p>Golovkin, who stopped Japan’s Ryota Murata inside nine rounds last month to become unified world middleweight champion again, said simply: “I hope to see you on September 17.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2022/may/24/bbc-to-announce-further-cuts-to-output-with-redundancies-likely","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T17:34:36Z","webTitle":"BBC to announce further cuts to output with redundancies possible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/24/bbc-to-announce-further-cuts-to-output-with-redundancies-likely","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/may/24/bbc-to-announce-further-cuts-to-output-with-redundancies-likely","fields":{"headline":"BBC to announce further cuts to output with redundancies possible","trailText":"Freezing of licence fee means the broadcaster, which has already lost 1,200 staff, must cut programmes","body":"<p>The BBC is preparing to announce further cuts to its output before the end of the month, with the corporation’s staff waiting to see whether their jobs will be on the line.</p> <p>The public broadcaster has already undergone multiple rounds of redundancies and cuts over the past decade as a result of continuous below-inflation licence fee increases.

Rishi Sunak needs to stick or twist on windfall tax","trailText":"Treasury’s thinking seems to change by the day, but the procrastination is helping no one","body":"<p>Now the windfall tax debate gets interesting. Rishi Sunak and his Treasury officials have noticed what should have been obvious from the off. It’s not just North Sea oil and gas producers, the popular bogeymen, that are making bumper profits in current conditions. Some electricity generators are too.</p> <p>And, possibly awkwardly for a government that says it wants to give renewables a push, windfarms and solar assets are providing unexpectedly lovely returns for some owners.</p> <p>Cue a report in the FT that Sunak is preparing to extend the scope of a windfall tax to include generators. Cue, also, oil-style corporate cries about a threat to future investment, this time accompanied by tumbling share prices.</p> <p>Drax, the biomass group with a residual interest (still) in coal, lost 15%. British Gas owner Centrica, with its one-fifth share in the UK’s current nuclear fleet, was down 7%. SSE, heavy with hydro and windfarm assets, fell 8%.</p> <p>Is the reported proposal really so outrageous? Not really. Sunak’s progress towards a levy has been shambolic, but, if he wants to take the windfall route, one could say it is logical to include generators. The target is supposed to be windfall profits that arise in exceptional market conditions, not just windfalls that come from under the North Sea.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-electricity-generators-oil-gas\">Rishi Sunak reportedly considering windfall tax on electricity generators</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Exhibit A in this context is Drax. Since last autumn, when wholesale prices started to take off, its shares have soared from 420p to 812p (before Tuesday). The stock market can see that booming electricity prices represent splendid news for a company that hasn’t suffered the same rate of inflation in the cost of the wood pellets it ships from the US to burn in Yorkshire.</p> <p>Since Drax enjoys generous subsidies when market conditions are trickier for it, it’s hard to see why it should escape a windfall net. Its shareholders, contemplating a new share price of 700p, might reflect that they’re still up 66% in a year.</p> <p>Another example is nuclear, whose overheads are largely fixed: the value of its output has soared without any extra spending on its part. The same applies to windfarms and solar projects operating under old-style “renewables obligation certificates” (ROCs), which set a floor under the prices the companies receive without capping the upside.</p> <p>There are, though, two critical limits to Sunak’s apparent new approach. Both suggest that the Treasury would be silly to think it can grab £10bn via a more broadly defined windfall tax. The figure looks a stretch too far, never mind the fact that consumers’ average bills <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/energy-bills-likely-to-rise-by-800-in-october-says-ofgem-chief\">will shortly be going to £2,800 a year</a>, so the regulator says.</p> <p>First, Sunak should forget any idea of chasing profits made by windfarm and solar generators operating under “contracts for difference” (CfDs), the more modern financing setup.</p> <p>The game there is very different from ROC arrangements. With CfDs, the Treasury is already collecting windfall-style prizes: it gets paid when the generator sells power at prices above the “strike” price.</p> <p>Second, the Treasury should not make the mistake of thinking that all electricity is sold at “spot” prices. That is not how the energy market works. In practice, much of the output is sold under long-term contracts at lower prices, so the imagined corporate profit bonanza may be smaller in reality.</p> <p>And the forward-looking nature of the contracts means the biggest chunk will only occur next winter. If the Treasury starts trumpeting the £10bn figure as set in stone, it probably will scare investors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the principle of including generators – or, more precisely, nuclear, biomass and those with old-style ROC arrangements – seems reasonable. As long as CfD assets are given a free pass, investment into renewables should keep flowing.</p> <p>Think of a CfD as a form of state-backed guarantee that removes the volatility from an investor’s returns. If the guarantee remains in place – and it will – pension funds, infrastructure funds and others should still show up for their stable multi-year returns.</p> <p>Yes, the firms will scream blue murder and say the financing environment has become unstable, but France and Spain have already tapped their generators so the UK would not be an outlier.</p> <p>The Treasury’s thinking on windfall taxes seems to change by the day, so we are yet to see if Sunak actually goes with his new plan. The politics, one suspects, is largely driven by a perceived need to out-do Labour, but the economic case for including generators is coherent.</p> <p>Just make a decision: the procrastination is almost the worst part for investor sentiment.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/25/all-australians-should-be-offered-free-flu-vaccines-to-prevent-disaster-experts-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T17:30:15Z","webTitle":"All Australians should be offered free flu vaccines to prevent ‘disaster’, experts say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/25/all-australians-should-be-offered-free-flu-vaccines-to-prevent-disaster-experts-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/25/all-australians-should-be-offered-free-flu-vaccines-to-prevent-disaster-experts-say","fields":{"headline":"All Australians should be offered free flu vaccines to prevent ‘disaster’, experts say","trailText":"Influenza cases rise amid ongoing high Covid infections and hospital pressure sparking calls to increase vaccination rates","body":"<p>Medical professionals are ramping up calls for the flu vaccine to be made free nationwide, saying governments needed to think about the coming flu peak as a looming “disaster” as it coincides with ongoing high rates of Covid infection.</p> <p>Queensland has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/queensland-to-issue-free-flu-vaccinations-as-cases-jump-132-in-one-week\">made the jab free</a> amid soaring influenza rates in the state, while the New South Wales government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/nsw-considers-making-flu-vaccine-free-as-ambulance-demand-reaches-unprecedented-levels\">taking steps to follow suit</a> amid unprecedented demand for its ambulance and hospital services.</p> <p>Hospitalisations are doubling every week in Queensland, while NSW, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/calls-for-mask-wearing-as-victoria-flu-cases-exceed-past-two-seasons-combined\">Victoria</a> and central Australia are also experiencing large outbreaks of two circulating influenza strains, H1 and H3, with infections rates particularly high among young people.</p> <p>The deputy director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Prof Ian Barr, said the vaccination should be free to indicate the severity of the early influenza season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/nsw-considers-making-flu-vaccine-free-as-ambulance-demand-reaches-unprecedented-levels\">NSW considers making flu vaccine free as ambulance demand reaches unprecedented levels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just 24% of the adult population and 9% of children under five have <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2022/05/influenza-flu-immunisation-data-influenza-flu-immunisation-data-1-march-2022-to-22-may-2022.pdf\">received a flu vaccine</a>.</p> <p>“The Covid vaccination has set the precedent … it sends a message the government thinks it’s a priority,” Barr said.</p> <p>“We need something to motivate people to get vaccinated this year, we’ve got high rates and it’s no use waiting three or four weeks to get out there.”</p> <p>Barr said flu season had arrived a month or two earlier than normal this year, with a peak expected “well before” August.</p> <p>“There’s a two-year gap when [we] haven’t been exposed, and we know immunity wanes especially if you’re not vaccinated,” he said.</p> <p>“What we don’t normally see is quite so many kids in hospital but a lot of this is due to high numbers.

Later it migrated to a spot underneath the handbrake in Dad’s car, carefully stuck there with Blu-Tack. It stayed there until Dad died, at 84.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eeab0e204f3a05ad931288e8d321d23f3431a17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eeab0e204f3a05ad931288e8d321d23f3431a17/0_435_2877_3597/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kumi Taguchi holds the pet rock she inherited from her Japanese father\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kumi Taguchi holds the pet rock she inherited from her Japanese father</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kumi Taguchi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was in Kyoto when I found out. My sister called me and said that because of the way Dad died, most of his possessions had to be destroyed. The first thing I thought of was the rock. Through tears, I asked her whether it had survived. I still find it strange that in that moment I was a little girl again, yearning for something from my childhood.</p> <h2>My most useful object</h2> <p>Gosh, this is hard. On a purely pragmatic level, my phone is my most useful object. My rice-cooker is useful because I can’t cook rice any other way – but I don’t use it much. So I am going to choose my coffee grinder.</p> <p>It’s similar to a pepper grinder and I bought it during the 2021 lockdown. I felt the need to go analogue as much as I could. I think it was an instinctive thing – knowing I needed to be still, create rituals and feel a sense of connection to tangible things.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7d1acc1fc2b1cca3421130d2003fe53bdcdce33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7d1acc1fc2b1cca3421130d2003fe53bdcdce33/0_391_3826_2296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kumi Taguchi’s coffee grinder\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taguchi’s manual coffee grinder</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kumi Taguchi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Using it is a joy. It is heavy and feels just right in my hands. I love filling it with beans, clicking the gears to adjust the grind setting and winding the lever around. The sound is meditative, the smell and taste wonderful – but it’s the process that is the real gift. I even enjoy cleaning it. I undo all the parts and use a small brush to dust off the spring and washer and conical grinder and gears.</p> <h2>The item I most regret losing</h2> <p>Piglet. He was my first soft toy. I was born three months early and Piglet sat on top of my humidity crib. He was made of navy blue corduroy and had two flowers embroidered in wool on his tummy, one yellow and one red. He had red silk inside his ears.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s weekend culture and lifestyle email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/saved-for-later\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Saved for Later\" data-form-description=\"Weekly lifestyle and culture picks from Guardian Australia\" data-form-campaign-code=\"UK_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Get a week’s worth of must-reads, trends and pop-culture in your inbox\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s weekend culture and lifestyle email</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He came with me through multiple house moves in my 20s and 30s.

My other (favourite) toy made it but Piglet didn’t.

Everyone began to throw in suggestions, the conversation growing speedier and more enthusiastic. Drawing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_S\">“Cool S”</a>. The Spice Girls. Asking yes/no erasers to answer questions. “Oh, and what about when everyone got really into collecting millipedes!” The conversation paused as everyone looked at me. Turns out that experience wasn’t universal.</p> <p>I get a similar reaction every time I bring up The Quick and the Dead, a 1995 film directed by Sam Raimi. I watched it as a kid and figured everyone else had too. But whenever I’ve brought it up over the years, I’m usually met with a blank stare.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FbuXkp18H8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8FbuXkp18H8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I’m not quite sure why The Quick and the Dead flew so under the radar – it had a strong cast, a solid premise and it is a lot of fun to watch. Sometimes a film just arrives at the wrong moment – like The Shawshank Redemption, swept under the table by Forrest Gump; or horror comedy Jennifer’s Body, widely under-appreciated until years after its release.</p> <p>The Quick and the Dead stars Sharon Stone as the Lady, a woman who arrives in an outlaw town in the late 1800s, to take part in a gunslinger contest. Despite what she says, she isn’t there for the prize money – the Lady has unfinished business, the nature of which is slowly revealed over the film. The plot centres on the series of duels that make up the contest, and the gunfighters who are entering: a sinister outlaw who runs the town (Gene Hackman), a preacher who refuses to shoot (Russell Crowe) and a cocky local kid just trying to prove himself to his father (Leonardo DiCaprio).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/18/looking-the-queer-dramedy-that-was-a-decade-ahead-of-its-time\">Looking: the queer dramedy that was a decade ahead of its time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Quick and the Dead is not a traditional western, nor is it a satire; if anything, it is a little bit camp and schlocky, with the slightest hint of superhero movie in there. (Raimi went on to direct the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films, and Marvel’s most recent film, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.)</p> <p>I have fond memories of this film, so at first I was hesitant to rewatch it, in case it held up poorly. With one or two exceptions, it’s still great. If anything, it’s a little more fun now with the benefit of hindsight. The Crowe and DiCaprio you see on screen have yet to hit it big at this point. Stone’s performance is also a very specific kind of pleasure, the no-nonsense Lady who suffers no fools and refuses to smile.

Retailers in their consultations with the AER had complained that the delayed offer date cut almost in half the time they had to inform customers of the offer before it comes into effect on 1 July.</p> <p>Victoria, which sets its own default offer, released its <a href=\"https://www.esc.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Victorian%20Default%20Offer%202022-23%20-%20Final%20decision_0.pdf\">reset for 2022-23</a> on Tuesday, lifting the price by 5%. That increase will affect 200,000 households and 50,000 small businesses – amounting to about 7% of households and 16% of small businesses – that are on standing offers.</p> <p>McConnell said the Victorian increase would likely be exceeded in other states because the main fuel of its power plants, brown coal, had not risen in price as much as black coal used in Queensland and New South Wales. Even so, most plants had long-term prices locked in and so would not be faced with sharply higher costs to pass on to customers.</p> <p>Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, said there was “no doubt” the delayed offer was driven by the timing of the election.</p> <p>“Prices have now been at extraordinary levels – hovering just below $300/megawatt-hour for longer than ever in the national electricity market’s history,” Mountain said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/how-albaneses-practical-pivot-on-climate-paved-the-way-for-a-greens-surge\">How Albanese’s practical pivot on climate paved the way for a Greens surge | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This is becoming a train smash for small retailers, several of whom are refusing to take on new customers and are trying to encourage some of their existing customers to leave. I think this is likely to be disastrous for retail competition.”</p> <p>Mountain said the increase in the DMO could be as much as 15% or higher – with the prospect of a reset in another six months if not sooner.</p> <p>Other nations are facing similar if not bigger pricing pressures after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions sent energy prices rocketing. Britain’s regulator lifted the price cap by 54% in April, with another 40% increase expected next month, Mountain said.</p> <p>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, electricity makes up just over 2.5% of the basket of goods used to determine consumer price inflation.

Words are powerful, and by uttering them, our nation’s new leader signalled a new way for our policy and politics aimed at uniting and strengthening our communities and economy.</p> <p>But what sits behind the words of politicians is often more important, so let’s get into what it means for Australia to become a renewable superpower and how that will cast the climate wars into the history books where they belong.</p> <p>Australia has some of the best renewable resources in the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/the-election-revealed-a-shift-in-climate-sentiment-but-what-will-it-mean-for-policy\">This election marked a turning point on climate – but what will it mean for Australia?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But how do we leverage this enormous comparative energy advantage to make Australia a renewable superpower, accelerating climate action in the process?</p> <p>Essentially, becoming a renewable superpower has four elements that we need to pursue concurrently.</p> <p>First, we need to change our electricity system by replacing our coal power stations with the renewables and storage projects, with support for workers and communities.</p> <p>Second, we must grow the size of our electricity system to electrify everything: replacing petroleum vehicles with electric ones; and replacing gas stoves and hot water heaters in our homes with efficient electrical alternatives (induction stoves and heat pumps).</p> <p>Thirdly, getting on with the job of building off-grid and on-grid renewable energy zones to grow our manufacturing sector, reduce our reliance on imports and create a renewable export industry.</p> <p>Finally, we should ensure we maximise the benefits of doing this for all Australians by growing clean energy supply chains, so that First Nations communities are at the forefront of these industries on their land and also so that low-income households are able to participate in the renewables revolution.</p> <p>Going big on renewables will accelerate not just climate action in Australia but around the world.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/19/australia-is-third-largest-exporter-of-fossil-fuels-behind-russia-and-saudi-arabia\">Australia is the world’s third-largest exporter of fossil fuels </a>after Russia and Saudi Arabia. These exports generate more than double our domestic carbon pollution. Investing in clean manufacturing and renewable exports, and replacing our fossil fuel exports would, according to the Australian National University, help <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544222004662\">“reduce 8.6% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the Asia-Pacific and about 4% of global emissions”</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The jobs in these clean manufacturing and renewable export opportunities are almost double the number of direct and indirect jobs in fossil fuels</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So how does this help end the climate wars? </p> <p>The core narrative behind the climate wars prosecuted by vested interests and the hard right was to create a false choice between climate action and economic prosperity.</p> <p>Tony Abbott’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/17/tony-abbott-played-us-for-a-fool-on-electricity-prices-will-we-be-played-agaib\">“axe the tax” scare campaign </a>that helped him win the 2013 election is a classic example. Abbott blamed rising electricity prices mostly due to higher network (poles and wires) costs on the government’s carbon price, as an example of how acting on climate hits everyday Australians’ hip pockets.</p> <p>However, the idea of Australia becoming a renewable superpower fundamentally flips this false narrative on its head, because acting on climate means creating huge economic prosperity. And unlike the scare campaigns, the economic opportunities of Australia becoming a renewable superpower are facts, not divisive political fiction.</p> <p>Increasing competition in the electricity sector by introducing <a href=\"https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/12/17/csiro-report-reveals-renewables-remain-cheapest-new-build-power/\">low-cost renewables and storage</a> lowers wholesale electricity prices for everyone.</p> <p>Moving to electric homes and electric vehicles could, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/20/australias-election-debate-on-energy-ignores-the-miracle-of-rooftop-solar\">Rewiring Australia</a>, save Australian households $5,000 per year.

Making commodities such as fertiliser would reduce our reliance on ammonia imports and fossil gas, while green aluminium and green steel would value add to our world-leading iron ore and bauxite export industries.</p> <p>In addition, there are projects in development to make components for clean energy technologies. Australia can do everything, from produce and recycle the minerals essential to clean energy technologies such as lithium, copper and nickel, to manufacturing wind turbine blades, inverters, batteries and even electric buses.</p> <p>However, the clean energy superpower job opportunities are not just in the traditional mining and manufacturing industries. There are also jobs in the legal, financial, computer science, education, training and engineering professions deploying and managing renewable energy systems, household electrification, electric vehicles and more.</p> <p>For example, Australia leads the world in the uptake of rooftop solar. As a result we have built significant software capability in the operation of and access to distributed energy. Australian businesses such as Allume are now providing these solutions to energy consumers in Australia and around the world.</p> <p>Over the weekend Australians from the country, the suburbs and the city <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/when-australians-woke-up-to-scott-morrison-they-didnt-just-move-the-goalposts-they-dragged-them-off-the-paddock\">overwhelmingly voted for climate action</a>. Even in electorates in central Queensland there was a swing to the ALP. This isn’t surprising given <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blueprintinsti1/status/1450220197453959173\">polling by centre-right thinktank Blueprint</a> last year found that 80% of residents of Flynn back government investment in new industries such as renewable hydrogen. This suggests Labor’s strategy of focusing on clean energy and manufacturing opportunities stemmed the tide of defection from the last election in these seats and was sufficiently compelling in urban Australia to help pick up seats like Reid and Swan.</p> <p>The challenge now for the ALP is to work with the parliament, state and territory governments, businesses, unions and the community to turn the breadth of these opportunities into reality and without delay.</p> <p>It is only by Australia becoming a renewable superpower in practice, creating good jobs and lowering energy bills, that many in traditional fossil fuel heartlands and ongoing climate doubters will finally have their scepticism put to rest, ensuring the climate wars are a thing of the past and the future is stronger for all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nicky Ison is a clean energy commentator and strategist.

wars, moderate Andrew Bragg says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With former home affairs minister Karen Andrews withdrawing from the race on Tuesday, the deputy leadership is likely to be contested by Sussan Ley, favoured by conservatives, and moderates Jane Hume and Anne Ruston.</p> <p>In a policy <a href=\"https://www.andrewbragg.com/post/policy-2022\">manifesto</a> released on Wednesday, Bragg echoes Malcolm Turnbull’s calls for climate policy to “move beyond ideology”, including by adopting more ambitious “emissions reduction signals at 2030 and 2040”.</p> <p>Other climate ideas include “a transmission fund through the CEFC [Clean Energy Finance Corporation] to connect the new grid”, akin to Labor’s $20bn rewiring the nation plan, and to “cut taxes and consider new emissions standards for Australian cars to promote electric vehicles”, a policy championed by teal independents.</p> <p>Bragg labels super a “significant failure” that “doesn’t get many people off the pension, costs the budget more than it saves and reduces agency and individual choices”.</p> <p>Bragg wants a pause to super increases, which are legislated to lift from 10% to 12%, allow people to access super for housing “without heavy restrictions” and set up “a permanent system” to opt out of compulsory super in favour of higher wages “during certain periods”.</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://www.andrewbragg.com/post/first-speech-to-the-australian-senate\">his first speech to the Senate</a> arguing for super contributions to be voluntary for low-income earners, Bragg has been an outlier in favour of economic liberalism and a major overhaul of retirement savings.</p> <p>A moderate in a now increasingly conservative party, Bragg has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/liberal-senator-says-coalition-mps-shifting-to-support-indigenous-voice-to-parliament\">advocated for the Indigenous voice to parliament</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/coalition-religious-discrimination-bill-passes-after-marathon-all-night-sitting\">supported amendments to protect LGBTQ students</a> during the religious discrimination bill debate – two calls he reiterates in the manifesto.</p> <p>Although a push to freeze super increases was rejected in the last parliament, the Morrison government did propose allowing first homebuyers access up to $50,000 of their super, in line with calls from Bragg and other MPs including Tim Wilson, defeated in Goldstein.</p> <p>Bragg’s call to “open super for housing by expanding our 2022 election policy” will likely find favour with re-elected colleagues.</p> <p>Liberal MP Luke Howarth said “we didn’t lose because our policies were wrong, we lost because people wanted to change the prime minister”.</p> <p>“Look at Labor’s corflutes, they were all about Scott Morrison,” he told Guardian Australia. “If our policies were a little different we wouldn’t have got a single extra vote.”</p> <p>Howarth said super for housing “is not a bad idea” and “the only reason Labor opposed it is because of their links to industry super”.</p> <p>But the rest of Bragg’s manifesto is likely to prove controversial – inside his party and out.</p> <p>Bragg wants to deregulate “rigid” labour laws, including establishing “a simple small business award with strong, clear conditions”, and “promote self-employment through contracting” but allow Australians to create accounts held by the Future Fund to save “for the rainy day”.</p> <aside

West Australian MPs want a larger presence in the engine room of the new Albanese government. The Labor contingent from the west always wants that – but electoral success in 2022 gives that perennial aspiration just cause.</p> \n<p>The story of how Labor triumphed in the west is a fascinating story-within-a-story of the 2022 campaign. It began after Labor’s election rout in 2019. After that defeat, most of the national focus went to Labor’s poor performance in Queensland, but things were also bad in the west.</p> \n<p>Albanese and key strategists agreed in-principle that a national campaign put together on the east coast did not resonate with voters in the west of the country. By 2020, WA Labor had a new state secretary – Tim Picton. Picton had worked in Canberra and for Jay Weatherill and Daniel Andrews before running Mark McGowan’s campaign in March 2021 – the state election that decimated the Liberals in WA.</p> \n<p>A couple of months later, during a window where the state border opened in June, Picton travelled to Canberra. Without drawing attention to themselves and their objectives, the WA state secretary and Labor’s national secretary and federal campaign director, Paul Erickson, gave a detailed presentation to Labor’s Western Australian MPs about running a campaign-within-a-campaign in 2022.</p> \n<p>The messages for Western Australia, crafted using WA-specific joint research, would be complementary to the messages being promulgated in the national campaign. But Picton would develop localised language, and run his own digital campaign. Erickson appointed a <a href=\"https://www.mossgroup.com.au/\">separate advertising agency</a> for the WA campaign – the Moss Group. Campaign Edge did the national advertisements.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f22ed95dee85ea382bdfb2524615c621b053e8c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f22ed95dee85ea382bdfb2524615c621b053e8c/308_0_856_1006/851.jpg\" alt=\"WA Labor ad\" width=\"851\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labor ran state-specific campaign ads in Western Australia – and the strategy worked.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Labor party</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The WA ads had a very different look to the national campaign. They featured the state candidates walking together with Albanese across the bridge to the Optus stadium in Perth – which is where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/01/anthony-albanese-pledges-to-lower-cost-of-pbs-medicines-and-boost-evs-at-labor-campaign-launch\">Labor leader held his official campaign launch</a>. Labor staged its official campaign in Perth for the first time since 1940 as part of Albanese’s objective of bagging three Liberal-held seats in the west. McGowan also featured prominently in the advertising, and, of course, at the campaign launch.</p> \n<p>Back in mid-2021, Picton told colleagues in Canberra the right campaign – local, parochial, targeted – would “radicalise” voters in the west who were furious with Scott Morrison’s constant politicisation of the pandemic. During the Canberra presentation, Picton said McGowan and the state government would work as “agitators in chief” – championing WA causes in coordination with the central campaign.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up forGuardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Picton and Erickson felt with the right pitch, the 2022 campaign could displace conventional wisdom about Australian voters in more conservative-leaning states hedging their bets in the federation, wanting a Labor government at the state level and the Liberals in Canberra or vice versa.

But that messaging was particularly salient in WA given pent-up anger about the east coast disdain for McGowan’s pandemic management in the west.</p> \n<p>Labor strategists were surprised when the Liberals didn’t respond in kind during the campaign with a bespoke strategy countering Labor’s pitch. Labor only logged one WA-specific advertisement centring on a contention that Labor would bring back a mining tax – but it came late in the contest and fell flat.</p> \n<p>Labor had hoped to pick up three seats in WA on Saturday night but in the end the haul was four – Swan, Pearce, Hasluck and Tangney. The Erickson-Picton strategy had paid dividends.</p> \n<p>The experiment has also created a new model for political campaigns in the future. What remains to be seen is whether or not MPs in the west can persuade Albanese it is time to shift the centre of gravity in the new Labor ministry westwards.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/may/25/exhaustion-and-burnout-states-look-to-boost-volunteer-numbers-as-demand-increases","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T17:30:12Z","webTitle":"‘Exhaustion and burnout’: states look to boost volunteer numbers as demand increases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/25/exhaustion-and-burnout-states-look-to-boost-volunteer-numbers-as-demand-increases","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/may/25/exhaustion-and-burnout-states-look-to-boost-volunteer-numbers-as-demand-increases","fields":{"headline":"‘Exhaustion and burnout’: states look to boost volunteer numbers as demand increases","trailText":"Volunteers say the work gives them a sense of purpose but organisations face an ongoing struggle to maintain participation rates","body":"<p>In moments between sorting bulk bags of couscous and buckwheat for food hampers, a friendship formed between two neighbours.</p> <p>Retirees Leah Bergman and Hazel Kuperholz have lived next door to each other in Melbourne’s inner east for five years, but credit volunteering for the community organisation C Care, which provides cooked meals, for their friendship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/victorian-mp-booted-from-parliamentary-liberal-party-after-praying-for-abortion-to-be-banned\">Victorian MP booted from Liberal party team after anti-abortion social media posts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And, unlike many others at the organisation, the pair are continuing their volunteer work well after lockdowns have ended.</p> <p>“It’s given me a purpose and the best thing is I met my nextdoor neighbours,” Bergman says.</p> <p>Hazels agrees that their friendship has been a “lovely” outcome of her volunteering experience.</p> <p>“We laugh, and we have fun, and we’re all doing a good thing,” she says.</p> <p>They were drawn to volunteering during Melbourne’s early Covid restrictions, as it was a permitted activity that allowed them to escape lockdowns.</p> <p>C Care was overwhelmed with a surge in new volunteers during the pandemic, but Lisa Ball, the organisation’s manager, says the service has experienced a 30% reduction in regular volunteers since Covid restrictions eased last year.</p> <p>“The need for our service is growing exponentially so when we can’t match that on the volunteer side it makes it very challenging to be able to ensure that everyone who needs our support can receive it,” she says.</p> <p>“For the volunteers who do show up, we are concerned we are placing a burden on them which can lead to exhaustion and burnout.”</p> <p>Volunteering is now embedded in the weekly routines of Bergman and Kuperholz.

Hegel. Wittgenstein. And now Grant Shapps. The latest addition to the western philosopher kings. Amazingly, we now have to accept that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/28/grand-delusions-tory-chairman-grant-shapps-john-crace-sketch\">Michael Green, Sebastian Fox</a>, or whatever the transport secretary is calling himself these days, is what passes for an intellectual giant in this government. The go-to man whenever the prime minister is in trouble. The Ponzi scheme genius who can spin gossamer lies into a greater truth. Or perhaps not.</p> <p>Nothing much rattles Shapps. There again, he has humiliated himself so frequently in his career that taking on Boris Johnson’s own humiliation is of little concern to him. Rather it’s a badge of honour. There is no indefensible position he won’t defend. When the Convict needs a fall guy who is a step up from the catatonic Nadine Dorries, the Shappster is proud to make himself available. A martyr to the cause.</p> <p>So it was Call Me Grant who was sent out to tour the studios on the morning media round to answer questions about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/partygate-photos-boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-lockdown-breaches-sue-gray-report?ref=upstract.com&amp;curator=upstract.com\">the photos</a> that seemed to prove Johnson had lied to parliament and the country. It was here that we began to see the full weight of Shapps’s philosophical talents. Because it turned out that a party was not always a party. The finest mind of this generation of halfwits kindly went on to explain why.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/23/boris-johnson-conversation-with-sue-gray-meeting-that-never-happened\">Boris Johnson’s conversation with Sue Gray in a meeting that never happened | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was like this. The Convict was just dead unlucky. Every time he happened to walk into another room, he would find people drinking and playing loud music. And he could never resist pulling a bottle of prosecco out of his red box and making a speech. Out of politeness more than anything else. There again, a briefcase could have magical properties. It could turn any party into a work seminar. God knows the number of Covid planning meetings Johnson had attended when he’d been under his desk, throwing up into a waste bin.</p> <p>So there was no party and there never had been a party. People were just looking at photos of the Convict and his legless hangers on, surrounded by empty bottles piled high, and jumping to conclusions. And Shapps could see why people even stupider than himself might do this. He didn’t blame them. There were times when he had felt angry about the photos. Though clearly not now, as Grant had a huge smirk across his face. He thinks the parties are as big a joke as his boss does.</p> <p>There were a few problems with all this. The parties clearly were parties as the police had already fined other people who had attended them. Ah, those parties, said the Shappster. Those weren’t parties. They were far, far worse than that. Bingeathons. Orgies. Everyone knew that no one in No 10 did a stroke of work after 4pm. Which had made the nightly Covid press conferences something of a lottery. And there was a shortage of chairs when people were crowded into a room but everyone had just socially distanced sitting on one another.</p> <p>Shapps pressed on with his philosophical masterclass. The Convict couldn’t have attended any parties, other than the one he had been fined for, because he hadn’t been issued with any other fixed penalties. The police had spent hours looking at photos and hadn’t spotted him in any of them. Grant corrected himself. Actually, the police hadn’t looked at any of the photos, which meant that Boris couldn’t possibly have been in them. After all, if a tree falls, does it make a noise if there’s no one there to hear it?</p> <p>“The prime minister is mortified,” Shapps said. Not true. The Convict might have been a bit pissed off that he had been caught out telling porkies yet again, but he certainly wasn’t mortified. That would have taken something like a conscience. A sense of shame. The closest a narcissistic sociopath can get is a feeling of self-pity. The solipsist’s apology for compassion.</p> <p>Sad face. Boris had just been a little confused about what party he attended – nearly all of them – because he was reeling from the death of his mum. The Chronicle of a Death Foretold. Johnson’s mother had actually died about 10 months later. But the Convict liked to get his grieving done in advance. Or something.</p> <p>By now, the Shappster was running on fumes. None of his interviewers could keep up with his brilliance. If he wasn’t so obviously a Nobel prize-winning intellect, some might mistake him for someone who liked to play in traffic. He hadn’t lied, he lied. He liked to be upfront. He had no idea why Simon Clarke might have told broadcasters Sue Gray had instigated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/23/boris-johnson-conversation-with-sue-gray-meeting-that-never-happened\">the meeting</a> when she clearly hadn’t. Must have been a slip of the tongue.</p> <p>And he was sure the Convict hadn’t been putting pressure on Gray to shelve her report. Because that just wasn’t in his nature. He was such an honest and straightforward guy. If he had spoken to Gray it was to make sure she was OK and to see if he could help reduce her workload.</p> <p>Still, Grant had done his job of being the government’s necessary idiot for the day. Which took some of the pressure off Kwasi Kwarteng who had been monstered by Labour’s Darren Jones at the business select committee. Jones merely enquired what measures the government had in mind for dealing with an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/energy-bills-likely-to-rise-by-800-in-october-says-ofgem-chief\">energy price cap of £2,800</a> if he wasn’t going to bring in a windfall tax, increase borrowing or raise taxes.</p> <p>Kwarteng mumbled something about growing the economy. Truly, we are blessed with a government of all the talentless in this time of crisis. Jones had to point out that the Bank of England forecast we were heading for recession and in any case people were unlikely to perceive any growth benefits before October. So the real policy was to do nothing. The Convict’s answer to fuel poverty is to wait for hell to freeze over.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/24/macron-accused-betraying-pledge-stamp-out-violence-against-women-girls-france","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T17:09:13Z","webTitle":"Macron accused of betraying pledge to stamp out violence against women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/macron-accused-betraying-pledge-stamp-out-violence-against-women-girls-france","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/24/macron-accused-betraying-pledge-stamp-out-violence-against-women-girls-france","fields":{"headline":"Macron accused of betraying pledge to stamp out violence against women","trailText":"Campaigners protest against ‘government of shame’ after minister accused of rape by two women is kept in place","body":"<p>Equality campaigners have accused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron\">Emmanuel Macron</a> of betraying his promise to stamp out violence against women and girls after the French government kept in place a new minister accused of rape by two women.</p> <p>Feminist groups led by the Observatory of Sexist and Sexual Violence in Politics organised a street demonstration in Paris on Tuesday against what they called a “government of shame”, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/french-minister-refuses-to-stand-down-over-allegations\">Damien Abad</a>, the minister for solidarity and people with disabilities, remained in his job despite the rape allegations.</p> <p>Abad has denied the accusations, including one from a woman who said that in 2010 she blacked out after accepting a glass of champagne from him and woke up in her underwear in a hotel room with him.

She said Abad would stay in government and it was up to the justice system to establish the truth.</p> <p>But campaigners warned the majority of rape and sexual assault cases in France were dropped by prosecutors. One of the women who accused Abad had her case dropped by prosecutors, which she contested. The other had not filed an official complaint, but prosecutors are looking into the case.</p> <p>The row over Abad, a rightwing politician who recently joined Macron’s centrist movement, has overshadowed the first days of the new government, which is led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/elisabeth-borne-becomes-frances-first-female-prime-minister-in-30-years\">Élisabeth Borne</a>, France’s first female prime minister in more than 30 years.</p> <p>Madeline da Silva, co-founder of the Observatory on Sexist and Sexual Violence In Politics, which informed senior figures in Macron’s party about the allegations against Abad before his appointment, said he should not be in government.</p> <p>“For the simple reason of setting an example, and sending a message to women who are victims of sexual violence, Mr Abad should not have been made a minister,” she said. “Don’t tell us that no one knew … We reported this in writing to senior political figures who, by chance, now say they didn’t see the emails. There is an obligation in French labour law to protect people at work … By keeping Mr Abad, the government is not fulfilling its responsibility to protect the people who work with him.”</p> <p>Da Silva said Borne had had her work overshadowed because her first cabinet meeting “featured someone sat at the table who was accused of sex crimes. Is that really the way to support women in politics?”</p> <p>Da Silva cited the case of François de Rugy who quit as French environment minister during Macron’s first term, after allegations he hosted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/francois-de-rugy-french-minister-under-fire-over-alleged-taxpayer-funded-lavish-dinners\">lavish, taxpayer-funded lobster</a> dinners as parliament speaker. She said De Rugy had not been under police investigation when he quit. She said the message was “lobsters are more serious than rape”.</p> <p>Borne has said she did not know about the accusations against Abad until the investigative website <a href=\"https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/210522/violences-sexuelles-damien-abad-nomme-ministre-malgre-un-signalement-adresse-lrem\">Mediapart</a> ran an article about them at the weekend. “Who can imagine for a single instant that the president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, did not know?” said Xavier Bertrand, the head of the Hauts-de-France region.</p> <p>Earlier this month, there was outrage when Macron’s centrist party initially stood by a parliamentary candidate in Dordogne who had been convicted of domestic violence. Jérôme Peyrat was found guilty of violence against his former partner in September 2020.</p> <p>But La République En Marche’s leader, Stanislas Guerini, told France Info radio that despite the conviction, Peyrat “is an honest man, I don’t think he is capable of violence against women”. Guerini later apologised and Peyrat stood down as a candidate. Guerini was appointed to government as a minister a few days later.</p> <p>In 2020, Macron’s decision to appoint Gérald Darmanin as interior minister – despite accusations of rape, sexual harassment and abuse of power – drew heavy criticism and prompted demonstrations. Darmanin this month kept his job in cabinet after Macron’s re-election. He has denied wrongdoing and prosecutors in January asked for the case to be dropped.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/may/24/french-open-tennis-2022-roland-garros-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T17:04:35Z","webTitle":"French Open 2022: Tsonga retires after Ruud defeat, Medvedev through – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/may/24/french-open-tennis-2022-roland-garros-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/may/24/french-open-tennis-2022-roland-garros-updates","fields":{"headline":"French Open 2022: Tsonga retires after Ruud defeat, Medvedev through – as it happened","trailText":"Jo-Wilfried Tsonga ended his career in a dramatic defeat to Casper Ruud, while there were also wins for Medvedev and Pliskova on day three","body":"<div id=\"block-628d3c0d8f084f9a73ca5749\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-24T20:12:07.167Z\">9.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Day three reports</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\"> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/24/pliskova-and-halep-battle-into-second-round-french-open\">Pliskova and Halep battle through into second round of French Open</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/24/jo-wilfried-tsonga-bids-emotional-farewell-as-career-draws-to-a-close\">Jo-Wilfried Tsonga ends tennis career with emotional French Open farewell</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-628d0f468f08b48a6e7434f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-24T17:04:35.807Z\">6.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>With apologies to Simona Halep</strong>, who was meant to be on court today around midday (BST) but still hasn’t appeared for her first-round match against Nastasja Schunk, I’m going to get off now.

But for me the dynamism of their work has fallen off in recent years, and there are sometimes issues with basic plot naivety and plausibility, for all the obvious research that has gone into their screenplays. In this film, for example – and not for the first time – the Dardennes include a bizarrely perfunctory “cosh” scene in which someone has to be rendered briefly unconscious, and this is achieved by hitting them once or twice over the head with something heavy, a trope that I thought had gone out with 70s kids’ TV. The ending itself is a bit naïve in its execution, though not in what it implies about the ruthlessness of people who exploit vulnerable immigrants.</p> <p>Having said all this, I still responded to the heartbeat of idealism, urgency and force of this movie: a plain parable of inequality and injustice among the marginalised and dispossessed in the heart of western Europe. Given that so much cinema seems to be the creation of irony and indifference, the Dardennes are film-makers who believe that cinema should mean something and intervene in the real world. I was struck by the similarity of the Dardennes with the work of screenwriter Paul Laverty for Ken Loach, although I think without the Laverty/Loach streak of humour.</p> <p>In modern-day Belgium, a young woman called Lokita (Mbundu Joely) and a boy called Tori (Pablo Schils), both from Benin, have endured a terrible journey to the promised land of the EU and are now in a children’s home for immigrants. To get their residence papers, they have to claim to be brother and sister; no great strain, because these young people are now as passionately close as any siblings. But bureaucracy and official suspicion wreck their dreams. Desperate for cash and still owing money to people traffickers, Tori gets a job selling drugs under cover of delivering pizzas and Lokita agrees to be taken blindfold by criminals to a secret cannabis farm, a truly terrifying place in the middle of nowhere. She is there locked in for three months tending the plants under the unbearably hot lights, with her phone taken away, on the promise of payment when the time is up.</p> <p>Tori and Lokita are thus installed in various stages of the production and distribution chain for a particular commodity: an illegal one, as it happens, and they too are illegals. It is this general illegality which creates the market forces keeping Tori and Lokita obedient and scared workers, creating something that respectable and prosperous people want to buy as cheaply as possible. Tori’s passionate love for Lokita brings them back together — but triggers a disastrous chain of events.</p> <p>There is some ungainliness in the dramatic language here and I have to admit to a restiveness about the Dardennes’ quasi-automatic selection to the Cannes competition. Are they becoming one of the silverback gorillas of Cannes, the established prizewinners who are allowed into competition on the basis of great work in the past, not good work in the present? Maybe. At all events, there is a simplicity and clarity of purpose here that I responded to and the Dardennes have got excellent performances from their young leads.</p> <p>• Tori and Lokita screened at the Cannes film festival.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/may/24/erdogan-says-he-will-cut-all-ties-with-greece-dashing-hopes-of-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T16:53:23Z","webTitle":"Erdoğan says he is cutting all ties with Greek PM, dashing hopes of talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/erdogan-says-he-will-cut-all-ties-with-greece-dashing-hopes-of-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/24/erdogan-says-he-will-cut-all-ties-with-greece-dashing-hopes-of-talks","fields":{"headline":"Erdoğan says he is cutting all ties with Greek PM, dashing hopes of talks","trailText":"Turkish president, said to be irked by growing US-Greece relations, calls off meetings aimed at easing tensions","body":"<p>A pledge by Turkey’s president to cut all ties with the Greek prime minister – and a suggestion that Kyriakos Mitsotakis was dishonourable and lacking character – has raised fears of renewed tensions between the two Nato members.</p> <p>Calling off talks between the countries, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused Mitsotakis of deliberately antagonising Turkey when he <a href=\"https://primeminister.gr/en/2022/05/17/29339\">addressed</a> the US Congress during a visit last week to Washington.</p> <p>“This year we were supposed to have a strategic council meeting,” Erdoğan said in a televised address on Monday. “From now on there is no one called Mitsotakis in my book. I will never accept meeting him because we [only] walk on the same path as politicians who keep their promises, who have character and who are honourable.”</p> <p>The decision to freeze Greek-Turkish contact ends what many had hoped would be a period of détente between the perennial foes after Mitsotakis held talks with Erdoğan in Istanbul in March.</p> <p>The seemingly constructive meeting, conducted over lunch, resulted in the two men underlining the need for “increased cooperation” to improve strained bilateral ties in view of the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>But the Turkish leader, who will run for re-election next year, said Mitsotakis had failed to keep his side of the deal.</p> <p>“We had agreed not to include third countries in our disputes,” he said. “Despite this, last week, he had a visit to the US and talked at the Congress and warned them not to give F-16s [fighter planes] to us.”</p> <p>Making the historic 17 May address, the Greek leader stopped short of mentioning Turkey by name but warned Washington of the perils involved in fomenting instability in the region if arms purchasing agreements were adopted.

Turkey realises that the US has gradually reduced its strategic dependency on Turkish soil by increasing its military presence in Greece.”</p> <p>For the first time in almost a year, the Greek coastguard said this week it had stopped about 600 people from crossing into the Aegean from Turkey – raising further fears of Erdoğan using the country’s large refugee population to stoke tensions.</p> <p>“Erdoğan is an unpredictable and dangerous neighbour. He weaponised refugees in 2020 and he may do it again,” said Pavlos Eleftheriadis, a professor of public law at the University of Oxford. “But the Greek government is also reacting in what appears to be an unlawful way by conducting unlawful pushbacks of asylum seekers in the Evros [River] and the Aegean Sea.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/24/we-cant-all-work-ourselves-out-of-the-cost-of-living-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T16:41:57Z","webTitle":"We can’t all work ourselves out of the cost of living crisis | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/we-cant-all-work-ourselves-out-of-the-cost-of-living-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/24/we-cant-all-work-ourselves-out-of-the-cost-of-living-crisis","fields":{"headline":"We can’t all work ourselves out of the cost of living crisis","trailText":"<strong>Letters: </strong>An immediate increase in benefits could surely be brought into play, writes <strong>Jill Westby</strong>.

That means that the threshold value of a positive test can be altered depending on the circumstances.</p> <p>We have seen a lot in the media about pre-test probabilities and the meaning of a result in relation to Covid and lateral flow tests. For bowel cancer screening in England, given the assumption that the screening population has no symptoms, the threshold of a positive test is set at 120. But if you present to your GP with potential symptoms, you will be offered a test where it is considered positive if greater than 10 and then referred on for further investigations. For those with a result less than 10, your chance of having bowel cancer at an individual level is then less than 1%.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Damian Glancy</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Consultant colorectal surgeon</em></p> <p><strong>• <em>Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Somerset’s Will Smeed is a good example of the opportunities T20 success can bring: the 20-year-old – who has never played a senior match longer than 20 overs a side – did well enough in last year’s competition (and also, it must be said, in the Hundred) to secure winter contracts with Bangla Tigers in the Abu Dhabi T10, and with Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Premier League, where he hit two 90-plus scores in six innings and departed with his reputation further inflated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"973346384e794e7fdcb95c760a7f061ceae29bc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/973346384e794e7fdcb95c760a7f061ceae29bc6/0_62_4594_2757/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quetta Gladiators' Will Smeed hits out in the Pakistan Super League in February 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quetta Gladiators' Will Smeed hits out in the Pakistan Super League in February 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arif Ali/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It increasingly seems a young man’s game: nationally six of the top 10 run-scorers in last year’s competition were 25 or under, and three of Somerset’s top five in the final were under 23, players who have never known life without T20 and for whom the skillset required comes naturally.</p> <p>This will be particularly tested this year, with the competition moved earlier in the season and many clubs going into it with little more than a day’s format-specific training. “I’m hoping there’ll be big crowds and actually better cricket,” Kerr says.</p> <p>“A couple of years ago when the 50-over competition was earlier in the year scores were high, the pitches a bit fresher. There are advantages. There’s always a natural buzz at T20, a different crowd, a different atmosphere and a different kind of pressure. More than anything it’s an opportunity to entertain the public.

When their two-day-old daughter first refused to eat, then began to go yellow with the signs of jaundice and then fell into a seizure, Kanchana and her husband, living in the Sri Lankan region of Haldummulla, knew she needed urgent medical care.</p> <p>But they faced a terrible obstacle. Sri Lanka is in the grip of the worst economic crisis in its history, declaring bankruptcy and with no foreign reserves left to pay for imports. As a result, the country has been unable to afford necessary fuel and in recent weeks, supplies have all but dried up. As the girl’s father searched for hours on Sunday for fuel for his tuk-tuk to drive her to hospital, he was faced with one empty petrol station after another.</p> <p>Eventually, when they arrived at a local hospital just a few kilometres away, their two-day-old was in such a critical condition she had to be transferred to an emergency treatment unit at the larger Diyatalawa hospital. But it was too late; she was already dead on arrival.</p> <p>Shanaka Roshan Pathirana, the judicial medical officer of the Diyatalawa hospital who conducted the postmortem, confirmed that the length of time in getting the infant to hospital had led directly to her death.</p> <p>“The depressing memory for the parents that they could not save their baby just because they could not find a litre of petrol will haunt them for ever,” Pathirana said in a social media post, which accused the government of failing to protect the lives of vulnerable people.</p> <p>Pathirana spoke directly to the Guardian to confirm the details of the incident but said he was not authorised to speak to the media beyond his social media post. Kanchana, the baby’s mother, said she was too distraught at her daughter’s death to say anything more.</p> <p>It was a haunting reminder that as Sri Lanka’s economic crisis drags on without respite, the human cost continues to mount. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/sri-lanka-financial-crisis-new-prime-minister-ranil-wickremesinghe\">The newly appointed prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe</a>, warned last week: “the worst is still to come”, with medicine shortages worsening daily and food shortages predicted to be on the horizon. Already, many in the country can barely afford one meal a day as food inflation has soared to a record 45% and the country’s currency has become the worst-performing in the world.</p> <p>Sri Lanka’s economic crisis has also precipitated a political crisis that continues to destabilise the country. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who is accused of catastrophic economic policies and mismanagement that drove the country to bankruptcy, has continued to refuse to bow to mass protests and resign. While a new prime minister was appointed this month, the government is seen by many as weak and without the backing of the people.</p> <p>Nowhere are the woes of Sri Lanka more visible than the queues that continue to form outside petrol stations, often more than two miles long, long into the night as the island grapples with rampant fuel shortages and prices that have risen 137% over the past six months. For the drivers and tuk-tuk owners, petrol is their livelihood; without it they cannot survive. To worsen matters, on Tuesday the government announced an unprecedented fuel hike of 20-24% on petrol and 35-38% for diesel.</p> <p>“No matter how much you work, it’s now never enough to cover the costs of the petrol,” said Ruwal Ranasinghe, 40, a tuk-tuk driver from Pethiyagoda.</p> <p>As darkness fell over Colombo on Monday night, D M Sameera, 39, a driver from Kesbawa, about 15 miles away, settled in for what would be his 33rd hour waiting in a queue for petrol outside a station in the city’s Havelock town area.</p> <p>His desperation was palpable. The previous morning he had driven to two different petrol stations and waited for hours, each time getting to the front of the queue just after petrol ran out. Eventually, he had parked outside this station on Sunday afternoon, kept there for more than 24 hours by the promise that petrol was definitely on the way imminently and the fact there was nothing left in his tank. But by 11pm on Monday, none had come and he was facing another night sleeping in his car as he waited for a tanker to arrive.</p> <p>“I have to be away from my family for days now because during the day I work and at night I wait for petrol,” said Sameera. “Often I don’t have enough fuel to drive back home. This has made me feel fed up with my life and not wanting to go on. I am so angry and filled with hatred at the government for doing this to us.”</p> <p>For the city’s tuk-tuk drivers, life has become what one described as “a living hell”, with every moment they are not working spent waiting in line for petrol, often until 3am or 4am, or sleeping overnight in line if they have “bad luck”. Their incomes have more than halved as a result, while petrol prices have skyrocketed.</p> <p>“I don’t see my family any more: if I am not working I am just in my tuk-tuk waiting for petrol for up to eight hours a night,” said Mohammad Kamil, 38, as he sat outside a petrol station at 10pm. “I have lost so much sleep. It’s very sad, I cry alone in my tuk-tuk sometimes when I am waiting for petrol because it’s so desperate.”</p> <p>As supplies of fuel have recently trickled in, donated by India and other neighbouring countries, a system has emerged to help people find petrol – including Facebook and WhatsApp groups dedicated to announcing where the latest fuel arrival has been dispatched.</p> <p>In an attempt to maintain their family life, some tuk-tuk drivers resorted to desperate measures during their night-time fuel searches. In the back of Chanukah Pradeep’s tuk-tuk, which had sat in a petrol queue in Gamthaha district for hours, his two-year-old daughter lay curled up asleep next to his wife.</p> <p>“I brought them with me here, because otherwise I don’t get to spend any time with my family,” said Pradeep, who works two jobs. “When I get back from the petrol queue they are both asleep, so at least this way I can be with them for a little bit of time.”</p> <p>He looked mournfully at his daughter asleep in the tuk-tuk back seat, shifting restlessly as the huge diesel trucks honked their horns impatiently nearby and car fumes filled the air.</p> <p>“I am so sad and full of regret that this is her life and that I am losing all this precious time with her for what? Just for petrol,” said Pradeep. “I will never get that time back.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Devana Senanayake</em></p> <p>• This article was amended on 25 May 2022 to clarify the baby was two days old, not two years old as an earlier version had it.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2022/may/24/the-grim-reality-of-shakespeares-ideas","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T16:35:23Z","webTitle":"The grim reality of Shakespeare’s ideas | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/24/the-grim-reality-of-shakespeares-ideas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/may/24/the-grim-reality-of-shakespeares-ideas","fields":{"headline":"The grim reality of Shakespeare’s ideas","trailText":"<strong>Brief letters: </strong>Enduring lessons of the Bard’s plays | Children and risk | Wolves v buses | The next monarch | Purple line power","body":"<p>Katharine Birbalsingh says that “the ideas in Shakespeare are universal” and should continue to be taught in the classroom (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/22/uks-strictest-headmistress-fears-schools-will-stop-teaching-shakespeare\" title=\"\">UK’s ‘strictest headmistress’ fears schools will stop teaching Shakespeare, 22 May</a>).

There was nothing in my diary that day, that week or the weeks before and after.</p> <p>My employer had sent everybody home, which was the right thing to do. But over the following months, the lack of contact with my team members meant that I became more and more isolated and ineffective in my job. I lost a sense of belonging to something I’d previously really enjoyed.</p> <p>My employer is ordinarily very supportive. But in some cases, managers went to pieces and just didn’t know how to manage a team in that situation. I had the counselling provided by my employer, which was helpful, but eventually I decided to leave my job.</p> <p>A number of people left my employer at the time for similar reasons. I feel so aggrieved and let down by what is happening with our government and our prime minister. It makes me very angry and very sad when I think about what we’ve all been through, and how we all stuck to the rules. <br><strong>Zoe, 50, works in education, Cornwall</strong></p> <h2>‘If I’d known what I do now, I wouldn’t have stuck to the rules’</h2> <p>Thirteenth November is the day that I received a phone call from my mum’s number. It was not my mum on the phone, however, but a paramedic who was ringing to say that my mum had died. She died alone in her assisted living flat after months of us not being able to visit in person because of the restrictions.</p> <p>At 89, she had been feeling desperately lonely but otherwise in good health. She had told me on the phone earlier that week that she’d “take her chances” with Covid if I could visit. But I told her no, I’ve got to stick to the rules.</p> <p>If I’d known then what I know now, I wouldn’t have thought like that. I have no doubt in my mind that it was the impact of lockdown that killed her.</p> <p>If I could go back I’d certainly break the rules and make sure I’d been there for her. <strong>Sandra</strong><strong>, 61, teacher, Leeds</strong></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/24/kellyanne-conway-book-bannon-trump-kushner","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T16:07:17Z","webTitle":"Kellyanne Conway takes aim at Bannon in book but hits Trump in process","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/kellyanne-conway-book-bannon-trump-kushner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/24/kellyanne-conway-book-bannon-trump-kushner","fields":{"headline":"Kellyanne Conway takes aim at Bannon in book but hits Trump in process","trailText":"Former senior counselor to Donald Trump says president was ‘too trusting of others who lacked transparency or talent’","body":"<p>In her new memoir, Kellyanne Conway lavishes abuse on Steve Bannon, calling the former White House strategist a “leaking dirigible” and an “unpaternal, paternalistic bore of a boor” more concerned with his own image than serving Donald Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/mallory-mcmorrow-speech-democrats-michigan-midterms\">The ‘straight, white, Christian, suburban mom’ taking on Republicans at their own game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in doing so, the former senior counselor to the ex-US president criticises Trump himself, otherwise a notable escapee from her book.</p> <p>“One of Trump’s biggest selling points,” Conway writes in one of many takedowns of Bannon, “was his refreshing lack of political experience.

This month, recommendations include Terry Pratchett’s fantasy novels, a guide to writing and some gripping spy novels. Tell us what you’ve been reading in the comments.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Dean Atta, poet and author</h2> <p>Right now I’m almost exclusively reading queer books. It’s really important to me to see a variety of stories being told, as it reassures me that I can tell my own stories without them needing to speak for every queer person. <br><br>Séan Hewitt’s memoir <strong>All Down Darkness Wide</strong><strong> </strong>spoke to my formative years growing up under Section 28, having conflicting feelings towards my sexuality as a Christian. It’s a very tender book that looks at intimate relationships in Hewitt’s life and explores the nuances of two men existing outside traditional family structures. As a queer person you can be close to your family and yet still feel a distance when it comes to their understanding of your experience. <br><br>Also in nonfiction, <strong>Body Work</strong>, Melissa Febos’ illuminating writing guide, has been a trusty companion of late. Febos explains how she wrote her books, which include Whip Smart, about her time as a professional dominatrix. <br><br>And finally, <strong>Limbic</strong> by Peter Scalpello is a collection by a Glaswegian poet living in London – my opposite, as a London poet living in Glasgow. I was intrigued to see how Peter experienced my city and it’s uncanny; I relate to so much of it. He’s very candid about the gay scene in London, very open about sex and the lack of intimacy you can sometimes feel in a big city. It’s a very brave book that will ring true for many gay men and queer people, I’m so glad it exists in the world.<br></p> <p><em>Only on the Weekends</em> <em>by Dean Atta (Hodder, £8.99)</em> <em>is available now.

It tells the story of a family who discover that the world is going to end and they are the only ones with a chance of survival – as long as they are inside the house when the day finally comes.</p> <p>Although the book can be classified as horror, I loved Jackson’s dark humour and the way she showcases the family dynamics. It’s set in a mansion where the characters live in their own bubbled reality, never fully satisfied, always thinking of the new world to come. I found the book so clever, scary and funny that it became a journey I got to experience alongside the family. And Jackson constantly teases the reader, having you flip between doubting and believing that this day will ever come.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>PD Smith, author and critic</h2> <p>The news in the last few months has been grim, with a war in Europe and the possible dawn of another cold war with Russia. My recent reading reflects this mood.</p> <p>Geoffrey Household’s <strong>Rogue Male</strong><em> </em>was written at the beginning of 1939, as Europe moved inexorably towards war. Described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robert-macfarlane\">Robert Macfarlane</a> as Household’s “masterpiece”, the novel describes how the narrator attempts to assassinate a dictator and is then pursued relentlessly until he is, literally, holed up in the Dorset countryside, like a fox gone to ground. It inspired countless popular manhunt novels, but it is also a deeply strange and evocative book that reminded me strongly of Kafka’s claustrophobic parables.</p> <p>I also read Eric Ambler’s spy novel <strong>Cause for Alarm</strong>, written a year or so before Rogue Male and similarly overshadowed by the storm clouds of war. I found it less original and gripping than Household’s book, but still worth reading.</p> <p>After this I turned to a classic cold war detective novel from 1981: <strong>Gorky Park</strong> by Martin Cruz Smith. His Moscow detective Arkady Renko is brilliantly drawn (“a lean, pale man”) and the novel gives a wonderfully vivid sense of the difficulty of investigating a brutal crime while the KGB is breathing down your neck. Renko wonders at one point if he’s playing “a game of investigator against himself”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c47df0b81a61cae87abafaefe50a1baaba0a8bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c47df0b81a61cae87abafaefe50a1baaba0a8bd/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Auster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Auster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the moment I’m writing a book about crime fiction and, as I recently finished a section on James Ellroy, this month I revisited his extraordinary novel <strong>American Tabloid</strong>. Reading anything by Ellroy is always a visceral experience, and this one is no exception.</p> <p>Set during the cold war, Ellroy aims to “demythologise” the era of John F Kennedy and to create a new myth that rises “from the gutter to the stars”. Although, as ever, Ellroy is more interested in the gutter, and the brutal, ambitious, self-destructive men who live there, than in the stars. In an interview with the Guardian he summed it up as a “tabloid sewer crawl through the private nightmare of public policy”. It’s a crazy, unforgettable book about conspiracies, corruption and scandal – a pure adrenaline rush in literary form.</p> <p>Reading Ellroy’s feverish alt-history of cold war America reminded me of a line from another book I read a month or so ago – Paul Auster’s entertaining private-eye novel <strong>Squeeze Play</strong>, which he published under the pseudonym Paul Benjamin in 1984. Towards the end, Auster’s gumshoe has an epiphany: “I had understood the most important fact of all – that reality doesn’t exist without the imagination to see it.”</p> <p>It’s a great line, one that captures for me how the best crime fiction (like all great fiction) reimagines events, allowing us to see the world with new eyes.</p> <p><em>PD Smith is the author of four non-fiction books, including </em><em>Doomsday Men</em><em> (Allen Lane) and </em><em>City: A Guidebook for the Urban Age</em><em> (Bloomsbury).</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Brenda, Guardian reader</h2> <p>It’s only this year that I began reading the<strong> Discworld novels</strong> by Terry Pratchett. I’ve fallen entirely in love with hard-bitten Sam Vimes and the byzantine world Pratchett erected upon the backs of four elephants who stand on the back of a turtle swimming slowly through space. There is no pleasure like the pleasure of reading a book in the confident knowledge that there are at least 20 more volumes ahead of you. I figure if I pace myself I can read Discworld novels until the end of this decade.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/live/2022/may/24/davos-day-2-world-food-crisis-imf-ec-nato-ukraine-pandemic-live-update","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T16:01:42Z","webTitle":"Davos day two: Global tax deal delayed; Von der Leyen on Russian food ‘blackmail’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/may/24/davos-day-2-world-food-crisis-imf-ec-nato-ukraine-pandemic-live-update","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/may/24/davos-day-2-world-food-crisis-imf-ec-nato-ukraine-pandemic-live-update","fields":{"headline":"Davos day two: Global tax deal delayed; Von der Leyen on Russian food ‘blackmail’ – as it happened","trailText":"Rolling coverage of the second day of the World Economic Forum in Davos","body":"<div id=\"block-628cfc838f08b48a6e7433d4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-24T16:01:33.129Z\">5.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time to wrap up..... back tomorrow! <strong>GW</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/historic-global-tax-deal-on-multinationals-delayed-until-2024\">‘Historic’ global tax deal on multinationals delayed until 2024</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/nato-russia-china-jens-stoltenberg-davos-wef\">Nato head warns over risks of close economic ties with Russia and China</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-628cfdcc8f08b48a6e7433ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-24T16:01:18.120Z\">5.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Early detection will be crucial to prevent an virus outbreak going global and becoming the next pandemic, Bill Gates says.</strong><br></p> <p>You also need a global capacity looking out for threats, and responding to them, he tells a panel at Davos.</p> <p>Gates also flags that many of the pandemic risks are in countries which in the next several decades won’t have the infrastructure needed to handle an outbreak - so international cooperation is crucial.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PandemicAction/status/1529125347504947200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">“The ideal is that you detect and prevent pandemics before they go global.” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillGates?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BillGates</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WEF22?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WEF22</a> panel on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/pandemicpreparedness?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#pandemicpreparedness</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0HZ776a5pw\">pic.twitter.com/0HZ776a5pw</a></p>&mdash; Pandemic Action Network (@PandemicAction) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PandemicAction/status/1529125347504947200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 24, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Helen E.

It’s inexcusable that people could commit these atrocities, or that people could stand silent as they were committed.”</p> <p>Over more than a century, at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/06/canada-dark-of-history-residential-schools\">150,000 Indigenous children</a> were forcibly converted to Christianity, given new names and prohibited from speaking their native languages. The last residential school closed in the 1990s.</p> <p>The schools, run by both churches and the federal government, operated by coercion. Canada’s first prime minister, Sir John A MacDonald, told the country’s parliament that an Indigenous child in his or her own community was “simply a savage who can read and write”.</p> <p>In contrast to the welcome for Simon, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, faced a chilly reception, with a heckling crowd following him around the grounds of the Pow Wow Arbour.</p> <p>“Canada is all Indian land,” a group chanted at him, loudly drumming as he met with attendees. “We don’t need your constitution.”</p> <p>The prime minister said the discovery of unmarked graves had ushered a “difficult year” for Canadians.</p> <p>“This is about remembering who we lost,” he said. “To those who are still filled with hurt and anger, I hear that.”</p> <p>Trudeau had previously turned down an invitation from the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc to join them in observing Canada’s first-ever National Day of Truth and Reconciliation holiday in September.

The garden, designed for the charity Rewilding Britain, aimed to show their role as incredible bioengineers within a natural ecosystem, and incorporated crack willow, hawthorn and alder.</p> <p>Unusually for the show, native grasses are shown as they would be seen in the wild, with their previous year’s growth and their pre-season seed-head remnants left on, together with the brown, former season’s dead foliage.

Rewilding Britain is about the marginal areas. This may not be a formal garden, but we are trying to show you what you see out in nature when it’s colonising itself, is a lovely mix of shrubs, trees, grassland, meadows.

When you realise what habitat does, what it can look like, you can start to find it beautiful. It’s about leaving a little part of your garden wild, unmowed.</p> <p>“Why not leave some hawthorn in the corner with some nettles under it – that’s creating habitat.

Onshore and offshore wind and solar power all command about £40 per megawatt hour on the market today, but gas-fired power generation costs about £140 per megawatt hour.</p> <p>Under the system of “contracts for difference”, renewable energy generators bid for contracts to produce power, but the government can set an overall limit on how much capacity it wants in the auctions, and can set limits on how much cash it is prepared to provide as incentives.</p> <p>On Friday, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy laid out plans for an auction, to take place on 5-6 July, allowing for 5GW of capacity to be competed for by onshore wind and solar, neither of which can take more than 3.5GW in total. The government was also expected to set a cap on offshore wind, of about 7GW of new capacity. Instead it set no cap but limited the incentive “pot” to £200m. Industry sources said that pot would amount to a de facto cap of about 7GW on new offshore wind capacity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2022-05-24-02:09:06/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Renewable capacity – graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2022-05-24-02:09:06/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>At about 12GW, this is the biggest auction so far, but still falls far below what the industry says is possible: according to industry estimates, there are about 8.5GW of offshore windfarms that could come on stream, along with about 3.9GW of onshore wind and about 5GW of solar farms.</p> <p>Many groups, including unions, the CBI employers’ organisation, the National Farmers’ Union, and green and consumer groups, had called for the government to increase the amount of renewable energy generation.

Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: “Once again, families are paying higher energy bills as a direct result of Conservative failure. The government is intentionally blocking access to the quickest, cheapest, cleanest forms of new power, stopping enough onshore wind and solar energy to power 3m homes. These are shovel-ready projects, with planning permission, that could be generating energy for our country at a quarter of the price of gas by the end of next year.”</p> <p>He added: “This terrible decision, bowing to the concerns of a few Tory backbenchers, damages investment, forfeits good jobs across the country, keeps bills high, and continues our exposure to Putin’s gas.”</p> <p>Doug Parr, a policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: “We have a global climate emergency which requires low carbon power, we have a cost of living crisis which requires cheap power, and we have a war in Ukraine that requires domestic power. By an amazing stroke of luck, renewables are low-carbon, cheap, domestic and can be deployed faster than the alternatives. Capacity limits on cheap renewables are outdated thinking.”</p> <p>The new contracts for difference auction follows a pattern of slowing growth in renewable energy in the UK, according to analysis conducted by the Liberal Democrats on government data.</p> <p>Total renewable capacity grew by 3.4% to 49.44GW in the year to December 2021, compared with an average annual rise of about 18% over the previous 11 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wera Hobhouse, the climate and energy spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: “Under the Conservatives, the UK renewables industry has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/13/how-the-uk-can-cut-carbon-emissions-and-reduce-household-energy-bills\">neglected again and again</a>.

Recently [in the local elections], British people sent a message that the Conservatives have let them down. The lack of ambition in renewables is just another example that will leave millions vulnerable to ever-soaring energy bills.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “The Covid pandemic and its aftermath understandably slowed infrastructure deployment across the country. That said, nearly 40% of our electricity now comes from renewable sources, and since 2010 we have delivered a 500% increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid. The contracts for difference scheme has been hugely successful in boosting UK energy supply and reducing our dependence on volatile fossil fuels, with competitive auctions reducing the price of offshore wind by around 65% since 2015.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/24/new-york-removes-last-public-payphone","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T15:49:13Z","webTitle":"End of an era as New York removes last public payphone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/new-york-removes-last-public-payphone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/24/new-york-removes-last-public-payphone","fields":{"headline":"End of an era as New York removes last public payphone","trailText":"City once had more than 6,000 public telephones but march of technology has led to replacement with wifi kiosks","body":"<p>New York City removed its last public payphone this week, discontinuing a relic from a more analog time.</p> <p>On Monday municipal officials removed the last remaining city-owned payphone, located in the Midtown area.

She was, her friends and family said, a girl who “did not fear anything”.</p> <p>That pluck perhaps explains why, larking around with friends in Liverpool city centre last year, she had no hesitation, no concern, in confronting a boy two years older who was filming her. She demanded that he stop and delete the footage. She had no idea he had a knife. What followed shocked everyone, particularly the city of Liverpool.</p> <p>It took place on a night that should have been all about fun: the switching on of the city centre Christmas lights. Steve Rotheram, the metropolitan mayor of Liverpool, summed up community feelings when he expressed his horror at the stabbing.</p> <p>“For such an appalling attack to take place on one of the busiest streets in the Liverpool city region, during one of the busiest days of the year, sends shivers down our spines,” he said at the time. “Ava was just a child with her whole life in front of her. Her future has been stolen and the lives of her family and friends shattered. I am angry today for Ava and her family, for the parents across the region worrying about their children’s safety, and angry that such a heinous act should take place here.</p> <p>“Only yesterday we supported ‘Orange the World’ campaign to end male violence against women and girls. Last night’s senseless events show us that there is still so much work to do.”</p> <p>After Ava’s death the city’s three professional football clubs, Liverpool, Everton and Tranmere, came together to <a href=\"https://www.thisisanfield.com/2021/12/liverpool-everton-and-tranmere-unite-in-stand-against-knife-crime-epidemic/\">speak out against the carrying of knives</a>. “Liverpool is a city built on compassion and solidarity, and we must take a unified stance – it is not acceptable, for any reason, to carry knives. This is a simple message, yet one that can save hundreds of lives every year,” the clubs said.</p> <p>Ava had gone into the city centre on 25 November to meet friends and have a laugh. Small bottles of vodka had been bought and their contents were being drunk mixed with fruit juice.</p> <p>The jury in the 14-year-old boy’s trial was shown CCTV footage showing what many would call kids being kids. They were sitting in plant pots, pulling up plants and throwing them at each other. They were singing, dancing, falling over, and running around a Christmas tree.</p> <p>A group of four boys chanced upon Ava’s group. They started filming in order to distribute the footage on Snapchat. Ava was evidently angry and approached the defendant to demand he stop filming. The boy thrust the knife into Ava’s neck, causing catastrophic injuries.</p> <p>Staff from the nearby Liverpool One shopping centre tried to stem the bleeding but it was too late. She was still just alive as paramedics took her to hospital but she died shortly afterwards.</p> <p>The trial was striking in that most of the evidence came from children and hardly any account of what happened was exactly the same.</p> <p>For the family it was obviously a gruelling, emotional trial, not least because the court was shown footage of the stabbing. They saw her pushing the boy, who had his right arm raised. It was played four times, twice at normal speed and twice slowed down. Prosecutors showed the jury an enlarged still from the footage showing the knife. It was one of many examples of CCTV shown to the jury.</p> <p>The boy accepted that he stabbed Ava but maintained that he “didn’t mean to”, saying he was just trying to get Ava away from him.</p> <p>It was a senseless death, one that is difficult to read into for wider lessons. Richard Garside, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/about/richard-garside\">Centre for Crime and Justice Studies</a>, said a case like this involving such young children was mercifully rare, but that would be of no consolation to the families and friends of Ava.</p> <p>“Whatever happens as a result of the verdict is obviously not going to bring Ava back. How on earth do you make sense of a 12-year-old girl going out and not coming home?” he said.</p> <p>Hundreds gathered at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/funeral-held-for-stabbed-girl-12-in-liverpool-ava-white\">Ava’s funeral</a> two days before Christmas, when the archbishop of Liverpool, Malcolm McMahon, described her as a “popular, loving young person”.</p> <p>“Ava was loved by so many people, undoubtedly heaven will be a happier place,” he said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/24/boy-14-guilty-of-murder-liverpool-schoolgirl-ava-white","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T15:38:03Z","webTitle":"Boy, 14, guilty of murder of Liverpool schoolgirl Ava White","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/24/boy-14-guilty-of-murder-liverpool-schoolgirl-ava-white","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/24/boy-14-guilty-of-murder-liverpool-schoolgirl-ava-white","fields":{"headline":"Boy, 14, guilty of murder of Liverpool schoolgirl Ava White","trailText":"Teenager stabbed 12-year-old in neck in Snapchat video row on night she went to see Christmas lights","body":"<p>A 14-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering the 12-year-old Liverpool schoolgirl Ava White after he stabbed her in the neck in a row over a video posted on Snapchat.</p> <p>The boy stabbed her and then showed a “callous disregard” for his actions, seeming “rather pleased with himself, as if he feels big”, Liverpool crown court heard during a 12-day trial.</p> <p>The boy, who has a legal right to anonymity, had denied murder and manslaughter, claiming he accidentally stabbed Ava in self-defence.</p> <p>But a jury took two hours and eight minutes to return a guilty verdict.

He ran from the scene, abandoning the knife and his coat.</p> <p>The jury was shown CCTV footage of the boy and his friends going into a shop, where they bought butter, which he said was for crumpets, and he was seen arranging his hair for a selfie.</p> <p>CCTV footage also showed without question that he was the person who stabbed Ava but he denied being there, telling police he was playing Call of Duty with a friend. In later interviews he blamed another boy for the stabbing.</p> <p>Newell said: “Knowing he had stabbed her, his behaviour is of someone who is, at best, utterly unconcerned, at worst, rather pleased with himself, as if he feels big.”</p> <p>She said the boy’s young age was not a defence. “He is not a babe in arms, he knows right from wrong. He was capable of making the decision to carry a knife. He was capable of deciding to use it and he was capable of lying about it over and over and over again.”</p> <p>The boy, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, appeared at the trial via video link from a secure unit, often using fidget toys to help him concentrate on proceedings. He was accompanied by an intermediary.</p> <p>Speaking outside court, DS Sue Coombs said the force’s thoughts were with the family.</p> <p>“Her mum and dad and sister are still completely devastated by what’s happened to Ava and it has been heartbreaking for them to witness Ava’s final moments during this court process,” she added.</p> <p>It was a trial that relied heavily on CCTV footage. The jury saw the clear high spirits of Ava and her friends in Liverpool city centre, sitting in plant pots, sitting on top of each other, dancing, singing, falling over and running around a Christmas tree.</p> <p>They also saw the fatal moment when the boy stabbed her, with Ava standing in front of the boy who had his right arm raised. In his right hand was a “reflective item”.</p> <p>The jury heard edited transcripts of five police interviews carried out in the days following his arrest. His answers to questions included numerous no comments as well as “I’m not bothered” and “I don’t fucking know”.</p> <p>Asked why he lied to police, he replied: “I was scared I was going to go to jail.” The knife, which had a 7.5cm blade, was found in March after the boy’s legal team contacted police to tell them of its whereabouts.</p> <p>During one interview session he told an officer “shut up you nonce” as he was questioned, although following legal discussions the jury was not told that.</p> <p>The murder, on one of the city’s busiest streets at one of the busiest times of the year, shocked Liverpool. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/04/hundreds-join-vigil-for-stabbing-victim-ava-white-12-in-liverpool\">A vigil in the city centre was</a> held 12 days after and hundreds of mourners gathered at the city’s Catholic cathedral two days before Christmas Day to see her off.</p> <p>Her coffin was covered in family photographs of Ava, a year 8 student at <a href=\"https://www.notredameliverpool.com/\">Notre Dame Catholic college</a>.

In a letter from her lawyers, human rights group Redress says she fears the confession will be used against her and other dual-national detainees held in Iran.</p> <p>In the Commons on Tuesday, Milling accepted that UK Foreign Office officials were present at the signing of Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s forced confession, but simply relayed to her the message from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) that she needed to sign it.</p> <p>Milling said: “Given the situation Iran put Nazanin [in] at the airport she took the decision to sign the document. No UK official forced her to do so. Iran has a practice of insisting detainees sign documents before they are released.”</p> <p>Milling said repeatedly UK officials did not force Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian dual national, to sign the document, but was careful to avoid saying whether officials advised her to do so.</p> <p>She also gave no answer on whether the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, knew of the pre-conditions for her departure in advance. Similarly, she sidestepped a question of whether the IRGC was going to be removed from the list of foreign terrorist organisations as part of an Iran nuclear deal.</p> <p>Milling was answering an urgent question in the Commons that had been tabled by Tulip Siddiq, Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s MP.</p> <p>Siddiq told MPs: “For days in the run-up to her release, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard had tried to make Nazanin write out and sign a document listing the crimes she was wrongly accused of, admitting guilt for them, requesting clemency and promising not to sue or criticise the Iranian government. At Tehran airport on 16 March – on the day she was eventually allowed to fly back to the UK – she was again asked to do this by Iran, but instead tore up the piece of paper.</p> <p>“It was only when a UK official told her that she had to sign it if she was going to board the plane that was waiting to take her home, that she finally caved and gave Iran what they wanted. Nazanin returned home, but the toll this took on my constituent after six years of detention is unimaginable and unacceptable.</p> <p>“She is traumatised and fears for what the consequences of this could be for her future, her family and other British citizens still held hostage in Iran.”</p> <p>Siddiq said it was “part of a systematic failure to respond to the torture of British citizens by foreign governments and hold them to account”.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe, in a BBC interview, confirmed she told the prime minister at a meeting in Downing Street that she had lived in the shadow of his mistaken statement to MPs in 2017 that she had visited Iran to train journalists in 2016.</p> <p>She said: “For about a year and a half, I was trying to say: ‘Look I was on holiday … I have come with a baby with a suitcase full of nappies …</p> <p>“But then when he made that comment, the Revolutionary Guards every time after that … they said, ‘You have been hiding information from us. We know that you’re a spy. We know what you were up to, even your prime minister mentioned that.’</p> <p>“So I lived under the shadow of his comment psychologically and emotionally for the following four-and-a-half years after that day.”</p> <p>She said there was an old Persian saying, “you may be able to leave prison but prison will never leave you and I will have to accept that”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/may/24/the-fiver-yes-its-close-season-transfer-time-when-anything-goes","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T15:02:19Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Yes, it’s close-season transfer time, when anything goes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/24/the-fiver-yes-its-close-season-transfer-time-when-anything-goes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/may/24/the-fiver-yes-its-close-season-transfer-time-when-anything-goes","fields":{"headline":"Yes, it’s close-season transfer time, when anything goes","trailText":"<strong>In today’s Fiver:</strong> A dodgy ticker, title celebrations and plenty more","body":"<h2><strong>DODGY TICKER</strong></h2> <p>The ticker on the BBC News channel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/24/bbc-apologises-after-manchester-united-are-rubbish-appears-on-ticker-news-tennis\">went haywire</a> on Tuesday morning, churning out random arrant nonsense such as “Manchester United are rubbish”, “Weather rain everywhere” and … actually, we don’t see the problem with this.

On the same day, Liverpool lost 3-1 at home to Aston Villa and the day before Burnley beat Everton 1-0 at Turf Moor. Thirteen or so years later the Pointless prize still opens at £1,000. There is never a ripple of applause from the tame audience. However, when the prize rises to something like £6,000 the audience applauds wildly. Since the game itself remains the same, we must conclude that humans applaud money. The bigger the sum, the louder the adulation. Liverpool now have oodles of the stuff, as do all the top six, Manchester United notwithstanding. Burnley, on the other hand, are lumbered with not-quite-big-enough American leveraging millionaires, while Everton are being accused of massively fiddling their finances [which they deny – Fiver Lawyers]. So, to the elitist, top-end club supporters next season, let us reflect that when Manchester City shove six goals up some hapless team playing the same game, and the City humans go wild, they are going wild for money.

Now, after 37 years away, they’re back","body":"<p>In early 1983, a Düsseldorf band called Propaganda got a message: Trevor Horn wanted them to come to London. It was an enticing and deeply improbable turn of events. Horn was the UK’s hottest pop producer, a man who had unexpectedly turned the hopelessly drippy duo Dollar into a critical cause célèbre and piloted ABC’s debut The Lexicon of Love to platinum-selling transatlantic success, also making it the fourth biggest-selling album of 1982 in the UK.</p> <p>Propaganda, however, were no one’s idea of a pop band. They were electronic experimentalists, a product of Germany’s burgeoning post-punk <em>Neue Deutsche Welle</em> scene. As vocalist Susanne Freytag puts it, they were attempting: “To go away from American music and find a kind of identity – there was a lot of shame in our generation in Germany, and it was a way of finding, or seeing people using the German language and making new music.” One of their members, Ralf Dörper, had previously been in metal-banging industrialists Die Krupps: he claimed to be less interested in music than he was in film. They had already caused a ripple of controversy in Germany by plundering imagery from the 1920s and 30s: a TV show refused to let them use a film featuring images of Zeppelin airships and Marlene Dietrich because, Dörper later said, “they didn’t understand that we might be questioning values of the past, rather than accepting them”. And they were not huge on melody. One of the songs on their demo tape was a German-language extrapolation of Throbbing Gristle’s entirely tune-free 1981 single Discipline. When the call from Trevor Horn came through, Propaganda scrambled to recruit a new member, Claudia Brücken, on the grounds that none of them could actually sing. “I felt a bit shocked,” says Freytag. “I thought ‘I’m not a singer, I’m happy to go and do something, but oh my God, we need a singer’. She is a very good singer, thank God.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnQ2zOmb6Hg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nnQ2zOmb6Hg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It was the beginning of one of 80s pop’s most unlikely and enduring stories. Propaganda’s career was brief and turbulent – by 1986, the band had splintered, mired in legal disputes – and they never sold huge quantities of records: their debut album A Secret Wish reached No 16 in the UK. But the people who liked them seemed to love them with a rare intensity. In 2018, when Freytag and Brücken reunited to play A Secret Wish live in London, “people came from Mexico and Japan” to see it. A similar enthusiasm seems to have greeted the news that the pair have made a new album, The Heart Is Strange, with A Secret Wish’s producer Stephen Lipson, under the name xPropaganda. “There’s someone who’s messaged me about coming to the London show from North Carolina,” frowns Lipson, sitting with Brücken and Freytag in a north London recording studio. “He’s bringing his daughter. It’s extraordinary. I don’t understand any of it.”</p> <p>“Maybe,” Freytag suggests, “Propaganda represents a different kind of 80s. It’s not what we associate with … the Duran Duran side of the 80s.”</p> <p>Horn had been alerted to Propaganda by NME journalist Paul Morley, with whom he was starting a new record label, Zang Tuum Tumb. The fact that its name came from futurist artist Filippo Marinetti’s onomatopoeic description of the sound of warfare underscored its leftfield, arty approach to pop, with which Propaganda fitted perfectly. “Paul liked the music, but it was also the combination of the name, the weird Germans and the really hard beat,” says Freytag. “It was a bit mad. Paul and Trevor, they were really intrigued by the thought of what they could make with people like us: four quite experimental, strange Germans. That was also appealing for us.”</p> <p>So Propaganda happily submitted to a ZTT makeover, which involved first Horn, then his deputy Lipson, drastically reworking their sound and Morley decorating their records with impenetrable sleeve notes: one single’s cover featured not one but two lengthy quotes from Italian literary theorist Franco Moretti, the first about Balzac, the second pondering the gender of vampires. “I was experimental – I was very playful with creative things,” says Brücken. “And for me, the opportunity to work with Trevor was amazing, and to work with Stephen and all these fantastic people. I always felt we were doing something together, I didn’t feel like my artistic integrity was at all compromised in any way.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fb3eaadaa5975bb414c362ab0dbc8e15a8a46a47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb3eaadaa5975bb414c362ab0dbc8e15a8a46a47/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Striking out on their own … xPropaganda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Striking out on their own … xPropaganda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jimmy King</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under ZTT’s aegis, Propaganda became pop stars, of a sort: within a year, they were on The Tube, performing their German-language extrapolation of Throbbing Gristle’s Discipline to a visibly nonplussed audience. They also performed their debut single, The Nine Lives of Dr Mabuse, which showed what Horn could do with their sound: a sample-stuffed, cutting-edge production with a killer chorus, which still retained the original band’s harsh, experimental edge. One critic memorably called them “Abba in hell”. It made the Top 10 in Germany, meaning Brücken, still at school in Düsseldorf, had to “be excused by my art teacher to go and make a video in Folkestone”. When she returned, bearing the Anton Corbijn-directed, German expressionism-influenced end result, “for my art teacher, it was a total proud moment, because it just dived into German history and the photography was so exquisite”.</p> <p>Its followup, Duel, earned them an appearance on Top of the Pops. By now, work had commenced on their debut album: distracted by the unexpectedly vast success of ZTT’s other signing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/02/how-we-made-relax-by-frankie-goes-to-hollywood-sex-mix-gay-clubs\">Frankie Goes to Hollywood</a>, Horn bowed out, letting Lipson take over as producer. It took a year and remains a source of controversy within the band: Lipson says he recently “came unstuck” with the band’s fourth member, Michael Mertens, over precisely who did and wrote what during its making. “I think he thinks the songs were more formed than I think they were, that was the crux of it. I remember there’s a song, Dream Within a Dream, and he just had a chord progression. A beautiful chord progression, and acknowledged as such by one and all, but there was no song, no idea, no structure, and I think quite a lot of the songs were like that.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We spent a fortune doing A Secret Wish, but it was so worth doing. The manager wouldn’t see it that way</p> <footer> <cite>Stephen Lipson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The sessions sound deranged, a state of affairs compounded by the fact that ZTT had carelessly neglected to set a budget for the recording. At one point, a percussionist was required to stand on a ladder throwing “huge bits of metal” into a porcelain bath. At another, Lipson and a programmer engaged in a “sample war”, taking turns to blast each other with the most outrageous noises they could find: you can hear it on Jewel. Contributions were solicited from Japan’s David Sylvian and Yes guitarist Steve Howe, the latter dragged in as he walked past the studio. The end result was hugely expensive and wildly inventive, but when Lipson played it to the assembled bigwigs from ZTT’s parent company Island, he says it was greeted with silence, broken only by the plaintive inquiry: “Have you got a single?”</p> <p>A Secret Wish attracted some very high-profile fans: Martin Gore claimed it was a huge influence on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/depeche-mode\">Depeche Mode</a>’s subsequent albums, Quincy Jones wanted to licence it for release in the US, and Horn subsequently claimed he had borrowed its sound on Michael Jackson’s Bad. But cracks had started to appear in Propaganda’s ranks, as Freytag remembers: “We did a tour, a lot of TV appearances, and I remember it worked really well, but after that it was a bit like: OK, we didn’t earn enough money and it was a lot of work, and people became frustrated, didn’t really understand this country.”</p> <p>Lipson says that a new manager didn’t help. “We spent a fortune doing [A Secret Wish], but it was so worth doing. The manager wouldn’t see it that way because they hadn’t lived the journey.”</p> <p>Brücken – who married Paul Morley – elected to stay with ZTT, the others left. If nothing else, Propaganda’s split in its aftermath bolstered the mystique of A Secret Wish: its reputation seemed to grow with the passing of time, the vanishing into history of an era when major record labels would bankroll wild experimental follies. There have been various incarnations of Propaganda since, but all attempts to reunite the quartet who made A Secret Wish have floundered, save for a single brief live appearance in 2008. When the most recent attempt to reunite collapsed – “we were working together,” says Freytag diplomatically, “then there was a time when it didn’t really work any more” – Brücken and Freytag struck out on their own as xPropaganda: the plan to write a few new songs with Lipson in order to play live turned into an album.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LebVh0k0cjg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LebVh0k0cjg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The irony is that The Heart Is Strange feels exactly like a 21st-century followup to A Secret Wish: not a forensic re-creation of its sound, but a modern album made with the same pop smarts, the same experimental edge, and the same dark undertow, enshrined in songs such as The Wolves Are Returning, a coolly dismayed assessment of the rise of the far right. There’s talk of a followup: an improbable second act to one of the 80s’ most improbable pop stories. “It was just that particular moment in time,” says Brücken, of their first flush of success. “It wouldn’t have happened a year later or a year before, you know – it was just this kind of peculiar series of events that happened that made this moment possible. I mean, if we’d planned it, it never would have happened. I always think that.”</p> <p>• The Heart is Strange is out now on ZTT.

However, on the night she was killed, Strickland had been hanging out with Wilson, according to police.</p> <p>Since then, police have identified Armstrong as the prime suspect in Wilson’s death, believing that she shot Wilson after Strickland dropped Wilson off at the home where she was staying.</p> <p>According to text messages obtained by the police, Strickland lied to Armstrong about his whereabouts that evening.</p> <p>“Hey!

When she was shown “video evidence of her vehicle”, Armstrong told police that “she had no explanation as to why it was in the area and did not make any denials surrounding the statement,” investigators wrote in the affidavit.</p> <p>In the days that followed, various tipsters told police that Armstrong “became furious and was shaking with anger” in January when she found out that Strickland had continued his relationship with Wilson.</p> <p>“Armstrong told the caller [she] was so angry Armstrong wanted to kill Wilson … [she] then proceeded to tell the caller [she] had either recently purchased a firearm or was going to,” the affidavit noted.</p> <p>Armstrong last spoke with police on 13 May and has since deleted her social media accounts, the affidavit added.</p> <p>Armstrong’s father, Michael Armstrong, told ABC’s Good Morning America in an interview broadcast on Tuesday he did not believe his daughter could have killed Wilson. He said there were many “unanswered questions” about what happened.</p> <p>“I know her,” Michael Armstrong said. “I know how she thinks and I know what she believes. And I know that she just would not do something like this.”</p> <p>Wilson’s family said in a statement that she was not in a relationship with anyone at the time of her death.</p> <p>“There are no words that can express the pain and suffering we are experiencing due to this senseless, tragic loss,” the family said in a statement. “Moriah was a talented, kind and caring young woman.

He is expected to make a statement to the Commons, followed by fielding questions at a private meeting with Tory backbenchers, and potentially a press conference.</p> \n<p>But Mark Harper, the Conservative MP and former chief whip who has called for Johnson to quit, said he was fed up with “decent” colleagues “being asked to go out on the television day after day and saying things that are frankly ridiculous and defending the indefensible”.</p> \n<p>He added the prime minister had not been straightforward with people and that senior ministers could not give straight answers about basic questions.</p> \n<p>Another Tory backbench critic of Johnson’s, Roger Gale, said the prime minister had misled the Commons by denying any gathering was held in November 2020.</p> \n<p>He said: “That is a resignation issue. I have made my own position clear. It is now a matter for my Conservative parliamentary colleagues to decide whether or not to instigate a vote of no confidence.”</p> \n<p>Gray’s report was not initially expected to contain photos taken at some of the law-breaking parties, but could do when the final version is delivered to No 10.</p> \n<p>Some insiders believe this will help stymie criticism of it being a whitewash, particularly if such evidence comes out at a later date, for instance during the investigation into whether Johnson misled parliament by the privileges committee.</p> \n<p>There may also be an attempt to counter the narrative sown by ministers in recent months that such gatherings were brief and frivolous. Referring to the damning photos and video evidence of the parties that has emerged so far, a source said: “A picture paints a thousand words.”</p> \n<p>The Met has been referred by the Liberal Democrats to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, about the handling of its investigation.</p> \n<p>The IOPC referred the complaint to the directorate of professional standards in the Met, who will have 15 days to respond with how they intend to handle it.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/may/24/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-unburnable-edition","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T14:52:56Z","webTitle":"Atwood responds to book bans with ‘unburnable’ edition of Handmaid’s Tale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/24/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-unburnable-edition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/may/24/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-unburnable-edition","fields":{"headline":"Atwood responds to book bans with ‘unburnable’ edition of Handmaid’s Tale","trailText":"Auction of fire-resistant edition comes ahead of an expected US supreme court ruling reversing the right to abortion","body":"<p>Amid political firestorms over books deemed by rightwingers to be unsuitable for school libraries, the author Margaret Atwood has announced an “unburnable” edition of her most famous novel, The Handmaid’s Tale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2022/feb/19/margaret-atwood-on-feminism-culture-wars\">Margaret Atwood on feminism, culture wars and speaking her mind: ‘I’m very willing to listen, but not to be scammed’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Canadian author, 82, appeared in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpsMsAMY4eM\">a short YouTube video</a> to announce the project, attempting to flambé the one-off tome with a flame-thrower.</p> <p>Announcing the book, Penguin Random House <a href=\"https://unburnablebook.com/\">said</a>: “Across the United States and around the world, books are being challenged, banned and even burned.

No mean feat for a plant that was the first to be spun into a useable fibre, which was used by the Egyptians to move rocks when they built the pyramids, and by Christopher Columbus to make sails to travel the New World.</p> <p><a href=\"https://ministryofhemp.com/hemp/history/\">By the 1700s, American farmers were legally required to grow it,</a> such was hemp’s uses and benefits. A combination of lobbying by the petrochemical, pulp-paper and nylon industries, all of whom stood to lose billions if the commercial potential of hemp was realised, combined with drug hysteria over cannabis, caused it to fall from favour in the 20th century, particularly in America. By the mid-1980s the only two hemp products you could buy legally in the US were Hungarian twine and sterilised bird seed.</p> <p>Today, companies have started to reengage with hemp’s potential.

With no dyes and no treatments, you’re looking at a new way of creating the colour white by using the inside of the plant itself.”</p> <p>Other hemp pioneers are <a href=\"https://www.energytech.com/energy-storage/article/21177341/will-hemp-make-ev-batteries-better\">looking to make batteries for electric vehicles</a> from the material, and <a href=\"https://hempplastic.com/\">alternatives to petrochemical plastics</a> have been made with the plant’s fibres and resin, which can be used to make everything from car doors to musical instruments.

The dictionary includes the 10 most widely spoken languages in London.</p> <p>“My hope is that visitors will draw connections between climate and culture in ways they may not often consider,” explains Lee, “to ask how their own ways of thinking about the weather may be shared, or might sometimes be untranslatable to other people who speak other languages. And, of course, to simply step back and think about the weather intimately, as something that moves us and connects us bodily and culturally.”</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/a-thousand-words-for-weather/\" title=\"A Thousand Words for Weather - booking link\">A Thousand Words for Weather</a> opens at Senate House Library on 22 June and will run until spring 2023 to capture all the seasons</em> <br></p> <p><strong>The flatpack furniture that makes itself</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cc46b97d05607a010171d21d9e01fdc146072f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cc46b97d05607a010171d21d9e01fdc146072f3/1497_1226_6416_3850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The HygroShape chaise-longue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The HygroShape self-assembling chaise-longue</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HydroShape</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you hate putting flatpack furniture together, then this new project from a team at the University of Stuttgart’s Institute for Computational Design and Construction is for you. HygroShape furniture basically assembles itself, thanks to the natural properties of the European maple wood used for construction. Their launch products – a lounger and a chaise-longue rocker – arrive flat but once unpacked, the wood starts to dry out and curl into shape, thanks to the team’s meticulous computational design.</p> <p>The prototypes are currently in development, with company Hylo Tech working on furniture design but also building components that work with the qualities of the wood in a streamlined and efficient way.</p> <p>“The biggest potential for the self-shaping technology is that we can embed the action of physical shaping directly into the material,” says the very aptly named Dylan Wood, one of the team behind HygroShape and Hylo Tech. “As a result we don’t need noisy machines, tools, labor or complicated instructions to assemble the pieces.</p> <p>“This might seem cool for furniture, but we are already developing larger scale applications. Think building components such as roofs, columns, or entire houses that shape silently without construction workers or cranes. The larger and more complicated the parts get the more useful our material programming approach becomes.”</p> <p><strong>The art of mending, creating and caring</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f690cf5d2242b3f9c941994157bcedb9b77ddd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f690cf5d2242b3f9c941994157bcedb9b77ddd7/0_225_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Studio Propolis.

Covering everything from textiles and ceramics to furniture, Eternally Yours showcases traditional repair and reuse methods, such as the Japanese art of Kintsugi and the African American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/dec/10/gees-bend-african-american-art-met\">Gee Bend quilts</a>, alongside contemporary artists focused on craft. Also on view is the Beasley Brother’s Repair Shop, created by designer Carl Clerkin. It’s modelled on traditional east end repair shops which claimed to be able to mend anything. During the course of the exhibition, Beasley Brothers will run workshops and demonstrations of DIY and skills training.</p> <p>The clothes and homeware brand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/sep/12/raise-a-glass-toast-is-relaunching-menswear\">Toast</a> will also take part in the show, providing workshops and mending consultations by artists such as Celia Pym and Ekta Kaul.</p> <p>We wanted to support Eternally Yours this summer to shine a spotlight on the challenges facing the fashion industry,” says Toast’s CEO Suzie de Rohan Willner. “As an industry, we need to get to a point where extending the life of the things we own is the norm, as nearly every flaw in the system can be traced back to overproduction and overconsumption.

Laws imposed on the country in a public health emergency were flouted at the centre of government and the person ultimately responsible – the prime minister; lawmaker number one – was himself a lawbreaker. When asked about it in parliament, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/01/boris-johnson-forget-partygate-resigning-matter-democracy-peril-leaders-lie\">he lied</a>.</p> <p>That much has been known for months. Johnson’s reprobate character has been displayed for years. That makes two categories of Tory MP. There are those who were truly appalled when they realised their leader was a scoundrel, and those who never objected to his malpractice on moral grounds, but worry that it is an electoral liability.</p> <p>If the first group were large enough to force their leader’s resignation, they would have done it already. The second group has enough data to infer that the Tory majority might be imperilled if Johnson leads his party into a general election, but no way of being sure. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/17/north-shropshire-byelection-liberal-democrats-say-they-will-win-comfortably-as-count-continues\">Byelection defeats</a>, opinion polls and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2022/may/05/elections-2022-results-live-local-council-england-scotland-wales\">lost council seats</a> prove that voters are unhappy now, but there is always the possibility they will cheer up again.</p> <p>Besides, there is no substitute leader with talents obvious enough to make ditching the incumbent a low-risk gamble. The stakes feel higher as the next election gets nearer. Also, postponing action against Johnson reinforces the impression that he is a master political escapologist. It is a feedback loop: Tory MPs quail before the difficult decision and narrate that cowardice as evidence of their leader’s uncanny knack for survival.</p> <p>Their weakness is his strength, as it has been all along. Johnson won the leadership in 2019 because Conservatives were panic-stricken and demoralised. The party had come <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/eu-elections-tories-and-labour-savaged-as-voters-take-brexit-revenge\">fifth in European elections</a>, taking just under 9% of the vote. The threat posed by Nigel Farage’s Brexit party felt existential. MPs who had previously sworn to obstruct Johnson’s ambitions to be leader, either because they had been personally wronged by him or just observed that he was a wrong’un, decided instead that he was their only hope of salvation.</p> <p>That choice was rewarded at the ballot box, and reluctance to re-evaluate it is the prop supporting the prime minister today. It might hold him in place right through to the next election, not from any realistic expectation of another massive victory or sentimental loyalty, but because the whole point of following Johnson was to avoid confronting questions that his removal would raise all over again. He is protected by dread of seeing the cracks, the crumbling plasterwork, the mould and damp that the vivid “Boris” candidacy papered over.</p> <p>There are glimpses of it in every corner, where the paper has already come unstuck. The government has no response to the cost of living crisis because the prime minister and the chancellor cannot agree on who should get help, when and how it should be funded. There are Downing Street advisers who say a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/23/windfall-tax-which-cabinet-ministers-are-for-and-against-it\">windfall tax </a>on energy companies would be “unconservative”, which is to interpret conservatism narrowly as a creed for government as protector of corporate profits, indifferent to poverty.</p> <p>That is one definition, but British history affords others that include intervention in social crises. There was also once a kind of conservatism that cared about conserving things; observing the rules and conventions that are supposed to keep government honest. There was, until recently, a conservatism that recognised the rule of law as a foundation of democracy and recognised the intrinsic villainy in politicians who excuse themselves from the rules they impose on little people.</p> <p>Now the Tories are led by such a man. The choice to continue under his leadership is also existential. The longer they enable a form of government that recognises no principle higher than the prime minister’s entitlement to power, the harder it gets to explain what other values the party represents.</p> <p>There was a moment earlier this year when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/boris-johnson-attended-leaving-do-during-strict-january-lockdown\">weight of public outrage</a> over lockdown parties was crushing the political life out of Johnson, but Tory MPs failed to finish him off. With that stay of execution they declared that it was not ethically wrong for a prime minister to cheat and lie in office, only unwise to get caught and only then for as long as opinion polls say so. If polls can change, wrong can become right. <br><br>It is too late now to go back to the point of principle. If Conservative MPs sack Johnson they would have to give a reason, and if the offence is dishonesty they must describe the lie. Where does that end? It is the stray thread that can’t be pulled for fear of unravelling the whole shoddy weave. Perhaps there are enough Conservatives with the courage to do it, if not over this scandal then the next one. Johnson certainly can’t be shamed into resignation, but that shamelessness is contagious. It is the source of resilience that makes Tories believe their current leader has powers that no other candidate could match. And once they have indulged that thought, they become unable to judge whether the absence of conscience in a prime minister is reason to sack him or back him.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/may/24/shell-pause-london-agm-protesters-oil-gas-green","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T14:40:19Z","webTitle":"Three arrested at Shell AGM as protesters chant ‘We will stop you’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/shell-pause-london-agm-protesters-oil-gas-green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/24/shell-pause-london-agm-protesters-oil-gas-green","fields":{"headline":"Three arrested at Shell AGM as protesters chant ‘We will stop you’","trailText":"Environmental activists accuse firm’s board of spending more on green ads than green technology","body":"<p>Three people have been arrested after Shell was forced to pause its annual general meeting in London after it was interrupted by environmental protesters chanting: “We will stop you.”</p> \n<p>About 40 climate protesters attending the event as shareholders told the oil and gas company’s board: “We will expose you.

Wokeness has already <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/feb/15/woke-teachers-want-shakespeare-cut-curriculum-abou/\">culled the dead white man</a> from American curriculums, we are told, so surely it won’t be long until we follow suit. Right?</p> <p>But the inconvenient truth – which isn’t quite so headline-worthy – is that decolonising the curriculum isn’t about burning copies of Macbeth, or chucking Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations in the bin. It’s not even about only studying writers from marginalised identities. As a mixed-race English teacher who believes strongly in diversifying the English syllabus, for me, it’s about re-examining the lens through which we view canonical texts in the first place – shifting it to become more critical, more aware of the systemic forces at play both within and around a text. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/jul/21/schools-minister-rebuffs-calls-to-decolonise-english-curriculum\">Decolonisation</a> may sound radical, frightening even to some, but this is what great English teaching already does.</p> <p>So much of Shakespeare is about power: who holds it and who doesn’t and why. And this is the fundamental question of our divided and troubled age. Examination of gender is critical to studying Romeo and Juliet<em>. </em>The portrayal of race is fundamental in analysing Othello<em>. </em>Grappling with the antisemitism in the portrayals of Shakespeare’s Shylock or Dickens’ Fagin is key. Decolonising the study of Shakespeare is to take these questions one step further, removing them from the text and applying them to the world around us. To teach students, through literature, to challenge the status quo.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/22/uks-strictest-headmistress-fears-schools-will-stop-teaching-shakespeare\">UK’s ‘strictest headmistress’ fears schools will stop teaching Shakespeare</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some people claim that educating students of colour about structural racism, or pupils from impoverished backgrounds about systemic inequality is defeatist: it teaches children to accept their subjugated position. But we do a disservice to young people if we fail to recognise that these structural disadvantages already hit them in the face as soon as they leave the school gates – and often before. Young black boys <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/15/black-boy-in-stop-and-search-30-times-accuses-met-police-of-racist-profiling\">stopped by police</a> in their school uniforms; pupils whose families can’t afford food; children whose parents are facing the wrath of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile environment</a>. These young people don’t need to be taught that injustice exists because they see the results of systemic prejudice all around them – they are drowning in the impact of divisive and discriminatory policies. By refusing to acknowledge this, we neglect the chance to empower students to examine the power dynamics that dictate our world. To eventually enact change. Call me a biased English teacher, but literature is the perfect medium for this.</p> <p>The conflation of blackness with violence in Othello forms a platform to scrutinise systemic racism in Britain today – how white supremacy manifests and how this shapes pupils’ lives. The way Macbeth usurps authority is arguably a metaphor for the way some groups in society maintain a stranglehold of control over others – why not use this as an opportunity to question those in power, and even to examine our own positions?</p> <p>Undoubtedly, part of decolonising the curriculum must be about introducing texts written by alternative voices. Teaching students that our historical notion of what a celebrated text should look like is steeped in politics and colonialism, and that, in fact, many great works of literature were written by marginalised voices enables them to relate to literature in a new way. Those concerned that Shakespeare is about to be <a href=\"https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/my-pupils-need-mozart-not-stormzy-innit/\">replaced by Stormzy</a> on GCSE papers worry that we undersell pupils by teaching literature they can relate to. But this assumes that books by multi-ethnic writers are inherently deficient in some way. Studying outstanding classics such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/08/small-island-andrea-levy-bookclub\">Small Island</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview20\">Brick Lane</a> would not only expose my pupils to literary excellence and compelling narrative, but it would enhance their knowledge of British history, revealing perspectives that Shakespeare and Dickens lack.</p> <p>Unless you’ve experienced it, it’s hard to put into words how it feels to meet yourself in a book for the first time. The first time I did, I was an A-level student faced with Othello, whose contested “Moorish” background was the closest to my north African heritage I’d ever encountered on the page. And who did I meet? A man whose violence was likened to a wild beast and whose race rendered him a savage, a danger to white women. A person who faced such racism that it became internalised in his own self-perception. I wish I had met myself in literature earlier, but it’s made me determined to make sure my own students do. After all, white men get to see themselves in almost everything they read and watch.</p> <p>There is no woke mob vying for copies of Hamlet to be ripped up, or jostling for editions of King Lear to be destroyed, just English teachers like me doing what we can to supplement a tragically myopic curriculum. Decolonising the curriculum offers students the valuable chance not just to see themselves on the page, but to examine and question the historic structures that dictate their lives today.</p> <p>Besides, dead white men have a habit of sticking around for centuries.

Writing them, he adds, is “the only way I know how to love them”.</p> <p>That love shows. As an ode to family, We Started to Sing is full of tenderness. As a play, it feels fragmented and anticlimactic. There is simply not enough plot or conflict. Maybe it is too close to home; what seems to be missing is Graham Greene’s “splinter of ice”.</p> <p>Scenes are infused with affection but there is no substantially darker, sharper side to his characters. And whatever family tensions there are between them are subsumed by greater warmth. That, in the end, is the problem with this delicately crafted play, which seems like a series of sweet or poignant scenes.</p> <p>Also directed by Norris, its pace is meditative but undramatic despite instances that seem almost to veer towards an alternate reality – characters freeze or reach out theatrically and atmospheric music raises expectations – but nothing comes of it.</p> <p>Grandparents Bert (Robin Soans) and Peggy (Barbara Flynn) remember the war at the start and recount how they met. Their musician son, David (David Ricardo-Pearce), occasionally rolls his eyes but his wife, Fiona (Naomi Petersen) listens raptly. There is piano playing, red wine and conviviality.</p> <p>Each scene brings a jump in time: Fiona and David separate, a new partner comes along in Rob (George Taylor), children grow up, grandparents die. Characters speak of ageing and mortality but this cannot make up for the lack of story and neither is it particularly profound.</p> <p>There is one fractious scene that stands out when David and Fiona, now separated, discuss their son Barney’s bad behaviour. Fiona explodes with resentment and this flashpoint sparks with tension and intensity. More of this is required but we are quickly back to placid scenes.</p> <p>There are many beautiful qualities to this production, nevertheless. The visually arresting back-screens that project family films (video design is by Megan Lucas). Atmospheric musical interludes that include a cello concerto by Elgar arranged for the piano, and a rendition of Dido’s Lament by Purcell. A powerful scene that shows Bert scared and irascible towards the end of his life. Memories that are shown to be tied to geography – streets and houses that become receptacles, maybe even proof, of past lives. There is an acute observation of English manners and emotional repression, too, with much tea-drinking and talking about the weather. These exchanges capture all that can’t be said and feel distinctly English.</p> <p>Later mentions of Barney, who remains off stage, brings meta moments: Peggy says he is “writing us” and characters look around, momentarily conscious of being inside a play. Bert adds that this drama is about people who sit around and one of them dies – which feels apt as a summary for what we see on stage.</p> <ul> <li><p>We Started to Sing is at the <a href=\"https://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/we-started-to-sing/\">Arcola, London</a>, until 18 June.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/may/24/corrina-corrina-review-everyman-liverpool-chloe-moss","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T14:05:42Z","webTitle":"Corrina, Corrina review – onboard battle gets lost at sea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/24/corrina-corrina-review-everyman-liverpool-chloe-moss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/may/24/corrina-corrina-review-everyman-liverpool-chloe-moss","fields":{"headline":"Corrina, Corrina review – onboard battle gets lost at sea","trailText":"Chloë Moss’s play about a female officer who joins an all-male crew on a cargo ship skims the surface of its issues","body":"<p>If you wanted to map the contours of the patriarchy, a container ship would be a pretty good place to do it.

When motivation is in short supply, putting them into action is another thing<br>","body":"<p>I’ve been having strange symptoms for six months. Doctors are confused, I’m struggling to sleep and my anxiety is through the roof. Honestly, you should see the state of my 2am Googles. Normal, healthy searches, eg “Petite Lithuanian supply teacher tells you you’re failing” has been replaced by “Are palpitations a sign of a heart attack?” and “When is a skin rash definitely cancer?” Anxiety feels like being in a constant state of fear, and that’s tiring. If only I could sleep. In addition to health worry there is the what-if-I-can’t-pay-my-bills worry, relationships worry, does-everyone-hate-me worry, have-I-failed-at-life worry. I tell them to wait in line, I’ll get to them all.</p> <p>I don’t get this from my mother. She is a dreamer who doesn’t worry about a thing, whose mantra is “go with the flow!” More likely it’s from my late father – a man who believed whatever “go” was, it was flowing towards ruin. I have memories of him moving tiny amounts of money around every day, taking out every insurance policy he could, controlling his diet with rigour. Like him, I am convinced that around every corner hides a catastrophe. Unlike him, I take no practical steps to meet it, so I suppose I’m an unfortunate combination of them both.</p> <p>There’s no shortage of advice on what to do about anxiety. The last decade has seen an explosion in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/healthmindandbody\" title=\"\">mental health books</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/podcasts\">podcasts</a> and self-care articles. Yet it’s hard to overstate how irrelevant all of this feels in the jaws of an anxiety attack. You have to find a way to access sense within panic, and think about your thinking. This requires discipline, and immense self-motivation. When your chest feels crushed and your heart is hammering, no one can breathe for you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a17ffae33ec56bbe4fd6d322a33610fe4abb847\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a17ffae33ec56bbe4fd6d322a33610fe4abb847/1113_1063_1911_2389/800.jpg\" alt=\"Exercise does help … but Rhik Samadder still finds himself opting not to go for a run.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exercise does help … but Rhik Samadder still finds himself opting not to go for a run.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have tried <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/04/it-gave-me-an-ability-to-enjoy-life-readers-on-cognitive-behavioural-therapy\" title=\"\">CBT</a>. Many people are put off, anticipating a long waiting list. I found the NHS was good at staying in touch during the wait, though, recommending drop-in groups and reading material. Reading is good in a spiral, because it forces you to slow down and focus. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/manage-your-mind-9780198747277\" title=\"\">Manage Your Mind</a> by Gillian Butler, Nick Grey and Tony Hope taught me to identify the biases that characterise anxiety. Their “crooked thinking” list includes such gems as catastrophising, overgeneralising, mind reading, fortune telling AKA predicting the future, black-and-white thinking, taking things personally, taking the blame, emotional reasoning, and wishful thinking. Sound familiar? Mind reading and fortune telling may seem like carnival options, but are actually the worst fun.</p> <p>There is a psychological technique known as “distancing” that I also find helpful. It is any way of looking at your situation more objectively , putting your problems into perspective. It is the reason that being told “you’ll laugh about this one day”, or “no one cares about you, they have their own problems” or “in 100 years it won’t matter” are oddly reassuring. Our crises are local and ultimately trivial. The terrors we rehearse don’t happen, and even if they do, this too shall pass.</p> <p>Apart from CBT, the usual practical stuff works. Nutritious food, regular sleep and exercise; seeing friends, tidying up, doing things I’m good at. Yada, yada, yada. But the shameful thing is that I frequently find myself not going for a run and still failing to feed myself properly. Why am I sluggish to take steps I know will help? The thing is, when you’re exhausted, trapped by intrusive, repetitive worry, it is hard to julienne a carrot. It doesn’t feel necessary for survival in the moment. </p> <p>The only answer I’ve found is to set the bar ridiculously low. Just as when I’m faced with the anxiety of a blank page, and tell myself I need only write 200 words. That’s easy, and there’s always 200 more behind those. I need a low barrier of entry, and a sense of achievement. I know it is a good idea to leave the house every day, but what if I’m too stressed? I have a rule that I will at least go downstairs to check the post, and open the front door. Once there it is more than likely I’ll walk to the park, but that’s not the threshold of success. It is opening the door, or 200 words, or eating one green thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f736c1c768adf71f12d803f0c99ad97d5b8ab7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f736c1c768adf71f12d803f0c99ad97d5b8ab7a/670_729_5308_3185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Setting the bar low … the first 200 words is the hardest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Setting the bar low … the first 200 words is the hardest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Social anxiety is a stickier one, but even here it is possible to take the pressure off. When attending parties, I remind myself for what and whom I’m going – usually the person who invited me. It’s not my job to be scintillating, simply to show that person I care enough to make an effort. They are always grateful for the numbers. Have you got a hot date, but forgotten how to hold a human conversation? Try admitting your worry out loud. It’s probable the other person will relate, and you’ll both relax. Two nervous lizard people just trying to get by. We’re all a mess.</p> <p>Baby steps help us to stay motivated. That’s why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/12/fit-in-my-40s-what-next-after-couch-to-5k-app\" title=\"\">Couch to 5K</a> is so popular. I ran some impressive times during the first lockdown, but by the third was sedentary, having individual biscuits delivered to my door. This trajectory – which I call “5K to couch” – was dispiriting and made me give up, in a fit of all-or-nothing pique. But I’ve taken the pressure off myself now.</p> <p>Perhaps my low-pressure, micro-goals philosophy is laughable to people who self-motivate in cold showers at dawn. More power to them. We all start from where we are. I know how easy it is for self-care to become another thing to fail at. If I can’t run today because of my heart, I’ll walk. It’s still moving my body, still showing up and doing my best.</p> <p>Mostly though, avoid the late-night Googles.

Sad to say, it goes down like a cup of tepid, milky and over-sugared tea.</p> <p>Michell’s previous cinema documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/06/nothing-like-a-dame-review-enjoyable-documentary\">Nothing Like a Dame</a>, about Britain’s brilliant theatrical dames, had been full of fun. This is merely reverent. There is no original material: the film is stitched together from existing footage, all of which is very familiar, but the found-footage approach (which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/27/diego-and-maradona-were-two-different-people\">Asif Kapadia used so intimately and vividly with Diego Maradona</a> and Amy Winehouse) now looks like a retread. We go through the reign from its early days to her majesty’s situation now, finally going back for a sombre reflection on the death and funeral of George VI, presumably in acknowledgement of the fact that another sad event may unfortunately be on the way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKpdlHwHmMo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gKpdlHwHmMo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Michell’s film touches on almost every single important event, placing due emphasis on the Commonwealth to which the Queen attaches such importance, but occasionally talking about the National Front and racists to pre-empt charges of naivety. There are clips of Claire Foy and Olivia Colman in Netflix’s The Crown and also Prunella Scales playing the Queen in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/31/alan-bennett-lady-in-the-van-film-interview\">Alan Bennett’s A Question of Attribution</a> – these fictional versions supplying the private wit and wisdom that we long to witness in the real Queen, but can’t.</p> <p>The film also goes through the “horribilis” rows that the Queen went through in the early 90s, though no mention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/17/the-crown-magic-mushrooms-and-the-truth-behind-michael-fagans-palace-break-in\">Michael Fagan</a>, who broke into her bedroom a decade before. And the interview in which Prince Andrew claimed not to be able to sweat is duly included. But there was evidently no time to feature the Duke of Edinburgh’s death – a very odd omission – or the Queen’s startling and surely controversial decision to let Andrew guide her by the arm at the memorial service in church, signalling a forgiveness that many in the country do not share.

However, levying additional taxes on businesses directly investing in renewable generation feels contradictory to the UK’s desire for greater energy independence and a greener power system that can help to deliver a net zero economy.</p> <p>“The government has other tools which it could use to both raise funds to help tackle the cost of living crisis and encourage greater investment in the UK’s green economy, such as encouraging the crown estate to unlock more seabed for offshore wind.” </p> <p>The Investec analyst Martin Young was also sceptical about the idea.

The spectre of intervention, however, could weigh on the generators.”</p> <p>The Bernstein analyst Deepa Venkateswaran was sceptical about the £10bn excess profit figure. She said: “We believe that the Treasury has grossly overstated the potential take from a windfall tax on renewable generators and shaken investor confidence in the sector, as can be seen from the share price reaction today, which we believe is an overreaction.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/may/24/our-time-on-earth-review-barbican-curve-gallery-london","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T13:50:39Z","webTitle":"Our Time on Earth review – ear-splitting obstacle course of barmy solutions to the climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/24/our-time-on-earth-review-barbican-curve-gallery-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/may/24/our-time-on-earth-review-barbican-curve-gallery-london","fields":{"headline":"Our Time on Earth review – ear-splitting obstacle course of barmy solutions to the climate crisis","trailText":"Whether pondering dinner with pests, reinventing myself as a vegetable or being deafened by a waterfall that sounded like industrial machinery, this hectic show made me want to flee","body":"<p>“Breathe,” whispers the disembodied voice in the darkened threshold to the Barbican’s Curve gallery. “Just one breath, shared by all living things.” The air we breathe comes from sea creatures and trees, it tells me, with a sort of irksome intimacy. Beyond the heavy curtain, the air is filled with sounds and furies, the cawing of a stuffed crow, the sound of a heavy downpour, a distant clamour of voices. It is a cacophony in there, with mutterings, corporate-speak and sound effects. The din is putting me on edge. All the fungi in the soil, the springtails, centipedes and millipedes, the mycelium, sugar nutrients, ants and earthworms, the plankton in the seas and the insects in the air are having a hard time, too.</p> <p>Filled with sometimes radical, sometimes nonsensical speculations about how we may reverse the appalling and seemingly irreversible impact of human activity on our planet, the Barbican’s <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2022/event/our-time-on-earth\">Our Time on Earth</a> offers a number of visions of how the world might look, and how we might also change, if we are to rethink our place in the world. One of the tasks the show takes upon itself is to raise our consciousness, less to inform us how bad things are, but more to recalibrate our sense of interconnectedness to the natural world.</p> <p>My own time on Earth is bad enough, without all the magical thinking. Some of the solutions proposed here, to share our dining table with pests as well as pets,, appear risible. Some smaller changes, such as making fabrics and building materials in more ecologically and environmentally sound and sustainable ways, are undoubtedly a good thing. But for all the talk of spiritual awareness and wise nature, Our Time on Earth is a physical as well as metaphorical – never mind spiritual – obstacle course. The guest curators, Caroline Till and Kate Franklin, run “a futures research agency working with global brands and organisations to explore and implement design, material and colour innovation”.

Hugely enlarged 3D scans of different species of plankton hove into view, floating in what I take to be a soup of microplastics.

They are the same people, of course, who wail about the “politics of envy” if the booming salaries of millionaire bosses are questioned. But the wages of train drivers are an advertisement <em>for</em> striking, not against. By taking industrial action – rather than being resigned to their lot – drivers have succeeded in driving up their pay.</p> <p>The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has pleaded for workers to exercise “pay restraint”: an easy demand to make when you’re paid half a million each year, rather than say a care worker on £17,000, nearly 30 times less. However, surging prices have not been caused by rising wages, but by supply chain issues in China, rising energy costs and companies taking home windfall profits.</p> <p>The response of workers to a crisis imposed upon them should not be stoic acceptance of their lot. We’ve had, regrettably, far too much of that. According to the High Pay Centre, the median CEO is paid <a href=\"https://highpaycentre.org/high-pay-centre-analysis-of-ftse-350-pay-ratios/\">111 times more</a> than the lowest-paid worker. We spend tens of billions of pounds a year on in-work benefits and personal debt has ballooned to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/929a4297-7517-432c-85a3-6616b45e8fe1\">unprecedented levels</a>.</p> <p>Workers who are unionised benefit from a so-called “wage premium” of between <a href=\"https://www.niesr.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bryson-IZA-5.pdf\">10% and 15%</a>, while the pay of non-unionised workers is dragged upwards by trade unions, too. The government doesn’t lack tools to fi​​x the cost of living crisis, such as hiking the minimum wage and social security entitlements, but strengthening unions is a no-brainer. After all, does anyone really think that countries such as Sweden – where nearly <a href=\"https://www.worker-participation.eu/National-Industrial-Relations/Countries/Sweden/Collective-Bargaining\">nine in 10 workers</a> are covered by collective bargaining agreement, and where living standards are substantially higher than our own – are economic disasters?</p> <p>Expect an escalating media blitz against the unions. Ours is a society in which working-class people are demonised for being too weak – for supposedly languishing in poverty because of a lack of aspiration; and for being too strong – for daring to fight for a just share of the wealth they create with their hard graft.</p> <p>Yes, strikes are inconvenient, but is a day of disruption a more painful intrusion into millions of lives than leaving working people without enough money to pay their bills or feed their families?</p> <p>If an example is to be made of Britain’s train drivers, it should be that they provide inspiration for workers to fight back. Low pay is a scandal and a national emergency, and it can be addressed if workers have the strength to demand what is rightfully theirs. If train drivers have the courage to reject collapsing pay, then so, surely, should a workforce that has resigned itself to stagnation and decline for far too long.</p> <p>• Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development/2022/may/24/male-afghan-tv-presenters-mask-up-to-support-female-colleagues-after-taliban-decree","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T13:46:14Z","webTitle":"Male Afghan TV presenters mask up to support female colleagues after Taliban decree","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/24/male-afghan-tv-presenters-mask-up-to-support-female-colleagues-after-taliban-decree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/may/24/male-afghan-tv-presenters-mask-up-to-support-female-colleagues-after-taliban-decree","fields":{"headline":"Male Afghan TV presenters mask up to support female colleagues after Taliban decree","trailText":"#FreeHerFace campaign gathers force as high-profile men rebel against crackdown on face coverings in Afghanistan","body":"<p>Male TV presenters in Afghanistan are wearing face masks on screen to show solidarity after the Taliban issued an order that all women on news channels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/22/taliban-enforce-face-coverings-afghanistan-female-tv-news-presenters\">must cover their faces</a>.</p> <p>In a protest dubbed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/freeherface?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FreeHerFace</a> on social media, men on Tolo News wore masks to mimic the effect of the face veil their female colleagues have been forced to wear after a Taliban crackdown.</p> <p>The Taliban’s Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ordered all Afghan media outlets to use masks for female presenters.

It is very difficult to read the news with a mask.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d3022c0ac1700e237a131f69f7b275f76dac9e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d3022c0ac1700e237a131f69f7b275f76dac9e3/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khatira Ahmadi, an Afghan presenter at Tolo TV reads news wearing a mask, Kabul, Afghanistan, 23 May 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khatira Ahmadi, an Afghan presenter at Tolo TV reads news wearing a mask, Kabul, Afghanistan, 23 May 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A 29-year-old male anchor on a private television channel, who did not want to be named due to security concerns, told the Guardian he and other male colleagues had put on masks to work in the past two days. When the Taliban order reached their office, he said, female colleagues were clearly dispirited. “Performing while wearing a mask is very annoying,” he said. “When I perform with a mask, I feel like someone has grabbed me by the throat and I cannot speak.”</p> <p>He said he and his colleagues will continue to protest until the Taliban reconsider their decision.</p> <p>In an interview with CNN, former Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, among others, called on female presenters to defy the Taliban order and not wear masks. The Taliban’s official Twitter account replied to Karzai: “In the past two decades, Mr Karzai wanted any kind of freedom for the Afghan sisters and paving the way for the freedoms to make foreigners happy, but his wife did not appear in any media as she wanted for the rest of Afghans.”</p> <p>The Ministry of the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice has announced that wearing a hijab is “necessary”, and the best type is the burqa and the black Arab hijab.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/08/afghanistan-face-veil-decree-lost-my-right-choose-clothes-taliban\">Afghanistan face veil decree: ‘I’ve lost the right to choose my clothes’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the new order, in the first instance of the order being disobeyed the Taliban will advise and guide unveiled woman; as a second step summon her; the third step is three days’ imprisonment.

It’s a great act. It’s one of the few instances where Afghan men are doing something symbolic because all the resistance and protests against the veil so far has been by women.</p> <p>“The question is would they wear a hijab? Would they cover themselves in a burqa if they were asked to? But how far will you go? The whole country wearing the burqa?And what do we do with that anger and emotion? Where does it take us?

Meanwhile, the seven-term Oregon congressman Kurt Schrader, whose conservative politics drew the left’s ire, appears to be on the verge of losing his seat to progressive challenger Jamie McLeod-Skinner, though results have been delayed by a ballot-printing problem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/24/primary-elections-texas-georgia-midterms-voting-trump-live\">US primary elections: voters to test Trump’s power over Republican party – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And in what will be one of the cycle’s most competitive Senate races, John Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s iconoclastic, liberal lieutenant governor, beat Congressman Conor Lamb, a rising star of the center-left.</p> <p>The next test of progressive political power comes on Tuesday, in a Texas runoff election between Congressman Henry Cueller, a conservative Democrat backed by party leadership, and Jessica Cisneros, a progressive immigration lawyer endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. And after that, there are competitive intra-party primaries in Illinois, New York and Michigan.</p> <p>“We’re not doing any victory laps,” Mitchell said. “If anything, those losses and the wins have redoubled our commitment and focus.”</p> <p>Moderates see the cycle very differently.</p> <p>They point to a trio of House races last week in North Carolina and Kentucky where the more moderate candidate won handily. Those victories came just two weeks after the Democratic congresswoman Shontel Brown won a fiercely contested rematch in Ohio against Nina Turner, a progressive activist who worked on Sanders’ presidential campaigns.</p> <p>“People who are far outside the mainstream of the Democratic conference make it harder for moderates to run in swing districts because their ideas and their rhetoric are used against people like Abigail Spanberger,” said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of the center-left thinktank Third Way, referring to the Virginia congresswoman who singled out progressives for costing the party seats in 2020.</p> <p>Bennett said it was important to distinguish between progressives. He argued that candidates who are “liberal but not radical”, such as McLeod-Skinner in Oregon, pose little risk to swing-state Democrats.</p> <p>Instead, “we are worried about the Squad”, Bennett said, the group of progressive congresswomen that includes Ocasio-Cortez, “because the people in that wing of the party do not regard it as part of their duty as Democrats to help ensure that we have majorities”.</p> <p>It’s a charge that angers progressives. Following Sanders’ lead in 2020, they united behind Biden to oust Donald Trump in 2020 and then spent the past year and a half working with congressional leaders and the White House to pass the president’s economic agenda. And yet progressives are the ones being pummeled by outside spending.</p> <p>A number of contentious Democratic contests have been shaped by Super Pacs, like the one formed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, known as Aipac, another supported by the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and another backed by a crypto-billionaire.</p> <p>Much – though not all – of the outside money has been spent in support of moderate candidates, including in Texas, where Cuellar, the nine-term congressman, is in the fight of his political life.</p> <p>“This is a David-and-Goliath sort of battle,” Mitchell said.</p> <p>The rash of spending has only exacerbated tensions between the party’s ideological factions. In a sign of progressives’ building resentment, Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ former campaign manager, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2022/05/19/the-primary-battles-of-dems-uncivil-war-00033632\">warned</a> that progressives could launch third-party candidates in swing districts to scuttle centrist Democrats’ chances.</p> <p>The suggestion infuriated Bennett, who called it the “most irresponsible thing I’ve seen a Democrat say … maybe ever, particularly in the face of a Republican party that has lost its ever-loving mind.”</p> <p>Though still early in the primary season, progressives appear poised to expand their numbers in Congress. Still, not every closely fought intra-party battle has fallen neatly along ideological lines.</p> <p>Oregon’s Schrader, a former leader of the conservative Blue Dog coalition, angered Democrats in the state after his vote against a provision that would allow Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs. Local Democratic leaders voted to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/oregon-national-dems-battle-house-primary-support-rcna25934\">endorse</a> his challenger, McLeod-Skinner, sharply breaking with tradition.</p> <p>In Texas, however, the battle lines are clearly drawn.</p> <p>Pundits there think the south Texas runoff between Cuellar and Cisneros will prove to be a bellwether of the Democratic mood in a political landscape that increasingly favors Republicans. Democrats have razor-thin majorities in Congress, and the party in power historically loses in the president’s first midterm election.</p> <p>Democrats are also struggling to outrun Biden’s low approval ratings, weighed down by inflation and widespread frustration with Washington.</p> <p>Since Cisneros forced Cuellar into a runoff earlier this year, the race has been reshaped by a draft supreme court opinion indicating the justices are prepared to overturn a constitutional right to an abortion.</p> <p>Cuellar is one of the only Democrats left in Congress who is against abortion. Cisneros, by contrast, has cast herself as a defender of reproductive rights in a state that has effectively banned abortion.</p> <p>They have also clashed on immigration. Whereas Cuellar staunchly criticizes the Biden administration’s immigration policies, appearing frequently on Fox News to air his grievances with the president’s handling of the border, Cisneros has advocated for a more progressive stance in that sector.</p> <p>No matter what happens on Tuesday in Texas, progressives believe they have made progress elevating candidates they say will excite the party’s base in November.</p> <p>In Kentucky, long a Republican stronghold, Democrats nominated Charles Booker, an unabashedly progressive ex-state lawmaker who would be the state’s first black senator. It’s a shift from two years ago, when he surprised the party establishment by nearly defeating its chosen candidate in the Senate primary that cycle.</p> <p>Booker now faces an uphill battle to unseat the entrenched Republican senator Rand Paul. But he says his progressive Kentucky New Deal agenda is popular with voters of both parties. It’s the partisan labels and political culture wars that get in the way.</p> <p>“The truth of the matter is, the people of Kentucky want real progress,” Booker said. “It’s just that no one listens to us.</p> <p>“The policies that I lift up, the issues that I fight for, they’re not radical and they don’t come from some national consultant. This comes from my lived experience of living the struggle that most Kentuckians know well.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/may/24/universities-told-crack-down-spiking-brazen-attacks-students","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T13:02:12Z","webTitle":"Universities told to crack down on spiking after ‘brazen’ attacks on students","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/24/universities-told-crack-down-spiking-brazen-attacks-students","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/may/24/universities-told-crack-down-spiking-brazen-attacks-students","fields":{"headline":"Universities told to crack down on spiking after ‘brazen’ attacks on students","trailText":"Universities minister launches working group to spearhead plans for practical action to help keep students safe","body":"<p>Universities are to be required to introduce policies by the end of the year to crack down on drink and needle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/12/drink-spiking-uk-campaigners-mps-inquiry\">spiking</a>, amid concern about increasingly brazen attacks on students.</p> <p>Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, said she had seen the impact of spiking first-hand and that it was a horrific crime that she was determined to stamp out in higher education.</p> <p>On Tuesday, she launched a working group, made up of vice-chancellors, police, campaigners and victims, to spearhead plans for practical action to help keep students safe.</p> <p>Although the true prevalence of spiking remains unclear, police data obtained by the Commons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/prevalence-of-drink-and-needle-spiking-unknown-mps-say\">home affairs committee</a> said 81% of recorded victims were students, while a recent survey by the student news site <a href=\"https://thetab.com/uk/2021/10/19/over-2600-young-people-believe-theyve-been-spiked-already-this-term-226466\">the Tab</a> suggested 11% of students believed they had had their drink spiked.</p> <p>Donelan wants every university to bring in a dedicated policy to tackle spiking by the end of the year, including measures to ensure that all victims are recognised and supported.</p> <p>“This is an issue that is very close to my heart, having had someone close to me spiked when I was younger, which had devastating consequences.

It doesn’t have to be that way …","body":"<p><strong>What salads are </strong><strong>satisfying enough </strong><strong>for dinner?</strong><br><em><strong>Matthew, Birmingham</strong></em></p> <p>“Big, beautiful, non-boring salads are such an important category,” says Melissa Hemsley, whose latest book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/feel-good-9781529109818\">Feel Good</a>, was published last week. And, she says, they can be achieved with just beans, bread and a bit of prep. “Roast butter beans, maybe with some harissa and honey to get them nice and sticky. Crouton the hell out of a baking tray of old bread. Roast any veg you’ve got. Batch-cook maftoul, quinoa or wild rice for bulk. And make good use of eggs.” The beans and croutons (we’re talking <em>big</em> ones here) could then, for example, form the base of a caesar-tahini salad. The next day, “toss tomatoes with cannellini beans or chickpeas, maybe with a sticky, harissa-maple dressing, then smash whatever croutons you’ve got left over into breadcrumbs and sprinkle them on top.”</p> <p>Gelf Alderson, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/river-cottage-great-salads-9781526639103\">River Cottage Great Salads</a> (out in June), meanwhile, turns to small beetroot. Just don’t boil them, he says, because “they roast really nicely”, especially with tamari soy sauce. Then, just before the beets are cooked, scatter over a few seeds and add a dash more soy for good measure: “Those seeds come up a bit like Twiglets, so you get this deep, punchy flavour that satisfies the protein part of your brain.” Eat with pickled beetroot, if you have some – “they act as a dressing” – and a creamy cheese such as cottage or goat’s: “Beetroot loves that kind of stuff.”</p> <p>Roasted broccoli is another Hemsley favourite, particularly with feta. “Pierce or halve wrinkly, leftover lemons, throw them on to a baking tray and roast,” she adds. “Then squeeze them all over the top at the end.” Freekeh or buckwheat will provide substance, then raid the fridge for a dressing. You might, Hemsley says, unearth some harissa to stir through sun-dried tomato pesto, say, or find the ends of an almond butter or tahini jar, in which case “pour in olive oil and lemon juice, and give it a good shake”. If broccoli isn’t your thing, swap it for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/nov/01/thomasina-miers-recipe-coronation-cauliflower-salad\">coronation cauliflower</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/apr/28/cook-perfect-coronation-chicken-royal-wedding\">chicken</a>. Speaking of which, if you have any chicken left over from the Sunday roast, Hemsley suggests shredding it into a “kind of mimosa salad” – “Boil eggs, peel and chop, then toss through the meat with some beans.” As always, it’s worth boiling more eggs than you need: “Lovely, jammy eggs make any salad heartier.”</p> <p>The same rings true for potato salad. For spuds you’ll like, Alderson roasts Jersey Royals in oil and curry spices, and adds chopped eggs and “any kind of leaf you can get your hands on”. You don’t need to mess around with a dressing, either, because the oil and spices mean “it kind of dresses itself”.

So we must put them on notice: accountability is coming for those who liquidate our future.”</p> <p>He added: “You hold the cards. Your talent is in demand from multinational companies and big financial institutions. You will have plenty of opportunities to choose from. My message to you is simple: don’t work for climate wreckers. Use your talents to drive us towards a renewable future.”</p> <p>Guterres has become increasingly outspoken on the climate crisis in recent months, telling world leaders in April: “Our addiction to fossil fuels is killing us.”</p> <p>He has also recently attacked companies and governments whose climate actions do not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/oil-firms-climate-claims-are-greenwashing-study-concludes\">match their words</a>: “Simply put, they are lying and the results will be catastrophic.

Caroline Dennett claimed Shell had a “disregard for climate change risks” and urged others in the oil and gas industry to “walk away while there’s still time”.</p> <p>Dennett said she was inspired by an Extinction Rebellion protest: “When I saw news footage of Extinction Rebellion inviting anyone at Shell to jump ship and offering support through its <a href=\"https://extinctionrebellion.uk/act-now/campaigns/truth-teller/\">TruthTeller project</a>, it motivated me to take action.

It’s truly inspirational to think their £460,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/partygate-inquiry-what-police-said-and-the-dangers-for-the-met\">“Partygate” performance piece</a> has not yet reached its final form. That will come as early as today, when a number of the officers tasked with not spotting Boris Johnson in a series of piss-up photos get signed off with stress. Only when they’ve been on the sick for two years, then retired with a full pension but also returned to a high-paying station desk job, will Partygate have attained the British establishment gold standard.</p> <p>Last night, I saw a Tory MP <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/tory-mps-despair-over-photos-boris-johnson-at-lockdown-party\">demand to know</a>: “Was the Met weak, gullible, incompetent or stupid?” Sir<strong>,</strong> I simply CANNOT play favourites with those words. Just tick all of them, and wonder how we ever imagined it would be anything different. When you think of the people who’ve died in police custody with no officer seeing anything, it suddenly seems blindingly obvious that the cops would fail to discern the prime minister in a picture of a party that they have already ruled criminal, and have consequently issued other fines for. Johnson could have been kicking himself to death while holding aloft a glass of lady petrol, and any number of specialist officers would have found a way of not noticing it. It’s usually something to do with the sightlines, I believe.</p> <p>Anyway: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/partygate-photos-boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-lockdown-breaches-sue-gray-report\">leaked set of photos</a>. Or rather: the first leaked set of photos. It’s possible they prove that most ancient of political adages: it’s not the crime, it’s the vanity photographer you hired to take photos of the crime. Did the PM’s personal photographer, Andrew Parsons (taxpayer-funded salary: the equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/editors-letters/andrew-parsons-taxpayer-photographer-prime-minister-conservatives-b1795165.html\">£100,000 a year</a>), take this unfortunate series of snaps featuring Johnson at a leaving party? We don’t know at this stage, though I must say I felt I recognised Andrew’s style: a shot framed like Brooklyn Beckham did it, with some giant blur in the foreground. Privacy pixellation, or just a bit of curry on the lens? Henri Cartier-Bresson called photography “the decisive moment”. Having studied his oeuvre, I would say Andrew tends to make a terrible decision way too late. I can’t imagine what drew Boris Johnson to him.</p> <p>So did the PM mislead parliament? There are so many ways to answer that question, but I think the most dignified rejoinder it warrants is probably: ya think?! Last December, Labour’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/24/partygate-images-boris-johnson-questions\">Catherine West asked Johnson</a> in the Commons if he could tell her “whether there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November [2020]”. Johnson’s reply: “No. But I am sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.” This has led some to speculate that Johnson could attempt to escape censure for lying to the house on a kind of technicality: that the “no” referred to whether or not he could tell West the answer, as opposed to whether or not there was a party. So we’ve now seen the equivalent of a live two-hour freeway chase (Johnson in the Ford Bronco), and any amount of bloody footprints at the scene. But we definitely shouldn’t rule out the PM’s official spokesperson addressing the Commons privileges committee with the words: “If the ‘no’ doesn’t fit, you must acquit.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/disgraced-prime-minister-boris-johnson-party-lockdown\">Just how many lives does this disgraced prime minister have? | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Either way, on it all goes. Waiting for Johnson or his backbenchers to do the right thing over the parties scandal feels like waiting not just for Godot, but for some Godot/Rapture/Avatar III crossover. Let’s just frame the more historic story of the day in terms of the relevant drinks photos we haven’t clapped eyes on. We have yet to see a picture of the then-foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, drinking from a ceramic coconut on a paddleboard in Crete, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/19/utterly-shameful-labour-asks-if-dominic-raab-should-stay-after-afghanistan-delays\">refusing to come home</a> and sort out the Afghanistan evacuation last August. See also Foreign Office permanent secretary Philip Barton, who failed to return from holiday to deal with his department’s chaotic handling of this life-or-death situation.</p> <p>What we have now seen, as of today, is the foreign affairs committee’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/24/top-official-at-foreign-office-called-upon-to-resign-over-kabul-withdrawal-sir-philip-barton-dominic-raab\">hugely damning report</a> into the Foreign Office’s handling of the situation. That alone has proved hard to get to the bottom of, with the department branded “intentionally evasive and often deliberately misleading”, and Barton himself accused of a “determination to avoid unearthing the facts”. As Kabul fell, countless Afghans who had assisted the British were left behind and subsequently tortured or murdered by the Taliban, while animal twazzock Pen Farthing was the sole passenger on the last civilian plane out, having presumably convinced someone extremely high up in government that his pets were high-value Taliban targets. As the report has it: “Multiple senior officials believed that the prime minister played a role in this decision. We have yet to be offered a plausible alternative explanation for how it came about.”</p> <p>Unfortunately, we don’t really live in a time of plausible explanations. The foreign affairs committee report identified a “fundamental lack of seriousness” in government, which feels entirely right. The key thing to realise is that it’s all connected. Partygate and the Afghan chaos are on a continuum. Conservative MPs should think of it as a vast carelessness, and realise that the sooner they demand what we might call a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory\">broken windows theory</a> of government, the fewer real lives will be sacrificed to it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p></li>

As his status grew in financial circles, so too did his list of good works, particularly those associated with arts and heritage.</p> <p>Grossart was chair of trustees at the National Galleries of Scotland and held similar roles in Scottish Opera, the Edinburgh international film festival, the Scottish National Orchestra, the National Museums of Scotland and many more.</p> <p>One of his last legacies was as chair of Burrell Renaissance, which raised the funding to refurbish the home of the <a href=\"https://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/venues/the-burrell-collection\" title=\"\">Burrell Collection</a> in Glasgow – the museum reopened in March this year. He also secured a change to the trust deeds governing the astonishing collection amassed by the Glasgow shipowner, so that parts of it can be exhibited internationally.</p> <p>In the fractious environments of Edinburgh business and Scottish politics, he floated above the fray, admired by most while resented for his success and ubiquity by a few. Anyone who inquired about his political allegiances would be told alternately that he supported the Grossart party or the Dinner party. He served governments of all complexions when the calls came – for example, as an early board member of the Scottish Development Agency under Labour in the 1970s and as chair from 2008 to 2016 of the Scottish Futures Trust, Scotland’s equivalent of the public finance initiative, set up by the SNP.</p> <p>While widely identified as an Edinburgh grandee of business and the arts, Angus came from a west of Scotland background, growing up in the town of Carluke, Lanarkshire. He was the son of Mary (nee Gardiner) and William Grossart; his father, a draper, who for a time ran a modest hotel in Dalry, Ayrshire. Angus would travel by train each day to attend Glasgow academy.</p> <p>He then studied law at Glasgow University, where his friends and contemporaries included the politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1994/may/13/obituaries.past\" title=\"\">John Smith</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/12/guardianobituaries.labour\" title=\"\">Donald Dewar</a> and Menzies Campbell. Grossart’s passports to the wider world also included golf. In 1957, he was runner-up in the now defunct British Youth Championships and twice captained the Scottish junior team.</p> <p>In 1963 he became an advocate specialising in tax law, often appearing as junior to James Mackay, later Lord Mackay of Clashfern and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>’s lord chancellor, who became a lifelong friend.</p> <p>Finding the bar “a little cloistered”, he was increasingly drawn to business and in 1969 formed a partnership with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/03/sir-iain-noble-obituary\" title=\"\">Iain Noble</a>, whose family were landowners in Argyll, to launch Scotland’s first merchant bank.</p> <p>It was an immediate success, aided by investments in the early days of North Sea oil. However, the partnership lasted only three years and Grossart bought out Noble’s share of the business. </p> <p>By the mid-80s, he was involved in running many of Scotland’s key cultural heritage organisations, from festivals to galleries and orchestras. He was perhaps at his most influential as a dispenser of funding when he was chair in Scotland and deputy UK chair of the National Heritage Memorial Fund between 1999 and 2005. One of Grossart’s strengths was that he appreciated small, community-based projects as well as large and expensive ones.</p> <p>Similarly, in his business life, he was a great encourager and mentor of small companies while holding a vast portfolio of directorships outside his main business interests. He chaired BP’s Scottish board for 15 years and Trinity Mirror from 1998 to 2007. Noble Grossart remained his core business and he was still an active chair at the time of his death.</p> <p>His reputation came closest to risk when, having been the long-standing vice-chair of the Royal Bank of Scotland during its expansionist years, he initially defended Fred Goodwin after the bank’s collapse in 2008 as a “scapegoat”. However, he later joined investors who sued to recoup losses.</p> <p>In later years, Grossart put his address book to good use as a fundraiser for prestigious works of restoration. These included the Prince of Wales’s pet project at Dumfries House, a Palladian pile in Ayrshire, and the renovation of <a href=\"https://stgilescathedral.org.uk/\" title=\"\">St Giles Cathedral</a> in Edinburgh.</p> <p>One of his most sustained commitments was to Glasgow Life, the organisation that holds the city’s cultural assets. He was a founder board member in 2014, and its former chief executive Bridget McConnell spoke of his “absolute loyalty, love of culture and willingness to make huge efforts on our behalf”. It was a description that many who benefited from his shrewd advice would have recognised.</p> <p>A final flourish of Grossart’s came in November when he organised a commemorative service and parade to recognise the 250th anniversary of Sir Walter Scott’s birth. It was, of course, no ordinary parade as two pipe bands, high-ranking military and heraldic figures and the entire Edinburgh legal and political establishments processed along the Royal Mile and down the Mound to the Scott Monument. </p> <p>Grossart was appointed CBE in 1990 and knighted in 1997. A genuine builder of bridges with Russia, and particularly cultural links between Edinburgh and St Petersburg, he was awarded the Medal of Pushkin in 2018. He returned it after the invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Gay (nee Dodd), a successful artist, whom he married in 1978, and their daughter, Flure.</p> <p>• Angus Mcfarlane McLeod Grossart, merchant banker and patron of the arts, born 6 April 1937; died 13 May 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/may/24/moonage-daydream-review-david-bowie-brett-morgen-cannes","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T12:24:56Z","webTitle":"Moonage Daydream review – glorious, shapeshifting eulogy to David Bowie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/24/moonage-daydream-review-david-bowie-brett-morgen-cannes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/may/24/moonage-daydream-review-david-bowie-brett-morgen-cannes","fields":{"headline":"Moonage Daydream review – glorious, shapeshifting eulogy to David Bowie","trailText":"Brett Morgen’s intimate montage of the uniquely influential artist celebrates his career, creativity and unfailing charm","body":"<p>Brett Morgen’s Moonage Daydream is a 140-minute shapeshifting epiphany-slash-freakout leading to the revelation that, yes, we’re lovers of David Bowie and that is that. It’s a glorious celebratory montage of archive material, live performance footage, Bowie’s own experimental video art and paintings, movie and stage work and interviews with various normcore TV personalities with whom Bowie is unfailingly polite, open and charming. (There is the inevitable Dick Cavett – who deserves a documentary of his own – also Russell Harty, Valerie Singleton and Mavis Nicholson, though my one disappointment is that Morgen didn’t include the legendary 90s TV interview with Jeremy Paxman in which Bowie tried to convince Paxman that this internet invention was going to be very important.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJCgb5oEG0c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iJCgb5oEG0c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As a rock star, Bowie was a unique artist, aesthete, insurgent experimentalist, gender dissident and unrepentant, unselfconscious cigarette smoker. (I wonder if he ever gave that up?) Morgen includes the traditional student-poster gallery of the various icons to whom Bowie can be compared – Oscar Wilde, Buster Keaton, James Baldwin, Aleister Crowley – all perfectly allowable, but none of them quite approximate Bowie’s own sweetness and rock idealism. His physical beauty in my view can be compared to Wilfred Thesiger.<br><br>What I loved about Morgen’s film was the way it shows that his fans, especially the ecstatic young people at the Hammersmith Odeon and Earl’s Court shows, were not different from Bowie: they became Bowie. Overwhelmed, transfigured, their faces looked like his face. One guy says, with the passion of a convert on whom enlightenment is dawning like the rising sun: “You don’t have to be bent to wear makeup!” This is the 70s we’re talking about, of course, but … well … fair enough, no you don’t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"366165f298a81d8d20ca83dfeaa74a26a5a5745d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/366165f298a81d8d20ca83dfeaa74a26a5a5745d/1193_0_5504_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Let’s Dance … Brett Morgen dances as he arrives at the 75th edition of the Cannes film festival for the screening of Moonage Daydream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Let’s Dance … Brett Morgen dances as he arrives at the 75th edition of the Cannes film festival for the screening of Moonage Daydream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrícia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>The film doesn’t cover Bowie’s personal life as such – although it touches on his half-brother Terry and his tense relationship with his mother. Angie is not mentioned, although Iman is: this film is about the public Bowie, the Bowie of surfaces and images. His personal life is a mystery: he says he has never bought a property in his life (at least before settling down with Iman) and just existed in London or LA or Berlin, simply pursuing the vocation of an artist, albeit an artist who has been lavishly and lucratively recognised in his own lifetime.</p> <p>Morgen suggests, probably justly, that Bowie’s great period probably came to an end with the 70s, but that his intellectual curiosity and creativity continued to have something heroic and magnificent as the years continued to go by. And perhaps his adventures in other art forms, like Marcel Marceau-type mime or playing the Elephant Man on stage were slightly misjudged in that he had already absorbed all these things, was already drawing on that type of energy in his rock personae. Some of his movie performances were better than others, but again the point was that he had included movie-stardom as an ingredient in what he was already doing. The jittery fever of his presence continues long after the film has ended.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moonage Daydream screened at the Cannes film festival.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/may/24/boohoo-settlement-us-lawsuit-fashion-retailer","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T12:23:00Z","webTitle":"Boohoo agrees settlement in $100m US lawsuit over ‘fake promotions’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/boohoo-settlement-us-lawsuit-fashion-retailer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/24/boohoo-settlement-us-lawsuit-fashion-retailer","fields":{"headline":"Boohoo agrees settlement in $100m US lawsuit over ‘fake promotions’","trailText":"Online fashion retailer says settlement agreed ‘without admission of liability’","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/boohoo\">Boohoo</a> has reached a settlement in a $100m (£80m) US lawsuit that alleged the online fashion retailer used fake promotions to mislead shoppers.</p> <p>The Manchester-based company said the settlement had been agreed “without admission of liability” and within its existing provision for legal costs of £18m, a figure that included costs from other more run-of-the-mill cases such as trademark infringements or employment claims.</p> <p>In the case, brought in California, Boohoo and its brands PrettyLittleThing and NastyGal were accused of running sham sales and promotions in the US for at least four to five years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/04/boohoo-tumbles-as-reality-of-online-clothes-shopping-hits-home\">Boohoo tumbles as reality of online clothes shopping hits home | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The suit alleged discounts being offered to US shoppers were based on inflated, or “fake”, original prices that customers had almost never previously been asked to pay.</p> <p>Boohoo’s share price fell more than 5% on Tuesday after it announced the settlement but analysts said this was part of a general downturn in online fashion retail stocks in reaction to lacklustre results from the German specialist About You.</p> <p>Andrew Wade, an analyst at Jefferies, said it was a “marginal positive to have the issue resolved and covered by existing provisions”.</p> <p>Settlement of the case comes as Boohoo attempts to move on from a difficult few years in which its reputation has been damaged by allegations of poor working conditions in its UK suppliers’ factories in Leicester.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company instituted an independent review of its working practices and has implemented a number of changes including opening its own factory in Leicester.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/boohoo\">Boohoo</a> has indicated its clothing prices are likely to rise this year after profits almost halved amid weakening consumer demand and rising costs.</p> <p>The online fashion specialist said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/boohoo-likely-to-raise-prices-after-pre-tax-profits-fell-94\">pre-tax profits fell</a> 94% to £7.8m in the year to 28 February.

The land of the free, and the home of the brave Republican politicians who want to force women to have babies but don’t want to do anything to ensure that babies are fed. The US is in the throes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/baby-formula-shortage-why-is-there-none-what-to-do-causes-explained\">a nationwide infant formula shortage</a>. The situation is dire: two children were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/us/baby-formula-shortage-tennessee-hospitalized.html\">hospitalised in Tennessee</a> because their parents couldn’t find the speciality formula they needed. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/22/us/nyc-state-of-emergency-infant-formula-shortage/index.html\">New York City</a> has declared a state of emergency and the US military has started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/22/us-baby-formula-shortage-europe-shipment\">flying in supplies from Europe</a> (it’s called Operation Fly Formula).</p> <p>Are the anti-abortion crowd doing everything in their power to fix the problem? Hardly. Almost 200 Republicans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/19/republicans-baby-formula/\">recently voted</a> against a bill that would provide $28m (£22.4m) in aid to the Food and Drug Administration to ease the shortage; nine Republicans also opposed a bill to make it easier for low-income parents to get formula through a government programme. Which is all very on-brand, really. “Pro-life”, remember, means that you advocate for the unborn. Once they’re in the world and actually need things, they’re on their own. Time to pull themselves up by their tiny baby bootstraps!</p> <p>A formula shortage is not just another inconvenient supply chain problem. Babies can’t start eating solid food until they are four months old at the very earliest; if there isn’t any formula available, you can’t just give your baby a bacon sandwich. Nor can you “just breastfeed” at the drop of a hat, as some people have suggested. Bette Midler tweeted: “Try breastfeeding! It’s free and available on demand.” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricRSammons/status/1524385361362837505\">Eric Sammons</a>, the editor of Crisis, a Catholic magazine, tweeted: “I would also say that hopefully this is a wake-up call to become more self-sufficient – God literally designed mothers to feed their babies.”</p> <p>Sorry, God, but your design has some serious flaws: I suggest you go back to the drawing board. Maybe add a little button that you can turn on and off when you want milk to come out? That would be a lot simpler than the current setup. Breastfeeding may be “natural” but it’s hardly easy for many women. That’s not something that we really talk about enough; indeed, before my own foray into parenthood I had no idea how time-consuming and difficult breastfeeding could be. <br><br>Among his sanctimonious and ill-informed twaddle, Sammons does have a point, however. This crisis really should be a wake-up call: we should all be asking ourselves how on earth the richest country in the world managed to get itself into such a situation. While there are a number of factors at play, the simple answer to why so many American families are worried their babies will starve is corporate greed.</p> <p>The US loves to hold itself up as a beacon of capitalism and Republicans regularly scaremonger about “socialist” Europe. The thing is, though, free markets work a lot better in Europe; there is far more healthy competition than <a href=\"https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/articles/chazen-global-insights/market-concentration-threatening-us-economy\">there is in the US</a>, where a few big firms rake in massive profits and everyone <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/europe-not-america-home-free-market/600859/\">else pays the price</a>. One thing that never ceases to astound me as a Briton in the US, for example, is how expensive and limited broadband choices are here. I have just two overpriced options for my home internet and they’re essentially the same. </p> <p>Other industries are plagued with similar problems, including the baby formula market: just two companies – <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/the-current-baby-formula-shortage-sheds-light-on-longstanding-weaknesses-within-the-industry\">Abbott and Reckitt Benckiser</a> – control about 80% of the US market. Nestlé has another 10%. Lack of competition in broadband markets is bad enough as it means consumers are stuck paying ridiculously high prices. In the formula market, however, it means that when one company runs into a production issue, babies could starve. So yeah, let this be a wake-up call. Operation Fly Formula is just a sticking plaster. What’s really needed is Operation Fix Capitalism.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/ng-interactive/2022/may/24/are-uk-coronavirus-are-cases-going-down-or-harder-to-count","type":"interactive","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T12:11:48Z","webTitle":"Are UK coronavirus cases actually going down or are they just harder to count?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2022/may/24/are-uk-coronavirus-are-cases-going-down-or-harder-to-count","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/ng-interactive/2022/may/24/are-uk-coronavirus-are-cases-going-down-or-harder-to-count","fields":{"headline":"Are UK coronavirus cases actually going down or are they just harder to count?","trailText":"When the government ended free tests, daily case numbers became less reliable.

And they saw how many people died: a number that peaked on Tuesday 19 January 2021, when 1,366 people died, making it the the worst day of the pandemic*.</p> \n<p>Since March 2022 case numbers from the <a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/\">daily government dashboard</a> have tumbled. A fall that has coincided with the government’s Living with Covid plan: as restrictions fell away in England, so did cases. The government ended restrictions including the legal requirement to self-isolate on 24 February and cut the provision of free tests on 1 April.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/05/covid-stats/graphone\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After two long years of disease, restrictions and fear – it’s the news everyone has been hoping for.</p> \n<p>But have cases really gone down that fast?</p> \n<p>Like all statistics – the UK’s coronavirus statistics are a way of measuring something – but not the thing itself.</p> \n<p>It’s not hard to see that as the government cut free NHS tests and people weren’t able to report private tests, the total number of tests fell, and so did the number of positive tests. Then, by the government’s measurements at least, cases fell.</p> \n<p>And falling cases made it look like the government was justified to cut tests.</p> \n<p>The good news? Cases are on a downward trend. But it hasn’t been as fast or as rosy as the government charts have made out.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/05/covid-stats/graphtwo\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Looking at the weekly <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/20may2022\">coronavirus infection survey</a> from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) – puts the recent fall in perspective.</p> \n<p>What the government (coronavirus.gov.uk) case numbers actually measure is not the number of of new people in the UK infected with coronavirus every day. But, the number of people who take a test, get a positive test result, and then report that test.</p> \n<h2>Why ONS cases are so much higher<br></h2> \n<p>Throughout most of the pandemic, government numbers were recording about a third of the cases that the ONS was picking up. <br></p> \n<p>Instead of relying on people choosing to take a test, the ONS numbers are estimates based on a sample of around 200,000 people across the UK who take a test every month regardless of whether they have symptoms. This makes the ONS system better at catching asymptomatic infections, and better at picking up milder variants like Omicron. <br></p> \n<p>However the ending of free tests sees that relationship break down with the gov.uk figures almost entirely missing the March 2022 spike and recording less than a twelfth of the cases that the ONS picked up at the start of April<br></p> \n<p>But the overall picture is positive. On all measures – cases are down. Vaccination levels are high, antibody levels are high, and the spread of infectious disease tends to reduce in the summer. But that won’t last for ever.</p> \n<h2>How will we spot the next wave?</h2> \n<p>In all <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1054323/S1513_Viral_Evolution_Scenarios.pdf\">four scenarios considered by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies</a> of how the pandemic will unfold, there is a resurgence in the autumn/winter of 2022. In the best case, it is a small one.</p> \n<p>Given that this will happen, it is vital to maintain virus surveillance system and the ability to ramp up protection measures again, as Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, argued <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60467183\">at the launch of the Living With Covid plan</a>.</p> \n<p>But the warning system doesn’t have to come from the daily numbers we have got used to on the government dashboard. Prof Kevin McConway argues that daily cases numbers from the gov.uk dashboard were always more about news cycles than actual health surveillance.</p> \n<p>“The data from tests did help, but the numbers and rates were always subject to biases of unknown size, because they depended on who was turning up to be tested,” he says. “That varied – some people had jobs that required frequent testing, and those requirements changed over time; some people might not choose to be tested even if they knew, or suspected, they had symptoms because they would lose their income; at a few times tests were difficult to get.”</p> \n<p>Even before people had to turn to private tests on 1 April, we see a big dip in testing – showing a change in attitude to the virus, as much as people reacting to the price change.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/08/uk-coronavirus-dashboard-v2/stacked-chart-tests\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“Even if free tests were still available now, people’s propensity to ask for them would have changed a lot because of the perception that the disease isn’t as important or dangerous as it was,” says McConway. “That partly stems from government policies and announcements but by no means all of it – it would have happened anyway.”</p> \n<h2>Data from GPs and Google searches</h2> \n<p>The UK Health Surveillance Agency (UKSHA), which has taken over from Public Health England, is continuing to publish <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season\">Flu and Covid-19 Surveillance reports</a> that draw together data sources including the ONS infection survey but also information from GPs and hospitals, places outside the health system such as care homes and schools, and even sources such as Google searches for symptoms and reports of disease outbreaks at workplaces like restaurants.</p> \n<p>More creative data sources such as <a href=\"https://researchportal.ukhsa.gov.uk/en/publications/tracking-sars-cov-2-in-sewage-evidence-of-changes-in-virus-varian\">sewage</a> have even been used to gauge coronavirus levels in the population. Though are not currently referenced in the surveillance report.</p> \n<p>The emergence of a more transmissible or more deadly variant is one of the key areas of concern for next winter so continued genomic sequencing of samples is required to keep track of how the virus is mutating. And blood samples will continue to be needed as antibody levels give an indication of immunity.</p> \n<p>McConway says the UK has decent measures in place to keep track of diseases that get less media attention than coronavirus.</p> \n<p>“What’s unique about Sars-CoV-2 is the scale of the pandemic, and the public and government and media interest, and some of that led to different and more elaborate and expensive surveillance approaches, but lots of things go on all the time without most people noticing.”</p> \n<p>So as with flu – it is likely authorities will see the warning signs before a new surge hits in the winter. The question is then – as Vallance notes – whether the government will act on it.<strong><br></strong></p> \n<p><strong>The Guardian’s UK coronavirus tracker will switch over shortly to use ONS infection survey numbers for cases, instead of the gov.uk numbers</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p> \n<p><em>* Gov.uk counted 275,618 new cases by specimen date on 4 January 2022 in the UK – the highest daily caseload for the pandemic.

This is the UK premiere of Australian circus group Circa’s dive into the Rite, part of this year’s Brighton festival.</p> <p>This reboot is a mood piece, a sombre, slow-burn crescendo, which starts not with Stravinsky, but a rumbling soundscore by Philippe Bachman, until the rumbling gives way to plaintive bassoon and Stravinsky’s music unfurls. In parallel, the performance moves from fleeting solo and duo interactions, with bodies deftly lifted, tossed and balanced, a partner’s weight deflected with invisible effort, into a community of 10 performers bound by some ominous force, woven in changing textures and complex structures of limbs, like a tangle of ancient tree roots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41e86abfd30914bedb8dae75300c53538b36dd11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41e86abfd30914bedb8dae75300c53538b36dd11/0_356_7511_4507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Circa: Sacre at Theatre Royal, Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Circa: Sacre at Theatre Royal, Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pedro Greig</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Circa made their name combining inventive acrobatics with contemporary dance sensibility, director Yaron Lifschitz expanding tricks and bodies into larger, more symphonic pictures. The speed and dexterity is awe-inspiring but there’s great pleasure in the detail: the moment a man’s backbend gets just to the point of falling and he softly lands on the back of another performer beneath him. Or Veronique Bennett’s stark lighting on a plain black stage, when a running woman launches herself at a man and the light cuts out just as he would catch her.</p> <p>In keeping with The Rite of Spring’s themes, there is a sense of being shaken by outside forces, ritual in the building of formations raising individuals up to the sky, humans pushing forth without always knowing why, throwing their bodies at each other in desperation. This Sacre doesn’t get too misogynistic on the sacrificial maiden front – the women are as strong as the men, one carries two on her shoulders and holds the weight of two others clinging to her at the same time – but it does rise to an intense denouement, isolated woman at the centre, slamming her splits into the floor. It’s a story told and retold, the draw of Stravinsky’s music too powerful to ignore, and as Lifschitz shows, it can still inspire rich rewards.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://brightonfestival.org/\">Circa: Sacre</a> is at Theatre Royal, Brighton, until 28 May.<br></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/may/24/uk-finance-faces-340bn-in-losses-without-action-on-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T11:48:32Z","webTitle":"UK finance ‘faces £340bn in losses’ without action on climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/uk-finance-faces-340bn-in-losses-without-action-on-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/24/uk-finance-faces-340bn-in-losses-without-action-on-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"UK finance ‘faces £340bn in losses’ without action on climate change","trailText":"Dire warning follows first Bank of England climate stress tests on seven largest lenders","body":"<p>UK banks and insurers will end up shouldering nearly £340bn worth of climate-related losses by 2050, unless action is taken to curb rising temperatures and sea levels, the Bank of England has warned.</p> <p>The numbers emerged from the Bank’s first climate stress tests on seven of the UK’s largest lenders.

This was not Harry Kane’s finest season, despite a big uptick in its second half, but Son’s brilliance ensured that ultimately mattered little. Mohamed Salah had looked nailed on for this until the last couple of months and still needs mentioning, as does Kevin De Bruyne; his performance at Wolves, which I was fortunate to report on, was mindblowing and an already supreme Manchester City are transformed when he is at his best.</p> <p><strong>Gregg Bakowski </strong>De<strong> </strong>Bruyne. It looked like Salah would be a shoo-in halfway through the season but the Manchester City midfielder has been talismanic in the run-in, dragging his team kicking and screaming over the line with some supreme performances. A tip of the hat to Son, too.</p> <p><strong>John Brewin</strong> De Bruyne. In a season of no completely overriding star, he was the best player in the best team.</p> <p><strong>Michael Butler</strong> De Bruyne. The best midfielder in the world and the best player in the Premier League. He is more than the sum of his stats, though only five players scored more than his 15.</p> <p><strong>Ben Fisher</strong> Flip of a coin between Salah and De Bruyne. Sadio Mané has equally had an extraordinary season, for club and country.</p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning</strong> Salah continues to amaze with his consistent excellence for Liverpool.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Harris</strong> De Bruyne. Needs to do more in Europe to be ranked alongside the greatest but is the standout player in England and has been for years – even when people thought Eden Hazard was.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter</strong> Salah. More goals than any other Premier League player apart from Son, more assists than any other Premier League player and in phenomenal form for most of the campaign. Had to deal with two major disappointments at international level plus the distraction of his contract saga.</p> <p><strong>David Hytner</strong> Salah. Joint-top scorer, top assister.

Imperious. Majestic. Gamechanging. Cool-as-the-proverbial. The Belgian illustrated why he is City’s big cheese by leaving his very best until the campaign’s killer phase. This was crowned by the pinpoint cross that created the Ilkay Gündogan winner versus Aston Villa that sealed the title.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Liew</strong> Salah and De Bruyne have been brilliant in parts. But João Cancelo has been brilliant for a whole season, all over the pitch. A unique, underrated player.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong> De Bruyne. Salah was the standout candidate in the first half of the season but his form and output significantly declined in the new year and, ultimately, it’s hard to look past De Bruyne. The best player for the best team, who also delivered the best individual display of the season away to Wolves in the run-in.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay</strong> Son. Began the season trying to work out what, if anything, Nuno Espírito Santo wanted him to do, ended it with as many goals as Salah. Gareth Bale got a £90m move by playing like this.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> De Bruyne had a slow start by his standards but he was exceptional after shaking off an ankle problem. His assist for Gündogan’s title-winning goal was an example of a big-game player showing up for his team when the pressure was at its peak.</p> <p><strong>Will Unwin</strong> De Bruyne.

Thomas Frank did brilliantly to guide Brentford to mid-table and fans of ninth-placed Brighton should be aware just how lucky they are to have Graham Potter, who should be a serious contender for any top job. Mikel Arteta did well to change the feel around Arsenal, and Eddie Howe can be acclaimed for his work at Newcastle if not his ability to answer questions about the deeply sinister side of the club’s ownership.</p> <p><strong>GB </strong>Jürgen Klopp. He rotated his squad brilliantly to get Liverpool back into the title race despite losing Salah and Mané to Afcon. That he did so while making it to the final of the three other cup competitions truly is remarkable.</p> <p><strong>JB</strong> Conte. When it came to the top-four battle, Conte’s experience told against Arteta, still a relative fledgling. Why Manchester United thought Conte, a born winner, was a bad idea speaks only to the self-interest of those who decided they couldn’t face being confronted by his demand for better.</p> <p><strong>MB</strong> Potter has coached Brighton to their record points total, five points from a European place. Amazing what a trendy new beard and turtleneck can do.</p> <p><strong>BF </strong> Howe has transformed Newcastle in six months. It is easy to point to their January business and the ability to shell out almost £100m as the obvious gamechanger but he has revitalised players whose careers had gone stale, none more so than Joelinton, and gelled a squad that ended up nestling in mid-table. Only Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham have won more points this calendar year. Thomas Frank and Potter deserve a place on the podium for helping their teams punch above their weight.</p> <p><strong>BG</strong> Frank has done an excellent job at Brentford on their long-awaited return to the top flight and it will be intriguing to see whether they kick on or struggle in what could be a difficult second season.</p> <p><strong>DHa</strong> Klopp. No one else could do what he does with the players he has. More than that, though, he is a man of honesty and integrity who understands the importance of football to the people, but also that good football is no substitute for good values. The same cannot be said of all his rivals.</p> <p><strong>AH</strong> Klopp. His team played every game it was possible to play this season, winning both domestic trophies and taking Manchester City to the wire in the title race despite being 14 points adrift in January. A third Champions League final appearance in five seasons awaits. No wonder Liverpool’s owners pounced with a four-year contract extension as soon as he mentioned he was open to the idea of extending a great era.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d92363a5a9ed356761fb7a176e17bd2529cdba8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d92363a5a9ed356761fb7a176e17bd2529cdba8/637_470_2866_1775/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jürgen Klopp embraces the FA Cup on a flight back to Liverpool after their triumph over Chelsea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"619\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jürgen Klopp embraces the FA Cup on a flight back to Liverpool after their triumph over Chelsea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>DHy</strong> I want to look beyond the top two, for success relative to means, so step forward Potter, who got Brighton to ninth on a net spend of £15m, playing with a clear identity. Measured and assured face of the club.</p> <p><strong>JJ</strong> Pep Guardiola. Four titles in his opening six years at Manchester City is a far better ratio than, say, the great Sir Alex Ferguson, who returned zero in the same span. We are witnessing him take football into a new zone of excellence. The fun is where the likable Catalan may leave it when he is finally finished in England.</p> <p><strong>JL</strong> Klopp, not just for cajoling a tiring squad through four gruelling competitions but for his moral leadership in a game that badly needs it.</p> <p><strong>SN</strong> Frank. Having achieved top-flight status for the first time in 74 years, Brentford were meant to be immediately relegated. Instead they finished 13th. In large part that was down to the tactical acumen and motivational skills of their manager, who pulled off a masterstroke by bringing Christian Eriksen to the club in January. A hugely impressive achievement by a man who also has the best hair in the division.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c1bb7400d1daff5ffc6e4d972840f213e4ecd85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c1bb7400d1daff5ffc6e4d972840f213e4ecd85/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brentford’s manager Thomas Frank (right) gestures on the touchline during the match against Leicester City at Brentford Community Stadium in October 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brentford’s manager Thomas Frank gestures on the touchline during the home match against Leicester in October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>BR</strong> Frank.

Having been there for the latter, it gets my pick: a methodical weave through three defenders, leaving the final one on his backside, still defies belief.</p> <p><strong>GB </strong>Salah against City. He was surrounded when he received the ball but after a delicious roll of his foot to bamboozle Bernardo Silva, he tricked his way into the box, past Aymeric Laporte and fired across Ederson from an acute angle with his weaker foot. To do it against the champions in such an important game made it all the more impressive.</p> <p><strong>JB</strong> Salah v Manchester City. He faded a little as the season went on but there was a point in early season when Salah looked the best player in the world. This was his Messi moment.</p> <p><strong>MB</strong> Thiago Alcântara’s fizzing daisy cutter for Liverpool against Porto in the Champions League still makes me gawp, but domestically you probably can’t look past Salah against City. Ten perfect touches against the best team in the league. No notes.</p> <p><strong>BF </strong>Rúben Neves v Watford, for the sheer audacity of it. The Wolves midfielder, who looks set to depart this summer, nudged the ball into the 18-yard box and then looped a cheeky chip shot over Ben Foster and into the far corner.</p> <p><strong>BG</strong> I have been relentlessly pilloried for suggesting on Football Weekly that Ethan Pinnock’s tap-in for Brentford against Liverpool in September would be among the goals of the season but it ended a wonderfully clever training-ground move from a free-kick against one of the league’s best defences in one of the games of the season, so I’m sticking to my guns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7eb9014cb1f1fd529ea39e812ab50e063840f3ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eb9014cb1f1fd529ea39e812ab50e063840f3ae/0_0_4000_2820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brentford’s Ethan Pinnock scores the opening goal in the Bees’ 3-3 draw against Liverpool at Brentford Community Stadium in September 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brentford’s Ethan Pinnock scores the opening goal in September’s 3-3 draw with Liverpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>DHa </strong>Salah, Liverpool v Man City. A blur of skill, speed composure and chutzpah, in the best game of the season.</p> <p><strong>AH</strong> Salah v Manchester City. He must have been the only person inside Anfield who thought a goal was possible when receiving the ball from Curtis Jones. Astonishing belief and technique.</p> <p><strong>DHy</strong> No contest this season – it is Salah v City.</p> <p><strong>JJ</strong> Rodri versus Aston Villa. His seventh of the term is given the vote because of how vital it was and how unlikely the scorer was. City had been reeling at 2-0 down before Gündogan pulled one back with 14 minutes left. One hundred and twenty seconds later came the sweetest of long-range finishes, Rodri somehow threading the ball beyond Robin Olsen. It was an equaliser that told the rest of the Spaniard’s team, the Etihad Stadium and Liverpool who would take the crown.</p> <p><strong>JL</strong> Not Premier League but Bersant Celina for Ipswich v Crewe in November. Controls a long ball with his laces, immediately chips the keeper from 25 yards. It’s pretty good.</p> <p><strong>SN</strong> Salah v Manchester City. The turn away from Cancelo, the skip past Silva, the twisting of Laporte and, finally, the unstoppable finish past Ederson – what Salah did against City in October was as beautiful as it was jaw-dropping. No other goal came close … except perhaps the remarkably similar one Salah scored against Watford 13 days later.</p> <p><strong>BR</strong> Manuel Lanzini’s lay-up volley against Crystal Palace. One of those moments where you see suddenly that elite footballers at that level are just wired differently.</p> <p><strong>JS</strong> I have a weakness for a left-footed winger cutting in from the right, dribbling past a load of defenders and finishing off the move with a stunning finish. So it will have to be Salah’s goal against City at Anfield.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37a68a0273f76c73db526e9bc1e4cfc8451f6989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37a68a0273f76c73db526e9bc1e4cfc8451f6989/16_0_2519_1512/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohamed Salah scores Liverpool second goal in their 2-2 draw with Manchester City at Anfield in October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohamed Salah scores Liverpool second goal in their 2-2 draw with Manchester City at Anfield in October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>WU</strong> Bernardo Silva v Aston Villa.

Weirdly, I never seem to catch a bad game at Vicarage Road. This one was rattling good fun throughout, Watford running all over an awful United but almost being pulled back before two late goals that confirmed the end of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s reign. For the briefest of moments it seemed Claudio Ranieri might, by contrast, be feted for his contribution to the Hornets.</p> <p><strong>GB</strong> Liverpool 2-2 Manchester City.

The two best sides delivered the two most high-quality games, the one at Anfield the pick of the pair. City were incredible in the first half but Liverpool hung in and made it a thrilling tussle in the second half, during which four goals were scored, including Salah’s one of stunning skill and composure.</p> <p><strong>BR</strong> Manchester City 3-2 Aston Villa. Are you not entertained?</p> <p><strong>JS</strong> The barmiest game I attended was easily Brentford’s thrashing of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. It seemed like a routine afternoon after Antonio Rüdiger finally ended his ridiculous quest for a long-range goal. Then Brentford came roaring back.

They could hardly stop losing and, make no mistake, were going down unless things turned around quickly. Enter Eriksen, the very fact of whose comeback was one of the season’s best stories. In the event Eriksen’s return offered much more than a feelgood glow: he was extraordinarily influential in his 10 starts, adding the craft and composure Brentford lacked. They only lost two of those games, sailed to survival and now sweat on retaining a player who is again sought by the big boys.</p> <p><strong>GB </strong>Marc Cucurella has been a revelation for Brighton after joining from Getafe for £15m. Skilful, fast and with wonderful passing ability, he has been a brilliant outlet at left-back and to impress in a mid-table team is no mean feat. No wonder Manchester City and Chelsea are interested.</p> <p><strong>JB</strong> Eriksen. It was a risk, and one taken only on careful medical advice, but beyond the romance of Eriksen all but coming back from the dead, he soon re-established himself as one of the best players in the Premier League.</p> <p><strong>MB</strong> Some players just kick a football differently, and Eriksen is one. Turned Brentford from efficient Moneyballers into something nice to look at, in a league they have no right to be in.</p> <p><strong>BF </strong>José Sá has been superb for Wolves, a snip at £7m from Olympiakos. Marc Guéhi and Conor Gallagher have been excellent for Crystal Palace and must have a good shot at going to the World Cup.</p> <p><strong>BG</strong> Bruno Guimarães took a while to bed in after his arrival at Newcastle in January but he has quickly established himself as a firm favourite of a rejuvenated fanbase that is brimful of optimism.</p> <p><strong>DHa</strong> Luis Díaz. Generally speaking, a 50% hit-rate on transfers is respectable, which is to say the game may never have seen a run of successes remotely comparable to Liverpool’s over the past few years. But even in that context Díaz is special, a bionic ball of aggression and brilliance, apparently formed from barbed wire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaa4900d2efa4732577f53f06414215579411cec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaa4900d2efa4732577f53f06414215579411cec/57_0_3028_1817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Diaz celebrates after scoring the opening goal in Liverpool’s 4-0 trouncing of Manchester United at Anfield in April 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Díaz celebrates after scoring the opening goal in Liverpool’s 4-0 trouncing of Manchester United at Anfield in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>AH</strong> Eriksen.

He is young and gifted enough to turn things around. Whatever the reasons and however suitable the fit, Romelu Lukaku also underperformed at Chelsea. And the Norwich sporting director, Stuart Webber, blotted his copybook badly, having done so much to abet their rise, by overseeing some poor recruitment and an inconsequential change of manager in a season that was supposed to see them consolidate but turned out abysmally.</p> <p><strong>GB </strong>Raphaël Varane. I know he’s had injury problems but for £34m I think Manchester United would have expected a bit more assurance from him when he has played.</p> <p><strong>JB</strong> Ralf Rangnick. The German’s reputation as an empire-builder, a Mr Fix It for ailing institutions, was mortally damaged by his inability to get any sort of tune out of Manchester United. The later weeks of his interim reign seemed to be spent defending that reputation.</p> <p><strong>MB</strong> West Ham’s Nikola Vlasic and Tottenham’s Bryan Gil deserve a mention but it’s difficult to look past Sancho as the standout candidate. In his defence, he does play for Manchester United.</p> <p><strong>BF </strong>A serial winner, Varane was supposed to bring some calm to the chaos at Manchester United but his signing hasn’t worked. Norwich can also lay claim to quite a few expensive mistakes.</p> <p><strong>BG</strong> To paraphrase Sheriff May in No Country For Old Men, if the version of Manchester United Erik ten Hag is taking over ain’t a mess, it’ll do til a mess gets there.</p> <p><strong>DHa</strong> Lukaku.

Eight glasses held high, a table strewn with bottles. Not a mask to be seen, not a hint of social distancing. They’re standing mere breaths apart. And there, holding court, centre stage – all grins and clownish mop of hair and crumpled, easy swagger – is Boris, good old Boris. Knees up, guard down, clearly raising a toast in a room full of alcohol. It all looks so very jolly.</p> <p>Only at a second glance do you notice the red box that sits askew upon a chair, slung there like an afterthought. Then, in the foreground, a further revelation. As if designed to mock, tucked away between the bottles is that icon of the Covid age – a plastic pump dispenser of hand sanitiser. And how absurd it looks, how silly, this token nod towards curtailing infection amid the booze and grins and genial dissolution of another night of No 10 flicking the finger to the nation.</p> <p>They were partying, to be clear, on the day Britain’s Covid <a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths\">death toll topped 52,800</a>. Another 438 deaths added to the tally just hours before the revelry started. With the country yet again in lockdown, Covid felt old, so grim, and so much harder this time round. Still, you gritted your teeth and did what you must. Because, honestly, who in their right mind would want to risk infecting and killing others? The swaggerer-in-chief, that’s who, Downing Street’s serial carouser. His smugness, the nod and the wink of it all. Come on chaps, there’s rules and there’s “rules”. </p> <p>Boris Johnson and his hangers-on are desperate to convince you the rules never mattered – and that anyway, you’re down there in the cesspit with him. For wasn’t it all, by this stage, just so tiresome? And weren’t all of us at it, this clandestine cavorting? Well. From a frontline perspective, in late 2020, when this picture was taken, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/11/uk-death-toll-from-covid-19-passes-50000\">second wave was crashing down</a> and the dying was just getting started. As Boris raised his glass and chortled, more than 60,000 of us still lived, still breathed, who, three months later, would be dead. </p> <p>To NHS staff, it was always abundantly clear that the way you survive a pandemic is together. Collective compliance – this fragile, miraculous web of forbearance from an increasingly battered nation of stoics – was really all our patients had. Over and over, I would thank my stars for basic, selfless, public decency. Because by January 2021, the ventilators, ambulances and beds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/08/the-worst-by-a-cataclysmic-margin-the-race-to-save-the-nhs-from-covid\">were running out again</a>. People were dying who should have lived – in their beds at home before a paramedic could reach them, on hospital forecourts, on tarmac, in corridors, on ordinary wards because the ICU was full.</p> <p>What we had to enforce at this time could feel barbaric. Once, at Christmas, I begged the powers that be to permit – <em>please</em> – a teenage boy to accompany his mother into the room where his father lay dying of Covid. The rules were so rigid – one deathbed visitor only – but finally, under duress, they relented. And so I sat, masked and gowned, in a tiny room with pastel wall art and obligatory NHS tissues, trying to prepare a boy the same age as my son for how very different his dad would look now to the man who’d been whisked away from his home by ambulance.</p> <p>When you’ve helped children into PPE, pretending you can’t see as their lips start to quiver, you feel a boundless gratitude to the rule-respecting public. You know too well that what prevents a vertiginous death toll from rising ever higher is their millions of acts of individual sacrifice, from the mundane to the utterly harrowing. Rules, in short, have been the necessary curse of this pandemic. Hated yet obeyed, because we care about each other. We knew it at the time, we know it’s true today. And that glass of wine in the prime minister’s hand? It’s been thrown into the faces of us all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/breathtaking-9781408713785.html\">Breathtaking</a>: Inside the NHS in a Time of Pandemic</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Two from our [resistance] committee were taken at the weekend. There have been lots of other people taken. We are keeping a low profile these days,” said Yousef Abdallah Adam, a 35-year-old painter and decorator who leads a pro-democracy “resistance committee” in south Khartoum.</p> <p>Legal representatives said 80 people associated with the protest movement had been detained in less than two weeks. Many have been dispersed to prisons around the country, often hundreds of miles from their homes.</p> <p>“The authorities believe the wave of arrests will have an impact on the momentum of the protests but the resistance committees will continue to exercise their right to peacefully protest despite the pressure on them,” said Osman Basri, of the Emergency Lawyers’ Association in Khartoum. “They will not stop until they achieve a civilian government”.</p> <p>The October coup came two and a half years after the 2019 popular uprising that led to the fall of the veteran dictator Omar al-Bashir and derailed Sudan’s move from a power-sharing arrangement to democracy. It prompted massive protests, with huge crowds in streets in cities across Sudan denouncing both the military takeover and a subsequent deal that reinstated the prime minister, Abdullah Hamdok, but sidelined the pro-democracy movement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/sudans-prime-minister-resigns-as-pro-democracy-protests-violently-repressed\">Hamdok resigned in January</a>, saying he was unable to work with the military.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1feea83fbe2a2e682780570ccf518066aa2cab2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1feea83fbe2a2e682780570ccf518066aa2cab2c/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sudanese demonstrators take to the streets of Khartoum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sudanese demonstrators take to the streets of Khartoum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though protests this weekend were the largest for some time, the pro-democracy movement is struggling to mobilise big crowds.</p> <p>In Omdurman, hundreds of mainly young people gathered on Shaheed Abdul Azim Street throughout the afternoon carrying flags, banging drums and chanting protest songs. They blocked traffic with rocks and burning tyres. Some wore plastic helmets or protective glasses.</p> <p>Many had been injured in previous demonstrations and the mood was defiant. “I was protesting against Bashir, against the army rule afterwards, against the coup too. We are many and we will win,” said Momin Ahmed, 27, who has yet to regain the full use of an arm after being shot earlier this year.</p> <p>Ijlal Syed Bushera, 43, said the protest movement would win eventually. “Even if more are killed and they drive trucks over us we be here until we achieve the goals of the revolution,” Bushera told the Guardian.</p> <p>After two hours, police moved in, firing teargas and charging with vehicles to disperse the unarmed protestors who ran down side streets, coughing and streaming tears.</p> <p>Activists admit the crackdown and holidays during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan have made it harder to organise large protests, but also say they have switched tactics away from mass rallies to focus on smaller, localised demonstrations.</p> <p>Observers say the unrest that eventually ousted Bashir after 30 years in power started with small but repeated protests but grew as the economy plunged in the last months of the Islamist autocrat’s rule.</p> <p>The military seizure of power in October prompted international donors, including the US and the World Bank, to pause significant amounts of economic assistance and debt relief to Sudan.

They don’t want to relive that experience, even for a few hours,” explains Steve Happi, the 33-year-old producer of <a href=\"https://www.jailtimerecords.com/\">Jail Time Records</a>, a non-profit record label started in New Bell prison in Douala, the largest city in Cameroon.</p> <p>In December 2021, Happi opened <a href=\"https://www.anti-do-to.com/pages/jail-time-records-part-2\">a second studio</a> in the Deido district of Douala, providing a recording facility outside jail for former prisoners like him. “We have people who have really changed because they have the opportunity to record for free,” says Happi, who founded the label in 2019 with an Italian artist and director, Dione Roach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81128936cb8039464166fdf16687592881029d86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81128936cb8039464166fdf16687592881029d86/0_278_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some of the artists who record for Jail Time Records.

Gunning has swum for Great Britain and Jamaica, one of the most dangerously homophobic countries on the planet, but he is now back in the garden of his childhood home in Orpington, Kent, on a beautiful morning.</p> <p>“I’m nervous but excited,” Gunning says, “because I’ve got so much more to give the world. I haven’t achieved all I wanted in my career but, now I’m retiring from competitive swimming, I don’t feel I failed. Yes, I haven’t qualified for the Olympics or won that world title. But the amount of lives that I’ve impacted means more to me than medals.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/skier-gus-kenworthy-my-legacy-in-pyeongchang-was-that-kiss-to-have-it-broadcast-to-the-world-felt-amazing\">Skier Gus Kenworthy: ‘My legacy in Pyeongchang was that kiss – to have it broadcast to the world felt amazing’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gunning pushes his swimming goggles above his forehead and, during our photoshoot, he tries to stop his face cracking open into a brilliant smile which is full of joy and pride. He is meant to look straight down the barrel of the lens but he can’t help himself. That smile keeps returning even though we have spent 90 minutes talking about some harrowing subjects.</p> <p>The 28-year-old Gunning has remembered how, when he was a schoolboy just down the road, he used to write The Swimmer, rather than his name, at the end of his assignments. It was one way to blur his identity and avoid the boys who threw acid at him. He buried his real self and did not have his first sexual experience until he was deep into his 20s.</p> <p>That did not stop people warning him, during a swimming competition in Dubai, that he should walk more like a straight white man. It was similar to the casual racism which made so many people question whether a black person could swim at the highest level.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48a8f52eff37249cba71e80da2fa853018a3fb33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48a8f52eff37249cba71e80da2fa853018a3fb33/0_0_5322_3548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gunning competes for Jamaica in the men’s 200m butterfly heats at the 2017 world championships in Budapest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Gunning competes for Jamaica in the men’s 200m butterfly heats at the 2017 world championships in Budapest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“At school there weren’t many mixed-race people,” Gunning says, “and I had lots of voices telling me black people can’t swim. I should do something black people would succeed at, like athletics. Sometimes I just wanted to be a straight white swimmer who had only the pressure of competing because, when I went to competitions, people often said: ‘You must be a runner.’ I said: ‘Yeah.’ It was too much hassle to say I’m a swimmer and they’d go: ‘Well, how?’ That conversation would bring me down and I always want to be up. It’s only in recent years that I’m proud to say I’m a swimmer.”</p> <p>Gunning asked to do this interview as a way of announcing his retirement. He trained alongside the formidable Olympic champion Adam Peaty, his close friend, for many years in the GB squad. His strong friendship with Becky Adlington and her former husband, Harry Needs, meant that they asked him to be godfather to their daughter. Gunning has swum in two world championships, <a href=\"https://swimswam.com/michael-gunning-breaks-jamaican-record-with-159-fly-at-british-nats/\" title=\"\">broken numerous Jamaican national records</a> in freestyle and butterfly and he was desperately unlucky not to swim at the Olympic Games in Tokyo last year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hopefully in 10 years’ time the next black gay swimmer will be seen just as a great swimmer representing their country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“My ambitions have changed,” he says. “I could swim at the Commonwealth Games this year, and go to the next Olympics, but I wouldn’t gain anything unless I was winning a medal. I now want to make sport equal for all. I want to encourage black people to swim. I want to help change homophobic laws around the world. I want to make an impact.”</p> <p>Gunning has a charisma and dynamism more suited to television extravaganzas than chlorine-scented swimming pools. But he also carries a serious intent, for he has endured too much to avoid some hard truths about race and homophobia. He confirms the statistics produced by Swim England which state that 95% of black adults and 80% of black children in this country do not swim. “I do lots of school visits and ask [black] parents: ‘Why don’t you encourage swimming more?’ The answer is always the same: ‘Why would we encourage them to do something they won’t succeed at?’ Hopefully people like me will show it can be done. And let’s not forget that being able to swim can save your life.</p> <p>“I don’t like to be called ‘The gay black swimmer’ in headlines. I’m an international swimmer but I had to go through that to bring about change. Hopefully in 10 years’ time the next black gay swimmer will be seen just as a great swimmer representing their country.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35ceadb274fa39d8cb0e84e2277eea2d4bf02bf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35ceadb274fa39d8cb0e84e2277eea2d4bf02bf4/0_0_5965_3931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gunning in the garden of his parents’ house in Orpington, Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Gunning in the garden of his parents’ house in Orpington, Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Commonwealth Games will be held this summer in Birmingham but, as Gunning explains: “35 of those countries still have homophobic laws. A high number still have the death penalty as punishment. As a swimmer who represented Jamaica, while training in the UK, I have an opportunity to highlight such issues. These Games can act as a catalyst for change because this is Birmingham’s chance to shine and show people how equality and diversity works. We can be true to ourselves.”</p> <p>Gunning could not be himself for much of his life. “I knew I was very different at school,” he says. “I’ve always got a big smile on my face but I felt people didn’t like me being happy. I tried to fit in and the best way to do that was to suppress my sexuality. But I still had acid thrown at me in science when I was 15. I was doing well and I got praise from the teacher. I was really happy and people didn’t like that. So they threw acid on my blazer because I’m naturally very bubbly and outgoing and they wanted to put me back in my place.</p> <p>“I was scared to tell my parents so I lied and said I spilt acid. My mum had to spend 60 quid on a new blazer but I didn’t tell her about the bullying until much later because I knew she would storm down to the school. But whether or not I moved class I still felt shame. I still felt I had to be someone different. I had no role model to look up to as a gay black kid. I guess I want to take on that role now.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My dad knows how gay people are treated in Jamaica and he was concerned but after we spoke he was absolutely fine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gunning remembers how he and Needs, <a href=\"https://attitude.co.uk/article/rebecca-adlingtons-ex-harry-needs-opens-up-about-biphobia-and-first-relationship-with-a-man-1/23632/\" title=\"\">his best friend who came out as bisexual</a> after he and Adlington separated, were at the Ariana Grande concert five years ago, on 22 May 2017. A suicide bomber caused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/22/manchester-arena-police-explosion-ariana-grande-concert-england\" title=\"\">the death of 22 people that night</a>. Gunning ran from the devastation and became traumatised with guilt.</p> <p>Counselling helped him and made Gunning realise he could not keep hiding. That Christmas, in the very house where we now sit, his mum became the first person to whom he came out. “We were very emotional and I remember thinking: ‘This shouldn’t have to be a thing.’ My mum was great but I didn’t have the guts to tell my dad. I said to my mum: ‘Can you tell Dad and the family?’ It’s one of my regrets now.”</p> <p>His dad is from Jamaica and “he had lots of questions. How did I know? I’d never had a sexual experience at that time. My dad knows how gay people are treated in Jamaica and he was concerned but after we spoke he was absolutely fine. He just wants me to be happy.”</p> <p>Had he switched to competing for Jamaica by then? “Yes and I knew the <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1182991,00.html\" title=\"\">heavy weight of the laws and homophobia in Jamaica</a>. But I’m so proud, so blessed, to have represented my dual nationalities. Not many people get that privilege. I had worried that people were not going to support me – but they did. From the swim association down most people were great but of course, online, there was lots of hate, lots of death threats.”</p> <p>Does he feel fear? “If I was out in Jamaica, I would worry. But in the UK I feel very safe and fortunate. So many people in Jamaica shared their experiences of how their parents would chuck them out, disown them. They tried to beat the sexuality out of one person and it was like conversion therapy. It was inhumane. So I think the fact I was that beacon of light helped lots of people because, in Jamaica, gay sex is illegal. You get put in prison. Even if you’re seen holding hands with a person of the same sex you are seen to be in a criminal relationship.”</p> <p>Gunning looks up. “But I will continue talking out and I would like to go back to Jamaica. I’ll make a bigger impact if I face it there.”</p> <p>There is regret that Gunning did not swim for Jamaica at the Tokyo Olympics. He had secured his qualification for 2020 but the pandemic changed everything. He couldn’t travel or work with his coach or team. Gunning had to train on his own but he was still on track to swim in Tokyo last year when Fina changed the qualifying markers. He had just one competition to secure his Olympic place. With little proper training, amid so much pressure, <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/07/13/michael-gunning-tokyo-olympics/\" title=\"\">he just missed qualification</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0ca9a15e9a10d4b729ee80dc729992c2f9de41df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ca9a15e9a10d4b729ee80dc729992c2f9de41df/0_111_2855_1714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gunning of Jamaica looks on after his men’s 200m butterfly heat at the British Swimming Invitation Meet at the Manchester Aquatics Centre in March 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gunning looks on after his men’s 200m butterfly heat at the British Swimming Invitation Meet at the Manchester Aquatics Centre in March 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the decision of Jake Daniels, the young Blackpool footballer, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/16/thanks-for-your-leadership-jake-daniels-a-gay-man-and-professional-footballer\" title=\"\">come out last week</a> was an inspirational reminder to Gunning of his new objectives. “To see Jake taking on that responsibility, at 17, was amazing. If I’d had someone like that to look up to when I was young my life would have been so much easier. But I am here now and I want to help people like me. I would like to work in television, maybe in education, and bring that aura of positivity I feel every single day.</p> <p>“I’ll still be in the swimming world because I’m so passionate about getting more black people to learn to swim and help change stereotypes around the world. I always hated the word retirement because I’m not retiring from swimming. I’m only retiring from competitive swimming, because swimming will always be part of my life. I wouldn’t be the person I am today without swimming.”</p> <p>Gunning’s parents, and his grandfather, glowed when I said how proud they must be of him. “We are,” his dad said. “We really are,” his mum echoed.</p> <p>An hour earlier Gunning told me that his grandad had not wanted his daughter to go out with a black man. But Gunning’s mum gave her dad an ultimatum to allow her to be with the person she loved. Her dad relented and Gunning’s parents were married in Orpington.</p> <p>“I remember the first photo they took of him holding me,” Gunning says of his grandad. “There is such love in his eyes. To see how far you can go from that previous viewpoint to such love shows how quickly attitudes can change.”</p> <p>Gunning laughs when I ask what his grandad thought when he was the scantily-clad pin-up <a href=\"https://attitude.co.uk/article/michael-gunnings-own-experiences-of-homophobia-and-racism-fuelled-his-fight-for-equality-in-sport/25384/\" title=\"\">on the cover of Attitude</a>, the gay magazine. “At first I was worried but we have such an amazing relationship. He was just happy for me.”</p> <p>In the spring sunshine all the little drops of water have dried on his face. “Whatever my journey is next,” Gunning says, “I will try hard. I’m a little scared, a bit daunted, because it’s unknown waters. But I’m ready to face it and make a difference. I want to make a real impact.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/may/24/leinsters-savage-beauty-could-make-them-europes-greatest-champions","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T10:51:22Z","webTitle":"The Breakdown | Leinster’s savage beauty could make them Europe’s greatest champions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/24/leinsters-savage-beauty-could-make-them-europes-greatest-champions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/may/24/leinsters-savage-beauty-could-make-them-europes-greatest-champions","fields":{"headline":"Leinster’s savage beauty could make them Europe’s greatest champions","trailText":"Leinster could draw level with Toulouse’s five titles this weekend and the scary thing is they are still improving","body":"<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-breakdown\" name=\"the-breakdown\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-breakdown\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-breakdown\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The surest sign of consistent quality in European club rugby is visible just above the heart. Those four little gold stars woven into Leinster’s jersey might not immediately catch everyone’s eye but if you know, you know. Each of them denotes a European Cup title and adding another on Saturday will gain the Irish province entry to the most rarefied of clubs.</p> <p>Currently the French thoroughbreds of Stade Toulousain are the sole occupants of this elite five-star enclosure, courtesy of victory over La Rochelle in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/22/la-rochelle-toulouse-champions-cup-final-rugby-union-match-report\" title=\"\">last year’s final</a>. Next up, after Leinster, are Toulon and Saracens with three while Munster, Leicester and Wasps are the only other teams to have raised the trophy more than once. In the past 20 years only one side from outside that magnificent seven – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/17/exeter-are-european-champions-after-dramatic-final-against-racing-92\" title=\"\">Exeter</a> – have conquered Europe.</p> <p>Leinster’s recent form strongly suggests they could draw level with Toulouse this weekend. Of course, Ronan O’Gara’s La Rochelle beat them in last year’s semi-final and nothing can be remotely guaranteed. But should Leo Cullen’s side prevail in Marseille it would be the fifth time in 14 seasons the trophy has ended up in Dublin. Considering the opposition involved over that period, that would be some achievement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/21/eddie-jones-casts-leinsters-power-game-as-the-template-for-england\">Eddie Jones casts Leinster’s power game as the template for England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which inevitably kickstarts one of those subjective pub arguments. Are Leinster on the verge of becoming the greatest European club side of the pro era? There will be plenty of spluttering in France but, increasingly, there is a strong case to be made. Not just in terms of trophies but the manner in which they are increasingly getting the job done.</p> <p>It is all very well saying the English league leaders, Leicester, started slowly in the </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/07/leicester-leinster-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report\" title=\"\">quarter-final at Welford Road</a> or that Toulouse were below their best <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/14/leinster-toulouse-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report\" title=\"\">in the semi</a>. That is what top sides do: even decent opponents are made to look moderate. And when you looked at the scoreboard at the end of both of those matches, against sides containing some top-notch individuals, the aggregate was 63-31.</p> <p>At which point another familiar cry goes up: they should be good, they’re Ireland in disguise. Which is mostly true in terms of personnel. But, conversely, what if it is Leinster’s excellence that has filtered upwards to Ireland’s national team rather than vice versa? And either way, is that not the perfect yardstick by which to judge whether a club (or provincial) side truly are the real deal?</p> <p>So let’s proceed accordingly. Two of the greatest European champions in terms of the quality of their title-winning performances were the Brive side of 1997 and Leicester in 2001. But while Brive were simply scintillating in Cardiff, carving open the Tigers to win 28-9, they did not necessarily boast a team full of internationals. Their flying winger Sébastien Carrat was a French national sprinter, for example, but he never won a cap for <em>Les Bleus</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e5ba70ad408f3e86ef5e6daa1f6902329d84b93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e5ba70ad408f3e86ef5e6daa1f6902329d84b93/0_0_3500_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugo Keenan touches down for a try during the January rout of Bath.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugo Keenan touches down for a try during the January rout of Bath.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leicester’s forwards, however, were pretty much the England pack in disguise, with the talented Pat Howard, Geordan Murphy and Austin Healey outside them. Their 34-30 victory over Stade Français in Paris was also as compelling a finale as any in the tournament’s history. There is only one snag: having retained the trophy the following year they have drawn a Champions Cup blank over the past 20 years.</p> <p>Despite the fabled deeds of Munster and the famous knockout acumen of Wasps, then, the all-time shortlist arguably has to be whittled down to four: Toulouse, Leinster, Toulon and Saracens. Toulon were as star-dusted a side as the competition has ever known and no other team have won three consecutive titles. The most eye catching, without doubt, was their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/24/toulon-saracens-heineken-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">23-6 humbling of Saracens in 2014</a> when Matt Giteau and Juan Smith scored the tries, Jonny Wilkinson kicked the goals and Steffon Armitage – remember him? – claimed the man-of-the-match award.</p> <p>Sarries, too, had some extra-special moments, not least in Newcastle in 2019 when they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/11/leinster-saracens-champions-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">overpowered Leinster</a>. Maybe there would have been more titles had the salary cap saga not intervened. Toulouse, meanwhile, stand out for their longevity and sustained pedigree, although two of their five final wins were achieved in extra-time and the combined winning margins of the other three were a modest 12 points. Arguably the final in which they played some of their most compelling rugby was in 2004 against Wasps at Twickenham, which they lost courtesy of Clément Poitrenaud’s late howler.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f8bf2a94ea3a8328a3f43e5665e80dee41a1dd3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8bf2a94ea3a8328a3f43e5665e80dee41a1dd3f/0_199_5070_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonny Wilkinson lifts the trophy after Toulon’s 2014 triumph.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonny Wilkinson lifts the trophy for Toulon’s star-studded side in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For my euros, though, the two most striking all-round European sides – capable of playing in a variety of ways, with power and panache and with sustained Test-class excellence – have been Toulon and the modern-day Leinster. Nothing, it should be stressed once again, is yet settled but the Dubliners are still improving. They can scrummage with the best of them and their tighthead can throw 25-metre passes in open play. Their back row never take a step backwards and neither do their midfield. They possess a high-level kicking game – out of hand and off the tee – and their half-backs are tactically outstanding. When Leinster really up the tempo there is a savage beauty to their clinical execution.</p> <p>So who would win if the Toulon of 2014 played the Leinster of 2022? Shifting the tickets would not be a problem, that’s for sure. Never mind Wilkinson and Giteau, what about Bakkies Botha, Carl Hayman, Jean-Martín Fernández Lobbe and Bryan Habana? With Martin Castrogiovanni, Ali Williams and Mathieu Bastareaud as back-up? Perhaps best not to bet the Monte Carlo-based yacht on an Irish romp.</p> <p>But should Leinster win well on Saturday the “ultimate” question can legitimately be raised. Right now Johnny Sexton, Jamison Gibson-Park, Tadhg Furlong, Josh van der Flier, Robbie Henshaw and the rest of their squad of hungry internationals are displaying a rhythm and certainty exhibited by only the very best. A fifth gold star on their jerseys this weekend would truly cement their lofty status.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/24/from-marrickville-to-tokyo-anthony-albanese-goes-down-the-rabbit-hole-and-emerges-on-the-world-stage","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T10:49:57Z","webTitle":"From Marrickville to Tokyo: Anthony Albanese goes down the rabbit hole and emerges on the world stage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/from-marrickville-to-tokyo-anthony-albanese-goes-down-the-rabbit-hole-and-emerges-on-the-world-stage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/from-marrickville-to-tokyo-anthony-albanese-goes-down-the-rabbit-hole-and-emerges-on-the-world-stage","fields":{"headline":"From Marrickville to Tokyo: Anthony Albanese goes down the rabbit hole and emerges on the world stage","trailText":"Australia’s new prime minister felt the gravity of the moment as he met with the leaders of the US, India and Japan","body":"<p>On Monday morning, when Anthony Albanese woke up in his quiet Marrickville bungalow, it could have been any other ordinary day.</p> <p>But by that evening, as he walked down the steps of the colossal RAAF KC-30 at Haneda airport in Tokyo, Albanese emerged on to the world stage as Australia’s 31st prime minister.</p> <p>He was greeted on the tarmac by Japan’s state minister for foreign affairs, a military salute and a waiting motorcade of glossy black Toyota vans.

The three men laughed together as if a reunion of old friends.</p> <p>“What a great way to begin,” Albanese said with a smile.</p> <p>The US president was clearly pleased with the prime minister’s attendance, saying his commitment to the Quad so soon after being sworn in was “testament to Australia being all in”.</p> <p>“You got sworn in, got on a plane – and if you fall asleep while you’re here, it’s OK, because I don’t know how you’re doing it,” Biden said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c3df758a8a5423ae49d80cf4b5d06492b09c481\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c3df758a8a5423ae49d80cf4b5d06492b09c481/0_79_2355_1413/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hello Tokyo: Albanese arrives at Haneda airport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hello Tokyo: Albanese arrives at Haneda airport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A long-serving staffer, possibly exhausted after the relentless six-week election campaign, shed a tear as Albanese spoke to the room of leaders, with the voice of a newly formed prime minister.</p> <p>“It is an honour that this is my first act as prime minister to attend this important leaders’ meeting here in Japan,” Albanese said.</p> <p>Behind him sat two of the most important people of his career – his friend and ally Penny Wong, now as foreign minister, and Tim Gartrell, his long-serving chief of staff. They look on like proud parents, almost needing to pinch themselves at the moment.</p> <p>Later, at their first bilateral meeting, Biden and Albanese again exchanged friendly banter, flanked by officials on each side.

The pictures have also raised a series of questions, both about what Johnson knew, and the conduct of subsequent investigations.</p> \n<h2>1. Why was Johnson not fined for this event?</h2> \n<p>This is something that has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamWagner1/status/1528757676246712321\">puzzled over by lawyers</a> since the pictures were revealed on Monday by ITV News. It is fair to say that, so far, no one has yet come up with a satisfactory answer.</p> \n<p>The Metropolitan police investigation into parties in and around No 10 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/boris-johnson-could-get-three-more-fines-over-partygate-say-insiders\">fined Johnson</a> (as well as his wife, Carrie, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak) for attending a birthday celebration for the PM in the cabinet room in June 2020. But police did not penalise Johnson for the 13 November 2020 gathering, or even, reports say, send him a questionnaire about it. Fines were, however, issued to others there.</p> \n<p>The apparent explanation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/24/partygate-boris-johnson-meeting-sue-gray-lockdown-parties-downing-street\">offered by Grant Shapps</a>, the transport secretary, on Tuesday was that Johnson had just popped in to raise a toast to Lee Cain, his outgoing head of communications, whose leaving celebration it was.</p> \n<p>But some of those present say the entire event was instigated by Johnson, who poured drinks, made a speech, and stayed for up to 25 minutes. So unless the police explain their decision, which seems unlikely, his lack of a fine remains a mystery.</p> \n<h2>2. Was this actually a party?</h2> \n<p>Shapps’ argument was seemingly that even if it was a party, Johnson was not himself partying. People looking at the raised glasses, and table littered with bottles of wine and spirits, plus takeaway food, might disagree. This is, however, both a somewhat semantic debate and not entirely relevant.</p> \n<p>The legal guidance for the time, during England’s 28-day “circuit-breaker” lockdown, permitted indoor gatherings of people not in the same household under only a handful of conditions, mainly very specific ones such as funerals, wakes, and in circumstances where children live between two homes.</p> \n<p>The only one potentially relevant to the leaving celebration was the exception for gatherings deemed “reasonably necessary” for work purposes. But even for this, what is shown in the images appears to fall well outside this stipulation.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200513134724/https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/offices-and-contact-centres#offices-3-5\">more detailed guidance for workplaces</a> published at the time set out that in-person meetings should be avoided where possible, adding: “Only absolutely necessary participants should attend meetings and should maintain 2m separation throughout.” There is no mention of drinks or speeches.</p> \n<h2>3. So did Johnson mislead parliament?</h2> \n<p>In December last year, as reports of various gatherings began to emerge, Johnson <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1468563160827568130\">was quizzed in parliament</a> by the Labour MP Catherine West about the 13 November event. In response, the prime minister said “the rules were followed at all times”.</p> \n<p>This would appear to be inaccurate on two counts. Firstly, given others were fined for attending, the gathering was clearly not legal. But even on the basis that Johnson was arguing he did not believe at the time that any rules had been broken; what is shown in the photos makes that assertion hard to believe. To most onlookers, it very much resembles a party.</p> \n<p>The Commons privileges committee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/no-10-drops-attempt-to-delay-inquiry-into-whether-boris-johnson-misled-parliament\">will decide on this</a> when it holds its own inquiry. Even if the cross-party group of MPs rules Johnson did mislead parliament, there is no legal requirement for him to resign, just a convention that this would happen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e00f1ea3-8183-43a5-8ce0-68be838c2724\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JwDDNfBN2Cw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>4. How and why were the pictures leaked?</h2> \n<p>Shortly before they were published, Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s former chief aide, posted one of his intermittent blogposts asserting (among several things) that in the next day or so, photos would emerge which would cause “any reasonable person” to conclude the PM had lied.</p> \n<p>Cummings left No 10 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/13/dominic-cummings-has-already-left-job-at-no-10-reports\">on the same day</a> as Cain – although in something of an apparent huff, without any leaving drinks – and would thus have a good idea of what went on. He also clearly despises Johnson and would have reason to leak damaging images.</p> \n<p>All that said, we do not know who leaked them, and there is no shortage of former No 10 staff or their associates who might choose to. The “why” appears more straightforward – to damage Johnson’s credibility before the imminent civil service report into the parties, led by Sue Gray.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"free daily newsletter\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am\n  <br>\n  <br>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5. Will the photos be in Gray’s report?</h2> \n<p>Some images are expected to appear, although it remains unclear which. Gray is expected to identify only senior officials, so if she was to use pictures such as those handed to ITV they would need to, as ITV did, blur out some attendees, which makes it less likely. She is, however, tipped to criticise a wider culture of drinking and failing to abide by rules in and around Downing Street. Whether the blame ultimately falls to Johnson or his staff remains to be seen.<br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/24/sunak-living-costs-budget-deficit-tax-uk-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T10:47:06Z","webTitle":"Sunak faces calls for help with living costs as budget deficit lower than forecast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/sunak-living-costs-budget-deficit-tax-uk-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/24/sunak-living-costs-budget-deficit-tax-uk-economy","fields":{"headline":"Sunak faces calls for help with living costs as budget deficit lower than forecast","trailText":"Tax receipts are weaker than expected, revealing impact of UK’s slowing economy","body":"<p>The chancellor is expected to come under renewed pressure to offer a larger financial package of support to low-income families suffering from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/cost-of-living-crisis\">cost of living crisis</a> after the public spending deficit in April came in lower than expected.</p> <p>With the cabinet understood to be concerned about the government’s falling poll ratings as the cost of living crisis escalates, the government borrowed £18.6bn last month – lower than forecast and down by £5.6bn from a year ago, according to Office for National Statistics figures.</p> <p>The reduction in borrowing potentially hands Rishi Sunak further funds to ease the cost of living crisis, which has hit the living standards of those on low incomes the hardest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/uk-inflation-food-prices-grocery-supermarket\">More than a fifth of Britons struggling as grocery price inflation hits 13-year high</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the improvement in borrowing figures masked weaker-than-expected tax receipts in April, revealing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/a-uk-recession-seems-certain-the-only-question-is-how-deep\">the impact of Britain’s slowing economy</a> on the exchequer.</p> <p>Central government tax receipts of £70.2bn came in below a forecast by the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), of £72.3bn.</p> <p>The Treasury’s income was also flattered by one-off items that are unlikely to be repeated as a possible recession looms.

Here’s what it could mean for Britain","body":"<p>Australia’s Labor party has come to power, pushing the conservative Coalition out of office for the first time in almost a decade. Voters also delivered big wins for the Greens and a group of independents promising action on climate change. Here are 10 takeaways for political strategists in the UK to consider.</p> <h2>Well-crafted campaigns defeated rightwing populism …</h2> <p>Well-organised, targeted campaigns on progressive issues triumphed in Australia over negative, dog-whistle campaigns built around conservative leveraging of “culture war” issues. The result on Saturday was a repudiation of the hard right, after scare campaigns on issues such as refugees backfired on Scott Morrison’s Liberals.</p> <h2>… but rightwing populism endured</h2> <p>Nevertheless, the Coalition took 35% of the national vote, and fringe parties – Pauline Hanson’s One Nation and the Trumpist Clive Palmer’s United Australia – managed nearly 10% of the national vote between them. </p> <h2>A low-key policy offer worked for the centre-left …</h2> <p>Safety first proved to be a winning formula for Anthony Albanese, who moderated a lot of his policy offering to avoid a repeat of Labor’s defeat in 2019 when it over-promised on economic and tax reform. Albanese’s low-key, low-risk performances on the campaign trail proved to be more palatable than Morrison’s self-confessed “bulldozer” style.</p> <h2>… but this was no Labor landslide</h2> <p>On first preference votes Labor support dropped from the previous election from 33.34% to 32.8%. The Coalition share of first preference votes fell by 5.64 percentage points but was still higher than Labor. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v23/index.html?key=1rT99on3Dr98_Qi-mWPLfOLn46Yo8-bTy-uXoa30xJuw&amp;location=docsdata\" data-alt=\"Major parties’ vote share\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v23/index.html?key=1rT99on3Dr98_Qi-mWPLfOLn46Yo8-bTy-uXoa30xJuw&location=docsdata\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>The right had a women problem</h2> <p>Gender was another area where the Australian opposition was able to exploit the weakness and shortcomings of the Coalition government. Morrison’s blokey, suburban dad image worked well for a time but his handling of a series of scandals involving his ministers and employees sent his rating among women crashing.</p> <p>In particular, his failure to deal with the allegation that a ministerial member of staff was raped by a colleague in a government office in Canberra dominated the news for weeks. His tin ear was never more glaring than when he admitted it had taken an intervention from his wife comparing how he might feel about it if it was one of his daughters who had been assaulted to make him understand the seriousness of the situation. </p> <p>Another hot-button issue on Australian doorsteps was Morrison breaking his promise to set up a federal anti-corruption commission amid growing concern over donations to political parties and the misallocation of public funds. </p> <h2>Independents broke through</h2> <p>The success of the so-called teal independents (a little bit green, a little bit blue) offered a template for targeting individual seats with well-focused, local campaigns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The victorious teals, who are mostly women, had their most notable wins in well-heeled inner-city areas of Sydney and Melbourne where Morrison’s record on climate, sleaze and gender reversed decades of traditional backing for the Liberals. </p> <h2>The climate crisis weighed on voters’ minds</h2> <p>The defeated rightwing coalition government thought “ordinary” voters in the suburbs did not care about esoteric things such as emissions targets and renewable quotas. But when people were finding that their homes were successively on fire or underwater, they joined the dots and sent a message that this wasn’t the case.</p> <p>The teal candidates were heavily backed by climate activists in their inner-city battlegrounds, and the Greens won at least three lower house seats, in what has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/australian-greens-hails-best-result-ever-with-dramatic-gains-in-lower-house-and-senate\">referred to as a “Greenslide”</a>. Overall, the Greens took 12% of the national primary vote, up nearly 2 percentage points, suggesting environmental politics had appeal beyond university-educated urbanites.</p> <h2>Murdoch’s influence appeared to wane</h2> <p>The triumph of Albanese and others was also a defeat for the Murdoch press, which campaigned ferociously against the progressive parties. News Corp Australia controls the biggest-selling papers in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, along with a host of other titles that gave the Coalition the soft-soap treatment while portraying Labor and the rest as unhinged radicals. That it did not work could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/22/the-election-outcome-exposes-a-gaping-disconnect-between-news-corp-and-voters\">proof of Murdoch’s waning influence in the social media age</a>.</p> <h2>Preferential voting system helped progressives</h2> <p>Australia uses a preferential voting system that helped maximise the progressive vote to the benefit of Labor and the teal independents. For example, Labor’s win in the prized inner-city Melbourne seat of Higgins came despite them losing the primary vote to the Liberals. But when the second preference of Greens voters was counted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2022/may/23/australia-election-results-2022-live-tracker-australian-federal-poll-who-won-is-winning-senate-elections-map-track-the-votes-seat-counts-electoral-commission-aec-latest-seats-count-result-winner\">Labor leapfrogged into first place</a>.</p> <h2>Local Covid politics also played a role</h2> <p>The Australian election was influenced by a host of local factors but the impact of pandemic politics is particularly instructive. Tough Covid lockdowns by Labor state governments in Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland were heavily criticised by Morrison and his ministers. But if he thought it was a vote winner he was wrong because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/they-were-having-a-go-at-victorians-how-the-liberals-miscalculated-the-anti-dan-election-strategy\">those attacks went down badly with the public</a>. Western Australia, for example, historically a Coalition stronghold, swung by 11 percentage points to Labor.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2022/may/24/pushing-buttons-violent-video-games","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T10:45:04Z","webTitle":"Pushing Buttons: Why linking real-world violence to video games is a dangerous distraction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/24/pushing-buttons-violent-video-games","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2022/may/24/pushing-buttons-violent-video-games","fields":{"headline":"Pushing Buttons: Why linking real-world violence to video games is a dangerous distraction","trailText":"In this week’s newsletter: Tragic shootings in the US have resurrected the disproven theory games turn people into killers.

And it makes intuitive sense that the interactivity of games – especially shooting games – might appear more troubling, from the outside, than passive media such as film. (I gotta say, though, that in 25 years of playing video games I have never seen a scene as violent or upsetting as, say, a Quentin Tarantino movie.)</p> <p>But the idea that exposure to these violent games turns people into killers in real life is comprehensively false – and it deflects attention from the actual drivers of real-world violence, from inequality to access to firearms to online radicalisation. It is a very politically motivated argument, and one that makes me instantly suspicious of the person wielding it. The NRA, for instance, trots it out <a href=\"https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-nras-long-incoherent-history-with-violent-video-games\">on the regular</a>. Donald Trump, inciter of actual real-life violent riots, was fond of it too. Why might that be, I wonder?</p> <p>First, the facts: there is no scientifically credible link between video games and real-life violence. A lot of the studies around this issue are, in a word, bad – small sample sizes, lab conditions that have no relation to how people engage with games in the real world – but the best we have show either no link at all between violent games and violent thoughts or behaviour, or a positive correlation so minuscule as to be meaningless. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jul/22/playing-video-games-doesnt-lead-to-violent-behaviour-study-shows\">review of the science in 2020</a>, which looked at and re-evaluated 28 global studies of video games and violence, found no cumulative harm, no long-term effect, and barely even any short-term effect on aggression in the real world. It concluded that the “long-term impacts of violent games on youth aggression are near zero”.</p> <p>This seems self-evident: video games have been a part of popular culture for at least 50 years, since Pong, and violent games have existed in some form since Space Invaders, though they’ve gotten more visually realistic over time. If video games were in some way dangerous – if they significantly affected our behaviour, our emotional responses – you would expect to have seen widespread, cross-cultural changes in how we act. That is demonstrably not the case. Indeed, overall, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/57581270\">violent crime has been decreasing</a> for more than 20 years, the exact period of time during which games have become ubiquitous. Though it would be unscientific to credit video games with that effect, you would think that if the generations of people who’ve now played Doom or Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto were warped by it, we might be seeing some evidence of that by now.</p> <p>It is true that some perpetrators of mass murders – such as the Columbine shooters – were fans of video games. But given that the great majority of teenagers are fans of video games, that doesn’t mean much. More often than a fixation on violent media – of all kinds – mass shooters display an obsession with weapons or explosives or real-life killers, an interest in extremist views, social ostracisation. These are not otherwise well-adjusted people suddenly compelled to real-world violence by a game, or a film, or a Marilyn Manson album.</p> <p>The history of the “video games cause violence” argument goes back even further than video games themselves: it’s an extension of the panic that flares up whenever a new and supposedly morally abject form of youth culture emerges. In the 1940s, when New York’s mayor ordered 2,000 pinball machines to be seized <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/01/the-mayor-who-took-a-sledgehammer-to-nycs-pinball-machines/267309/\">so that he could performatively smash them up</a>, it was arcades; during the satanic panic of the 1980s and beyond, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/31/horror-films-and-heavy-metal\">it was metal music</a>. Since the mid to late 90s, it’s been video games, and no amount of studies debunking any link between them and real-world violence seems to make a difference.</p> <p>So why does this argument keep showing up? In short: because it’s an easy scapegoat that ties into older generations’ instinctive wariness of technology, screen time and youth culture, and it greatly benefits institutions like the NRA and pro-gun politicians to have a scapegoat. Whenever video games are implicated in a violent event, there is usually stunning hypocrisy on display. After the El Paso shooting in 2019, Walmart removed violent video game displays from its stores – but continued to <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/walmart-removes-violent-video-game-displays-after-shootings-el-paso-dayton_n_5d4d7a11e4b01e44e47947dc\">sell actual guns</a>. Fox News, the TV network that platforms Tucker Carlson and the great replacement theory with him, is happy to point out that the perpetrator of a mass shooting played video games, while remaining oddly quiet on the racist ideas that show up in these shooters’ manifestos.</p> <p>I’m not saying that we shouldn’t examine video game violence at all, or question it. Does every game that involves sneaking up on enemies need a gratuitous neck-breaking animation when you succeed in overpowering a guard? Why do games so often resort to violence as the primary method of interaction with a virtual world? Do we really need more violent media – couldn’t we be playing something more interesting than another military shooter? These are valid and interesting questions. But they have nothing to do with real-world violence.</p> <h2>What to play</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fcf9ef8584b4df53f14fdc14072362a8a02800b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fcf9ef8584b4df53f14fdc14072362a8a02800b/0_96_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"‘The most interesting anti-violent video game I’ve played’.

In this lo-fi role-playing game, you get into fights with plenty of monsters, but instead of battering them into submission you can win them over by talking them down and showing them mercy, which is often the more difficult option. In most games, there’s no question about what you do when a monster turns up in your path: this one makes you interrogate yourself. I interpreted it at the time as social commentary on pacifism and community, and looking back, I don’t think that was too much of an overreach.</p> <p><strong>Available on:</strong> PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch<br><strong>Approximate play time: </strong>6-10 hours</p> <h2>What to read</h2> <ul> <li><p>I’m going to start with a book this time: Lost in a Good Game: Why We Play Video Games and What They Can Do For Us, by Pete Etchells. A researcher and lecturer in biological psychology, Etchells’ perspective on video games is both relatable and extremely well-informed. He looks at the evidence (or lack of evidence) behind all the most pervasive beliefs about video games, and in the end he makes the case that most of the effects that they have on individuals and society are actually positive. <a href=\"https://iconbooks.com/ib-title/lost-in-a-good-game/\">It’s a reassuring read</a> that I often recommend to worried parents who don’t play games themselves.</p></li> <li><p>Grand Theft Auto V, perhaps the poster child for morally bankrupt video games that supposedly corrupt the youth, has now sold <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-passes-165-million-sold-as-red-dead-redemption-2-reaches-44-million/1100-6503511/\">165 million copies</a>, following its launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X earlier this year. This makes it one of the most popular entertainment products of all time in any medium, and yet strangely, in the nine years since it was released, we have not seen the emergence of roving gangs of teenagers looking to act out their chaotic GTA Online shootouts in real life.

I think back to when I was a child at school, if you heard a piece of music or something was presented to you, it meant so much,” said Ileana Ruhemann, principal flute in the orchestra, which has performed soundtracks for shows such as Blue Planet and regularly plays for BBC radio shows.</p> <p>“It’s just such a privilege and it’s such a joyful thing to be able to maybe be the first person they’ve seen play the flute live, and certainly they don’t see an orchestra every day. It’s a great honour for us.”</p> <p>As well as benefiting young people, the residency will help the “cultural development of Great Yarmouth”, said Alison Bell from Norfolk Music Hub, which provides support for families who cannot afford instruments or music lessons.</p> <p>“What we’ve tended to do in the past is take children down to London, to the Albert Hall or something like that, to go and experience something phenomenal, something outside their comfort zone or anything they could experience locally,” she said.</p> <p>“But this is of the same quality and it’s right inside the heart of their own community.

Sergei Loznitsa, the Ukrainian film director whose brilliant 2018 satire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/10/donbass-review-cannes-2018-sergei-loznitsa\">Donbass</a> brought home to Cannes what was happening in his country, now brings to the festival an eerie new docu-collation of archive footage meditating on the horrific aerial bombardment inflicted on cities and civilian populations by the British and Germans during the second world war. Nothing could be more brutally relevant given the current destruction of Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities by Putin’s Russia, although Russian warfare in the 1940s doesn’t feature here.</p> <p>The film is inspired by WG Sebald’s essay collection Air War and Literature, which ruminated in detail on the evasiveness and amnesia that follows war and the need to bear witness. Yet there is scope for debate as to whether Loznitsa’s film treatment entirely approximates the subtlety of Sebald’s writing, and I’m inclined to say that this tests the limits of Loznitsa’s approach.<br><br>It is avowedly about aerial bombardment during the second world war, a type of warfare that political leaders convinced themselves was somehow more efficient and more detached from the grisly business of land war and hand-to-hand combat. But the film – for reasons never discussed, and there is no overt discussion of any kind – stops short of the most horrifically unnatural part of the second world war’s air-bombardment history: Hiroshima and Nagasaki, contenting itself with ostensible equivalence of the Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force. Maybe we are edging close to a new kind of Kino-historikerstreit.<br><br>Without voiceover narration, Loznitsa takes long uncut clips of archive footage, mostly black and white but occasionally switching to colour, showing the contented civilian populations (with no notion of what horrors are in store), footage of munitions workers, footage of combat planes taking off and sailing through what appear to be calm skies, dropping bombs and then showing us the stunning destruction, including a heart-wrenching image of a dead baby. A passionate string octet on the soundtrack in the final 10 minutes underlines the despair.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9icu5bTGQ4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X9icu5bTGQ4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The clips are mostly silent and Loznitsa appears to have added ambient sound effects of engines, voices indistinctly murmuring etc. It is sinister and dreamlike – very different from the usual brisk, dramatic and unreflective documentary approach to the second world war.<br><br>We see Field Marshal Montgomery giving a jaunty speech to British factory workers, telling them how good it is to see them, to get to know them. Loznitsa’s irony is clear: it is very important that they don’t get to know the Germans, don’t get to see they are humans as well, because then it will be impossible to bomb them. We see Winston Churchill giving a callous and heartless speech saying that if the German civilian populations don’t want to be bombed they should move to the fields (as if that was as easy as a picnic). Then we see Sir Arthur “Bomber” Harris saying that his bombing will be an interesting “experiment”.<br><br>Perhaps the chilling British tone is explicable given the Nazis’ swaggering initial threats of <em>totaler Krieg</em>, but it is queasy nonetheless. On the German side, we don’t see the Führer’s rants on this subject, but hear another voice – Goebbels? – icily promising “counter-terror” against the British. Loznitsa has a repeated visual trick of making it unclear which civilian population we are looking at: a crowd of Germans suddenly cheer at the sight of – Winston. So they’re British. Again, the equivalence theme is clear enough.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/24/putin-is-just-the-frontman-sergei-loznitsa-the-ukrainian-film-maker-who-refuses-to-be-cancelled\">‘Putin is just the frontman’: Sergei Loznitsa, the Ukrainian film-maker who refuses to be cancelled</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And what do we conclude?

Said plan has clearly been redrawn. A few weeks shy of his 81st birthday, Clinton is on the stage again, clad in sequinned trousers, a sailor’s hat with a huge eye on it and something that looks like an ancient Egyptian collar made out of holographic material – an outfit that may well constitute George Clinton’s idea of dressing down in a manner befitting his advanced years.</p> <p>His role in live shows has diminished over time, although it’s still more than you suspect your average octogenarian could muster: when he’s not adding vocal interjections, dancing or beckoning for more applause, he retreats to a seat at the rear of the stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"38835e4c53c91fdc8d64031355956dd15684b565\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38835e4c53c91fdc8d64031355956dd15684b565/1800_95_3190_3945/809.jpg\" alt=\"Gleefully overstuffed … George Clinton & Parliament-Funkadelic.\" width=\"809\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gleefully overstuffed … George Clinton &amp; Parliament-Funkadelic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You could never accuse the current incarnation of Parliament-Funkadelic of not compensating. The band is still as gleefully overstaffed as at their 1970s height – at points there are eight vocalists performing at once – and Clinton presides over a kind of barely-controlled chaos: musicians wander on and off stage, swapping instruments and roles. At one point, a singer reappears both wielding a guitar and stripped to his underpants. They sound fantastic, fusing together what are effectively Parliament-Funkadelic’s greatest hits – Up for the Down Stroke, One Nation Under a Groove, Flashlight – into sprawling medleys that devolve into lengthy jams.</p> <p>These underline what a broad musical universe Clinton’s brand of funk was. Michael Hampton, who was a 17-year-old prodigy, Kidd Funkadelic, when he first joined Clinton in 1975, delivers stinging acid-rock guitar solos. Greg Thomas’s sax and Greg Boyer’s trombone are audibly informed by jazz – during one solo Boyer quotes from John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme, and during a lengthy (Not Just) Knee Deep, Thomas leads the audience in a scat-singing call-and-response derived from Cab Calloway.</p> <p>As always in the P-Funk universe, the sublime happily co-exists with the ridiculous, both on stage and in the audience, where a gentleman who looks like he could conceivably be a bank manager sports a homemade T-shirt bearing the title of Funkadelic’s 1975 song No Head, No Backstage Pass. From his back seat, Clinton wears a broad grin: a patriarch of misrule to the end.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://georgeclinton.com/\">George Clinton &amp; Parliament-Funkadelic</a> are on tour in the UK until 28 May.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/24/the-american-right-is-whitewashing-hungarys-nasty-autocratic-regime","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T10:15:04Z","webTitle":"The American right is whitewashing Hungary’s nasty, autocratic regime | Jan-Werner Mueller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/the-american-right-is-whitewashing-hungarys-nasty-autocratic-regime","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/the-american-right-is-whitewashing-hungarys-nasty-autocratic-regime","fields":{"headline":"The American right is whitewashing Hungary’s nasty, autocratic regime","trailText":"US conservatives are signaling their commitment to authoritarianism loud and clear by holding this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Budapest – the first-ever outside the US","body":"<p>In political analysis, sometimes the hardest thing is to see what’s staring you <a href=\"https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/in-front-of-your-nose/\">right in the face</a>. Putin put <a href=\"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181\">in writing</a> what he was going to do this spring – we just could not believe it, or we thought we’d prove our <a href=\"https://pressthink.org/2020/09/you-might-not-like-it-but-its-smart-politics/\">savviness</a> by identifying some completely counterintuitive twist to the story of an invasion foretold. A similar challenge is posed by American conservatives communicating their commitment to authoritarianism loud and clear by holding this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in Budapest – the first ever outside the US: the autocratic leader of Hungary, Viktor Orbán, is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/orban-tells-cpac-conservatives-europe-us-must-align-troops-2024-votes-2022-05-19/\">the main attraction</a>, with plenty of European <a href=\"https://www.cpachungary.com/en/speakers\">far-right party leaders as supporting acts</a>. Could these American ingenues abroad just be duped by a leader intent on selling his kleptocratic autocracy as the last bastion of authentic conservatism or, as he likes to put it, real “<a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/christian-democracy-or-viktor-orban-illiberalism-by-jan-werner-mueller-2020-01\">Christian Democracy</a>”? Maybe there’s some twist? Or perhaps, as Cpac’s hero Trump once proclaimed, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/04/politics/trump-covid-death-toll-is-what-it-is/index.html\">it is what it is</a>: from Tucker Carlson down, these figures are aware that Hungary has <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/hungary\">exited the democratic world</a>; they just repeat the Orbán regime’s talking points when confronted with evidence for it. They end up cheerfully endorsing Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe.</p> <p>Orbán has long tried to promote his regime internationally as a model of “illiberal democracy.” The idea is that the leader enjoys overwhelming support from the people, while implementing a decidedly anti-liberal agenda in matters of immigration and social policy: <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/articles/its-time-for-social-conservatives-to-stop-fawning-over-hungary/\">rewarding people financially for procreation</a>, legally cementing traditional notions of marriage and affirming the supreme value of the nation-state against “globalists” allegedly “opening all borders.” Such a stance <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/reclaiming-political-strategy-in-hungary/\">has resonated with conservatives</a> who felt that the right kept suffering endless culture war defeats in western Europe and North America; the ideology espoused by the self-proclaimed “plebeian” Orbán has also provided a template for a newly fashioned “<a href=\"https://nationalconservatism.org/\">national conservatism</a>” that seeks to combine nationalism with state intervention in economy and morality.</p> <p>Orbán’s self-declared illiberalism, just like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/670039ec-98f3-11e9-9573-ee5cbb98ed36\">Putin’s attacks on “obsolete liberalism</a>,” laid a trap: instead of focusing on his party’s systematic capture of the state and economy – creating an oligarchy-friendly autocracy that in many ways resembles Russia – critics were dragged (or belligerently entered) on to Orbán’s preferred battleground: culture and morality. He and his allies could triumphantly charge that the very liberals celebrating diversity and tolerance were zealots determined to destroy conservative ways of life. Never mind that “liberal nihilists” (Orbán’s words) in Brussels do not dictate to EU member states how to regulate abortion or, for that matter, immigration – like so many far-right populists, Orbán has been adept at creating a community defined by imaginary common victimhood. Those allegedly intent on victimizing Hungary could change over time – one year, it was migrants, then George Soros, then Brussels. What had to remain constant was a sense of mortal threat, where <a href=\"https://miniszterelnok.hu/orban-viktor-beszede-a-mathias-corvinus-collegium-tanevnyito-unnepsegen/\">national existence is at stake day and night</a>.</p> <p>Hungary (and Poland) have been lavished with attention by conservatives who, from the safety of prestigious chairs at North American universities, lament their status as victims of “cancel culture” and the alleged “<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/622436/live-not-by-lies-by-rod-dreher/\">soft totalitarianism</a>” of the US left: the land of the Magyars became an anti-liberals’ Disneyland – where you can still tell who’s a man and who’s a woman! – or even, as a Hungarian government official put it, a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/cpac-conference-budapest-hungary-viktor-orban-speaker\">conservative safe space</a>.” Voices that are ubiquitous in western debates – like British-born historian Niall Ferguson – would visit Budapest to bemoan the fate of free speech in US academia, suggesting that the situation had started to resemble Stalinist Poland. Such <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIC4HDc_imc\">a performance of victimhood</a> was all the more remarkable because it was staged in front of the very prime minister who had forced Hungary’s best university to leave (inviting a Chinese university to open a branch instead), radically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/hungary-independent-media-editors-reporters-orban\">reduced media pluralism</a> (leaving a few tiny liberal outlets in place for the sake of plausible deniability) and reshaped the cultural scene in the name of promoting nationalist values.</p> <p>It is tempting not to see things for what they are: perhaps all these intellectuals are just what used to be known as “useful idiots” – similar to the polit-tourists who went to the Soviet Union and came back with good news about workers joyously building socialism. But the latter were usually duped – whereas at least some of the conservatives enjoying their pálinka in one of Budapest’s Scruton cafes (named after the conservative British philosopher Roger Scruton) appear to know full well what is happening in their new favorite ideological holiday destination. They are simply willing to sacrifice democracy for the realization of their favorite Catholic natural law precepts, or for stopping what Orbán, among many other conspiracy theorists, identifies as the “great replacement” – substituting Muslims for the last real Christians on the old continent.</p> <p>Critics are usually brushed aside with the charge that left-liberal Orbánophobes just happen to be frustrated that their desire for a “<a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/hungary-liberal-hypocrisy-magyar-man-bad-lgbt/\">woke autocracy</a>” remains unrealized in a far-away country about which they know little; to boot, they are accused of being not just intolerant, but, deep down, anti-democrats: after all, how can they call a man who has won four consecutive elections decisively (generating a two-thirds majority in parliament on each occasion) an autocrat? What’s more, how can they mind the fact that he is building up a middle-class constituency (or so the justification of corruption by Orbán’s in-house intellectuals runs) – or, if that doesn’t sound right, how about the fact that everyone is corrupt anyway, <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/hungary-new-yorker-rod-dreher-viktor-orban-conservatism/\">in eastern Europe</a>?</p> <p>If such rationalizations sound curiously Trumpist, that’s because they are. After all, the conservative and religious fellow travelers of the 45th president also were never short of reasons to excuse his power- and money-grabbing. Nobody is denying that Orbán has genuine followers, just like Trump does. Yet Orbán’s claim to a great democratic mandate is dented by the fact that recent elections, while being free, have been utterly unfair: the main opposition candidate was literally given five minutes on state TV during the entire campaign; state resources were shamelessly used to promote the governing party; and, not least, the electoral system is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/06/orban-fidesz-autocratic-hungary-illiberal-democracy/\">rigged in the incumbents’ favor</a>. Contrary to the cliche of a crazy left cancelling anyone who disagrees, the problem is not that states cannot set their own immigration policies, or that there can be no debate about family policy – it’s that Orbán has unleashed one hate campaign after another, most recently with a government “protect the children” campaign associating homosexuality with pedophilia.</p> <p>Had Trump ever built a political theme park, it may well have resembled Orbánistan.

He prefers to double fist – a rubber banana in one hand, a Martian with protruding ears in the other – and chews with the same desperation as Jared Leto in Requiem for a Dream, awaiting his next fix.</p> <p>“Look, a TOOF!” my pre-schooler shouts triumphantly, as each new one pokes through the baby’s gums.</p> <p>As my children are gaining teeth, going through a rite of passage that symbolically, and practically, gives them independence, I am losing mine – or at the very least winnowing them down. Nightly, I clench or grind, occasionally waking from a lost-tooth dream, probably spurred on by my horrendous pre-bed habit of scrolling through my newsfeed and feeling utterly powerless, and the constant, shape-shifting anxiety that has become the norm for pandemic-era parents.</p> <p>Grinding and clenching, I learned, <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01812/full\">has been linked</a> to lost-tooth dreams – those who grind are more likely to have them, suggesting that your unconscious incorporates dental irritation into your dreams, and not necessarily the opposite, that grinding is a symbolic manifestation of anxiety. My grinding and clenching fluctuates according to my general stress level. I was both alarmed and comforted to learn that many of my friends also suffer from bruxism, or the condition of gnashing, clenching or grinding your teeth, either while awake or asleep.</p> <p>“I’ve been clenching so much I went to the dentist and I now need orthodonture,” one told me. “Like I’m in seventh grade.”</p> <p>Another was certain she had a cavity. Nope, just grinding. A third came back from a routine dental visit with a mouth guard to wear at night. And an executive at a national dental care company told me that while the normal prevalence of bruxism is 10% for adults, it’s now up to 30% for their patients.</p> <p>“Huge grinding uptick,” affirms my friend’s father, who’s been practicing dentistry in Miami for four decades. “Lots of broken teeth. Parents of schoolchildren are very stressed dentally, too.” It’s Covid-related, yes, but also Covid-parenting-related.</p> <p>“Gain a child, lose a tooth” – while not entirely founded, the saying does have some, erm, teeth to it. We parents may not be spitting out teeth left and right, but there does seem to be some sort of poeticism to all of this, including pre-pandemic data that points to a real link between motherhood and dental problems. One <a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2005/march/nyu_dental_researcher_finds.html\">study</a> found that the risk of periodontal disease and untreated cavities in mothers rose with their number of children. There are many more potential links.</p> <p>Parents are doomed to a life of relinquishing control – try as you might, you can’t dictate when your children go to sleep, if they experience pain, how quickly they grow up. Throw in a pandemic and an unstable world, and it’s a wonder we’re not all gumming down mashed banana.</p> <p>It’s something, this odd connection between teeth and parenthood, that, even 86 years ago, wasn’t lost on Jung.</p> <p>“The lost tooth also can mean that one loses a certain conception of things, a hitherto valid opinion or attitude,” he wrote in a letter about the symbolism of teeth in dreams. “For instance pregnancy can have such an effect that one loses one’s grip on the psychic continuity as the physiological condition takes the lead over the mind.”</p> <p>Have I lost my grip on my psychic continuity? Judging from my late-night Amazon binge-buying of baby teething toys as I grind away, I’d wager a conservative yes.</p> <p>So, what is to be done? For those of us who don’t want to get fitted for a night guard, says the Miami dentist, the key appears to be to finding ways to decrease stress, “with massage and exercises relaxing the muscles around the head and neck”.</p> <p>With this very pleasant directive in mind, I’ve been winding down my days by turning my phone off and pulverizing my neck with an electronic massager. The last few nights, I’ve awoken not from a bad, gumless dream, but by the cries of the baby, working through his next tooth. As I rock, and shush, and soothe, it dawns on me that all the salves I’m giving him – from the lullabies to the chew toys – will never control the underlying issue: that he’s growing up, and I can’t do a thing to stop it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sophie Brickman is a contributor to the New Yorker, the New York Times and other publications, and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Unplugged-Mothers-Balance-Digital/dp/0062966480/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">Baby, Unplugged: One Mother’s Search for Balance, Reason, and Sanity in the Digital Age</a></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/24/kurt-zouma-admits-animal-welfare-offences-over-cat-kicking-video","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T10:10:38Z","webTitle":"Kurt Zouma admits animal welfare offences over cat kicking video","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/24/kurt-zouma-admits-animal-welfare-offences-over-cat-kicking-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/24/kurt-zouma-admits-animal-welfare-offences-over-cat-kicking-video","fields":{"headline":"Kurt Zouma admits animal welfare offences over cat kicking video","trailText":"West Ham defender pleads guilty after footage showed him kicking and slapping his pet","body":"<p>The West Ham defender and French international Kurt Zouma has pleaded guilty to animal welfare offences over video footage showing him kicking and slapping a cat.</p> <p>Zouma appeared at Thames magistrates court alongside his brother Yoan who filmed the video that appeared on social media in February to widespread condemnation.

Saïd Benrahma has been inconsistent since joining two years ago, Nikola Vlasic has struggled since his move from CSKA Moscow last summer, and Moyes knows all about Lingard’s quality. The 29-year-old’s availability without a fee makes his appeal obvious.</p> \n<p>Lingard made a huge impact when he spent the second half of the 2020-21 season at West Ham, scoring nine goals and helping them finish sixth. However, Moyes was frustrated in his attempts to sign the England international last summer. Lingard decided to give it another go at Old Trafford, only to find himself on the sidelines for much of the season.</p> \n<p>West Ham, whose determination to sign a striker to compete with Michail Antonio has seen them target Chelsea’s Armando Broja, Arsenal’s Eddie Nketiah <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/west-ham-target-summer-move-for-aston-villa-striker-ollie-watkins\">and Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins</a>, also failed to convince United to part with Lingard in January. It has been a frustrating pursuit and that will come into their thinking when they decide whether to solidify their interest this summer.</p> \n<p>Moyes will need to see clear signs that Lingard, who is reportedly no longer of interest to Newcastle, wants to play for West Ham. The manager must also consider whether there are younger alternatives available. Hull’s Keane Lewis-Potter is a target.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, if Lingard is ready to return to east London then a move would appear to suit both parties.

With its encyclopedic detail and commanding narration by Charles Dance, this feels like a film for second world war buffs and aviation enthusiasts. Everyone else will stay for the interviews with the now elderly men who flew bombers as lads (teenagers some of them) at terrifying odds: 55,573 airmen out of 125,000 were killed during the war.

Another says he couldn’t talk about his experiences after the war. “People looked at you like you were a murderer.” For another, evidence of the Nazis’ crimes in the concentration camps made it easier for him to justify what he’d been ordered to do.

The fact that authorities say the shooting was “politically motivated” and that David Chou – the 68-year-old suspect with Taiwanese roots – was driven by anti-Taiwanese hate and upset about tensions between China and Taiwan has only intensified the pain. </p> <p>“We are all shocked that it went to this level of violence … that someone would bring a gun and shoot up a church,” Tsai said. “This echoes much of the issues that America as a whole has had to deal with: gun violence, race relations and the effects of misinformation.”</p> <p>Chou, of Las Vegas, came to a lunch held by Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian church in Orange county, where he chained the doors shut and hid firebombs before mingling with churchgoers then opening fire, according to officials.

His family was reportedly among those forcibly removed from mainland China to Taiwan some time after 1948. He had ties to an organization opposed to Taiwan’s independence from China, Taiwanese media have reported, but Orange county officials believe he acted alone.</p> <p>The shooting has renewed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-condemns-california-church-shooting\">global scrutiny</a> of China’s rhetoric on Taiwan, which Beijing considers a breakaway province, and prompted condemnation from the Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen, who described the violence as a politically motivated hate incident. Among Taiwanese-Americans in California, it has also heightened fears, particularly for older first-generation immigrants, and put conversations about Taiwanese identity at the forefront. Many of those present in the church were part of the first generation to immigrate to the US, Tsai said, and escaped persecution in Taiwan.</p> <p>“They understand what it was like to have lived in martial law. This generation remembers this lived experience of trauma and identity suppression,” he said. “This is the generation that was blacklisted for speaking out in the US in support of Taiwan, this is the generation that couldn’t go back to visit their own parents sometimes for fear of being jailed.”</p> <p>Nikki DePaola, a board member with the Taiwanese United Fund, said the shooting felt like a direct attack on Taiwanese identity, and has forced her group to consider the possibility of future violence.</p> <p>“The intention of an attack like this is to suppress the identity of being Taiwanese,” she said. “From a practical standpoint … our organization puts on events and now we have to factor in that there are bad actors out there who don’t want us to amplify Taiwanese culture.”</p> <p>Amy Liao, a Philadelphia-based community health professional who had multiple family members in the church, said she suspected for some relatives the shooting would bring up fears about the military police. “Our elders lived through decades of martial law,” she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7fa22e448f0c6adc4f26eb864b2a65f997a9d81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7fa22e448f0c6adc4f26eb864b2a65f997a9d81/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A closeup shot of a bouquet of flowers, one of many left outside a church.

We’ve had healthy productive discussions even though we ended up not agreeing, we didn’t break out into a gun fight.”</p> <p>The community has come together with the church offering mental health support, cultural groups pledging to help those affected by the shooting and a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-dr-chengs-family\">fundraiser</a> for Cheng’s family raising more than $730,000. DePaola said she was hopeful about how people will move forward.</p> <p>“We will band together in acts of solidarity, I think that’s a very Taiwanese thing to do, and I think coming out of this there is going to be a feeling of we are not going to let an act of terrorism cast doubt on our Taiwanese identity. We are not going to be afraid to say we are Taiwanese.”</p> <p>Amy Liao, who gave birth the same day of the shooting, takes comfort in what the community has overcome in the past. During a global Taiwanese diaspora event several years ago, her parents were involved in a deadly bus accident. People, even those who didn’t know them personally, stepped up to offer support.</p> <p>“This event and the many years of recovery brought many of the families closer together. I have witnessed how tragedy can strengthen community and revive faith, and imagine similar impact here,” she said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/may/24/alice-cooper-review-cult-tour-swansea-arena","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T09:59:51Z","webTitle":"Alice Cooper review – guillotine-wielding rocker is no longer a cut above","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/24/alice-cooper-review-cult-tour-swansea-arena","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/may/24/alice-cooper-review-cult-tour-swansea-arena","fields":{"headline":"Alice Cooper review – guillotine-wielding rocker is no longer a cut above","trailText":"The shock-rock superstar delivers a fine spectacle, but his varied back catalogue gets homogenised on this arena tour","body":"<p>The man on stage has died this way before.

Now the Mail has decided to <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/saturdays-national-newspaper-front-pages-12427754\">wipe the whole story off the front page altogether</a>.</p> <p>Most shocking is the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pm-called-sue-gray-to-meeting-and-suggested-she-abandon-report-p830t7szs\">allegation in the Times</a> that Sue Gray was “pressured” to drop her report in the No 10 meeting. Since “I’m waiting for Sue Gray” has become a playground joke answer to “Did you do it?”, the public outrage at gagging her would have been unsurvivable. But that shows how utterly out of touch the whole fetid Downing Street outfit has become – however many times they shuffle the deckchairs and job titles.</p> <p>Tomorrow another episode of the great stink in Tory Westminster will be revived when the committee on standards, chaired by Chris Bryant, produces its new code of conduct – it’s likely to look at ministerial rules, MPs’ second jobs and lobbying for private interests. That revives the stench of the Owen Paterson lobbying scandal. Will Johnson again try to weaken its recommendations? Bryant has recused himself from chairing the upcoming privileges committee investigation into whether Johnson lied to parliament. It will ponder the precise philosophical meaning of what constitutes “knowingly” or “deliberately” misleading MPs.</p> <p>The court of public opinion is all that matters to Tory MPs anxiously guarding their seats, as two key byelections approach. Labour MPs visiting Wakefield report that Partygate is alive and angrily kicking away Tory votes. So much for Downing Street briefers shrugging it off as yesterday’s news, too trivial for most voters in the face of a cost of living crisis. But how bad does their private Partygate polling need to be for them to prefer that people talk about soaring energy bills and hungry families forced into food banks?</p> <p>I don’t know how many lives a greased piglet has, but the prime minister still is a long way from rescue. In the meantime, just observe the contemptible silence of Tory MPs devoid of any sense of propriety, only eyeing their electoral chances. The former head of the civil service, Bob Kerslake, had it right last night when he asked: “Could you imagine any of this happening when Theresa May was prime minister?”</p> <p>For Labour, however, a damaged and disgraced prime minister, propped up by despicably dishonourable Tory MPs, is nothing but good news.</p> <p>• Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>• This article was amended on 24 May 2022. Chris Bryant chairs the committee on standards, not the committee on standards in public life as an error introduced during the editing process led an earlier version to say.

He said the company had fallen below community standards and expectations in a number of ways, including by selling insurance to children.</p> \n<p>Hayne said ACBF fell below community expectations by selling a “low value product” where customers received just 13% of the premiums they paid – the lowest percentage discovered in a survey conducted by the corporate regulator.</p> \n<p>Since 2018 the newly established Australian Financial Complaints Authority (Afca) has received 700 complaints about ACBF-Youpla. It has made 176 determinations, all in favour of the complainants, citing “deceptive and misleading” and “unconscionable” conduct. Afca estimates it has awarded $1.4m worth of refunds to clients of ACBF-Youpla, which it says still owed $500,000 in unpaid refunds at the time of liquidation.</p> \n<p>After the royal commission, consumer advocates repeatedly warned governments that ACBF-Youpla was teetering, and that if it were to go broke thousands of people would be left high and dry.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"290ac64682450e3a5c453b129e8af9007c406c71\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/290ac64682450e3a5c453b129e8af9007c406c71/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The luxury block at Gulf Harbour on the Whangaparoa peninsual, north of Auckland, where Ron Pattenden has an apartment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The luxury block at Gulf Harbour on the Whangaparāoa peninsula, north of Auckland, where Ron Pattenden has an apartment.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fiona Goodall/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In October last year, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) launched legal action against ACBF-Youpla, accusing it of misleading and deceiving customers by using marketing material that painted it as an Aboriginal organisation and by promising a lump sum payment at time of death, when in fact only funeral expenses were covered. Since the collapse of the group this litigation has been put on hold.</p> \n<p>By the time ACBF was hauled before the royal commission in 2018, Pattenden was no longer officially involved in the company. But documents seen by Guardian Australia suggest he was still keen to exert influence over its affairs, apparently to ensure it could continue to pay moneys it owed to him.</p> \n<h2>‘Cut back on staffing’</h2> \n<p>Pattenden didn’t appear before the royal commission when it sat in Darwin in July 2018 to examine the affairs of ACBF.</p> \n<p>Instead, the hot seat was occupied by Jones, an ACBF director. Counsel assisting the commission, Rowena Orr QC, subjected him to a withering cross-examination over the company’s business practices, as well as allegations that it represented itself as Aboriginal-owned when it was controlled by white people.</p> \n<p>Despite the public battering, Jones and his group went on to buy ACBF from Pattenden, formalising the deal in November 2018.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"97bb819d89976bab61a9c440cb809bd0eca978d8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97bb819d89976bab61a9c440cb809bd0eca978d8/0_78_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryn Jones from ACBF outside the royal commission in Darwin, in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bryn Jones from ACBF outside the royal commission in Darwin, in 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Campbell/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pattenden agreed to bankroll the sale himself, accepting repayments by instalment. In addition, Jones and his consortium of buyers agreed to use any surplus money in the business to pay him back.</p> \n<p>But in the wake of the royal commission, the federal government and the corporate regulator, which had for decades let ACBF carry on business, had finally had enough. In February 2019 they announced they would close the legislative loophole which had allowed ACBF to operate without a financial services licence (as recommended by the commission), constricting its ability to turn profit. In emails to the directors, Pattenden was keen for the company to try to get a licence, apparently to ensure they could pay back money owed to him.</p> \n<p>“How far away do you think the AFSL licence will take to achieve or to be able to operate under,” he asked in his letter of April 2019. “Have you got sales lined up in the pipeline and how many, I am hearing this could be a large number.”</p> \n<p>He also complained about the lack of any surplus payments by the company to him.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/arron-wilson-was-told-his-funeral-fund-would-help-his-family-now-his-money-is-gone\">Arron Wilson was told his funeral fund would help his family – now his money is gone</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Could you explain the reason for not even a dollar extra over the minimum amount payable off the sale loan amount.”</p> \n<p>ACBF has been unsuccessful in its attempts to get a licence.</p> \n<p>Pattenden expressed frustration that the company was struggling to stay solvent, apparently worried about its ability to pay his companies what was owed.</p> \n<p>“As the financier with three million on the line there are a lot of questions I need answers to that I am legally entitled to ask … you have a legal obligation to report and update me on important changes in the business, the Company’s financial state, again I say at present I am being told nothing,” Pattenden wrote on 19 April 2019.</p> \n<p>“From what I am hearing and now have no say in how you run the companies, I can only suggest and recommend you look at and reduce your overheads dramatically, legal fees are astronomical, but understand some of these cannot be avoided.</p> \n<p>“Cut back on staffing until you have the income coming in via sales to warrant them, i.e. make redundant all dead wood.”</p> \n<p>The consortium made 15 “repayments” to Pattenden, but stopped abruptly after claiming that Youpla had overpaid Crown, Pattenden’s other company, in a separate transaction for insurance premiums. Pattenden rejected the idea Crown owed Youpla money as “someone’s wrong theory” and suggested Youpla instead pay Crown from a “$300,000 slush fund” it held. This fund was held as a buffer to allow the company to pay out quickly to Aboriginal families for funeral expenses.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b85dfe8a8401c6a5b73b167604325adfad3c6b3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b85dfe8a8401c6a5b73b167604325adfad3c6b3/0_332_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kuku Yalanji elder Daphne Naden at her home in Mossman, Queensland.

Before 2001, when it held insurance with Axa, the French multinational was making more than $300,000 from the $1m a year ACBF paid in premiums.</p> \n<p>But in March 2001, Axa pulled its coverage, telling ACBF that “continuing the relationship between AXA and ACBF will not be in either AXA’s or ACBF’s, or more importantly in the ACBF members’ best interests”.</p> \n<p>Pattenden couldn’t find another insurer to take on ACBF, so in 2002 he set up his own – Crown – based in Vanuatu, where insurance companies needed only $200,000 in capital, compared with the $5m required in Australia.</p> \n<p>Crown stepped into Axa’s shoes. ACBF paid Crown premiums, and in return Crown funded the benefits that ACBF paid when members died.</p> \n<p>Pattenden resigned as a director of ACBF in 2002, although he continued to own most of the company.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the Australian Taxation Office did not like the new insurance arrangement.</p> \n<p>The ATO contended that Crown was part of the same group and was doing business in Australia. In 2008, after a five-year investigation, it slugged Crown and Pattenden with tax bills of at least $6.4m – later media coverage put the total at $15m – and banned him from leaving the country.</p> \n<p>Pattenden fought back, eventually succeeding in the federal court in overturning the departure prohibition order. In November 2011, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal also found in his favour, ruling that Crown was not doing business in Australia and therefore did not have a tax bill to pay there.</p> \n<p>In March 2010, he embarked on a complex restructuring of his business empire that resulted in ownership of ACBF and Crown moving from him personally to Just Solutions.</p> \n<p>Pattenden then sold his shares in Just Solutions to a new Vanuatu company he also controlled, Bu Teck.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/government-under-pressure-to-help-aboriginal-families-after-predatory-funeral-insurers-collapse\">Government under pressure to help Aboriginal families after ‘predatory’ funeral insurer’s collapse</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The purchase price was $29.8m, but Pattenden didn’t receive any money on the day. Instead, the amount was treated as a loan from Pattenden to Bu Teck. The effect was to transform the streams of dividends from ACBF and the profits from Crown’s insurance premiums into repayments of a loan, rendering them free from tax. As a result, over the decade between 2010 and 2020, Pattenden received<strong> </strong>almost $21m that ultimately came from ACBF customers, and was able to legally avoid paying any tax in NZ, Australia or Vanuatu.</p> \n<p>The restructuring also made Pattenden a managing director of ACBF again, according to documents seen by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>A memorandum of understanding from 26 March 2010, signed by Pattenden on his own behalf and as director of Just Solutions, records: “Just Solutions Limited undertakes to ensure Ron Pattenden remains as managing director of Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund until such time as he is unwilling or unable to continue.”</p> \n<p>Given his previous dealings with the ATO, Pattenden was aware that any suggestion Crown was telling ACBF what to do could be a problem. He also received advice in 2013 that Crown “cannot be operating a business in Australia” without risking tax and warning him against sending an associate to meet ACBF in Australia, with instructions from Crown.</p> \n<h2>Can any money be retrieved?</h2> \n<p>By 2019, the federal opposition, Asic and NGOs who had been supporting some of the thousands of worried Aboriginal policyholders, all expressed concerns about ACBF-Youpla’s solvency across the three funeral funds it was operating.</p> \n<p>Even as the position of the funds worsened, it continued to pay insurance premiums due to Crown. Crown received a total of $1.27m in premiums from Youpla in 2019 and 2020, company accounts show.</p> \n<p>Fund No 2 collapsed in November last year, and the other two followed in March. Now, more than 13,000 people have likely lost all that they have paid into the fund, as the liquidators pick through what’s left.</p> \n<p>In a report to creditors in March, the group’s liquidator, David Stimpson, said he was “aware of allegations of funds transferred improperly out of the group”.</p> \n<p>“These allegations will be investigated and recovery action pursued if appropriate,” he said in his report. He said he had begun gathering records “to properly determine if monies have been improperly transferred out of the group, the dollar value involved and the prospects of recovering some or all of those funds”.</p> \n<p>Asked by Guardian Australia about transfers of money to Pattenden’s Vanuatu companies, he said these would be “part of a thorough investigation that is being undertaken”.</p> \n<p>He expects the investigation to take more than a year.</p> \n<p>“There are investigations to be conducted, legal advice on a number of matters to be obtained, court applications and potentially litigation to undertake to recover funds into the administration,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Those all, inherently, take time.”</p> \n<p>In the meantime, Stimpson is seeking funding to cover existing claims.</p> \n<p>“I can’t tell you where the funding will/may come from, but I am looking at more than one avenue for funding and am hopeful it will come together soon,” he said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/may/24/not-now-review-oran-mor-david-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T09:17:35Z","webTitle":"Not Now review – sparky comedy about Belfast, belonging and the Bard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/24/not-now-review-oran-mor-david-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/may/24/not-now-review-oran-mor-david-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Not Now review – sparky comedy about Belfast, belonging and the Bard","trailText":"An aspiring actor considers a move from Northern Ireland to London<strong> </strong>in this witty two-hander by Cyprus Avenue’s David Ireland","body":"<p>Matthew is nervously running through his lines as he readies himself for a drama-school audition.

That makes it difficult to get breastfeeding started in the critical early days after birth.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Racism is another significant barrier to accessing breastfeeding support.</p> <p>For generations under slavery, Black American mothers who had recently given birth were frequently forced to serve as wet nurses for their oppressors’ families, which meant their own children often went hungry. The legacy of that horrifying history is still present in Black communities today.</p> <p>“We have long had an aversion to nursing because of wet nursing during slavery,” said Crystal Saiyge, a parent and DEI consultant in Hyattsville, Maryland. “Even though slavery itself ended, oppression never did, and the things that racism created in this country are still ongoing,” said Sahira Long, a pediatrician and medical director of the Children’s National East of the River Lactation Support Center in Washington, DC.</p> <p>Ana Rodney, who runs <a href=\"https://www.momcares.org/\">MOMCares,</a> a Baltimore organization that provides baby supplies and support to new mothers in the city’s Black community, said the formula shortage has hit many families hard. Black women don’t get breastfeeding encouragement or support from the white medical community, Rodney said.</p> <p>Breastfeeding requires time, “being able to sit with your baby, being able to bond with your baby and working on your milk supply, not being able to go back to work”, she said. “It’s not that easy for some of us, even if we want to.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a2633aedc6bc46f6d7b1fca49e0702c9d44e2c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a2633aedc6bc46f6d7b1fca49e0702c9d44e2c6/0_217_2449_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Rodney with her son, Asher, at home in Baltimore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ana Rodney with her son, Asher, at home in Baltimore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Native communities’ long history of racism and oppression, starting from the first contact with European settlers, has inhibited breastfeeding among Indigenous mothers today, Goldhammer said. “It was mothers and children that were separated, whether that was as a result of genocide, removal, relocation,” she said, and breastfeeding was just one of the vital traditions lost in that time.</p> <p>When Goldhammer had her baby 13 years ago, “there was a fair amount of breastfeeding support out there, but not necessarily for Native moms – it was always very white-centered,” she said. Goldhammer soon became a board-certified lactation consultant who offers culturally competent care and training for peer breastfeeding supporters in Native communities.</p> <p>“Lactation consultants are overwhelmingly white women, and that is why it has been white women who have seen the increases in breastfeeding … because that’s who the support was geared toward,” she said.</p> <p>“Our moms of color were not given those same encouragements, were not talked to about breastfeeding.

But if left unchecked, it could give rise to a new generation of drug traffickers, and refortify clans of old, much like the shifting of drug routes from the Caribbean to Central America did at the turn of the century.</p> <p>“If we aren’t careful, we could be flooded,” said an anti-narcotics official. “We don’t want to end up like Colombia.”</p> <p>The surge in domestic cocaine production comes as the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/juan-orlando-hernandez-drugs-biden-trump-obama-subpoena\">faces trial in the United States</a>, where prosecutors accuse Hernández, who left office after two terms in January, of running the country as a “narco-state”.</p> <p>The department of Colón, where the plantation visited by the Guardian was located, has been damned by geography: flatlands deforested by cattle ranchers provided the perfect landing strip for planes, and miles upon miles of remote, Caribbean coastline the ideal docking point for boats, packed to the brim with cocaine.</p> <p>But in recent years, many drug trafficking routes have shifted away from Honduras. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/15/honduras-human-rights-war-drugs\">once-ubiquitous sound of planes</a> or go-fast boats buzzing along the coast at night is much less common. Today, it’s the mountainous terrain of the department’s interior that bears the curse.</p> <p>Authorities began discovering coca plantations on mountainsides in the far eastern reaches of Colón in 2020. The traffickers seek out remote, desolate places, often within natural reserves.</p> <p>Anti-narcotics agents have been forced to hike as many as eight hours to arrive at a coca plantation, placing them at risk of an ambush and giving anyone there a chance to escape into the jungle. One remote plantation even had a wifi antenna installed so that workers could be warned of an impending raid in an area without cellphone service.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1eca0a09be8ba1d170842edfd26009cf74606658\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eca0a09be8ba1d170842edfd26009cf74606658/0_16_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pack of the seized cocaine with a Honduran flag and an image of a cockerel on the front.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pack of the seized cocaine with a Honduran flag and an image of a cockerel on the front.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orlando Sierra/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arrests have been few and far between, and the Colombian agronomists who oversee the coca production, and “cooks” who process the leaves into paste, have evaded capture entirely. “In Colón, there are many Colombians working on the plantations,” said the inspector. “[The narcos] take good care of the cooks because their operations depend on them.”</p> <p>Nonetheless, authorities told the Guardian they have gathered sufficient intelligence to determine that a mix of family drug clans new and old are behind the plantations. The most prominent example is the Montes-Bobadilla family, which has allegedly trafficked cocaine for decades. On 15 May, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb7k7/honduras-cocaine-herlinda-bobadilla-arrested-shootout\">the family matriarch was captured</a> and one of her sons killed just two weeks after the department of justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/rewards-offered-capture-and-conviction-leaders-honduran-drug-trafficking-operation\">offered a reward for information</a> leading to their arrest.</p> <p>During the cocaine gold rush that followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/crisis-of-honduras-democracy-has-roots-in-us-tacit-support-for-2009-coup\">a 2009 military coup</a>, the Montes-Bobadilla family allegedly operated one of the largest cocaine warehouses in the country, receiving shipments in their home town of Limón before passing them on to other clans who transported the drugs to Guatemala and beyond.</p> <p>Authorities noted that traffickers began experimenting with coca plants in Honduras about a decade ago, but that the discovery of plantations was sporadic until the past couple of years. There was so much cocaine flowing freely through the country in that past that there wasn’t much reason to adjust tactics. But increased interdiction efforts and the disruption of trafficking networks finally forced some to make the change.</p> <p>“Each generation perfects its methods, improves its tactics,” said the official. The coca plantations present less risk and the potential for higher reward. A kilo of cocaine is currently worth about $13,000 in Honduras, according to authorities. A trafficker typically earns between $500 and $1,500 a kilo passed on to the next group in the chain. But a kilo produced domestically could net a profit of over $10,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/01/honduras-juan-orlando-hernandez-prison-murder-drug-trial\">What links a prison murder, a New York drug trial and the Honduras president?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the plantation visited by the Guardian, red, coffee-bean-like seeds adorned the wilting bushes and the leaves had a yellow-green tint, indicating that they were ready to be harvested, which is done roughly every three months.

At other plantations, agents have discovered fully mature bushes standing 2.5m tall or more, suggesting that they were at least a couple years old and had already been harvested many times.</p> <p>Yields per acre vary widely, but even a small plantation like this one could come to generate annual profits in the hundreds of thousands of dollars – a tidy sum in a country where the vast majority of the population earns only a couple of hundred dollars per month.</p> <p>The resilience of certain drug clans and the surge of coca plantations make plain the Whac-A-Mole nature of the war on drugs: arrest one drug lord and the next in line steps up.

In fact, there are fair, green solutions to this crisis staring us right in the face.</p> <p>And they’re solutions that should get support from business. Over the past few days, the trickle of increasingly panicked messages from businesses on the cost of living crisis has become a flood. Already alarmed by the Bank of England’s warning of a looming recession and “apocalyptic” price rises, business leaders were spooked when Sunak’s speech at the CBI last week left many people wondering if he understood the scale of the challenge. At the weekend, the <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2022-05-22/eon-boss-warns-40-of-customers-could-fall-into-fuel-poverty?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=9644ed9337-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_05_23_03_09&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-9644ed9337-190349797\">chief executive of E.On</a> – a company not known for its economic radicalism – declared that “the most important thing is that the government intervenes” and the chancellor must “tax those with the broadest shoulders”.</p> <p>Consumer spending drives the economy. If people are struggling to pay their gas bills, they have less money in their pockets to spend on the high street or a restaurant meal. Which is why, as the CBI’s director general, Tony Danker, has said, Sunak’s first step should be investing in social security via increases in universal credit and legacy benefits to prevent families falling into destitution. This would also help to stabilise the economy, not fuel inflation. Income tax cuts wouldn’t help here. They’d give a big bonus to the rich, but the poorest, already facing the choice between heating and eating, wouldn’t benefit at all.</p> <p>Second, we need a serious industrial strategy to boost confidence, give long-term business certainty and restore investment in the UK’s productive capacity. Sunak promised to increase private investment with a “super-deduction” incentive, but in fact it fell in the last quarter. To make this long-term vision work, Sunak should <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/regional-development/2022/02/why-we-need-to-break-up-the-treasury\">break up the Treasury</a> and form a new Ministry for Economic Strategy with the target to drive investment-led, green growth.</p> <p>Third, rather than continuing to slip on our green ambitions, we must double down. Every home newly insulated and each wind turbine erected across the UK will reduce household fuel bills. We need to make this investment before 2050 anyway – so let’s do it now, to support the economy and bring down electricity bills sooner. As Danker said,<strong> </strong>non-inflationary, green investment opportunities are there for the taking, but government must “confirm them, launch them and fund them”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/windfall-tax-energy-companies-bills-uk-consumers\">Forget a gimmicky windfall tax.

We need an effective civil service, not one with a recruitment freeze and job cuts hanging over it. That collaboration, after all, not greed or capitalism, is what got us Covid vaccines and could bring lower energy bills too.</p> <p>Next, the government must make clear to businesses that just as they were supported in the pandemic, now companies must themselves act responsibly. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/bank-of-england-boss-calls-for-wage-restraint-to-help-control-inflation\">misrepresented the problem</a> when he said wage restraint was most important in stopping inflation. In fact, companies can reduce their profits too, to keep prices down – as the Bank has since acknowledged.</p> <p>Profits have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-uk-competition-report-2022\">gone up over recent decades</a>, particularly in uncompetitive, concentrated sectors. In a particularly egregious example, petrol stations <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61484102\">haven’t passed on</a> the fuel duty cut to customers, benefiting their bottom line at the public’s expense. <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/corporate-profits-have-contributed-disproportionately-to-inflation-how-should-policymakers-respond/\">Evidence from the US</a> suggests that recent rising prices have been disproportionately driven by rising profits, not wages. The real issue is that we’ve been too relaxed about some companies in some sectors building too much market power for too long. Their excessive market power is pushing prices higher still.</p> <p>At the same time, the risk of a wage-price spiral is low because of a collapse in trade unionism. The last time inflation was at 9%, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeDibb/status/1526828232967958533?s=20&amp;t=aM9DZgyOlAfEQ7YuHvtH0A\">more than half of workers were in a trade union</a>; today it’s less than a quarter. Consequently, not only are wages failing to keep pace with inflation, but we’re seeing their biggest fall since records began. Instead of forcing workers to take the strain, companies should show profit restraint and cut their dividend payouts.</p> <p>Finally, as fossil fuel companies pile up huge, unexpected profits from the very crisis that is pushing <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/press-releases/33284/\">millions into absolute poverty</a>, it’s fair for the government to redistribute these into welfare and income support. Even the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jesse_Norman/status/1528367097868435456?s=20&amp;t=-LLbbOMXlIPxXRUyRRem6Q\">former Treasury minister Jesse Norman</a> and the CEO of E.On seem to agree. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/windfall-taxes-price-caps-and-vat-cuts-how-nations-are-addressing-europes-energy-crisis\">Like Italy</a>, we should levy a windfall tax on oil companies whose profits have soared merely because of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

A chat over lunch in a local pub or restaurant, then a few photos of him in his element. His agents politely point out this is not ideal. Why not? “Because he’s Brendan Gleeson!” He can no more walk around the centre of Dublin incognito and uninterrupted than could Bono, or the pope.</p> <p>So our rendezvous is relocated to a seafood restaurant at the end of a fishing pier in a village outside Dublin. But even here, within seconds of Gleeson posing for photographs outside, a passerby comes up to say hi. Moments later, a woman shouts: “Oi, Brendan!” from her car across the street and comes over for a selfie and a chat about local broadband provision. Gleeson is obliging, but his agents weren’t kidding.</p> <p>Gleeson has been a screen fixture in Ireland for more than 30 years, an anchor of the local film and television industry who has also worked with the best in the business internationally: Spielberg, Scorsese, Anthony Minghella, Ridley Scott, Danny Boyle, the Coen brothers, you name it. He has played Donald Trump and Winston Churchill. He’s a versatile actor, guaranteed to bring a bit of humanity and dramatic heft, more often than not spiced with a hint of menace, or at least grumpiness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06312201bdf3844a1b62b4f7910f610d10f965ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06312201bdf3844a1b62b4f7910f610d10f965ba/0_0_6064_4034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gleeson playing Donald Trump in The Comey Rule.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gleeson playing Donald Trump in The Comey Rule.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Mark Holzberg/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No wonder then, especially after he took on the character of “Mad-Eye” Moody in the Harry Potter films, anonymity has been hard to find in Ireland. “I remember Robbie Coltrane saying to me: ‘You can forget about walking through an airport again,’” Gleeson says over lunch. “It’s difficult to browse in a shop. It’s a big price to pay and I don’t like it.” It’s not that he doesn’t like people, he says; it’s more that he <em>does</em> like them. “It’s stopped me from being able to people-watch with any great success and comfort. And that’s part of what you really need to do to stay aware of what’s going on.”</p> <p>In real life, Gleeson is neither menacing nor grumpy. He’s so talkative he barely remembers to eat his lunch. He apologises several times for “rambling on”. And he’s serious – until he isn’t. When I tell him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/13/calvary-review-terrific-black-comedy\">his movie Calvary</a> moved me to tears when I recently rewatched it, he immediately replies: “That bad, was it?” You rarely see him laugh on screen, but when he does it’s with his whole face. His eyes narrow and twinkle and his grin is a mile wide. This is exactly the reaction when I ask him about his latest role, and how close it is to the real him: “Ha ha! Ask my wife.”</p> <p>The role is Scott, a somewhat curmudgeonly middle-aged man who is going through a divorce. The show is State of the Union, written by Nick Hornby and directed by Stephen Frears. It’s a bittersweet little comedy series of 10 10-minute encounters between a couple about to go into their weekly marriage counselling session. In the first season (which won three Emmys), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/08/state-of-the-union-review-an-honest-and-perfectly-curated-portrayal-of-marriage\">the couple was Chris O’Dowd and Rosamund Pike</a>. This time, it’s Gleeson and Patricia Clarkson. From the outset, Clarkson’s Ellen is ready to move on. Gleeson’s Scott has apparently not moved on since about 1975. He’s looking forward to retirement, golf and fishing; she’s keeping up with yoga and progressive politics.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbR6an-LcDw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EbR6an-LcDw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbR6an-LcDw</p> <p>“It should come with a health warning in the corner: ‘Any couple who watches it, this could end in divorce,’” Gleeson says, his face consumed by laughter again. “I’ve had friends of mine saying: ‘Jesus. I was looking forward to playing a bit of golf when I retired.’”</p> <p>It made a few ripples in his own marriage, he admits. Gleeson and his wife, Mary, have been married for 40 years and have four grownup sons, two of whom, Domhnall and Brian, are successful actors. He started rehearsing for State of the Union at home, reading the script with his wife. “Myself and Mary used to sit down, and she’d say things like: ‘I’d kill that fella.’ And of course, if you’re playing a part, you have to go into their corner. You have to fight for them. And … there was a spillover. We actually did start fights!” He’s laughing at the memory of it. “Some things [about Scott] are fundamentally against the way I am. So just to establish that. But some of the things, I would say: ‘Hang on a second’ – which would start the row with Mary – ‘he does have a point.’”</p> <p>For extra friction, State of the Union takes place in the type of coffee shop that doesn’t serve cow’s milk or even use the word “coffee” – it’s all “Peruvian special blend”. The barista, Jay (Esco Jouléy), is <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/television/2022/2/18/how-state-unions-nonbinary-barista-challenges-older-couple\">Black, non-binary and asexual</a>. Predictably, Scott and Jay get off to a bad start. It would be easy to label Scott as a privileged, white, middle-aged, cis, male bigot, as his wife does, but then Jay is not exactly pleasant to him either. Gleeson praises the way both sides are called out for their assumptions. “This blanket kind of pardon for everybody, because they are part of a group that had been discriminated against, while laudable in the beginning, it doesn’t hold water,” he says. “Because it’s a ludicrous concept. There are people who are deeply flawed in every single corner of humanity.” Through the 10 episodes, Scott and Jay’s relationship develops into something more interesting. Scott might be lazy and blinkered but he’s actually not a bigot, Gleeson suggests. “That’s what I thought was the most beautiful part of him.”</p> <p>Doing the show put Gleeson on a personal learning curve. He had never worked with non-binary people before, he says. “I did not use the pronouns ‘them/they’ for gender-fluid people because I haven’t been in a situation where it was either expected or demanded or, in fact, even introduced as a possibility. So with Esco I kept, and I still do, just going to the wrong pronoun.” He then does it straight away: “But he – <em>they</em>! – said: ‘I don’t care. I find it interesting who you see me as today.’”</p> <p>Gleeson freely admits he found Jouléy’s non-binary identity a challenge at first. “He [he means ‘they’] used to dress differently and present himself differently every episode, which was fascinating.” But also confusing. The tendency to mentally assign gender to people you meet is hard to shake at his age (67), he suggests. “Finally I got it, and it was exhilarating. It was thrilling to be brought into a new awareness in that way.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"904f5f796e782d5b2fb72b70f13e3a7d1d876d5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/904f5f796e782d5b2fb72b70f13e3a7d1d876d5f/0_397_6585_3950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Colin Farrell in In Bruges.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Colin Farrell in In Bruges.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gleeson can understand the tendency in men to just slow down and stop learning as they approach retirement age – more so than women, perhaps: “There is nothing wrong with just sitting back and smelling the coffee.” Even if it’s Peruvian special blend, perhaps. But that doesn’t seem to apply to him personally. He’s as busy as ever. Or at least as busy as he wants to be. The dialogue recording he was doing in Dublin that morning was for The Banshees of Inisherin, his long-awaited reunion with Colin Farrell and writer/director Martin McDonagh. The last time the three of them worked together was 14 years ago on In Bruges, an odd-couple comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/18/my-favourite-film-in-bruges\">about hitmen hiding out in the Belgian town</a>, and a high point of modern Irish cinema. All he can say about the new film is that it’s “about two friends going in two different directions and the pain of it”.</p> <p>McDonagh and his older brother, John Michael McDonagh, have provided quite a few of these high points of modern Irish cinema, and Gleeson has figured in most of them. It began with Martin’s Oscar-winning short Six Shooter in 2004. With John, Gleeson made 2011’s The Guard – a different type of odd-couple comedy, with Don Cheadle – and 2014’s Calvary, in which he plays a kindly village priest who is condemned to die for the sins of the Catholic church. Between them, the McDonagh brothers seem to have found a rich seam of Irish storytelling, balancing earthy comedy and even action thrills with trickier spiritual and existential questions. It’s a tone Gleeson seems perfectly suited to. Do they take it in turns? Do they argue over him?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4845db1ae91bc51d66e1b74aabc60dd11070351\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4845db1ae91bc51d66e1b74aabc60dd11070351/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Guard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Optimum Releasing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“No, they don’t fight over me!” All the same, he’s discreet about them. “To try to explain two brothers, and then to meet the two brothers, would be a very, very silly thing to do.”</p> <p>Working with McDonagh and Farrell again was a delight. “We had all learned a little bit, maybe, in the meantime and matured in different ways, but ultimately, the centre of everything was absolutely as if In Bruges happened yesterday.”</p> <p>This could be his last collaboration with McDonagh, says Gleeson with some regret: “His muse will take him elsewhere.” After the success of In Bruges, McDonagh migrated to Hollywood, where he struck Oscar gold with 2017’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. “Was I aggrieved I wasn’t in it? No! Was I jealous? Yes. Would I like to have been in it? Of course. But I understand why not, too.”</p> <p>Gleeson can take it at this stage in his career. He started late: he did not take up full-time acting until he was 34. Before that he was a teacher. He had performed on stage since school days, and continued acting in amateur groups including Paul Mercier’s revolutionary Passion Machine theatre company, which specialised in accessible, original stories of modern Irish life. “I really did think that the professional stage was for other people,” he says. “I’m not sure why, it just felt as if it was a little … exotic. And I would go then to plays and think: ‘I’m not sure that was the right take on that at all.’ I kind of felt like: ‘I could do better than that.’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03da9c77b4a98799696bc1d6dd0845b99a6ad688\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03da9c77b4a98799696bc1d6dd0845b99a6ad688/0_0_2000_1277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Kelly Reilly in Calvary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Kelly Reilly in Calvary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Momentum Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He could. He graduated from stage to screen, including a part in the top Irish soap opera Glenroe. That was his first taste of celebrity. A stronger dose came in 1995, with Braveheart, in which he played Mel Gibson’s stalwart, rock-throwing sidekick Hamish. This was back when Gibson was a major force in cinema, with a relatively unblemished copybook. He was “a force of nature”, Gleeson recalls. “He had a really collaborative spirit, very driven, very much in charge, but his energy levels were unbelievable.” He’s still proud of the film, if not his part in it. “I didn’t really realise I was supposed to lose any weight. I think Mel assumed I would have known that I had to be all buffed up and stuff like that.”</p> <p>Gleeson’s next big hit was 1998’s The General, for which John Boorman won best director at Cannes. Gleeson played the notorious Dublin criminal Martin Cahill – a charming but intimidating character, the first of many Gleeson would play. When I observe that he often plays menacing characters, he jokes: “That’s because I haven’t got a pretty face, you see.”</p> <p>He credits Boorman with helping him tap into his mean side when they started preparing for The General. “He said I was doing a good mimicry, but I had to go deeper than that. I didn’t quite understand what he meant. And then between that and the start of filming, I started to get really bad dreams.” Things that had happened in his childhood resurfaced. Dublin was not always a safe place to grow up. “Things like bullying, a fella set a dog on me one time, or I got knocked down by a bus on my way to school. Little bits of things like that, but I suddenly started accessing that whole area of intimidation, nightmares and stuff. That’s where you have to go.” So if anything, Gleeson’s capacity for menace comes from having been on the receiving end of it. “It’s not difficult for me, because I saw it coming at me.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffa3ae1b69de852199aec26aff35c33a4ee8b1d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa3ae1b69de852199aec26aff35c33a4ee8b1d3/0_0_3504_2332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Knuckles McGinty in Paddington 2.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Knuckles McGinty in Paddington 2.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Maidment/Warner Bros/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gleeson has played against his menacing persona to fine effect, both in the Harry Potter movies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/26/paddington-2-review-hugh-grant-sequel-michael-bond-film\">in that other modern children’s classic, Paddington 2</a>, where he portrayed Knuckles McGinty, the grouchy prison cook and chief bruiser (whose softer side is brought out by Paddington’s transformative marmalade).

Honestly I’m as proud of that as anything I’ve done.”</p> <p>Gleeson’s career may not be slowing down, but he’s more relaxed about it than he used to be. “I don’t want to bother trying to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear at all at this point.” He’s become better at taking a little time to smell the coffee. At least until something like State of the Union, or a McDonagh brother, or Paddington 2 comes along. “The excitement you get when you get something through the door that absolutely sings. And that you have to rise to it, rather than trying to drag it up by its bootstraps. When I smell it, when it jumps through the window, it’s just not going to go away.” You can have a fulfilling career <em>and</em> smell the coffee, he suggests. “Curiosity is the thing, I think. That’s where I am at the moment.”</p> <p>• Series two of State of the Union starts on 24 May at 10pm on BBC Two</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/24/proposed-nbn-price-hikes-could-double-some-internet-bills-within-a-decade-accc-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T08:49:18Z","webTitle":"Proposed NBN price hikes could double some internet bills within a decade, ACCC warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/proposed-nbn-price-hikes-could-double-some-internet-bills-within-a-decade-accc-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/proposed-nbn-price-hikes-could-double-some-internet-bills-within-a-decade-accc-warns","fields":{"headline":"Proposed NBN price hikes could double some internet bills within a decade, ACCC warns","trailText":"Telstra says wholesale prices already among highest in the world and will only get worse under proposal","body":"<p>Australians face steep price hikes under a proposed new pricing model for the national broadband network, with retailers warning it could lead to some of the highest internet access costs in the world.</p> <p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) released a <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC%20consultation%20paper%20on%20NBN%20Co%202022%20SAU%20variation.pdf\">consultation paper</a> on Monday detailing proposed changes to NBN Co’s special access undertaking, which sets out how the company charges retailers for user plans and bandwidth.</p> <p>NBN Co has proposed getting rid of bandwidth, or capacity, fees for its high-speed plan but keeping them for low and mid-tier plans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/15/revealed-how-a-crafty-labor-move-on-the-nbn-is-being-used-to-win-over-voters\">Revealed: how a crafty Labor move on the NBN is being used to win over voters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under the proposal, the cheapest wholesale plan would double in price over the next decade, and eventually cost as much as a plan with four times the download speed. Retailers say they would be forced to pass on the costs.</p> <p>NBN Co’s forecasts suggested that the maximum allowable cost to retailers for the entry-level plan would double by 2033, and would go to $104 a month by 2040.</p> <p>Telstra has said NBN Co’s proposed model would lead to even higher prices for broadband, and would drive more people to wireless broadband products.</p> <p>“NBN’s wholesale prices are already the highest in the world among comparable countries and they’ll get worse with the proposed price increases,” a spokesperson said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for TPG said the proposal was a “slap in the face for those who rely on affordable broadband to stay connected for work, study and play”.</p> <p>“The only thing clear from NBN’s convoluted pricing model is that internet services are going to get more expensive for Australians in the future,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>“The NBN’s pricing proposal can be summed up as price hikes and no improvements.”</p> <p>Optus’s vice president of regulatory and public affairs, Andrew Sheridan, said Optus was disappointed, and the proposal would hit everyone’s hip pocket.</p> <p>“Retail providers like Optus will have no choice but to pass proposed cost increases onto our customers, knowing that many are already feeling the pain of rising household costs,” he said.</p> <p>“The new government has an opportunity to refocus NBN Co’s priorities towards its core objective of ensuring all Australians have access to fast broadband, at affordable prices, and at least cost.”</p> <p>NBN Co has proposed making the 25 megabits per second (Mbps) download speed plan the entry-level tier, and keep bandwidth or capacity charges for all plans below 100Mbps. Those plans would be bundled with a set bandwidth allowance, and retailers would be charged on top of that for how much they actually use rather than how much they think they need.</p> <p>There would be an excess fee of $8 per Mbps of bandwidth a month, and the bundles would be reviewed every six months to determine how much more bandwidth should be included in the bundle as user demand continued to rise.</p> <p>But it would do away with the bandwidth charge for users on 100Mbps or more, instead just charging a flat fee, which would be increased each financial year.</p> <p>The ACCC warned in its consultation paper that the $8 fee was above the cost of making more bandwidth available to retailers, and it could lead to costs rising due to the bandwidth allocation not meeting expected demand. NBN Co had forecast an annual peak data demand growth of 13%, but only allowed for bundle allowance increases of around half this level.</p> <p>The 100Mbps plan costs rise with the rate of CPI plus 3% in the first few years, and then CPI or 3% later on.</p> <p>What it would mean in practice is that the cost of the lower speed plans would match the 100Mbps plan within a few years. This would be because the underlying plan rises at the same rate, plus the additional cost of bandwidth use on top of that as demand for data grows. </p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up forGuardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>ACCC modelling suggests the cost for the 50Mbps plan would equal the 100Mbps plan by 2027, and the 25Mbps plan would reach the same price by 2034.</p> <p>The pricing would, according to NBN Co’s modelling, push many users on to the 100Mbps plan, which the ACCC said was more than many households would need.</p> <p>Modelling by the Bureau of Communications and Arts Research, put together as part of the consultation, argues the median household speed requirement by 2028 would be 29Mbps, and 99.9% of households would not need more than 78Mbps.</p> <p>A new communications minister in the Albanese Labor government has yet to be sworn in.</p> <p>NBN Co said it welcomed the paper and the opportunity to continue the pricing discussion with the ACCC and retailers.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.nbnco.com.au/content/dam/nbn/documents/media-centre/media-statements/2021/consumer-affordability-of-nbn-services.pdf\">Accenture affordability report</a>, put together by NBN Co last year, found Australia ranked sixth for affordable broadband in the OECD.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/we-were-kind-of-terrified-rural-telstra-customers-lose-service-for-a-week\">‘We were kind of terrified’: rural Telstra customers lose service for a week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The drive for the change, the ACCC said, was NBN Co had accumulated “significant losses” since the network construction began in 2009 – $38bn in real terms or $44.5bn in nominal terms. </p> <p>NBN Co had also proposed a $12-per-month voice-only service for people who did not want a fixed line internet service, but need a phone line.</p> <p>Consultation on the paper is open until 8 July, with the ACCC planning to release a draft decision on whether to accept the pricing changes in September 2022.</p> <p>In Senate estimates just prior to the election, NBN Co’s chief executive Stephen Rue said the process to decide the final cost would take between six and nine months.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/24/infamous-captain-cook-statue-in-controversial-pose-removed-from-queensland-street","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T08:37:17Z","webTitle":"Infamous Captain Cook statue in controversial pose removed from Queensland street","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/infamous-captain-cook-statue-in-controversial-pose-removed-from-queensland-street","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/infamous-captain-cook-statue-in-controversial-pose-removed-from-queensland-street","fields":{"headline":"Infamous Captain Cook statue in controversial pose removed from Queensland street","trailText":"Eight-metre-tall statue in pose some liken to a Nazi salute will be moved from Sheridan St in Cairns to the Atherton Tablelands","body":"<p>A statue of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/15/flawless-hero-or-bogeyman-captain-cook-still-divides-along-black-and-white-lines\">Captain James Cook</a> with an arm raised in a position that some liken to a Nazi salute has been removed from a main street in Cairns.</p> <p>Demolition contractor Martin Anton hopes to be the unlikely saviour of the controversial statue, which had been used to advertise a topless bar, after reportedly buying the statue for a token $1.</p> <p>Anton is taking the statue to a holding facility in the nearby Atherton Tablelands, and is remaining somewhat coy about his long-term plans for it.

bags £425m in work from UK government as it is criticised over tax","trailText":"Report claims public money from countries around the world is funding growth of tech company","body":"<p>Amazon has reaped a total of £425m in UK government contracts in the past two years, it has emerged in a report, prompting fresh criticism that the tech giant is failing to pay a fair share of tax in the country.</p> <p>The report, by the Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research (CICTAR) with assistance from investigative thinktank Taxwatch, finds Amazon’s highly profitable cloud computing business is increasingly being indirectly supported by taxpayers through hundreds of billions of dollars in government contracts around the world.</p> <p>In the UK, Amazon benefited from £250m of government contracts in 2020 – up from zero in 2014 and less than £25m in the four subsequent years according to CICTAR. That was more than 10 times the level of corporation tax paid by the group’s main British subsidiaries that year.</p> <p>Amazon’s publicly published corporation tax bill in the UK – for its largest subsidiary Amazon UK Services as well as Amazon Digital UK and Amazon Online UK – totalled £22.3m in 2020.</p> <p>Another £175m of government contracts were booked in 2021. Figures for the corporation tax paid for last year are not yet available.</p> <p>George Turner, the Taxwatch executive director, said: “Amazon’s history of tax avoidance is very well known but despite this the company has managed to bag a huge increase in revenue from the work it does from government.</p> <p>“At the very least taxpayers will want some reassurance that their money is spent on companies that are transparent about their tax affairs and demonstrate that they do not use artificial structures to reduce their tax bill.</p> <p>“The last Queen’s speech announced a new bill to reform government procurement. This would seem to me to be the perfect opportunity for government to ensure that those in receipt of lucrative government contracts also make their contribution to the tax system.”</p> <p>In the UK, The Seattle-based company’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) arm provides services, for the Home Office, HMRC and the Ministry of Defence. Contracts include cloud computing services for MI6, MI5 and the Ministry of Defence including sensitive document storage, according to the report.</p> <p>The report says: “While the UK government has taken some measures to tax profits generated in the UK but booked offshore, there is no evidence that these measures have been effective.”</p> <p>Amazon said that the “calculations are misleading and do not include the bulk of our business. Comparing a contract value over many years, to an incorrect corporation tax figure for a single year is highly misleading.”</p> <p>An Amazon spokesperson said: “We are investing heavily in creating jobs and infrastructure across the UK – more than £32bn since 2010.. This continued investment helped contribute to a total tax contribution of £1.55bn during 2020 – £492m in direct taxes and £1.06bn in indirect taxes.”</p> <p>The £492m in “direct taxes” – up from £293m a year earlier – includes employer’s national insurance, business rates and stamp duty as well as corporation tax.</p> <p>The company added that UK government departments using AWS were “enjoying cost savings of up to 60%”. A spokesperson said: “Public sector organisations in the UK use the UK branch of AWS Europe which registers its sales in the UK and pays all applicable taxes, due on its profits, directly to HMRC.”</p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said: “Amazon Web Services is just one of the government’s many cloud service providers, and our procurement decisions are always based on getting value for taxpayers and the best quality services.”</p> <p>In Australia, Amazon’s AWS arm has won contracts worth A$626m (£498m) since 2013, according to the research.</p> <p>This includes a deal with the Digital Transformation Agency, which is supposed to drive improvements in the federal government’s technology, under which Amazon will receive A$560m between 2019 and 2025, as well as arrangements with the Taxation Office and a contract to run the government’s Covid-19 tracking app, which is widely regarded as a failure because few people used it.</p> <p>In the US, the report says Amazon is recently reported to have signed a $10bn (£8bn) contract with the National Security Agency. The company set aside just over $2bn for US federal taxes last year according to the company’s annual report but kept its effective tax rate low with $1bn in tax credits and other benefits.</p> <p>Amazon has said its US taxes “reflect our commitment to investment in innovation, our employees, and our communities”.</p> <p>The findings come before Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday where the technology group faces shareholder pressure for greater transparency about its tax affairs. Investors will also vote on a shareholder proposal calling for an independent report into working conditions in its warehouses, a move backed by the shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis.</p> <p>The Greater Manchester Pension Fund and the Oblate International Pastoral Investment Trust, supported by UK-based independent shareholder advisory consultancy Pirc, put forward the resolution on tax transparency which has been publicly backed by institutional shareholders including Norges Bank.</p> <p>Amazon has recommended shareholders vote against the proposal, Amazon said it already publicly reported its tax contribution in some countries including the UK, in its <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2022/ar/Amazon-2022-Proxy-Statement.pdf\">recommendation document</a> ahead of the AGM.</p> <p>It said more “granularity”, on tax reporting as planned under new EU rules, would “potentially force disclosure of competitively sensitive information about our operations and cost structures and would hamper our ability to make operational decisions.”</p> <p>Tom Powdrill, the head of stewardship at Pirc, said: “There’s a real risk of changes in tax regulation, and wider public policy, catching companies and their investors out, so transparency is vital.

Some believe a deeper unrest is behind such incidents","body":"<p>As April drew to a close, Cleveland Guardians outfielders had to deal with a few unusual problems during their team’s visit to Yankee Stadium. But it wasn’t flyballs caught in the swirling winds over the Bronx, or the power of sluggers Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge that were unsettling them. Instead, they found themselves pelted with garbage by fans. Cleveland right fielder Oscar Mercado’s most significant catch of the game was intercepting a beer can that had been thrown at his head. The situation became so bad that at one point Judge and Stanton had to jog over to placate their own fans.</p> \n<p>“Brutal,” Guardians outfielder Myles Straw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/24/worst-fanbase-on-the-planet-yankees-crowd-pelts-guardians-with-garbage\">said after the game</a>. “Worst fanbase on the planet.”</p> \n<p>Straw’s anger is understandable, but the behavior of Yankees fans (and there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/23/tim-anderson-jackie-robinson-remarks-home-run-yankees-fans-baseball\">more ugly scenes</a> in New York this weekend) is far from an aberration. In the NBA, stars such as Luka Doncic, Draymond Green, Kyrie Irving, and Chris Paul have all been involved in verbal altercations with fans during this year’s playoffs. And several animal rights protestors <a href=\"https://people.com/sports/animal-rights-activist-tackled-detained-after-running-onto-court-at-timberwolves-playoff/\">stormed the court</a> during multiple games as the Minnesota Timberwolves faced off against the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the postseason. In the NHL, threats made against Colorado Avalanche center Nazem Kadri this weekend were deemed <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/33967000/colorado-avalanche-working-law-enforcement-st-louis-regarding-threats-made-towards-center-nazem-kadri-game-3\">severe enough for the police to investigate</a>.</p> \n<p>The problem is not limited to the US either. In the UK, Sheffield United’s Billy Sharp was left bloodied after a fan headbutted him during a pitch invasion at Nottingham Forest. The fan was arrested and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/man-admits-assault-on-footballer-billy-sharp-at-play-off-semi-final\">will serve 24 weeks in jail</a>. There have been allegations of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/gerrard-says-goalkeeper-olsen-attacked-during-manchester-city-pitch-invasion\">a similar incident</a> during Manchester City’s Premier League title celebrations on Sunday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/football-fans-ugly-behaviour-society-pitch-invasions\">Fans’ ugly behaviour is not just about football – it’s about society | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“If you look at the amount of security that is at a professional sports game, it is laughable relative to what the crowd could do if it decided to become unruly,” says <a href=\"https://psychology.du.edu/about/faculty-directory/mark-w-aoyagi\">Mark Aoyagi</a>, a sports psychologist and professor at the University of Denver.</p> \n<p>Of course, clashes between fans and players have always been a part of sports in the US, but they seem to have become more frequent recently. Aoyagi says the main reason they have not escalated into all-out brawls, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/10/untold-malice-at-the-palace-pistons-pacers-documentary\">the infamous Malice at the Palace in 2004</a>, is the restraint of players.</p> \n<p>“What players are subjected to would be criminal in any other setting,” says Aoyagi. “At a minimum, there is the [verbal] assault at any given game for any given player. Despite what would be illegal and draw a reaction in any other setting, players almost never react to this sort of assault. It is only when a fan crosses an unwritten line that players will react. This might involve including a player’s family in the verbal assault or saying words that are forbidden. Again, the point here is that these violations are over and above what is already a criminal level of assault.”</p> \n<p>The NBA says it takes any such disruption seriously. “It is a concern anytime anyone involved in the game has a negative interaction with a fan or when our fans have a bad experience,” an NBA spokesperson told the Guardian. “We have zero tolerance for disruptive or unruly behavior in our arenas, and anytime an individual violates our NBA Fan Code of Conduct it is addressed swiftly by arena security and local law enforcement when appropriate.”</p> \n<p>Fan disruptions could shed light on a larger issue that has impacted society since the start of the pandemic in 2020. For months, fans were shut out from attending sports events as Covid spread. Once the crowds returned, bad fan behavior became more prevalent. A fan in Boston <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/news/fan-arrested-for-throwing-water-bottle-at-kyrie-irving\">threw a water bottle at Irving</a>; Trae Young <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/31521702/new-york-knicks-ban-fan-madison-square-garden-spitting-atlanta-hawks-trae-young\">was spat on in New York</a>; Russell Westbrook <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/sixers/russell-westbrook-sixers-fan-popcorn-nba-playoffs-bradley-beal-washington-wizards#:~:text=Russell%20Westbrook%20appeared%20to%20have,was%20ejected%20from%20the%20game.&amp;text=Valerie%20Camillo%2C%20president%20of%20business,a%20statement%20after%20the%20game.\">had popcorn thrown on him</a> in Philadelphia. Westbrook said the incident was far from unique.</p> \n<p>“To get food thrown on top of me, it’s just bullshit really,” he said after the game in May 2021. “Fortunately, I couldn’t get to the stands. I just don’t take that lightly. To me, it happens to me a lot of times. Obviously, I’ve learned to kind of look the other way but to a certain extent, you can’t just keep looking the other way. There has to be some penalties or something put in place where fans can’t just come to the games and do and say as they please, because they wouldn’t do that shit anywhere else – any other setting. And I’m sick and tired of it, honestly.”</p> \n<p>Aoyagi says that an increased level of fan misconduct could be a byproduct of pandemic angst, which has been linked to unrest in other settings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/17/flight-attendants-air-rage-epidemic-coronavirus-covid\">such as airplanes</a>.</p> \n<p>“There is no definitive reason why this is occurring, but prevailing thinking is that with the rules [such as mask wearing and quarantines] imposed during the pandemic resulting in people feeling less autonomy, the response for some has been to over-index on choice and autonomy when given the chance,” Aoyagi says. “The pandemic has resulted in a mental health crisis. The only real question is if it caused it or simply exacerbated what was already brewing.”</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, it is not just players who have been targeted by fans. During an NBA playoff game between the Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns on Mother’s Day, fans <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/05/11/chris-pauls-mom-tells-kenny-smith-about-fan-encounter-at-suns-game/\">allegedly repeatedly touched Chris Paul’s mother</a> and pushed his wife. The Mavericks subsequently said two “unruly fans” had been banned from their arena until the end of 2023, but the incident brought attention to the need for the families of players to have more protection.</p> \n<p>“This type of behavior will not be tolerated and, as was the case in Dallas, will be addressed immediately by security and our law enforcement partners,” the NBA spokesperson said. “The fans involved in this incident received bans through the end of 2023, which is 19 months. We take proactive measures to protect players’ families in arenas and, while we don’t discuss the specific actions, we educate players and their family members about ways to avoid conflicts with fans, especially when they are away from their home arenas.”</p> \n<p>Sports have always served as a way for fans to escape from the minutiae of everyday life and build a connection with a franchise, community, or city. However, professional leagues are at a critical moment where the fun and safety of sports are being tainted by disruptive fans.</p> \n<p>“Leagues, teams, and, yes, fans all want sports to be this great escape where saying things are all in good fun and a normal part of supporting your team,” Aoyagi says. “Certainly, there is a way to support your team and attempt to distract the other team or otherwise feel that you are helping your team in a way that doesn’t involve assault.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2022/may/24/partygate-what-were-you-doing-on-13-november-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T08:21:13Z","webTitle":"Partygate: what were you doing on 13 November 2020?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/24/partygate-what-were-you-doing-on-13-november-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/may/24/partygate-what-were-you-doing-on-13-november-2020","fields":{"headline":"Partygate: what were you doing on 13 November 2020?","trailText":"Whatever you were doing or not doing, we would like to hear your memories of 13 November 2020","body":"<p>New photographs have emerged showing Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/24/met-faces-questions-about-credibility-of-partygate-inquiry-after-photos-emerge\">at an event on 13 November 2020, for which he was not fined</a>, after the Metropolitan police last week ended its investigation into a string of Downing Street and Whitehall parties.</p> <p>At the time, England was under a national lockdown meaning only two people from different households could meet outdoors socially distanced.</p> <p>We would like to know what you were doing on 13 November 2020.</p> <h2><strong>Share your experiences</strong></h2> <p>You can get in touch by filling in the form below or contact us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/aug/12/whatsapp-sharing-stories-with-the-guardian\">via WhatsApp</a> by <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=447766780300\">clicking here</a> or adding +44(0)7766780300.

This represents around 7% of households and 16% of small businesses, the government says.</p> <p>The setting serves as an anchor because retailers are “required to use it as a common reference price when advertising their market offers and discounts”, the government adds. “This enables customers to easily compare market offer prices and choose a plan that best suits their needs.”</p> <p>Compare away, otherwise you’ll end up paying more.</p> <p>We’ll see what non-Victorians will have to pay on Thursday when the <strong>Australian Energy Regulator </strong>releases its default market offer. Given regions such as <strong>Queensland</strong> and <strong>New South Wales </strong>are more exposed to high fuel costs than Victoria – black coal is traded globally but brown coal less so – we can expect price rises of more than 5%.</p> <p>According to the <strong>Australian Bureau of Statistics</strong>, electricity makes up just over 2.5% of the basket of goods in our Consumer Price Inflation gauge, so we can expect the inflation rate to nudge a bit higher too.</p> <p>A bit of a tangent, but other things are going up at an exponential-looking rate.

(All throughout, diplomats and officials have continued to speak with each other.)</p> <p>The Xinhua story was later corrected to say: “Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday sent a congratulatory message to Anthony Albanese on his assumption of office as prime minister of the federal government of Australia.”</p> <p><strong>The sentiments expressed in the message are consistent with months of diplomatic formulations expressed by Chinese officials</strong>, who have signalled that they are open to post-election talks to get the relationship on the “right track”. Even last week, Chinese diplomatic sources <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/china-seeks-to-reset-relationship-with-australia-after-election\">told Guardian Australia</a> and SBS News that they saw “a good opportunity” to ease tensions in the period after the election, regardless of the outcome.</p> <p>Li said in Monday’s message that “the sound and stable development of China-Australia relations conforms to the fundamental interests and common aspirations of their people and is also conducive to peace, stability, development and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region”.</p> <p>This has been a line Chinese officials have used for years. Even the “wolf warrior” foreign ministry spokesperson <strong>Zhao Lijian</strong> said in June 2021 that China has always believed “that a sound and stable relationship serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples”.</p> <p>According to the Xinhua report, Li went on to say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>In the 1970s, the Australian Labor Party made the correct choice in establishing diplomatic ties with China, making important contributions to the development of bilateral relations.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>China’s new ambassador to Australia, <strong>Xiao Qian</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/24/actively-develop-friendship-chinas-new-ambassador-to-australia-strikes-softer-tone\">said in February</a> that the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties by <strong>Gough Whitlam</strong> in December 1972 could provide an opportunity to ease tensions.<br></p> <p>Finally, in the message to Albanese, Li said the Chinese side “is ready to work with the Australian side to review the past, look into the future, and uphold the principle of mutual respect and mutual benefit, so as to promote the sound and steady growth of their comprehensive strategic partnership”.</p> <p>This is almost identical to Xiao’s statement in February:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Taking the 50th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between our two countries as an opportunity, <strong>China is willing to work with Australia to meet each other halfway</strong>, review the past and look into the future, adhere to the principle of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and make joint efforts to push forward China-Australia relations along the right track.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>One area of difficulty here is the different perspectives on the meaning of “mutual respect”. In Beijing’s view, that would include Australia not “interfering” in issues such as the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and military pressure against Taiwan. Both sides of Australian politics have vowed to continue to speak up for Australian interests and values and are concerned about China’s militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea. <strong>Penny Wong</strong> has suggested Beijing should drop coercive trade actions against Australian exports if it wanted to give a sign of good faith.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d716d399ee3e1e1d40152347505bc5d34438c64c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d716d399ee3e1e1d40152347505bc5d34438c64c/0_0_2857_1937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang speaks from the podium at the opening session of the National Peoples Congress at the Great Hall of the People on March 5, 2022 in Beijing, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese Premier Li Keqiang speaks from the podium at the opening session of the National Peoples Congress at the Great Hall of the People on March 5, 2022 in Beijing, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-24T04:27:08.069Z\">at 5.27am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-628c45888f08afed639a2b37\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-24T02:46:06.062Z\">3.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Queensland records 18 Covid deaths and WA records six</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Queensland has recorded 18 Covid deaths in the past 24 hours and 5,118 new cases.

For Toews, the motifs that are reworked through all her books are largely autobiographical. She draws on her cultural background – growing up in a strict Mennonite community in rural Canada – as well as her family history: both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/02/miriam-toews-interview-all-my-puny-sorrows-mennonite\">her father and her sister</a> killed themselves after long battles with mental illness. While these recurring themes are threaded through her eighth novel, <em>Fight Night</em>, the tone is markedly different from that of its predecessor, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/10/women-talking-miriam-toews-review\">Women Talking</a></em>. That book fictionalised a historic case of sexual assault in a Bolivian Mennonite village, where multiple women were repeatedly drugged and raped while unconscious; if they questioned the resulting injuries and pregnancies, they were told by the male church authorities that it was the work of the devil. There is a seam of grim humour in that novel, but Toews has said that holding the pain of these women while writing it was one of the most intense experiences of her life, so it’s perhaps unsurprising that she has shifted to a more obviously comic register.</p> <p><em>Fight Night</em> is an exuberant celebration of female resilience – though it too is shot through with grief and pain, and its power is in showing how these are not merely inseparable but interdependent. The plot is spare and focuses on the relationship between three generations of women in one Canadian family, most particularly on the bond between the narrator, Swiv, and her grandmother, Elvira. These characters are at once wholly themselves and reassuringly familiar; they share DNA with a number of predecessors in Toews’s fictional universe. Swiv most nearly resembles Nomi Nickel, the teenage narrator of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-complicated-kindness-9780571341009\">A Complicated Kindness</a></em>, and there is an obvious link between them: Nomi’s childhood nickname was “Swivelhead”, from her habit of absorbing adult conversations by whipping her attention between the speakers. Elvira shares a name and part of her biography with the author’s own mother; in the novel, she too has lost a husband and a daughter to suicide and escaped a repressive small-town religious community with an authoritarian leader.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Toews has carefully rendered the fierce love between these three stubborn, forceful women</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The men of Swiv’s immediate family are absent. Her narrative takes the form of an extended letter to her unnamed father, who has recently left with no indication of any intention to return. As a framing device it’s not entirely convincing; for long swaths of the story the form appears to be forgotten, so that when the second person suddenly intrudes the effect can be jarring.</p> <p>Swiv explains that she has been expelled from school for punching her bullies, on her grandmother’s advice: “Madame said I had one too many fights, which if I knew the exact number of fights I was <em>supposed</em> to have then there wouldn’t be this bullshit, I said.” While Swiv’s heavily pregnant mother spends all day rehearsing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/what-is-antifa-trump-terrorist-designation\">antifa</a> theatre and raging against the state (“Grandma told me she doesn’t know how Mom was able to stop ranting long enough to get pregnant”), Elvira takes it upon herself to make up the girl’s missed education with her own eclectic life lessons.</p> <p>Swiv’s voice, though engaging, can be tricky, not least because her age is left vague – we are two-thirds into the novel before she tells a stranger that she is around a hundred months (Nomi Nickel calls nine “the year I really became aware of my existence”). Some of Swiv’s precocity can be explained by the weight of responsibility she carries, though at times she displays a knowingness that doesn’t quite ring true in a nine-year-old and occasionally tips into archness: “He looked happy and sad at the same time. That’s a popular adult look because adults are busy and have to do everything at once, even feel things.”</p> <p>In less skilled hands, the emotional double whammy of the novel’s ending could easily come across as trite. But Toews has so carefully rendered the fierce love between these three stubborn, forceful women that the reader is willing to follow her to the tear-jerking finale.

This time it’s a story about oil rigs going wrong in the North Sea and creating a massive spill – but more importantly, for the purposes of the drama, endangering the life of scientist-protagonist Sofia’s boyfriend Stian (Henrik Bjelland), and thus threatening to leave a little boy named Odin (Nils Elias Olsen) fatherless. The poor kid spends most of the film sitting around a waiting room being starred at furtively by worried adults, seemingly more anxious about having to deal with telling him his dad is dead than with the fact that they’re causing a massive environmental disaster that will affect millions. But I suppose you have to find some way to make the drama palpable to viewers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBCviSf1C54\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nBCviSf1C54?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Moreover, like nearly everyone in the film, Sofia (Kristine Kujath Thorp) works for the oil industry, so there’s no fundamental questioning of this massive, powerful enterprise that has ballooned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/28/we-have-to-pay-the-price-oslos-plan-to-turn-oil-wealth-into-climate-leadership\">Norway’s GDP over the last 50 years</a> or so. There are only good oil-industry employees here, and only slightly less scrupulous oil-industry executives, such as the bosses who haven’t grasped that the relentless drilling has made the seabed fundamentally unstable. This means robotics engineer Sofia must use her own creations to save Stian’s life when he gets trapped in an air pocket on a collapsed platform. Her buddy Arthur (Rolf Kristian Larsen) helps her out, and it’s kind of delightful that nobody looks like the Rock or any other Hollywood movie star here. They’re all just average nerds, likable if flawed, with pasty complexions and boiler-suits, trying to survive and save their loved ones.</p> <p>A regular beat of tension and release plays out as people get saved only to face new dangers, following the template of disaster films since the beginning of cinema, but it’s done well here.

But instead of shrugging it off or trying to change the subject, as Democrats are often criticised for doing, the state senator from Michigan decided to fight back.</p> \n<p>In just four minutes and 40 seconds, McMorrow delivered a fierce, impassioned floor speech at the state capitol that went viral on social media and earned a laudatory phone call from the US president.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/12/democratic-party-new-younger-leadership-us\">The Democratic party needs new, younger leadership before it’s too late | Cas Mudde</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>She also offered a blueprint for how Democrats can combat Republicans intent on making education a wedge issue. The New Yorker magazine described her as “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/05/09/a-role-model-for-the-midterms\">a role model for the midterms</a>”. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/27/us/politics/democrats-mallory-mcmorrow-cultural-issues.html\">newspaper added</a>: “If Democrats could bottle Mallory McMorrow … they would do it.”</p> \n<p>It was quite an ovation for a 35-year-old serving her first term in elected office. McMorrow, who previously worked as a car designer and branding and design consultant, is among a generation galvanised by resistance to Donald Trump and his red meat populism.</p> \n<p>Soon after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/how-did-donald-trump-win-analysis\">Trump’s election as president</a> in 2016, she saw a video of middle school students chanting “Build the wall!” at another student<em>; </em>the school happened to be the polling place where she had voted. She felt motivated to go into politics and was elected in 2018 to the state senate for the 13th district, which covers suburbs just north of Detroit.</p> \n<p>But the Michigan senate has been under Republican control since before McMorrow was born. In a time of acrimony and division, it was never going to be an easy ride.</p> \n<p>Republican <a href=\"https://www.senatorlanatheis.com/\">Lana Theis</a> opened the latest senate session with an invocation that was part prayer, part Make America Great Again (Maga) battle cry: “Dear Lord, across the country we’re seeing in the news that our children are under attack. That there are forces that desire things for them other than what their parents would have them see and hear and know.”</p> \n<p>McMorrow was among three Democrats who walked out in protest at the apparent reference to how schools address sexual orientation, gender identity and critical race theory – the target of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/republicans-midterms-culture-war-lgbtq-abortion-book-bans\">Republican laws across the country</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"550c1d3e9cd9233ba6a5ee2c8a51786c39293f57\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/550c1d3e9cd9233ba6a5ee2c8a51786c39293f57/697_120_1484_1855/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mallory McMorrow.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mallory McMorrow.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She also tweeted criticism of the prayer, prompting Theis to lash out in a fundraising email: “These are the people we are up against. Progressive social media trolls like Senator Mallory McMorrow (D-Snowflake) who are outraged they can’t teach can’t groom and sexualize kindergarteners or that 8-year-olds are responsible for slavery.”</p> \n<p>Grooming, a term used to describe how sex offenders initiate contact with their victims, has recently become a Republican buzzword and nods to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/25/qanon-conspiracy-theory-explained-trump-what-is\"> QAnon conspiracy theories</a> that hold Democrats run a pedophile ring. It is no less hurtful for being so preposterous.</p> \n<p>McMorrow recalls in a phone interview from the state capital, Lansing: “I’m the mom of a one-year-old and I sat in how horrific I felt all day and realised, if I feel that bad for one day, this is how bad it feels for those who are targeted unfairly every single day. It has to stop, which is why I decided to say something publicly.”</p> \n<p>She got to work on a response as she bathed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MalloryMcMorrow/status/1355296857333911555?s=20&amp;t=CeaecAkNhLRRakalIHa3FA\">her daughter Noa</a> at their home in Royal Oak. “She was just looking at me and laughing, so oblivious, and I was suddenly filled with all of these things that I wanted to say. So I wrote everything down. I crossed a lot of it out. I was up a lot of the night writing what I wanted to say and what I didn’t want to say.”</p> \n<p>When McMorrow <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/media-social-michigan-9651ec94e425db841581562aed6bbcbb\">delivered the speech</a>, Theis – who is from a different district and facing a Trump-endorsed challenger for her seat – did not even look at her, she recalls. But other state senators were unusually still and silent. And soon the rest of America would be paying attention.</p> \n<p>McMorrow, her red hair tied back, told the chamber: “So who am I? I am a straight, white, Christian, married, suburban mom who knows that the very notion that learning about slavery or redlining or systemic racism somehow means that children are being taught to feel bad or hate themselves because they are white is absolute nonsense.”</p> \n<p>She continued: “People who are different are not the reason that our roads are in bad shape after decades of disinvestment or that healthcare costs are too high or that teachers are leaving the profession. I want every child in this state to feel seen, heard, and supported, not marginalised and targeted because they are not straight, white and Christian.</p> \n<p>“We cannot let hateful people tell you otherwise, to scapegoat and deflect from the fact that they are not doing anything to fix the real issues that impact people’s lives. And I know that hate will only win if people like me stand by and let it happen.”</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLWo8B1R0MY\">video of the address</a> racked up millions of views across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. A tweet thread from McMorrow about it amassed more than 76,000 retweets. Leading Democrats outside Michigan including Hillary Clinton encouraged their social media followers to watch, as did activists and celebrities such as Mia Farrow, Don Lemon, Joe Scarborough and Maria Shriver.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden called and thanked McMorrow for saying what he felt needed to be said, she recalls. She also raised a stunning quarter of a million dollars in less than 24 hours. No one was more surprised than she was at becoming a breakout star of the Democratic party.</p> \n<p>“I am a state legislator in one of 50 states in the country and occasionally we hope that our video goes a a little bit outside of our district. I had no idea that it would go quite as far as it has but it did feel good. I wanted what I said to be about the issue and identity and not getting into this Democratic versus Republican mudslinging that we always see.”</p> \n<p>“I wanted to speak on behalf of everybody who’s on the receiving end of these attacks and also point out that, even if you are not the parent of a trans child, this is a scapegoat technique because it’s not fixing any of your daily problems.”</p> \n<p>McMorrow’s election flipped her district from red to blue and she still hears from plenty of Republican constituents. “We get calls in our office every week from people who are really upset – and you can hear it in their voice – about issues that they probably didn’t even think about a few months ago.</p> \n<p>“That is what drove me to want to make this kind of point: they are lying to you to get you so mad and hateful toward somebody else, as if somebody else is the cause of all your problems, when they’re not doing anything to help you.”</p> \n<p>Why did the speech strike such a chord? McMorrow suggests that Democrats have been afraid of talking about religion and faith openly while Republicans have sought to weaponise Christianity and create the illusion that they speak on behalf of all white suburban mothers.</p> \n<p>She reflects: “It feels like Democrats have ceded ground to the Republican party on Christianity and religion and family values and patriotism. Waving a lot of American flags tends to be associated with the Republican party now despite the fact that many of my colleagues supported the insurrection [in Washington on January 6, 2021].</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bdc02c322771b7c3e95d82bcebb0db94203b26b0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdc02c322771b7c3e95d82bcebb0db94203b26b0/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters hold posters regarding critical race theory in the Brandon Township village of Ortonville, Michigan, in November 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters hold posters opposing critical race theory in the Brandon Township village of Ortonville, Michigan, in November 2021.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emily Elconin/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I was speaking to a lot of people who look and are like me: white, comfortable, non-marginalised suburban moms – who I know don’t feel the same way as the current strategy of the Republican party and who maybe haven’t been as active – to say this only happens because we’ve let it happen and we need to reclaim our own identities and say we care about our families, our communities.</p> \n<p>“I am a parent. I want my daughter to grow up and meet people who are different from her and be empathetic and kind. The response that I’ve got from people is, ‘You have said everything that I feel and haven’t had a way to articulate.’”</p> \n<p>Democrats are often accused of being too hesitant and timid in the face of Republicans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/24/joe-bidens-message-drowned-out-by-beat-of-the-republican-culture-war-drum\">pushing hot button topics</a>. A plea by the then first lady, Michelle Obama, in 2016 – “When they go low, we go high” – has been seen as an argument for deeming such issues unworthy of a response and talking policy instead. But some hailed McMorrow for showing how to take on Republicans at their own game.</p> \n<p>Congressman Tim Ryan, a Democrat now running for the US Senate in Ohio, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/05/01/dems-gop-culture-attacks\">told the Axios website</a>: “I think you absolutely need to have that kind of tone, that kind of attitude on these issues. These guys are punching down … I think you’ve got to hit back. You’ve got to hit back hard.”</p> \n<p>There are now signs that leading Democrats, contemplating heavy losses in the midterm elections, are ready to acknowledge the potency of Republican attacks and return fire. Biden, for so long devoted to bipartisanship, has recently begun using the phrase “<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-biden-business-donald-trump-economy-accd1a895105377a3e4350067c56b64d\">ultra-Maga</a>” about the party that has careered outside the democratic mainstream.</p> \n<p>McMorrow, who is up for re-election in November and describes herself as a practical progressive who aligns with Senator Elizabeth Warren, says some of her Democratic colleagues find it hard to accept that these are not normal times.</p> \n<p>“I do believe the Democrats have policy issues that help people and we need to talk about those things but right now people can’t even hear them if they’re so worried about this moral panic that has been created.</p> \n<p>“We have to destroy that first if we want to get back to how are we fixing the roads, how are we making sure that we don’t have lead in our water, how do we make sure that there are more teachers in the profession. We can strongly point out Republicans are not offering any policy ideas and take the debate to that place. And get aggressive.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/may/24/funny-pages-review-cannes-2022","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T07:56:02Z","webTitle":"Funny Pages review – a deliciously dark coming-of-age comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/24/funny-pages-review-cannes-2022","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/may/24/funny-pages-review-cannes-2022","fields":{"headline":"Funny Pages review – a deliciously dark coming-of-age comedy","trailText":"Owen Kline fuses teen innocence with adult sexuality in a bad-taste debut film that recalls American Splendor and Crumb","body":"<p>As a child actor, Owen Kline played Jesse Eisenberg’s kid brother in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/apr/07/2\">The Squid and the Whale</a>, Noah Baumbach’s excruciating comedy about a middle-class New York family wrecked by divorce, with Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney as the warring parents.

It would clearly want Australia to stop the public condemnation of Beijing for the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and intensifying military, economic and diplomatic pressure against Taiwan. And it would clearly want Australia to treat China as a partner, not a security threat.</p> \n<p>However, both sides of Australian politics have vowed to continue to speak up for Australian interests and values – and are concerned about China’s militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea. The new Australian government will continue to hold the position that China should stop ignoring the 2016 ruling of the arbitral tribunal that found against China’s claims. Additionally, Australia’s laws against foreign interference, its use of national security tests for foreign investment proposals, and its ban on Huawei in the 5G network are here to stay.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily morning briefing newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download the free app</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/mar/17/make-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend?CMP=cvau_atom\">get our weekend edition</a> for a curated selection of the week's best stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/guardianaustraliagdn\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia\">TikTok</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_atom\">\"Full Story\"</a> in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It is fair to say the ambassador’s comments in February that China was prepared to meet Australia halfway were greeted with a level of scepticism in Canberra, because that offer wasn’t accompanied by any tangible steps that Beijing might be willing to take to repair the relationship.</p> \n<p>In Tokyo on Tuesday afternoon, Albanese pledged Australia’s ongoing support for the Quad grouping with the US, Japan and India, and signalled that he would step up the contest with China for influence in Pacific island nations.

That’s not fair.”</p> <p>Prior to the election, premiers in both Labor and Liberal-led states, backed by the Australian Medical Association, had urged the Morrison government to abolish its 6.5% annual growth cap on hospital funding and lift its contribution from 45% to 50%.</p> <p>Neither major party committed to the pledge during the campaign, though Albanese has made negotiating constructively with premiers a focus of his incoming government.</p> <p>The AMA has estimated that a 50-50 public hospital funding split and the removal of the cap – introduced by the Turnbull government in 2017 – would cost the commonwealth $20.5bn across four years.</p> <p>A Covid funding deal that provided additional commonwealth investment for Covid-related health costs is also due to expire in September. But former head of the federal department of health Stephen Duckett said the additional demand on states’ heath systems due to Covid would not be dealt with before then.</p> <p>Duckett said states were dealing with hospitals that were already under strain prior to the pandemic and deferred care that has built up during Covid, but that the federal government would need to consider if it would get productivity improvements if it boosted its hospital fundings contributions.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a> </p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up forGuardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“What are the states offering up to the commonwealth?

Visionary new aesthetics were being unleashed on to the world, and artists truly believed in the revolutionary potential of their work. It is this unrivaled possibility, openness and optimism that the Whitney Museum’s new exhibit of modernist art, At the Dawn of a New Age, seeks to channel for museum-goers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/10/absolutely-enthralling-why-matisses-red-studio-still-packs-a-punch\">‘Absolutely enthralling’: why Matisse’s Red Studio still packs a punch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There’s this sense of ebullience that registers in the work,” said the scholar and longtime Whitney curator Barbara Haskell, who organized this show. “It seemed that it would be fitting to showcase this work at a time when we’re dealing with the dystopia of the present day. I’m hoping to introduce the public to the range of quality and styles, the myriad ways that Americans translated what was happening in Europe to an American vernacular.”</p> <p>True to Haskell’s aims, the show is a riot of colors, moods and styles, giving a sense of the heady experimentation at work as artists hewed out a distinctively American modernism. From neoclassical fantasia to sensual abstractions, radiant landscapes, transcendental visions, cubist street scenes and even a vintage set of the world’s predominant tarot deck, At the Dawn of a New Age presents a dizzying range of art. This profusion is somewhat tamed by being thoughtfully arranged into three galleries that offer visitors opportunities to pace themselves and tease out links between the pieces in a given room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d03ee6224d511e6d87bf31d93861b1b61c1295d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d03ee6224d511e6d87bf31d93861b1b61c1295d7/0_0_2493_3011/828.jpg\" alt=\"Georgia O’Keeffe, Music, Pink and Blue No. 2, 1918.\" width=\"828\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georgia O’Keeffe, Music, Pink and Blue No. 2, 1918.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Gerhardt and Denis Y Suspitsyn/Whitney Museum of American Art</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Haskell wanted her show to make a provocative counterpoint to the currently running Whitney Biennial. Thus, she combed through the museum’s archives to not just celebrate modernist standard-bearers like Georgia O’Keefe and Aaron Douglas but also showcase artists – often women and/or people of color – who have been largely erased from the modernist movement. Nearly half of the work in At the Dawn of a New Age has sat in storage at the Whitney for 30 to 50 years, and many of the pieces on display are new acquisitions meant to address gaps in the Whitney’s collections that Haskell to identified while piecing together her exhibition. “The history of this period tends to be told through a handful of artists, whereas the reality that so many artists were working at such a high level,” said Haskell. “This has denied us that ebullience, the sense of possibilities in the work. Bringing back these works really conveys that mood of the time.”</p> <p>Among the less-celebrated artists given their due in At the Dawn of a New Age are Marguerite Zorach, Blanche Lazzell, Yun Gee, Isami Doi and Henrietta Shore. Arriving from all across the globe, and all throughout the United States, they were drawn to the modernist centers of New York and Paris by art that spoke to them with a sense of newness and promise. Channeling their creative impulses into this movement, they have created work that is at once recognizably modernist yet that remains true to their origins and the marginalized social spaces that they inhabited.</p> <p>Zorach’s contribution to the show, a landscape painted on to silk simply titled Landscape with Figures, brings to mind Seurat’s A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, for the sense of gathering and enjoyment that both convey. But Zorach’s stands on its own as a strange and compelling work: in the bending, flexing postures of the bathers there is a classic, neo-Greekness, and the piece’s central tree – composed of a radiant red trunk and lime green leaves – contributes to the otherworldly feel of the painting. As the work slowly soaks over your consciousness, it begins to feel as though these mysterious figures know secrets of pleasure and relaxation that few will ever penetrate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4951ebde007dba4bd414b9263e8cb9d92098a997\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4951ebde007dba4bd414b9263e8cb9d92098a997/0_0_4034_4338/930.jpg\" alt=\"Henrietta Shore, Trail of Life, c. 1923.\" width=\"930\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henrietta Shore, Trail of Life, c. 1923.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Y Suspitsyn/Whitney Museum of American Art</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In contrast to Zorach’s ponderous landscape, Yun Gee’s Street Scene is composed at a vertiginous angle, giving the piece an off-balanced sensation. Consisting of large chunks of yellows, blues, reds and browns, the work owes debts to cubism and conveys a sense of the unruliness of modern life reminiscent of John Dos Passos. The aloneness and even desperation held by each of the teeming human figures in Street Scene feels purposeful, perhaps arising out of the racism that Gee experienced as a Chinese immigrant living and creating in San Francisco.</p> <p>From bathers and cityscapes, one arrives at Henrietta Shore’s monumental flower, titled Trail of Life. Recalling the work of Georgia O’Keefe, with whom she exhibited (sometimes being the preferred of the two), it shows a simplified, abstracted flower bending with sensuous shapes. The work is among Haskell’s favorites in the show. “It’s almost this budding beginning of a flower. Shore applied multiple layers of paint, so the color just glows. I love how artists of this period are dealing with universal ideas about the interconnectedness between humans and nature, and Trail just codifies this idea of nature as a kind of container – if not something spiritual then at least communicating interiority.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50b294cd920884d063a39fe6317c3d8ab37f79ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50b294cd920884d063a39fe6317c3d8ab37f79ab/0_0_3006_2254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oscar Bluemner, Old Canal Port, 1914\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oscar Bluemner, Old Canal Port, 1914.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Gerhardt and Denis Y Suspitsyn/Whitney Museum of American Art</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That interiority and interconnectedness is quite clear in the two haunting woodcuts by Isami Doi, a child of Japanese immigrants who grew up in Hawaii before pursuing art in Paris and New York. Carefully piecing together diverse textures and shapes, the woodcuts find a whole that is at once solemn and serene but also bursts with the energy of the natural realm. His Moonlight shows us the backs of two figures linked at the arm as they take a nighttime walk through foliage and toward houses in the distance. In the way the figures and their surroundings bend into one another, the connection between the human and the natural is potent. Doi’s The Stream offers a woman with downcast eyes standing pensively before a fence, behind which flows a stream. One longs to know what exactly comprises the stream of thoughts flowing through this woman’s mind.</p> <p>At a time when the world can often feel so heavy, and when many are still weighing whether to fully re-engage with life, At the Dawn of a New Age offers a powerful reminder of exactly why we flock to museums. This hit parade of American dynamism and diversity is a welcome invitation to leave screens behind and bask in the presence of something transformative. “My very innocent goal would be that I hope people come to the show and fall in love with the work,” said Haskell. “It’s so joyful and so full of promise. Walking up into the galleries I have this sense of elation.”</p> <ul> <li><p>At the Dawn of a New Age: Early Twentieth-Century American Modernism<br>is on show at the Whitney Museum of Art in New York until January 2023</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/24/passport-office-britain-dilapidated-public-service-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"In the Passport Office queue I see distress, despair and the dilapidated state of Britain | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/passport-office-britain-dilapidated-public-service-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/passport-office-britain-dilapidated-public-service-cuts","fields":{"headline":"In the Passport Office queue I see distress, despair and the dilapidated state of Britain","trailText":"Public service cuts are ruining what’s left of the essential services we all use, says Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee","body":"<p>At Globe House, the London Passport Office, I want to see where rightwing anarchy leads. The queues outside are a publicly visible sign of the dilapidated state, people indignantly eager to tell stories that seem to signal the collapse of public services, things once solid crumbling away.</p> <p>The first person I meet is a father from Chichester with his small son, on a last try for the boy’s passport for a family holiday to Greece that was booked three years ago. “It’s lost if we don’t go tomorrow.” A renewal applied for in February was “lost in the post” despite proof of postage. Then they were told a Passport Office IT “systems upgrade” in March had lost it. “Then they wanted another copy of our marriage certificate. My wife spent hours on the phone daily to get an appointment.”</p> <p>Next they were told the passport was in Newport, Wales, so he headed there at 4am. But in Newport, the Passport Office said it was in Glasgow. When he reached the Glasgow office by phone, they said it wasn’t there: “A nice girl said she’d only worked there three days.” He kept calling. Finally they told him to collect it in London today. “Maybe it’ll be there, maybe it won’t,” he says, in an incredulous daze.</p> <p>Even worse cases include a couple desperate to see their son, who has been taken seriously ill in Sierra Leone. They show me a photo of him unconscious in hospital covered with tubes. They have flights booked for that night, but a passport is lost in the system: they hope for compassion if they ever reach the inquiry desk.</p> <p>The Home Office’s bad management is longstanding, but austerity and now ideological anti-statism have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/30/passport-office-delay-thousands-summer-holidays\">made things worse</a>. The chaos over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/01/hundreds-of-ukrainian-families-halt-bids-to-reach-uk-after-visa-delays\">visas for war-stricken Ukrainians</a> lifted the lid on a shockingly punitive culture and and a shrunken state’s incapacity.</p> <p>Look elsewhere and you see government services in meltdown. Pity the drivers unable to work while waiting for licences in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/01/dvla-chiefs-and-staff-clash-over-safety-issues-and-hgv-licence-backlog\">DVLA logjam</a>, or businesses in cashflow crises waiting for delayed refunds owed by HMRC: that service had its staffing levels and resources <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-hmrc-cuts-taxpayers-call-contact-helpline-revenue-customs-a8375261.html\">cut by 17%</a> between 2010 and 2018, worsening the gap in uncollected taxes. Meanwhile, a <a href=\"https://www.localgov.co.uk/Cuts-to-trading-standards-putting-older-people-at-risk-of-fraud-warns-charity/44890\">56% cut</a> in trading standards officers from 2009 to 2016 helped <a href=\"https://www.betterretailing.com/tools-and-insights/illicit-tobacco-advice-independent-retailers-illegal-tobacco-sales/\">cost the Treasury £2.3bn</a> in lost tax from rogue cigarette sales in 2019-20 alone.</p> <p>Most things falling apart are invisible, with no queues to be seen, just an erosion of the basics that began with the first swing of the post-2010 austerity axe, long before Covid. Barely a week goes by without revelations of decrepitude: last week the National Audit Office <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/press-release/regulating-after-eu-exit/\">found regulators struggling</a> since Brexit to take on inspections that had previously been done by the EU. The Competition and Markets Authority, the Health and Safety Executive and the Food Standards Agency can’t recruit enough staff, lacking lawyers, vets and toxicologists.</p> <p>“Taking back control” requires more controllers. Instead, the government has just announced a random <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/civil-service-pcs-union-warns-of-strike-over-pms-plan-to-cut-91000-jobs-boris-johnson\">cull of 91,000 civil servants</a>, a fifth of the entire service. There’s no need for “deregulation” or “bonfires of red tape” when incapacity quietly stops inspections anyway.</p> <p>Remember all that Tory “elf and safety” mockery over myths such as banning conker fights? Since 2009, council health and safety inspectors have been cut by 54% and prosecutions by health and safety authorities have fallen 38%. Interventions from the Equality and Human Rights Commission have fallen by 27% and construction site inspections have dropped 18%. These are samples of enforcement from <a href=\"https://www.unchecked.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-UKs-Enforcement-Gap-2020.pdf\">Unchecked UK</a>, an organisation funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the Ecology Trust and others. Their findings on cuts to environmental inspections of water, air and agriculture are hair-raising.</p> <p>This week I spoke to environmental health officers around the country: one said just the day before she’d found unregistered food outlets whose owners were utterly ignorant of hygiene rules. Despite ever-increasing numbers of food purveyors, there are far too few inspectors. Huge numbers are living in private rented housing, and councils have no idea who or where their landlords are. The public accounts committee has reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/13/one-in-eight-privately-rented-homes-england-pose-threat-health-mps-say\">589,000 rented homes</a> with dangerous hazards, with too few inspectors expert in complex law to process cases against rogue landlords.</p> <p>Yet again a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/05/government-accused-of-betraying-workers-as-employment-bill-is-sidelined\">promised employment bill</a> was missing-presumed-dead from the Queen’s speech. The average employer can expect a check by HMRC’s puny minimum wage inspection team <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/a-minimum-wage-is-pointless-if-we-dont-enforce-it\">once every 500 years</a>. These are just a few of essential functions to be eroded once again by Jacob Rees-Mogg’s “bloodbath for the civil service”, as the Daily Mail put it gloatingly. Jill Rutter of the Institute for Government tells me there was no assessment of need before adopting this measure, just a crude cut back to the service’s size before Brexit and Covid. But by 2016 the civil service had already been <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/civil-service-staff-numbers#:~:text=In%20June%202016%2C%20when%20the,2012%20Civil%20Service%20Reform%20Plan\">cut to its smallest</a> since the second world war.</p> <p>The cuts will come through hiring freezes and voluntary redundancy, a recipe for losing the brightest and most expert civil servants. With areas such as the north-east of England most heavily reliant on public jobs, forget “levelling up”. Will <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/minister-opens-new-salford-office-22005013\">new offices</a> for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in Salford be allowed to hire locally?</p> <p>The government will pay a political price for this.

In many ways to break out the violins for Mark Lawrenson would really be to miss the true essence of the man. You may even have missed his retirement last week amid the opera of season-ending farewells. Divock Origi gets a guard of honour at Anfield. Mike Dean gets a 1,500-word valedictory feature in the Athletic. Lawrenson, by contrast, simply slipped away with a droop of the shoulders and very possibly a wry quip about not letting the door hit him on the way out.</p> <p>Which does feel a little strange, even when you take into account the fact that Lawrenson has now been in gentle recession from our screens for some time now. There was still the odd radio gig, semi-regular appearances on Football Focus, the weekly prediction column for the BBC Sport website. But it has also been a curiously inconspicuous retreat, given that – if you give it a moment’s thought – most football fans in this country will probably have spent hundreds if not thousands of hours watching Lawrenson’s face over the years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/final-whistle-goodbye-to-mike-dean-the-premier-league-ref-the-fans-love-to-hate\">Final whistle: goodbye to Mike Dean, the Premier League ref the fans love to hate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, of course, has long been the pundit’s privilege: to soundtrack these life-forming experiences for us, to be the voice at the back of the room, the background chatter to our triumphs and miseries, World Cups and FA Cups and those hazy Saturday nights spent on the sofa covered in crisp crumbs.</p> <p>Lawrenson’s talent – and it really was a talent – was simply to drift unobtrusively into our living rooms, say a few words about marking and drift out again largely unnoticed.</p> <p>You didn’t need to listen to what Lawrenson was saying. He wasn’t really saying much anyway. Were it not for the occasional twitch and quiver of his moustache you would occasionally forget he was talking at all. He didn’t fume or rant or “destroy” anybody. Indeed in 25 years of watching and listening to Lawrenson I am unable to recall a single distinct opinion he ever expressed, beyond an occasional distaste for diving and the occasional belief – strongly worded and sincerely held – that the striker’s got time to take an extra touch there.</p> <p>And so the retirement of Lawrenson is really more than a footnote in the broadcasting landscape. It marks the passing of an entire style of punditry, a whole era of men (and of course it was always men) talking about football on television, one in which the sport itself still felt like light rather than heavy entertainment. If Lawrenson was already beginning to feel like an anachronism long before he hung up his microphone for the last time, then it was because the tonal shift in football broadcasting over the last decade was in large part a reaction to pundits such as him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"357a34a8807e67c0ff0acc1f97dadedbfecdfc8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/357a34a8807e67c0ff0acc1f97dadedbfecdfc8b/0_90_3008_1804/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Lawrenson shares the Football Focus sofa with Tony Blair and John Motson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Lawrenson shares the Football Focus sofa with Tony Blair and John Motson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC News &amp; Current Affairs/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So these days we have the needly, bristling Chris Sutton, the man of a thousand takes, a pundit who appears to have been sent into a broadcasting studio with the express objective of trying to get himself punched for insurance reasons. We have Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher, for whom punditry is less a sofa and more of a soapbox, an arena for competitive emoting and strong opinions fully enunciated.</p> <p>Neville is saddened by the thing we’ve just seen. Carragher is more than saddened; he’s shocked and outraged. Neville sees Carragher’s shocked and outraged, and raises him a <em>flabbergasted</em>. Graeme Souness repeats what they’ve just said, but in a Scottish accent, and while furiously chopping an imaginary carrot. Micah Richards laughs uncontrollably. The entire exchange will later harvest more than a million views on YouTube.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/23/premier-league-2021-22-review-pundits-of-the-season\">Premier League 2021-22 review: pundits of the season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is, by many measures, better punditry: more entertaining, more strident, certainly more granular and analytical.

Hey! Are you still watching? Keep watching! Roy Keane’s going to fume in a minute! Micah will laugh! In many ways the current era of punditry has more in common with the early days of colour television in the 1970s, when pundits would openly argue and disparage each other for sport.</p> <p>My own favourite exchange comes from the 1974 World Cup, in which ITV’s Jack Charlton and Derek Dougan start a verbal brawl over the obstruction rule that is only settled when viewers are asked to write in on postcards to decide who was right. “Well, people have been wrong before,” Dougan grumbles after Charlton wins the poll by a 78%-22% margin. “They were wrong to vote for a Tory government instead of a socialist government in 1970.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seen in retrospect, it is the pundits of the 2000s – your Lawrensons, your Alan Hansens, your Andy Townsends – who now feel like the anomaly.

When you didn’t need to have an opinion on the Saudi Arabian takeover, or government health regulations, or really anything at all. In many ways Lawrenson was the last of them, these drawling ruminants of the studio jungle. He’s gone now, and it’s probably for the best.

Now Jean Carne is enjoying an unexpected second spell in the limelight","body":"<p>At 21, the singer Jean Carne had uprooted her life in Atlanta, Georgia, to elope to Hollywood with jazz pianist Doug Carn. It was 1969, and like so many American kids of the flower-power years, Carne was moving west to try her luck in the world of entertainment.</p> <p>While most of her generation would have struck out, Carne found herself living in an apartment block with members of a new funk collective from Chicago. These vegetarian men, who expounded on the benefits of clean living and astrology called themselves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/feb/05/good-time-the-greatest-moments-of-maurice-white-and-earth-wind-fire\" title=\"\">Earth, Wind &amp; Fire</a>. Doug and Jean soon hit it off with the band, recording backing vocals and keys on their first two albums, and even adopting their vegetarianism. The group went on to sell more than 90m records, becoming one of the best-selling pop acts of all time.</p> <p>In the ensuing five decades, Carne has honed her five-octave vocal range to perform with a roll call of the 20th century’s finest American singers. Her highlights include being the last singer to perform with jazz great Duke Ellington, performing with Stevie Wonder, Minnie Riperton and the Temptations, vocal coaching a young Michael Jackson, and featuring on albums from jazz fusion luminaries including Grover Washington Jr and Roy Ayers. She has also produced solo hits, including the 1978 rare groove classic Don’t Let It Go to Your Head and the 1986 R&amp;B ballad Closer Than Close.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VokLZ7xDQsc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VokLZ7xDQsc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>More than 25 years after her last album of original compositions was released, Carne is back with a new record, produced by A Tribe Called Quest’s Ali Shaheed Muhammad and composer Adrian Younge. Even so, she still harks back to the joys of being in Hollywood in her 20s.</p> <p>“We didn’t tell anyone we were leaving when we eloped,” she says, laughing over a call from her home in Philadelphia. “Thankfully, my parents were OK with it when they found out, although they did have a wager for how long the marriage would last! It turned out to be a wonderful time that has supplied me with everything I’ve needed. The Chambers Brothers were living there, as well as [manager to Roberta Flack and Herbie Hancock] John Levy; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janis-joplin\">Janis Joplin</a> would even stop by.

He showed me the skill in singing very high and very soft and was always recounting his philosophies on life; I wouldn’t take a million dollars to take back those moments.”</p> <p>The church setting is a familiar one for Carne. Her mother sang in the choir and by the age of four, Carne was taking her own solos. At 12, she was playing piano and arranging music for services. As part of the arrangement work, Carne coached the choir and realised she had a talent for guiding other voices. It was a skill that led her to work with the Supremes’ Mary Wilson and an 18-year-old Michael Jackson.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I came up with all the lyrics and melodies on the spot. It added pressure, but it was also so freeing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pair met in the mid-1970s after the Jackson 5 had left Motown and were working with the producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Carne was going through her own transition phase, having recently divorced her husband, and was finding her footing as a solo act by working with Gamble and Huff. Together they formulated what has become known as the “Philly soul” sound, alongside the likes of Teddy Pendergrass and Lou Rawls.</p> <p>For Carne’s latest project, on Muhammad and Younge’s Jazz Is Dead label – which has also released new work from her long-time collaborator Lonnie Liston Smith as well as ex-husband Carn – she is harking back to those Philly soul days by recording solely on analogue tape. “It was like being in the 70s with the equipment,” she says. “It was a very unusual situation. Adrian and Ali hadn’t sent me any songs. I just turned up at the studio, they started playing some piano chords and then I came up with all the lyrics and melodies on the spot. It added pressure, but it was also so freeing.”</p> <p>The resulting seven tracks showcase Carne’s voice in peak form. Opener <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUygSfdPCS8\" title=\"\">Come As You Are</a> places her soaring falsetto over a driving funk rhythm, while the Black Jazz era of cosmic social-consciousness is represented on tracks such as the euphoric People of the Sun and scat-heavy Black Love.</p> <p>After spending her early career being presented as a featured vocalist alongside her ex-husband or for groups such as Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, it all feels like an unexpected second coming for Carne, a late-career moment in the sun. “I had no problem with others taking the limelight,” she says, “but it feels like it’s my time now.”</p> <p><em>Jean Carne JID012 by Adrian Younge, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jean Carne is out on 29 May on Jazz Is

But the last live tortoise spotted in the country was in the north-eastern province of Formosa in 2002.

In Argentina, the consumption of its meat and the illegal pet trade are two of the key drivers of the tortoise’s demise, he adds. </p> <p>“The widespread destruction of the Chaco forest, their habitat, is another cause.

The process has not been easy or fast. “Transporting wild animals in Argentina is extremely difficult,” says Di Martino. “The international and national transport of wild animals in danger of extinction is forbidden in Argentina, so all transportation for rewilding projects must be done with special permissions that take months to process.</p> <p>“The importing of 40 tortoises from Paraguay was an important step, as it was the largest international transporting of individual animals in the framework of a conservation project. Little by little, these barriers are being broken down, but there is still much work to be done.</p> <p>“Also, all animals that enter rewilding projects must go through a rigorous quarantine before being released, to avoid introducing undesirable pathogens into the environment. The development of these tests was particularly expensive and involved a great deal of work from our veterinary teams.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8506779b85585e77e2086d6c949262fa7a2e045a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8506779b85585e77e2086d6c949262fa7a2e045a/0_0_1994_1309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A winding river and oxbow lake in the national park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tortoises’ new home is El Impenetrable national park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rewilding Argentina</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tortoises have been held in groups of 10 in four pre-release enclosures for several weeks to acclimatise.

I want this’: Sasha Lane and Alison Oliver on Conversations With Friends</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Conversations with Friends is a harder sell. The book and series follow a thorny quadrangle of sex and friendship between two best friends/ex-lovers and an older married couple – none of whom, in classic Rooney fashion, seem party to their own motivations. It’s a murkier tangle than Normal People, made even more inaccessible by the characters’ psychological opaqueness and general aversion to speaking. Key figures from Normal People – Irish production company Element Pictures, director Lenny Abrahamson and writer Alice Birch – strive for a similar quiet, meditative realism on Conversations, with characters who communicate more frequently, and significantly, through text and email. (Rooney co-wrote the first half of Normal People, but has no official role in this series.)</p> <p>Carrying over both Rooney’s reticent style and digital communication is a tall order, and the loss to translation is a palpable absence. Conversations with Friends is frequently beautiful and steadfastly naturalistic – we see the characters in transit, getting dressed, texting with clear timestamps for the summer of 2019 – but keeps its characters terse, two-dimensional and frustratingly inscrutable. It’s a curiously flat mixture – pretty people in pretty places, decent acting (particularly from leads Alison Oliver and Joe Alwyn) and well-choreographed, vérité sex scenes that mostly run cold.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lvxQuOvf9s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3lvxQuOvf9s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As in the book, the show takes the perspective of Frances, played by Irish newcomer Oliver, a 21-year-old university student who performs spoken word with Bobbi (American Honey’s Sasha Lane), drawing the eye of thirtysomething Melissa (Girls’ Jemima Kirke), an essayist and sophisticate. In the book, Frances and Melissa’s husband Nick (Joe Alwyn), both uncomfortable in social situations, flirt over email before plunging into an affair. On-screen, it happens within two episodes with little said between them beyond trailed-off sentences. “I’ll craft you an email. It’ll be full of compliments in complete sentences,” Nick tells her in the first episode after attending her poetry performance. “We won’t even have to make eye contact,” she answers. To quote Frances in any tense situation: OK.</p> <p>Like Normal People’s Marianne, Frances is a typical Rooney protagonist: intellectual, thin, confident when expressing her leftist views, aloof and tongue-tied when verbalizing her feelings. What can be detailed in the book as neuroticism comes off on screen as coldness, inexplicable wordlessness. Nick and Frances are two awkward people often behaving awkwardly, and passing that discomfort – or, given how little we can discern of these characters, blankness – to the audience. Their numerous sex scenes, which like Normal People employed an intimacy coordinator, are expertly choreographed and sensitively filmed yet lack a fundamental chemistry – motions without feelings. When Frances tells him, in bed on a Croatian holiday with Bobbi and Melissa, that she doubted his interest in her because “you don’t always seem that enthusiastic,” he answers that it’s not her – “it’s me, I’m just awkward.” She replies, “me too, obviously,” and they kiss.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/15/conversations-with-friends-review-sally-rooney-tv-adaptation\">Conversations With Friends review – TV so slow it must be trolling us</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That awkwardness pervades the whole 12-episode season, which struggles to capture Rooney’s psychological insights on the absurd performances and isolation of millennial life. That’s in part due to Rooney’s minimalist style – the prose is mostly action and dialogue, with characters loth to express their reasoning. The novel relies heavily on digital communication – Rooney didn’t earn her reputation as the breakout millennial author for nothing – which is notoriously tricky to put on screen. Someone staring at their phone is inherently un-cinematic.</p> <p>That being said, I found the show’s unhurried depiction of messaging – a chat history available to the audience, watching the characters use autocorrect, type and erase – to be one of its most evocative elements, in part because it’s still rare to see the weight of digital communication on our lives accurately reflected on screen. While the physical conversations trail off, leaving us wondering why either party wanted this affair or clung to this friendship, the texts – and Frances’s handling of them – are revealing. Her exchanges with Nick and Bobbi – showed to the viewer and, for longer messages, narrated aloud – evince the gap between what is said and what is felt in the ways the conversations simply do not. Frances eyes her phone, scrolls back through old messages (“are we still having an affair?”), lingers on past words, fixates. The texts have the cringe of specific intimacy (Nick texts in all lower case) and the thrill of secrecy. That they echo for both Frances and the viewer – we’re on her phone, too – adds dimension to her emotions, her desperation and confusion, flattened by her behavior in person.</p> <p>Ironically, it’s the bottled conversations that hamper the show. Frances and Bobbi are supposedly close, but there’s little to their relationship beyond unconvincing gestures of physical closeness, in brief sequences on dancefloors. It doesn’t help that Lane plays Bobbi as cold and incurious, which makes the character’s contempt for most people nearly unbearable by the season’s final episodes. You need to earn the characters’ ability to say basically nothing for several hours, and Conversations with Friends does not.</p> <p>In other words, it’s like many television shows – imperfect and at times unwieldy, sometimes working and sometimes not, a jumble of elements straining at its illusion. That Normal People transcended the jump to screen is, in rearview, remarkable and fortuitous. Conversations with Friends took on a tougher task and landed in the vast TV middle: easy on the eyes but not as deep as it’s trying to be, watchable but not likely to provoke much discussion.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/24/britain-strictest-headmistress-katharine-birbalsingh-state-school","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"State schools are not the wild west and Britain’s strictest headmistress is not Clint Eastwood | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/britain-strictest-headmistress-katharine-birbalsingh-state-school","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/britain-strictest-headmistress-katharine-birbalsingh-state-school","fields":{"headline":"State schools are not the wild west and ‘Britain’s strictest headmistress’ is not Clint Eastwood","trailText":"The right wing press believes Katharine Birbalsingh has done something magical by creating a safe learning environment in a state school.

All the different train firms are separate bargaining units, with Network Rail also divided into operations and maintenance. If operations – mainly signallers – vote to strike, the railway could be closed. If Aslef eventually takes drivers out, likewise. Otherwise, the immediate impact may be limited.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/20/threat-of-biggest-rail-strike-in-modern-uk-history\">Union threatens ‘biggest rail strike in modern UK history’</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>So why is the RMT considering a strike?</strong></h2> <p>Pay has been frozen in much of rail since 2020, and inflation has soared. The government has told the railway to reduce costs by about 10%. Network Rail, the state-owned company that runs the infrastructure, believes it can save more than £100m a year through workplace reform. That includes changing its maintenance regime to a “risk-based” assessment and using more technology, rather than having so many boots on the ground.</p> <p>While no formal proposals have been tabled, unions believe train operating companies will close ticket offices, and pay offers will be far below inflation. They say staff who were lauded as essential frontline workers during the pandemic should not now lose jobs or take effective pay cuts.</p> <h2><strong>Why are cuts needed?</strong></h2> <p>Rail finances have been upended by the pandemic and the government is now on the hook for the losses. Pre-2020, the industry took about £4bn in annual taxpayer subsidy; the Treasury has stumped up about £15bn more in total since Covid hit. Passenger numbers are back up to 80% of pre-Covid levels, but in key areas – the lucrative commuter networks into London, which used to bring guaranteed season ticket revenues – they are significantly lower.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7cb705bf174d845a0a3c7693bb3787bc6e2d811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7cb705bf174d845a0a3c7693bb3787bc6e2d811/0_47_5138_3082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Network Rail staff cleans ticket barriers at Waterloo station in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Network Rail staff cleans ticket barriers at Waterloo station in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Is that the new normal?</strong></h2> <p>Who knows? Arguably cutting services will accelerate decline. But subsidising trains at such cost appears untenable. Even pre-pandemic, a dip in season ticket sales suggested that the commuting of yesteryear could wane. Widespread remote and part-time working has posed a great challenge: given high peak fares, occasional rail travel can seem more prohibitive than the spread cost of annual season tickets.</p> <h2><strong>What is the government planning to do?</strong></h2> <p>Despite Treasury cuts, generally Downing Street has been avoiding a fight. But the transport secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/grant-shapps\">Grant Shapps</a>, suggested that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/22/unions-vow-to-fight-ministers-proposals-to-curtail-right-to-strike-on-railways\"> laws could be brought in to ensure “minimum service levels”</a>, as floated in the Conservative manifesto. Such an incendiary move – effectively denying the right to strike – is unlikely to become reality, and in the short term has rallied wider union opposition.</p> <h2><strong>Are other rail unions on strike?</strong></h2> <p>Aslef, which is currently in dispute with ScotRail but not elsewhere in the UK, has warned it will not tolerate a further pay freeze for the train drivers it represents. The TSSA has said it is considering a ballot. But only the RMT has gone ahead yet, in a move that the rail industry has called premature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e90492ca8bf3b716e3af220de1a4ebb303792ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e90492ca8bf3b716e3af220de1a4ebb303792ae/0_44_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Network Rail staff work on tracks at a closed Paddington Station in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Network Rail is divided into operations and maintenance staff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Are rail staff well paid?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, many are well paid by national standards – but most station or maintenance staff don’t earn anything like the train drivers whose salaries are often quoted in the press. Drivers (normally represented by Aslef) can earn about £63,000 on the tube and more on the national railway, where they have prospered since privatisation – largely because of the fragmented marketplace it produced for their labour.</p> <p>The real gravy is in the eye-watering salaries paid to senior staff on rail projects such as HS2, while train company managers can earn far more than the prime minister – and even the Department for Transport’s rail passenger services director gets paid a salary that far outstrips most civil servants above him.</p> <h2><strong>So will the rail strikes really be the biggest in modern history?</strong></h2> <p>Technically, perhaps – at least if you define modern as post-Thatcher. A national signallers’ strike stopped trains intermittently across the country in 1994, and other national stoppages did occur under British Rail – but since privatisation and more draconian labour laws, disputes have largely been regional. The sheer numbers and geographic spread, with so many firms and Network Rail involved, mean it is big.</p> <p>Factor in parallel strikes about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/london-underground-station-staff-to-stage-24-hour-strike-on-6-june\">pay and job cuts on the London Underground</a>, and there could be significant disruption at times across Britain this year. But with so many more people able to work flexibly or from home, it may not quite hit commuters in the same way that, say, the Southern rail strikes of 2016-17 did.</p> <h2><strong>Will it empty shelves?</strong></h2> <p>Doubtful – though it might provide political cover for supply chain disruption already seen since Covid and Brexit. Only a prolonged single stoppage would halt freight. Contingency plans, with supervisors and managers drafted in, would allow some trains to run at times in the day.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/may/24/j-crew-wants-to-charge-me-41-to-return-two-tops","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"J Crew wanted to charge me £41 to return two items","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/24/j-crew-wants-to-charge-me-41-to-return-two-tops","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/may/24/j-crew-wants-to-charge-me-41-to-return-two-tops","fields":{"headline":"J Crew tried to charge me £41 to return part of my online order","trailText":"A reader says return charges for UK customers were not previously made clear by US clothing brand","body":"<p><strong>In March I bought some clothes from the website of the US clothing brand J Crew, spending £260 on </strong><strong>an order with free delivery.

The journalist Vicky Spratt doesn’t make this case directly in her first book, but she does lay bare our state’s lack of fitness for purpose in its current condition, showing how scarce, unsafe, cramped, unaffordable and, above all, insecure housing lies at the root of Britain’s ongoing public health crisis.</p> <p>How did we get here? To put it bluntly, we allowed ourselves to be bought off. Instead of investing in skills, industry and people, voters were consistently told that if they bought a house they’d be set for life, and if they didn’t, it was their own fault if they ended up poor and voiceless. Everyone knows it’s a busted flush: even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\">Michael Gove</a>, now housing and “levelling up” minister, has belatedly recognised the urgent necessity for more social housing if he’s going to live up to his job title.</p> <p>Since long before Covid, the gap in health and wealth between homeowners and renters has been worsening as house prices have become decoupled from incomes and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/02/boris-johnson-pondering-right-to-buy-for-housing-association-tenants\">right to buy</a> has taken 3.5m council homes out of public hands. The proportion of householders renting privately – at market rates, from barely regulated landlords – has doubled<strong> </strong>from around 10% 20 years ago, pushing millions into housing precarity.</p> <p>Spratt began researching <em>Tenants</em> in 2017, after she founded the Make Renting Fair campaign which, alongside the work of tenants’ union Acorn, Shelter and Generation Rent, eventually got letting fees banned under the 2019 Tenant Fees Act. There are so many facets to Britain’s shortage of decent, affordable housing that she takes care to discuss them in separate chapters while showing clearly how each is connected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7e25eb4bf09880b13ec7415f828abdd9109070ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e25eb4bf09880b13ec7415f828abdd9109070ec/0_0_2550_3188/800.jpg\" alt=\"Author Vicky Spratt\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The author, Vicky Spratt, believes our housing problems, while complex, are solvable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Poppy Thorpe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Housing is a social and political responsibility that, in the past 40 years, has been handed to individuals in vastly differing sets of circumstances. Home ownership, the ultimate form of privatisation, has been exalted over every form of tenure, meaning that those who own see increasingly little common ground with those who rent. The number of households on waiting lists for social housing far outweighs the number of secure tenancies that come up in every local authority, forcing people who can’t afford to buy into private renting, even when they can’t afford it.</p> <p>One instance, or run, of bad luck can make people homeless for years. Families reliant on one income can be knocked for six if the main wage-earner is made redundant or injured at work. Spratt speaks to her interviewees over a period of months – years, in some cases – gaining testimonies of how losing a secure home, or not getting one in the first place, derails every other aspect of people’s lives.</p> <p>She meets Limarra, a 26-year-old woman who gained two degrees after having her child aged 17, and whose least-worst option while her daughter is small is to get up at 4.30 every morning to manage a branch of Starbucks for £230 a week take-home pay. She is ambitious and focused, and can afford the £1,000-a-month rent on her privately let flat as long as the landlord doesn’t put it up and as long as her paltry earnings are topped up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/housing-benefit\">housing benefit</a>.</p> <p>In Peckham, their area of London – near to Limarra’s mum, who takes her daughter to school every morning, so she can work – a grand a month in the private sector is cheap. When her landlord decides to sell up, it quickly becomes clear there are no other affordable flats in the area, but when she approaches Southwark council for emergency social housing she is told that they have no responsibility to rehouse her until she is literally homeless – that is, sitting in the housing office with her bags on the day her tenancy expires. Otherwise, she is deemed to have made herself “intentionally homeless” because she “chose” not to pay higher rent.</p> <p>“OK, now are you are homeless,” the housing officer tells Limarra, her belongings sitting in a rented van outside the council offices. She is offered a flat in Croydon, miles away from her mum, her daughter’s school, and, crucially, the community mental health team she has been seeing directly as a result of housing stress. Again, she is told that if she doesn’t accept it she would once again be classed as “intentionally homeless”. Placed in an insanitary, privacy-lacking hostel in Camberwell, she becomes suicidal and her daughter starts to wet the bed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is impossible to read this book without becoming almost incapacitated with rage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Conversely, Kelly’s family are moved to emergency housing after being “evicted by proxy” – that is, their tenancy ended by a landlord who puts up their rent beyond what they can afford. In Bromley, where Kelly lived with her partner and children, she was across the road from their trusted GP who treated her son for asthma. Once in new accommodation, she registers at a different surgery, whose inexperienced GP prescribes him the wrong inhaler. Six weeks after their enforced move to an unfamiliar area, he is dead.</p> <p>It is impossible to read this book without becoming almost incapacitated with rage. The difference between being securely and insecurely housed is effectively the difference between life and death. The King’s Fund, a health thinktank, estimates the cost to the NHS of poor-quality housing as <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2018-03/Housing_and_health_final.pdf\">£1.4bn every year</a>. In Germany, writes Spratt, where 40% of households rent privately, rents are kept affordable relative to income and tenancies are open-ended rather than requiring renewal every two years, often lasting decades.</p> <p>Spratt returns throughout to the point that our housing problems, while complex, are solvable. When Covid-19 barged into our lives two years ago, the government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/16/how-getting-a-hotel-room-in-march-kickstarted-a-life-off-the-streets\">Everyone In</a> initiative ended street homelessness in the space of 10 days. Emergency legislation temporarily prevented evictions, and a combination of furlough and mortgage relief prevented mass repossessions. She points to the Housing First programme, pioneered in Finland, as an example of how meeting needs directly – giving homeless people a house, with no conditions attached but the support to make it a home – transforms lives.</p> <p>Towards the end of the book, Spratt impressively widens her focus to consider how home is “the base from which we engage with society, with our community”. Without housing security we are condemned to living atomistically from day to day, unable to raise our horizons beyond the four walls we are threatened with losing. Housing isn’t a pension, or an investment, she writes: it’s “essential infrastructure”, not only materially, but psychologically. Until housing security is taken this seriously by everyone, the winners as well as the losers from this toxic lottery,<strong> </strong>all our homes will be built on sand.</p> <p>• <em>Lynsey Hanley is the author of </em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/estates-9781783783823\">Estates: An Intimate History</a> (Granta)</em><em> among other books</em></p> <p>• <em>Tenants: The People on the Frontline of Britain’s Housing Emergency</em> by Vicky Spratt is published by Profile (£20).

MAHY/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/scotland-reports-first-monkeypox-case\">57 cases of monkeypox</a> have been detected in the UK, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/scotland-reports-first-monkeypox-case\">Scotland announcing its first case yesterday</a>, and that number will continue to grow. But before you start to worry about lockdowns and another deadly pandemic, below we have outlined some fairly reassuring facts about this newly-famous virus.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What even is monkeypox?</strong></p> <p>Monkeypox has been around for a while. It’s a zoonotic virus (meaning it travels from animals to humans) and was first discovered in 1958 in colonies of monkeys. The first human case was recorded about 12 years later in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and for the last few decades the virus has generally stayed around central and west Africa, particularly in close proximity to tropical rainforests. Melissa Davey, Guardian Australia’s medical editor, has written <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/why-are-monkeypox-cases-suddenly-emerging-across-the-world-and-could-the-virus-have-mutated\">a great explainer</a> on the various reasons that cases of the virus are suddenly rising now.</p> <p>The virus has two genetic strains: the central African strain and the west African strain. The former is known to spread more easily and cause more severe symptoms whereas, generally speaking, the latter is milder – and it is that west African strain that is being found at the moment. “As far as I’m aware, no one outside Africa has died of monkeypox,” our science editor Ian Sample tells me. “Most people just shrug it off after a few weeks.” Ian’s right, according to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON385\">World Health Organisation</a> there have been no fatalities associated with this outbreak. </p> <p>Monkeypox has also been detected in the UK before, Ian says. “These cases caused doctors to scratch their heads in sexual health clinics. You had people turning up with ulcers and spots on their face and genitals, but they weren’t testing positive for the usual suspects like herpes.” But usually such patients have been quickly linked to somebody travelling to a country with high levels of monkeypox and bringing it back with them. Now – for the first time – the virus is being detected in people that have not travelled to western or central Africa. Scientists are left trying to figure out how these people were infected.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>How does it spread?</strong></p> <p>Monkeypox is spread when there is close contact with an infected person or animal. “This virus isn’t airborne [like coronavirus],” Ian explains, “it gets into someone’s body through broken skin. Even if you can’t see those breakages the virus can get through.” This is perhaps why a lot of cases are found to have been sexually transmitted, but that’s not the only way it can happen. It is possible to catch it the way you would any other virus, like the flu, through your nose or mouth, if someone infected sneezed into your face, or coughed right at you, “but they’d have to be pretty close,” Ian adds. “And there’s also a possibility of getting it if you’re changing the bedding of a patient who’s had a lot of these ulcers which can have quite high concentrations of the virus in them.” But crucially there does have to be a high level of close contact.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>How dangerous is it?</strong></p> <p>There’s no need to sound the alarm just yet. Monkeypox is not like Covid-19 – it’s nowhere near as transmissible, meaning that large outbreaks are very unlikely, and as it’s the milder strain of monkeypox, there’s not much to worry about in terms of death rates or severe disease either. “Monkeypox is a DNA virus, it doesn’t evolve anywhere near as fast as the RNA viruses, which is what coronavirus is,” Ian says. And because the virus is not new, doctors do have solutions on hand to mitigate damage: “the smallpox vaccine can give you about 85% protection against monkeypox. And there are also a couple of antivirals that could help.”</p> <p>That doesn’t mean monitoring isn’t needed. It’s still important we know who has got it and try to prevent the spread, as it can be dangerous for children, pregnant people and those with weakened immune systems – hence why those testing positive are asked to isolate for three weeks. And the symptoms can be debilitating: headaches, nausea, fever, swelling lymph nodes, exhaustion and lesions that turn into ulcers on the face, hands and feet.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The fallout</strong></p> <p>But it’s not just those who have caught the disease that are suffering as a result of the outbreak. The UN has condemned what it has described as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/un-denounces-homophobic-and-racist-reporting-on-monkeypox-spread\">racist and homophobic reporting of monkeypox</a>. A significant proportion of these cases have been detected in men who have sex with men, but scientists are clear that this does not mean that only LGBT+ people can catch the disease. Anyone who has close contact with someone who is infected is likely to get infected themselves. But the sinister undertone of some reporting is reminiscent of other viral infections that have been used to further stigmatise gay men in the past. “​​We saw this in the 1980s with HIV,” says Ian. “At times it was referred to as a ‘gay disease’ and that is obviously nonsense – anyone can get HIV just like anyone can get monkeypox.”</p> <p>Unlike Covid-19, monkeypox has been around for decades and been thoroughly studied. We know it doesn’t spread easily, it’s outside its natural home in the tropical rainforests, and it’s almost impossible to not know you have it once symptoms begin, making contact tracing and isolation easier. Cases will inevitably increase but unless something changes, it shouldn’t have the same catastrophic impact as the last disease to dominate the headlines.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Penn Badgley</strong> fans unite! <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/23/penn-badgley-interview-podcast-you-gossip-girl\">Hollie Richardson interviewed</a> a Covid-ridden Badgley about his career, his new podcast and how he deals with low self-esteem. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>I enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/23/amanda-abbington-sherlock-the-unfriend\">Arifa Akbar’s interview</a> with <strong>Amanda Abbington</strong>, on life after her divorce from Martin Freeman, and her new partner Jonathan Goodwin’s paralysis. “We try to say ‘Yes’ to a lot of things,” she says. “Life’s too short.” <br><em><strong>Hannah J Davies, deputy editor, newsletters</strong></em></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/children-social-care-review-england-communities\">Rebekah Pierre incisively examines</a> the <strong>landmark review of children’s social care</strong> in England as someone who has been through and worked in the system. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>I’ve absolutely raced through <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p0c5w0zm\">Sirin Kale and Pandora Sykes’s ten-part BBC podcast</a> <strong>Unreal: A Critical History of Reality TV</strong>.

But I will yarn about the process. Coming together as Indigenous creatives on this work has been effortless. Imagining new ancestral stories into existence is seamless. This group of young performers and the wider Digi Youth Arts team of Che, Loki and myself, along with our Elders in Residence Aunty Colleen Wall and Uncle Charles Passi were clearly all meant to connect at this time and create.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Storytelling is not only our means of passing on knowledge to the next generation but it is imperative for healing.

It is in the space between creation and movement that we find the answers that we have been looking for. Because in each run through of the performance or scene we learn something new about ourselves that we will carry with us for ever.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The way I tell stories is through the use of movement and dance. It’s how I express myself and my way of (re)connecting with community, culture and myself.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>– Nicholas Currie Inns, Mununjarli and Bundjalung performer.</strong></p> <p>Each person brings their skills and knowledge to the space, and this deepens our performance. We also reclaim the way we have always told stories by not sticking to the siloed rules of western arts practice. From rock rap to mesmerising dance to intergenerational conversation, our storytelling is not really theatre as our non-Indigenous peers know it.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Storytelling has always been in my blood. From growing up in a family that had traditional dances it was a somewhat comfortable switch to be on stage still telling those stories.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>– Ethan Enoch-Barlow, Quandamooka performer</strong></p> <p>We have always practised “theatre” on these lands. Recently, I completed a doctorate of creative industries focusing on how insurgence and resurgence functions in the creative development of ancestrally connected performance. But my “real” education in this space has been working across generations for the past nine years with Digi Youth Arts telling stories across performance, learning how to do this with respect to agency, protocol and deep time.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Reclaiming our space is important as our ancestors were stripped from theirs, and as we now have the stage, we can amplify and present that voice for our people reclaiming our name, mob and identity and owning it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>– Elijah Manis, Kulkalgal Nation performer.</strong></p> <p>The spaces that Digi Youth Arts, myself and many other Indigenous artists have to function in are not made for our processes. Every act on a main stage is still<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/23/controversies-epiphanies-and-the-case-against-canva-highlights-from-sydney-writers-festival\">an act of reclamation</a>.

It is a reminder that we have been fought for.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I perform I feel a sense of growth and pride but to feel that towards our young ones elevates its meaning.

Over the past couple of days, an area of low pressure has positioned itself just south-east of the continent and allowed cold air to filter northwards into southern Chile and Argentina. This process will continue over the coming days with temperatures 5-10 degrees below normal in Argentina from Thursday.</p> <p>In fact, the western side of South America, including farther north into Peru, has experienced almost perpetually cool conditions of late linked to an ongoing La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean. During these events, which usually occur every few years, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the south-eastern Pacific cool significantly as colder waters from the deep upwell to the surface. Current observations suggest SSTs just off the coast of Peru are between 1.5 and 3.5C colder than normal and they have been cooler than normal since last autumn. The presence of cooler water has an often moderating impact on temperatures in South America but can have wider-ranging impacts on global weather patterns too.</p> <p>One such link suggested by research is that with drier-than-normal weather over the southern US during the winter half of the year. Since January, conditions have been drier than normal across the desert south-west. For the likes of Arizona, critical fire risks are in place for Tuesday and the return of windier and warmer weather for the weekend suggests these may continue to be a feature in the short term.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an exceptionally warm airmass that affected Iberia – bringing maximum temperatures over 40C in parts of southern Spain on Friday and Saturday – is moving eastwards across southern Europe. Further heat is expected to continue from Tuesday and over the next few days across Italy, Greece and the Balkans. While temperatures won’t be quite as high as in Spain, the aforementioned areas will still be prone to at least the low to mid-30s Celsius for a couple of days, in parts 10 degrees above the seasonal norm.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/may/24/cost-of-living-response-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-rift","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T05:00:56Z","webTitle":"Cost of living response hindered by Johnson-Sunak rift, say ministers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/24/cost-of-living-response-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-rift","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/may/24/cost-of-living-response-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-rift","fields":{"headline":"Cost of living response hindered by Johnson-Sunak rift, say ministers","trailText":"Sources reveal frustration at likely delay of package to help households hit by squeeze on budgets","body":"<p>Cabinet ministers are frustrated that a “mano a mano” standoff between Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak is holding up measures to help people through the cost of living crisis.</p> <p>Downing Street denied there was a rift between No 10 and No 11, with one source insisting that the prime minister and the chancellor were on the same page but simply taking time to find the right way to “target help at the most vulnerable”.</p> <p>Nevertheless, cabinet sources told the Guardian that there was frustration at the probable delay of the package to help people hit by inflation and a squeeze on household budgets.</p> <p>An economic rescue package – short of an emergency budget but containing promise of help with bills or tax cuts – was pencilled in for Wednesday but government sources said it was now unlikely to come this week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/23/windfall-tax-which-cabinet-ministers-are-for-and-against-it\">Windfall tax: which cabinet ministers are for and against it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One cabinet minister said the pair were locked in a “mano a mano” standoff – a phrase meaning hand-to-hand fighting – over a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/23/windfall-tax-which-cabinet-ministers-are-for-and-against-it\">windfall tax</a> on energy companies, about which rightwing advisers in No 10 are known to be sceptical, as well as how best to help struggling households.</p> <p>They lamented the fact that clashes between No 10 and the Treasury had repeatedly resulted in messy political compromises – such as going ahead with April’s national insurance increase to avoid Sunak appearing to U-turn, before handing back some of the proceeds by raising the threshold.</p> <p>There are concerns that a similar approach to the windfall tax issue could result in a complex measure, potentially involving more council tax or energy bill discounts, that would fall flat politically. “That is where this is heading,” the cabinet minister said.</p> <p>A cabinet source said they wanted help for families to come “sooner rather than later” because the delays were harming the party’s standing with the electorate ahead of two crucial byelections in Tiverton and Wakefield.</p> <p>Another cabinet minister said they would wait days or a week for cost of living measures “but not if it gets into months”, adding that it was sensible to make sure the measures were properly targeted at those who needed help.</p> <p>The disagreement between No 10 and No 11 is centred on whether there will be a windfall tax to help raise money, as well as whether any help on bills will be targeted at the most vulnerable or will be more universal – such as a rebate for everyone, a VAT cut or bringing forward the 1p cut in income tax.</p> <p>No 11 is understood to have been partially won round to the idea, if more investment in North Sea oil and gas is not forthcoming, but there is more resistance in No 10. Sunak is understood to be examining whether a levy on energy companies could be tapered to take account of investment levels.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the reality is that a windfall tax will not raise enough money to fund any big tax cuts or bill rebates, which are likely to have to be funded by more borrowing.</p> <p>Asked about measures to help with the cost of living, Johnson said on Monday that “no option is off the table” but added in relation to the idea of a windfall tax: “I’m not attracted, intrinsically, to new taxes.”</p> <p>He told broadcasters: “As I have said throughout, we have got to do what we can, and we will, to look after people through the aftershocks of Covid, through the current pressures on energy prices that we are seeing post-Covid and with what’s going on in Russia and we are going to put our arms round people, just as we did during the pandemic.”</p> <p>He said there was “more that we are going to do” but “you’ll just have to wait a little bit longer”.</p> <p>With a meeting due on Tuesday morning, those who sit in cabinet are still heavily split over a windfall tax, ranging from Kit Malthouse, who is firmly against, to Treasury ministers such as Simon Clarke who suggest that the money to provide help with the cost of living will have to come from somewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"First Edition sign up\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Canzini, the deputy chief of staff brought in to help Johnson assuage the right wing of his party, is said to be against a windfall tax, and sceptical about financial help for poorer households.

For there has, since the genocide, been a “<a href=\"https://www.spectator.com.au/2022/04/hotel-rwanda/\">blank ahistoricism</a>” about the country, as the Rwanda expert Michela Wrong has put it.</p> <p>The arguments against this devil’s bargain with the Rwandan government include: its assassination or abduction of rivals abroad, notably allegations surrounding the cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/21/letter-links-suspects-in-rwandan-spy-chiefs-death-to-government\">Patrick Karegeya</a> (Kagame’s former intelligence chief, strangled in a Johannesburg hotel – the government has denied any involvement) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/01/hotel-rwanda-activist-paul-rusesabagina-kidnapped-from-dubai\">Paul Rusesabagina</a> (subject of the film Hotel Rwanda, tricked into flying to Rwanda from Texas); the suppression of activists and journalists within Rwanda; a poor history of hosting migrants (many Eritreans and Sudanese, sent from Israel, <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/israel/i-was-left-nothing-voluntary-departures-asylum-seekers-israel-rwanda-and-uganda-enhe\">fled Rwanda for Uganda</a> – others started the journey to Europe); a likely lack of oversight of UK funds (<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-seals-deal-with-rwanda-to-offshore-asylum-migrant-seekers/\">initially £120m</a>) paid to Rwanda; and, not least, the difficulty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/boris-johnson-takes-pre-emptive-shot-at-lawyers-over-rwanda-scheme\">fending off challenges</a> by – to use Johnson’s judiciary-hating phrase – “lefty lawyers”.</p> <p>It’s fallacious to say, as Patel has done, that the policy is right simply because no one is offering alternatives. It’s instructive, too, that fellow Conservative Andrew Mitchell<strong>, </strong>first among those few MPs who know Rwanda, does not support this policy. Maybe he agrees with David Davis that the scheme is “<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/david-davis-boris-johnson-rwanda-asylum_uk_625e4f71e4b052d2bd656c0d\">moral delinquency</a>”. These are not the usual bedfellows of lefty lawyers.</p> <p>My own fitful learning began more than 30 years ago, in October 1990. From a house on the Uganda-Rwanda border, while writing The Last King of Scotland, I watched canvas-sided lorries traverse the valley below. They were carrying troops of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1990/oct/04/rwanda\">Rwandan Patriotic Front</a> (RPF) to incursion points from Uganda into Rwanda. This force, consisting mainly of exiled Tutsi veterans of the Ugandan wars that followed Idi Amin’s despotism, was on that occasion repulsed. Next developed 18 months of guerrilla warfare, led by Kagame, from an RPF base in the cross-border Virunga mountains. Later came the RPF’s militarised response to the genocide of 1994, again led by the same man who will host some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/14/fifty-migrants-to-be-sent-from-uk-to-rwanda-in-a-fortnight-says-boris-johnson\">50 migrants</a> the British government is hoping to send in coming weeks.</p> <p>No one should doubt that Hutu supremacists were responsible for the genocide and Kagame’s forces ended it. These facts should not mask the continuing cauldron of complexity into which we are now diving headlong. In respect of extrajudicial killings since the genocide, the Rwandan government has honoured itself almost as much as Putin’s Russia. Its history of this is not limited to notable opponents. During the first and second <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/16/congo\">Congo wars</a> (1996-1997 and 1998-2003), attacks on Hutu civilians who had fled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), committed by proxy Rwandan militias and the Rwandan army, <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/countries/africa/2010-drc-mapping-report\">cost the lives</a> of tens of thousands.</p> <p>Data for the execution of Hutu refugees are recorded in Gérard Prunier’s From Genocide to Continental War: The Congolese Conflict and the Crisis of Contemporary Africa (2009). Western nations turned their eyes from Rwanda’s “refugee management programmes” during that period. Unwilling to risk a fragile post-genocide stability, they also had political and natural-resource interests in DRC. And they did not understand the complexity. Neither did I at the time – not enough, or too late.</p> <p>What happened in the Congo wars, forming the historical basis of my scales-fallen-from-eyes novel, Freight Dogs, is why I doubt Johnson and Patel’s assertion that Rwanda is transformed into “one of the safest countries in the world”. It’s not just Conservatives who don’t get it: those two wars involve a particularly British disregard of the Great Lakes. The second war officially ended in July 2003, with the worst massacres long dispatched; only in April had the Blair government, focused on Iraq, begun <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,958738,00.html?=rss\">to half consider them</a>. Five years later, as new violence erupted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/16/congo-giles-foden\">calls for EU intervention</a> were <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/11/10/britains-cowardice-congo\">blocked by Britain</a>.</p> <p>Rwanda was the prime mover in much of this, although at least eight other African nations were implicated in the second war, along with myriad armed groups. This little reported suite of antagonisms caused a death toll of 5.4 million. That figure includes mortality from dysentery, malaria and malnutrition, as refugees fled fighting. It remains nonetheless the deadliest global conflict since the second world war, causing chaos in DRC, a country nearly four times the size of Ukraine, with about 50 million more people. One might speak of black lives not mattering. Rage about this was why I wrote my novel, which took all too long, because the subject is indeed so complex.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/few-optimistic-about-drc-peace-talks-in-kenya/a-61620879\">talks last month</a> to get Rwanda’s proxy rebel group, M23, to lay down its arms, conflict continues in eastern DRC, albeit much less so than formerly. On Monday and Sunday, M23 attacked UN forces in the region. Uganda, not Rwanda, has borne the brunt of a consequent refugee crisis in the Great Lakes – among other factors, it is perceived as safer than Rwanda.</p> <p>Uganda hosts the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uganda-has-a-remarkable-history-of-hosting-refugees-but-its-efforts-are-underfunded-166706\">largest population of refugees</a> in Africa: more than 1.5 million, of which nearly 460,000 are from DRC, along with many from other nations, including Rwanda itself. Given Rwanda’s role in causing DRC and its own citizens to flee, is it wise to be sending people there? Or anywhere in the Great Lakes, a region that has so often fallen victim to itself and the asymmetric morality western nations apply to it.</p> <p>To do so as neighbouring east Africa faces a severe drought, with the UN’s World Food Programme saying <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-61437239\">20 million people</a> are at immediate risk of hunger, which will cause further flows of refugees, shows how wrong this policy is. We are a small island with a relatively small migrant problem. Even smaller Rwanda, so often misconceived, should not be coming into the solution at all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Giles Foden is the author of Freight Dogs, Zanzibar and The Last King of Scotland</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Instead, the 18-year-old Mancunian is holed up in a drab-looking hotel room. Is she in London for Tardis-related reasons, perhaps? “Well,” says Finney, stifling a smile and looking around with a sense of mild desperation. “Yes, that’s something that came out this week,” she finally replies, with the care of somebody who has likely signed an exceptionally rigorous confidentiality agreement or two.</p> <p>It’s been a big week for the teenager, who only recently made her screen debut as trans schoolgirl Elle Argent in Netflix’s very sweet – and very popular – romcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/18/no-drugs-booze-sex-or-swearing-will-heartstopper-rewrite-the-young-love-rulebook\">Heartstopper</a>. That show came with its own ardent fan following but, in the days before we speak, Finney ascended to a new level in the world of cult British TV. She is set to join Russell T Davies’ re-rebooted Doctor Who, starring Sex Education’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/10/its-a-massive-moment-how-ncuti-gatwa-will-shake-up-doctor-who\">Ncuti Gatwa</a> as the first black Doctor.</p> <p>Finney’s character is called Rose, which was also the name of the companion famously played by Billie Piper in the mid-00s. The relevance of this is currently unknown. What we do know is that Finney was recently spotted filming scenes alongside David Tennant, AKA the Tenth Doctor, and Catherine Tate, AKA the Tenth Doctor’s companion, Donna Noble. In other words, there are more than enough cryptic developments to keep Whoniverse obsessives in a tizzy until the end product finally airs in 2023.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e092f6ec72d11b3c679f723aa22e192d7bf86e78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e092f6ec72d11b3c679f723aa22e192d7bf86e78/167_0_5011_3007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘There was no way anybody else could play this character’ … Finney as Elle in Heartstopper\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘There was no way anybody else could play this character’ … Finney as Elle in Heartstopper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finney squirms at the mere mention of Doctor Who – and what little she has to say about her casting only confuses matters further. “I didn’t know for a long time,” she says over Zoom, through curtains of sleek blond hair, “but I <em>did</em> know. I don’t want to give too much away.” My chances of gleaning anything meaningful seem practically zero. Was it mere coincidence that Davies’ mid-00s Doctor Who collaborator Euros Lyn also directed Heartstopper? “That was a huge coincidence!” exclaims Finney, before admitting that, actually, Lyn did recommend her to producers who were “looking for a trans girl”. But she doubts Lyn knew the precise nature of the project under discussion.</p> <p>Regardless of how she got there, Finney is clearly in her element. She loved watching Tennant and Tate as a child – she was one when the former took over as the Timelord – and is finding it “a bit surreal to be acting with them. It’s insane and I’m learning so much.” She’s also very excited to be involved with this thrillingly progressive new Doctor Who era alongside Gatwa and, of course, returning showrunner Davies, the writer who has almost single-handedly made British TV a more queer-friendly (and straightforwardly better) place, with such shows as It’s a Sin, Years &amp; Years and Queer As Folk.</p> <p>Finney fully appreciates Davies’ significance: “I am in awe of the fact that I’ve been seen by such a legend.” In fact, her only source of stress has been a very pleasant one: “I was worried about having two huge fanbases following me and whether they’d get along. But I think it’s going pretty well so far!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cb89cfb23f011e9cf4d856e78f7dac205d666eb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb89cfb23f011e9cf4d856e78f7dac205d666eb3/0_0_1848_1848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the cast of Heartstopper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘We’ve got a group chat we message on every day’ … the cast of Heartstopper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reckoning with internet fanbases is nothing new for Finney: she had one before she was famous, thanks to a popular TikTok account she started in school and used to document her trans experience. Now, thanks to Heartstopper – a hit for Netflix, which last week commissioned two further seasons – her following is gargantuan and intensely communicative (she has 1.7m followers on TikTok and 1.3m on Instagram). The series is based on <a href=\"https://heartstoppercomic.tumblr.com/\">Alice Oseman’s cult internet comics</a>, first published in 2016, about two schoolboys who fall in love. Fans follow the show’s stars forensically on social media, just as invested in their real-life friendships as their fictional ones. So have the actors really remained close mates since filming wrapped? Finney looks at me with horror-tinged disbelief. “Of course we’re really friends! We’ve got a group chat we message on every day.”</p> <p>Most of the Heartstopper team were acting novices, cast via open auditions on Zoom. Finney was alerted to a call for a trans girl of colour by her TikTok followers. Although she had never heard of the comics, she says: “I just knew I would get it – it was a calling. There was no way anybody else could play this character.” She identified strongly with Elle, who transfers from an all-boys grammar to the girls’ school next door, and has a budding romance with close pal Tao. So strong was her connection, in fact, that the role – her first proper acting job – didn’t actually involve much acting, “because Elle literally is me”.</p> <p>At the time of her audition Finney was studying drama at college, but had little hope of making it. “I was like, ‘There’s no trans roles, there’s nothing. I’m basically setting myself up to fail.’ I didn’t see myself reflected in the UK media anywhere.” Instead, she intended to “just do TikTok for the rest of my life”. That said, TikTok was not an entirely pleasant experience. Although Finney had a supportive fanbase, the response from strangers was brutal. “For the most part, it was hate back then. I can’t lie.” But she does see a silver lining, should mainstream success bring any unpleasantness. “It gave me a thick skin. I’ve had all the hate in the world through TikTok.”</p> <p>That online barrage was accompanied by real-life abuse too. At her first school, Finney was “bullied left, right and centre. People didn’t like how camp and flamboyant I was – but of course that’s on them not me.” She then transferred to a “posher” school and “ended up transitioning towards year 10. And of course I got bullied for that.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c551291046aa1d0a5a955fecfa8ae775cee445f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c551291046aa1d0a5a955fecfa8ae775cee445f2/305_2_3196_1918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘If Elle can do it, I can do it’ … with William Gao in Heartstopper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘If Elle can do it, I can do it’ … with William Gao in Heartstopper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was also mocked for making TikToks. “Cut to two years later, people [from school] are on TikTok doing the same thing I was doing. And people who didn’t have very nice things to say about me are watching Heartstopper and congratulating me.” Finney is magnanimous about this turnaround. “I don’t want to blame them fully because I know that when you’re in high school, you just want to fit in.”</p> <p>As Heartstopper fans will have gleaned, Finney’s experience differed from Elle’s. There is some homophobia in the Heartstopper universe but it’s generally a sunny and accepting place where Elle’s trans identity is largely unremarked upon. “It’s such a breath of fresh air,” says Finney. “Elle’s isn’t like any other trans story we’ve seen before – because it’s not focused on gender dysphoria or bullying. It’s something the little Yasmins can watch and think, ‘If Elle can do it, I can do it.’”</p> <p>How might seeing Elle on screen in her early teens have changed Finney’s own experience? “I would think there’s hope – a black trans person on the screen, so young, so authentic and so natural.” She cannot stress the importance of this kind of visibility enough. “You do not understand: the amount of time I’ve spent searching for representation, clawing for it, and trying to find somebody I could look up to as an idol, somebody that is a reflection of me.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef793f57fa3e81bca92d2873ad32357a416fb1bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef793f57fa3e81bca92d2873ad32357a416fb1bf/0_67_2306_2880/801.jpg\" alt=\"The next Doctor … Ncuti Gatwa.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The next Doctor … Ncuti Gatwa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While playing aspirational trans characters is a boon, Finney is hoping that won’t be all her career is limited to. “I think we’ll really [have] change when I can play a character whose gender identity or sexuality isn’t specified. That’s when the industry will start to see trans actors as normal actors like everybody else, and we can play any role that we want to. When I can play a cis role, it will be sunshine and rainbows.”</p> <p>Finney knows the complexities of identity-conscious casting, though. After all, if a trans actor can play a cis character, why not vice versa? The answer is two-fold. Firstly, there’s already a dearth of opportunities for trans actors. Secondly, when a cis actor plays a trans character, far more is at stake. Finney cites the example of Eddie Redmayne, who played a trans woman in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-danish-girl\">The Danish Girl</a>. “He gave such a great performance. I don’t have a problem with that. What I have a problem with is when people search up the cast for The Danish Girl and they see Eddie Redmayne isn’t trans and it was all a lie. Sadly, it creates this image for trans people that we aren’t actually what we say we are.”</p> <p>Still, Finney is not complaining about her trajectory. On the one hand, she’s determined to dream big; on the other, her ambitions seem rather modest. “For the most part, I’m just happy to be seen,” she says. “And I will play trans roles for the rest of my life if I have to because I think every trans story is valid. But bring on the next role: trans, cis, alien – whatever!”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/24/european-fruit-with-traces-of-most-toxic-pesticides-up-53-in-nine-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T05:00:56Z","webTitle":"European fruit with traces of most toxic pesticides ‘up 53% in nine years’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/24/european-fruit-with-traces-of-most-toxic-pesticides-up-53-in-nine-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/24/european-fruit-with-traces-of-most-toxic-pesticides-up-53-in-nine-years","fields":{"headline":"European fruit with traces of most toxic pesticides ‘up 53% in nine years’","trailText":"Analysis of nearly 100,000 samples found residues in a third of apples and half of blackberries","body":"<p>Contamination of fresh fruits by the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/eu-pesticides-database/active-substances/index.cfm?event=search.as&amp;t=3&amp;s=3&amp;s=1&amp;a_from=&amp;a_to=&amp;e_from=&amp;e_to=&amp;additionalfilter__class_p1=&amp;additionalfilter__class_p2=&amp;string_tox_1=&amp;string_tox_1=&amp;string_tox_2=&amp;string_tox_2=&amp;string_tox_3=&amp;string_tox_3=&amp;string_tox_4=&amp;string_tox_4=\">most hazardous pesticides</a> has dramatically increased in Europe over the past decade, according to a <a href=\"https://www.pan-europe.info/resources/reports/2022/05/forbidden-fruit-dramatic-rise-dangerous-pesticides-found-fruits-and\">nine-year study</a> of government data.</p> <p>A third of apples and half of all blackberries surveyed had residues of the most toxic categories of pesticides, some of which have been linked to illnesses including cancer, heart disease and birth deformities.</p> <p>Residues on kiwi fruits rose from 4% in 2011 to 32% in 2019, with the contamination of cherries also more than doubling from 22% to 50% over the same time period.</p> <p>In all, the analysis of nearly 100,000 popular homegrown fruit samples in Europe found a 53% rise in contamination by the most hazardous pesticides, over nine years.

For many years, the report has shown that 98% of the samples collected comply with EU legislation.”</p> <p>The commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/food/plants/pesticides/sustainable-use-pesticides/farm-fork-targets-progress/eu-trends_en\">claims</a> that the use of hazardous pesticides dropped by 12% in 2019 compared to the 2015-17 period, and is proposing <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/food/horizontal-topics/farm-fork-strategy_en\">a further 50% cut</a> by 2030.</p> <p>In contrast, the new study found that contamination figures had “dramatically” increased for fruits such as apples (by 117%) and cherries (by 152%) since 2011, the year that EU governments were supposed to <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32009R1107\">start banning</a> the relevant pesticides. Overall, they found that the proportion of contaminated fruits and veg in 2019 was up 8.8% on the 2015-17 baseline.</p> <p>Dr Guy Pe’er, an ecologist at iDiv, said that the quantities of pesticides used were less important than their impacts, because “nowadays you can kill a lot more with a lot less material.”</p> <p>He said the new study was extremely worrying because it “likely exposes just the tip of an iceberg of agrochemicals” as a result of its focus on chemicals already proved to be hazardous.</p> <p>“Our concerns about the overuse of chemicals should go far beyond just worrying about the specific fruits and vegetables that are monitored – we are speaking of a system that literally kills itself,” he said.</p> <p>A reform of EU pesticides law, which could contain new reduction targets, is expected on <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/the-green-brief-its-now-or-never-for-energy-conservation/\">22 June</a>, after it was <a href=\"https://www.greens-efa.eu/en/article/document/letter-on-the-sustainable-use-of-pesticides-directive-to-the-european-commission\">postponed</a> in March amid food security fears related to the Ukraine crisis.</p> <p>Environmentalists have <a href=\"https://www.greens-efa.eu/en/article/document/letter-on-the-sustainable-use-of-pesticides-directive-to-the-european-commission\">raised the alarm</a> over what they say are “systematic attacks” on the coming proposal by agribusiness lobbyists.</p> <p>In March, the European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1963\">announced</a> an “exceptional” suspension of green farming rules to allow crops to be sown across 4m hectares (10m acres) of ecological focus areas.</p> <p>Olivier de Schutter, the co-chair of IPES-Food and UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights said that European decision-makers should stand firm on green rules.</p> <p>“Unfortunately now with the food crisis that has developed, we have very strong pressure particularly from farmers unions who say we need to boost production to compensate for the disruption to supplies of wheat, vegetable oil and maize from Ukraine and Russia,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“That discourse is very dangerous … but it is a discourse that’s very tempting for governments to follow.”</p> <p>The farmers’ union Copa-Cogeca and German pesticide manufacturer Bayer were contacted for comment.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/may/24/one-woman-took-out-13-of-her-own-teeth-the-terrifying-truth-about-britains-dental-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T05:00:56Z","webTitle":"‘One woman took out 13 of her own teeth’: the terrifying truth about Britain’s dental crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/24/one-woman-took-out-13-of-her-own-teeth-the-terrifying-truth-about-britains-dental-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/may/24/one-woman-took-out-13-of-her-own-teeth-the-terrifying-truth-about-britains-dental-crisis","fields":{"headline":"‘One woman took out 13 of her own teeth’: the terrifying truth about Britain’s dental crisis","trailText":"In England, only a third of adults – and half of children – now have access to an NHS dentist. As those in pain turn to charity-run clinics for help, can anything stop the rot?","body":"<p>It is over an hour before the emergency dental clinic is due to open, but Jodie Manning is taking no chances. She hasn’t been able to eat for four days – “I can’t physically bite down any more” – and is determined to get an appointment. Sitting on a plastic chair outside a community centre in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, the student hairdresser is a picture of misery, periodically clutching her cheek and looking down at the number she has been given to mark her place in the rapidly growing queue.</p> <p>Aged 19, she has been to hospital with severe toothache “three-and-a-half times” in the previous year. The half is when they sent her home without treatment; on the other occasions, she was kept in overnight after collapsing from pain and dehydration, when even drinking liquids hurt her swollen mouth. Morphine has become her crutch: she fell asleep in college recently after taking the powerful painkiller. Like many of those waiting grimly in line, she has been struck off by her NHS dentist after not attending for two years, even though surgeries were shut to all but emergency cases during Covid.</p> <p>She isn’t the only one in the 50-strong queue surviving on liquidised food; others complain of constantly bleeding tongues catching on broken teeth. Some are self-medicating with half a bottle of whisky every night, according to a man with an abscess wearing a hammer and sickle pin badge who turns out to be Darren Turner, the only Communist party councillor in England (he was elected to Bury St Edmunds council on a Labour ticket but defected in protest against Keir Starmer’s leadership).</p> <p>“I personally have been trying for probably the best part of the last five or six years to get an NHS dentist, but it’s just impossible,” he says. “I had a wisdom tooth out in Cambridge privately and I needed to take a £500 bank loan to pay that. I’m a single father and I don’t have that kind of money hanging around to spend on my teeth. Feeding my children and putting a roof over their head has to come first.”</p> <p>Further up the queue, David Mead is more cheerful. Having recently been homeless, living in a tent in nearby Sudbury – “Look me up, I was in the local newspaper: ‘Sudbury rallies around homeless 19-year-old’!” – he says he has hardly cleaned his teeth for 10 years. A few weeks ago they started to hurt as he ate. “I want to find out what’s going wrong there,” he says.</p> <p>Others share tales of misfortune . “I cracked my tooth eating a Curly Wurly – as you do,” says Dean Leighton, a plumber in the utilities department at Cambridge University. He has turned up in a lime green T-shirt bearing the legend: Macho Man. It is a tribute to the late wrestler, Randy Savage, but could be read as a declaration of bravery. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"39fbbcb975f4a9974a07b874448c35c357e3713f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39fbbcb975f4a9974a07b874448c35c357e3713f/0_277_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Leighton undergoes an extraction in the Dentaid clinic in Bury St Edmunds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Leighton undergoes an extraction in the Dentaid clinic in Bury St Edmunds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Probably the saddest sight is the children who can no longer chew food normally. Some have never been able to see a dentist. Ruby Moore, clutching her teddy bear, Lucy, is only six, and has lost most of the enamel off her molars – a problem that can be caused by sugary drinks and snacks, poor brushing or, less often, genetics. “My teeth hurt,” says Ruby in a voice that lisps a little since she slipped on some hand sanitiser during Covid and knocked out a front tooth.</p> <p>She and her mum, Tamsin, had an NHS dentist but were booted off the list for reasons Tamsin still doesn’t quite understand. She is also in pain, sucking on tubes of Orajel, which temporarily relieves toothache. She has tried to get an emergency appointment elsewhere but has been turned away. “They told me, ‘Unless you are bleeding profusely we can’t see you,’” she says.</p> <p>Hence taking Ruby out of school on a Thursday morning to see a mobile dentist from a charity originally set up 20 years ago to deliver dental equipment to the developing world. Dentaid was founded in 1996 off the back of a project to help treat prisoners at a jail in Ukraine. It then began refurbishing donated equipment and sending it to charitable dental clinics across the world. As funding increased, Dentaid started projects in 70 countries including Malawi, Cambodia and Uganda.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d499bec80a931e33d9085c2000c13c4e5ac504cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d499bec80a931e33d9085c2000c13c4e5ac504cb/0_0_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tamsin Moore and her daughter Ruby wait to be seen by a Dentaid dentist.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tamsin Moore and her daughter Ruby wait to be seen by a Dentaid dentist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That the charity has ended up treating patients in the back of a car park in one of the wealthiest towns in Suffolk is a sad indictment of a broken system, according to the local Labour councillor Donna Higgins: “These are people who need urgent healthcare.”</p> <p>The same desperation can be seen across England, particularly in the north and east. <a href=\"https://dentistry.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ADG-Report_The-urgent-need-to-level-up-access_April-2022_V3.pdf\">Only a third of adults – and less than half of English children – now have access to an NHS dentist</a>, according to the Association of Dental Groups (ADG). At the same time, three million people suffer from oral pain and two million have undertaken a round trip of 40 miles for treatment, the ADG calculated recently, calling dentistry “the forgotten healthcare service”. Tooth extraction is now the most common reason for a child to be admitted to hospital, costing the NHS £50m a year.</p> <p>Dentaid’s first UK project took place in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, in December 2015 with free clinics for people who were struggling to access dental care. It now has four mobile dental units, soon to be joined by a fifth. Most of their work is for homeless and vulnerable people across the UK, but they are doing an increasing number of public access clinics.</p> <p>The charity’s first two visits to Bury St Edmunds were prompted by campaigning from a group called Toothless in Surrey and funded by Dentaid. To pay for the return trips, Higgins and seven fellow councillors, including Turner, chipped in £400 each from their “locality budgets”. It is not really what those funds are for, she says. “They’re supposed to be for getting up a playgroup, or if the community centre asks us to fund a second tea urn.”</p> <p>Bury St Edmunds is not the sort of place you associate with desperation. It has <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/14171031/beautiful-greggs-buildings-bakery/\">England’s poshest branch of Greggs</a>, housed in a Grade II-listed, 17<sup>th</sup>-century wood-panelled building; a Waitrose and a shop that only sells gourmet ready meals. But not everyone in the town can afford to spend a fiver on a microwave dinner for one – and certainly not on private dental care, which is the only option after all the local surgeries stopped accepting new NHS patients, even children. A similar story has played out across England, with “dental deserts” developing in all parts of the country, particularly away from the major cities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>They’re building all these houses but no one who lives in them will be able to get an NHS dentist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The ADG recently calculated the Top 20 “dental deserts” in England, with parts of Lincolnshire taking three of the four top spots, along with the East Riding of Yorkshire. North Lincolnshire has just 32 dentists for 100,000 people, the lowest rate in the country. Just 33.1% of adults and 35.3% of children there had seen a dentist in the 24 months up to June 2021.</p> <p>Approximately 2,000 dentists will have left in the past year, serving more than four million patients in England, the ADG said, arguing: “If there was ever a candidate for ‘levelling up’, NHS dentistry must be it. Funding has been flat for the past decade (a real-terms cut after inflation), and recruitment is now near impossible in rural and coastal communities – particularly the east of England from Whitley Bay to the Wash.” Brexit has inevitably made it harder to recruit dentists from the EU.</p> <p>The further a place is away from a dental training hospital, the more likely it is to have a shortage of NHS dentists, explains Charlotte Talbot, a dentist who has taken a day’s annual leave to volunteer at Dentaid’s Bury St Edmunds clinic. “It breaks my heart to see how desperate people are for treatment in a place like this,” she says. “I’m from Suffolk, I know Bury. It’s an affluent place. But the last time I volunteered here with Dentaid I saw a woman who had taken out 13 of her own teeth. It’s a sad state of affairs.”</p> <p>She looks through the window of the Dentaid van at a construction site, where builders are erecting 79 homes on a new housing estate, Lyle Place. “They’re building all these houses but no one who lives in them will be able to get an NHS dentist.”</p> <p>Even if the developers were obliged to contribute cash towards a new dental surgery, as they often are with new schools, there is no guarantee the NHS would be able to find any dentists prepared to staff it. Talbot, who now works in a London dental hospital providing treatment to disabled and homeless people, used work in an NHS community practice. “It was hard,” she says. “You see 30 patients a day in 10-minute appointments and can’t do the dentistry you want to do. NHS dentists have to work 30-40% harder to earn the same money as a private dentist, who are able to provide high-quality treatment without the same pressures or time constraints.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aeb0779ee0b70a335e5153a7f545927b9d1cf16e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeb0779ee0b70a335e5153a7f545927b9d1cf16e/0_403_6047_3629/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natalie Bradley, Dentaid’s clinical director and an NHS dentist, assesses a patient in the Bury St Edmunds community centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalie Bradley, Dentaid’s clinical director and an NHS dentist, assesses a patient in the Bury St Edmunds community centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The decline of NHS dentistry has deep roots. Years of underfunding and the current government contract, blamed for problems with burnout, recruitment and retention. Dentists are paid a flat fee for services regardless of how long a treatment takes (they get the same amount if they extract one tooth or five, for example). Covid exacerbated existing challenges, with the airborne disease posing a health risk for dentists peering into strangers’ mouths all day.</p> <p>As the British Dental Association put it in its most recent briefing: “NHS dentistry is facing an existential threat and patients face a growing crisis in access, with the service hanging by a thread.”</p> <p>Natalie Bradley, Dentaid’s clinical director and an NHS dentist, says regular checkups would lessen most patients’ problems. The day before the Bury clinic, the team had been in Leiston, a town of 5,000 near the Suffolk coast <a href=\"https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/health/mydentist-leiston-closing-due-to-lack-of-dentists-7796346\">that has had no dentist at all</a> since April 2021, when the final practice was forced to shut after being unable to recruit enough staff.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It costs £400 every time someone goes to A&E with toothache, even if they’re only given painkillers. A checkup costs £20</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“We saw someone with a suspicious lesion in their mouth that could be cancer,” she says. “We’re seeing much more extreme cases, a lot of DIY dentistry, people experimenting with extractions and fillings and cases where people have burned their gums using aspirins and clove oil, which can cause caustic burns.”</p> <p>Cutting back on NHS services makes no financial sense, she says: “It costs about £400 every time someone turns up to A&amp;E with toothache, even if all they can usually be given is painkillers. A checkup costs £20.”</p> <p>Some of the dentistry performed in the Dentaid van is far from simple. It requires three dentists to diagnose the cause of Jodie Manning’s agony. A tricky extraction follows. Dean Leighton, in the Macho Man T-shirt, has a tooth pulled, too. David Mead, the formerly homeless young man, needs no treatment, and is sent away with toothpaste and a brush. Young Ruby has some fluoride treatment to build up her missing enamel and her mum gets four fillings.</p> <p>But about 20 people are told after four hours in the queue that there is not time to treat them. Tony Judge, a scrapyard worker, is among them. He can only chew food in the middle of his mouth because of a cracked molar and a hole on the opposite side. He has no plan B: “I called 111 and they referred me to a private dentist, but they wanted a £200 deposit over the phone before I even got an appointment.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6beb461203f26559f254ddbdf008bff5295b4814\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6beb461203f26559f254ddbdf008bff5295b4814/0_295_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue waiting to be treated.

Everyone seems to agree the government contract needs a serious rethink, but there are other measures that could be taken, argues Simon Hearnshaw, an NHS dentist for 35 years in Hull who now works on dentistry for Health Education England.</p> <p>Fluoridisation of the water in areas of deprivation would be a start: “Only 10% of England has fluoride in the water, mostly in the Midlands and north-east,” he says. Daily supervised brushing in primary schools, as happens in Sweden, would be another.</p> <p>Emergency charitable services such as Dentaid, however well-intentioned, cannot be the solution, says Hearnshaw. “Why is it acceptable to wait in a queue for dentistry? If that was happening for any other part of healthcare, we would be horrified.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/may/24/mangrove-nine-garden-activism-chelsea-flower-show-notting-hill","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T05:00:56Z","webTitle":"Mangrove Nine garden brings activism to Chelsea flower show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/24/mangrove-nine-garden-activism-chelsea-flower-show-notting-hill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/24/mangrove-nine-garden-activism-chelsea-flower-show-notting-hill","fields":{"headline":"Mangrove Nine garden brings activism to Chelsea flower show","trailText":"Hands Off Mangrove represents plight of 1970s activists who overcame might of British state","body":"<p>They were worlds apart in 1970, when the face of the Chelsea flower show was Britt Ekland posing with the rose of the year.

They are part of a new trend in the flexible world of work: Thursday is the new Friday.</p> <p>Office-based staff are increasingly returning to their city centre desks, but only for part of the week. Many are opting to commute to their workplaces during the “core” midweek days – Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday – bookending the working week at home.</p> <p>The popularity of Thursday evening socialising with colleagues has not gone unnoticed by the bosses of hospitality businesses.</p> <p>“In terms of pattern in the cities, Mondays tend to be quieter, Fridays tend to be quieter, Thursday very strong,” Phil Urban, the chief executive of the pub and restaurant group Mitchells &amp; Butlers, said. “While the suburban business is still doing well, people who would have had a meal or a pint near their home are doing it in London.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c630f75395ac07f0ada294f13e933d7835100b37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c630f75395ac07f0ada294f13e933d7835100b37/517_99_2894_2031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"O’Neill’s signage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pub and restaurant group Mitchells &amp; Butlers, which includes the O’Neill’s chain, says its city centre locations are gradually becoming busier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: May James/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company’s city-centre locations – which include the O’Neill’s and All Bar One chains – are getting gradually busier, Urban said, which he attributed to the slow but steady return of workers.</p> <p>“It continues to strengthen, and that is partly the offices going back. I think offices will continue to go from three days to four days. I travel in and out [of London], and at my train station I’m now struggling to park again. It’s the first time I can say that in two years,” he said.</p> <p>Covid-19 caused two years of stop-start restrictions for office-based companies and their employees, who were repeatedly told by the government to work from home, then urged to return to their desks.</p> <p>After the lifting of lockdown measures, many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/06/sweet-deal-uk-workers-lured-back-to-office-with-bonuses-and-ice-cream\">businesses announced perks</a> to entice their workers back, including unlimited hot drinks, free breakfasts or company-branded merchandise.</p> <p>Despite these inducements, the return to the office has been a trickle rather than a flood. The number of passengers on the tube midweek remains at 70% of pre-Covid levels, according to Transport for London.</p> <p>However, Thursday is streaking ahead as the most popular day to work alongside colleagues, according to TfL figures. Almost 3m tube journeys were made on Thursday 12 May, the highest number since the pandemic began.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2022-05-23-05:22:49/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Work graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2022-05-23-05:22:49/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The trickle rather than flood of people means the bakery chain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/greggs\">Greggs</a>, for example, is still reporting sales 10% below pre-Covid levels at its outlets in city centres as well as those near offices. </p> <p>The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has called for more investment in the capital’s public transport to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/sadiq-khan-london-covid-bank-branch-northern-line\">bring office workers back to their commute</a>.</p> <p>The sluggish return can be partly attributed to the success of remote working during the pandemic.

A quarter of workers (24%) were dividing their time between home and the office in May, according to the latest survey by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics\">Office for National Statistics</a>, up from 13% in early February. </p> <p>Workers reported that an <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/ishybridworkingheretostay/2022-05-23\">improved work-life balance was the main benefit</a> of working from home in some capacity, while about half of hybrid workers said they had fewer distractions at home, and a similar number said working from home improved their wellbeing. </p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/17/uk-pay-inflation-unemployment-city-bonuses\">tight jobs market</a>, in which workers can pick and choose jobs, has given employees more leverage in this negotiation. Employers who offer hybrid working to their teams are also likely to benefit from improved output, according to Heejung Chung, professor of sociology and social policy at the University of Kent.</p> <p>“We are increasingly seeing evidence where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/working-from-home\">working from home</a> will be helpful for productivity,” she said, adding that workers especially valued the chance to ditch the commute at a time of rising costs.</p> <p>Not having to travel to an office every day “saves workers money and time, which evidence shows they give back to their employers in productivity gains when working from home”, she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This newfound flexibility brings challenges for city centre businesses, from sandwich shops to dry cleaners</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Chung, the author of The Flexibility Paradox<em>, </em>a book on flexible working, believes some degree of remote working is here to stay.</p> <p>“We will see businesses asking workers to come back in more often, but will the office five days a week be normal again? Absolutely not,” she said. “The genie is out of the bottle and it’s not going back in.”</p> <p>Yet this new-found flexibility brings challenges for city centre businesses, from sandwich shops to dry cleaners, whose trade previously depended on a steady stream of office workers five days a week.</p> <p>That may partly explain recent political interventions in the working-from-home debate. Boris Johnson recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/14/boris-johnson-urges-more-people-to-return-to-office-working\">called for workers to return to the office</a>, saying it made people “more productive”.</p> <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for efficiency, stoked criticism after leaving what were deemed to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/23/condescending-jacob-rees-mogg-leaves-notes-for-wfh-civil-servants\">passive-aggressive notes on the desks</a> of civil servants who were not in the office when he visited.</p> <p>Ministerial requests notwithstanding, the office return appears to be accelerating, as workers attend more in-person meetings. UK office occupancy hit its highest level since the start of the pandemic in the week ending 13 May, according to the latest data from Remit Consulting, a management consultancy that specialises in property.</p> <p>The average weekly office occupancy rate reached almost 28% across the UK, and topped 29% in London that week, the highest recorded over the past year, according to data sourced from entry systems at office buildings in major cities.</p> <p>However, this means office occupancy remains at about half the average level seen before the pandemic. Once again, the busiest days of the week remain Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Remit found.</p> <p>Despite worries about what this means for the future of offices, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/17/landsec-london-office-leasing-profit-bluewater-trinity-leeds\">leasing in London</a> is booming, according to recent updates from the office owners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/land-securities\">Land Securities</a> and British Land.</p> <p>“We have had the best year for London leasing in 10 years,” Simon Carter, the chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/britishlandcompany\">British Land</a>, said, adding that companies were on the lookout for office space with natural light and outside terraces, and were demanding sustainable, energy-efficient buildings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Location is also important, Carter said: “I think there has been a drive to more central locations, because if people are going to come into the office three, four days a week but live more dispersed around the UK, they want an office that is closer to a major transport hub.”</p> <p>British Land has three “campuses” in London that comprise office buildings, surrounding shops and hospitality venues and account for two-thirds of its property portfolio.

How many years since the inquiry and they have still not fixed what is wrong. They are not going to change what they are doing.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/11/stephen-lawrence-timeline-events-since-teenagers-murder\">Stephen was 18</a> when a gang stabbed him to death in a racially motivated attack at a south London bus stop. After Macpherson, the then Labour government put pressure on police to reform.</p> <p>The Lawrences buried Stephen in Jamaica, and Lawrence, speaking from there, said the government had to step in to force change. “The only person who could change their behaviour and force them to change is the home secretary. Everybody knows they are not going to change,” he said.</p> <p>“It is a waste of time. They know what they need to do. They need to change and treat people with respect no matter what they look like.”</p> <p>Lawrence said communities would be disappointed by the plan, and added: “They never admit it, they always say they are not institutionally racist.”</p> <p>At a press conference to launch the plan, three respected police chiefs – David Thompson, the chief constable of the West Midlands, who oversaw the plan; Andy Marsh, the chief executive of the College of Policing; and Tyron Joyce, an assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire, who also worked on the plan – were asked whether institutional racism still affected policing. They declined to answer.</p> <p>Joyce said the whole debate should not get hung up on that phrase, adding: “I get that there is an awful lot of emotion linked to those two words. But actually it is the action we should be focusing on now, and moving forward.”</p> <p>Two others on the panel who have been helping police with the plan said policing was still institutionally racist – Andy George, the president of the National Black Police Association, and Abimbola Johnson, the chair of an independent oversight board meant to ensure top officers come up with a more rigorous plan that pays attention to what communities want.</p> <p>Police chiefs debated a public acceptance of institutional racism but could not agree, and sources say there was significant resistance.</p> <p>But one has accepted it still applies. Lucy D’Orsi, the chief constable of British Transport Police, said black communities suffered from overpolicing. “I find Macpherson’s definition of institutional racism difficult to challenge when I consider the collective failure of our service to proportionately police Black communities,” she said.</p> <p>“When Black people are significantly less likely (64%) to trust the police than white people (74%), that tells me all I need to know about institutional racism. Overpolicing is not OK and it can’t continue.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/may/24/couch-potatoes-at-higher-risk-of-coronary-heart-disease-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T05:00:55Z","webTitle":"Watching less TV could cut heart disease, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/24/couch-potatoes-at-higher-risk-of-coronary-heart-disease-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/may/24/couch-potatoes-at-higher-risk-of-coronary-heart-disease-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Watching less TV could cut heart disease, study finds","trailText":"About 11% of cases could be prevented if people reduced TV watching from two or more hours to less than an hour a day","body":"<p>More than one in 10 cases of coronary heart disease could be prevented if people reduced their TV viewing to less than an hour a day, research suggests.</p> <p>Coronary heart disease occurs when fatty material builds up inside the coronary arteries causing them to narrow, reducing the heart’s blood supply.

The impact of cluster bombs in these areas was so large that in some cases they hit and killed numerous animals. A short distance from the cluster bomb found at Hostomel, the carcasses of two horses show clear marks of its submunitions on their bodies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"644b932f051cbb4e1941b2fc2447e4dbe6e05b4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/644b932f051cbb4e1941b2fc2447e4dbe6e05b4b/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two horses killed in the countryside of Hostomel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two horses killed in the countryside of Hostomel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Borodyanka, prosecutors have spent days exhuming dozens of victims who were hastily buried in local cemeteries by relatives during the bombing, because, according to the authorities, many of them were killed by cluster bombs. Coroners in areas north of Kyiv confirmed to the Guardian that they had found fragments of cluster munitions embedded in bodies dug out in the area. The findings are being classified by coroners and will be reported to The Hague, where charges of war crimes committed by Russia could be formalised in the coming months. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
