Medvedev began the third set with a break</strong> of Djere and then, as if struck by nerves, handed it straight back, double-faulting on the last point. Then follows a long game on the Serb’s serve, Medvedev missing a winner on break point. The Russian even seems to be enjoying how long this third game of the third set is carrying on for. Djere then misses a volley at the net. But then gets an advantage with an overhead. That’s saved by a Medvedev passing shot midway up the court. This is a marathon now. Then smash after smash is followed by lob after lob with Djere eventually netting his smash. He then saves with a winner down the line. Then misses volley when Medvedev had sallied all the way back into the Seine, and it’s coughed up to the Russian by a double fault. That took 16 minutes. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cfa76a9f39bb3a029514abc93ae45e3878fb338\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cfa76a9f39bb3a029514abc93ae45e3878fb338/0_0_4549_3033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danill Medvedev plays a backhand against Laslo Dere.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danill Medvedev plays a backhand against Laslo Dere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-26T13:00:13.590Z\">at 2.00pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-628f69fc8f08e0af9112cf19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-26T11:53:43.920Z\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Some Reuters copy on that amazing win for Jeanjean over Pliskova. </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The 26-year-old Jeanjean is a former big hope of French tennis who ended up living on minimum wage after a knee injury suffered when she was 15 kept her off the courts for two years.</p> <p>Dropped by Nike, who had given her a 10-year sponsorship deal, and by the French federation, who had assigned her a full-time coach when she was 12, Jeanjean went to study in the United States at the Lynn University in Florida. She came back to tennis after five years in the U.S. only for her return to be slowed down by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>“I lived on minimum wage and I didn’t live from day-to-day, but week after week. I put all the money I had into a week’s worth of tournaments and if they went well I got another week, but if they went badly I didn’t play for two months because it was financially impossible,” she said.</p> <p>On Thursday, Jeanjean outfoxed eighth seed Pliskova, a semi-finalist here in 2017, to get into the third round. “I could not try to overpower her, it was impossible, so I had to try to derail her and it worked perfectly,” she said on court Simonne Mathieu.</p> <p>Jeanjean, whose early rise had drawn comparisons with Martina Hingis, will next face Russian Ekaterina Alexandrova, the 30th seed, or Romania’s Irina-Camelia Begu.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-628f65728f08e0af9112cef6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-26T11:39:32.811Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Medvedev, having broken back</strong> when looking in trouble in the second set, will serve out for it against Djere.

Then she went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I love the United Kingdom, [Thornberry] is embarrassed by our flag.

He is not calling it the “emergency budget” that Labour has been demanding, but the size of the giveaway - at least £10bn, according to overnight briefing - makes it more significant than many of the budget we’ve had over the last decade or so. But this is the third fiscal event on this scale already this year - after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/03/energy-bills-rishi-sunak-discount-rebate-council-tax\">£9bn energy support package announced in February</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/mar/23/spring-statement-2022-rishi-sunak-poorest-families-likely-to-be-worst-hit-by-impact-of-ukraine-war-live-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with:block-623b631e8f0867da372175f9#block-623b631e8f0867da372175f9\">the spring statement</a>, which included further giveaways worth around £10bn - and we have not even had the 2022 budget. Spending interventions on this scale have become the new norm.<br></p> \n  <p>Sunak has been promising further support measures for a week, but no one at Westminster believes that its timing, less than 24 hours after Boris Johnson made his statement to MPs about the Sue Gray report, is a coincidence. Banging on about <a href=\"https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/politics/johnsons-fondness-of-dead-catting-revealed-in-old-telegraph-column-304291/\">“dead cats”</a> is one of the most hackneyed, and often erroneous, features of modern political commentary, but today it is fully justified.</p> \n  <p>As we explain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/rishi-sunak-to-announce-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms\">in our overnight story,</a> Sunak is going to announce a major U-turn, because he will announce a windfall tax having spent months rejecting what has been Labour’s flagship economic proposal. But his announcement today may indicate a change of approach in another respect. In<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/may/17/northern-ireland-protocol-brexit-liz-truss-boris-johnson-uk-politics-latest?page=with:block-6283cb238f08261baccdbc70#block-6283cb238f08261baccdbc70\"> his speech in the Queen’s speech debate</a>, and in other recent inteventions, Sunak has implied that he wants to focus help on the most vulnerable. Some of the measures announced today will be targeted at the poorest households, but the overnight briefing suggests there will also be a strong universal element too it as well, with every household getting extra support. In an interview on the Today programme this morning <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Paul Johnson</strong>, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the public spending thinktank, questioned whether this was the right approach. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For the poorest households it’s certainly very much needed. It’s extraordinarily hard to cope with that kind of increase in your energy bills and general inflation, not least because benefits have only risen by 3% this year.</p> \n   <p>Whether it’s needed for all households, I think, is more of a difficult point. £100 off for each household in the country costs, each £100, costs something like £3bn and a lot of that money, frankly, will go to households who don’t desperately need it. I’m sure they’ll appreciate it, but won’t necessarily need it. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>9.15am: </em>James Cleverly, the Europe minister, gives evidence to a Lords committee on the Northern Ireland protocol.</p> \n  <p><em>Around 11.30am:</em> Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, makes a statement to MPs about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/rishi-sunak-to-announce-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms\">a multi-billion cost of living support package,</a> partly funded by a windfall tax.</p> \n  <p><em>12pm: </em>Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, takes questions from MSPs.</p> \n  <p>12.30pm: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p><em>12.30pm:</em> Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, appears on ITV’s Loose Women.<br></p> \n  <p><em>After 12.30pm: </em>Boris Johnson leads tributes to the Queen in a debate marking her Platinum Jubilee.</p> \n  <p><em>Afternoon:</em> Sunak does a Q&amp;A with people on a visit, as well as a social media Q&amp;A with the moneysaving expert Martin Lewis.</p> \n  <p><em>2pm:</em> Sir Stephen House, the acting commissioner of the Metropolitan police, gives evidence about the Partygate investigation to the London assembly’s police and crime committee.</p> \n  <p>I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all.

Then, in her first extended trip abroad, she left it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/11/emma-raducanu-makes-tennis-history-with-us-open-final-win\">having won the US Open</a>.</p> <p>With her success has come certain difficulties. She has had to adjust to the reality of being a grand slam champion: the target on her back in the locker room, the scrutiny outside of it, the reality that she no longer has nothing to lose on court and even a stalker invading her privacy. Since the US Open Raducanu has lost more than she has won, compiling a 10-13 record, and has pulled up with innumerable physical complaints.</p> <p>Every struggle Raducanu has had this year should primarily be a reminder how abnormal and astonishing her US Open run was. She was clearly not physically or mentally prepared for the rigours of the tour yet she was able to play at the highest level for 10 consecutive matches from qualifying, winning without dropping a set. That run showed the potential she has but building a career to last and a game that can hold firm regardless of the conditions, form or opposition is an entirely different proposition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13a9040bd6574dd85691ad67fee0d5dbad75cb69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13a9040bd6574dd85691ad67fee0d5dbad75cb69/0_166_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Raducanu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Raducanu has lost some of the stronger parts of her game during the clay-court season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the WTA Race, the yearly rankings, Raducanu currently sits at 61st, a more accurate reflection of her current stature than her ranking of 11. That is no shame. The only other teenagers above her in the race are Coco Gauff and Leylah Fernandez. Even without her US Open title, simply reaching the top 100 just a year after her WTA debut would have been a significant achievement.</p> <p>Over the past year, Raducanu has certainly made decisions to be questioned, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/27/emma-raducanu-reflects-on-tough-choice-to-split-with-coach-torben-beltz\">her well-publicised coaching situation</a>. Her preference for frequently changing coaches and relying on various sources for advice predates 2021 and her unconventional methods have clearly helped her to significant success, but given her own inexperience, the notion that she can successfully coach herself is questionable.</p> <p>Certain parts of her game have also regressed recently, particularly her serve and forehand. More recently, she has spent so much of her first clay-court season experimenting with her game on the surface, mixing in loopier top spin, angles and junk, that on a hot day in faster conditions against Sasnovich her forehand desperately lacked the attacking quality that had contributed so much to her success.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\">  <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Raducanu’s overexposure has meant the criticism has often been too much, and the response to some of her losses has been extremely toxic.

She worked in a school, he had a factory job. She was three months pregnant and the couple were looking forward to their first child together.</p> <p>Over the next two months, they lost almost everything.</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>They had not paid much attention to the warnings that Russia could launch a new war in Ukraine, but they could see and hear the first incoming fire on 24 February from their windows.</p> <p>It soon became clear that it was too dangerous to stay sleeping in the apartment, but their block’s cellar was not fit for habitation, so instead most residents moved to the stairwell, laying out makeshift mattresses on the hard concrete floors.</p> <p>Gradually, they settled into a routine. In the first days, there were lulls in the shelling and they could scurry outside to buy food. They bought two chickens from an acquaintance with a garden; with someone else, they swapped a bottle of vodka for some potatoes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c28db6b3d847c60401c57f29335824b08103ddce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c28db6b3d847c60401c57f29335824b08103ddce/0_91_3204_1922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mariana Vishegirskaya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The image of pregnant Mariana Vishegirskaya who escaped a maternity hospital hit by Russian shelling in March was published around the world.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mstyslav Chernov/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They cooked over open fire in the courtyard, though at times even that seemed too dangerous, as the artillery shells flew in with increasing frequency. Once every two days, Vitaly would risk his life to venture out to a well and bring water for the family. Some days, he took Svitlana’s 13-year-old son with him, so they could carry more water back. In the night, it was sometimes so cold in the stairwell that the bottles of water turned to ice.</p> <p>One day, when Vitaly began to lower the bucket into the well, he saw there were dead bodies floating far down below. He assumed they had jumped in to take cover during unexpected shelling, but had then fallen and drowned. He set off to find another well, with clean water.</p> <p>On one water run, a shell landed so close to Vitaly that he was thrown to the ground by the blast. “He came back home with these crazy eyes, he was making no sense, I thought I’d lost him forever,” said Svitlana. The next day, his cognitive function was better, but he lost hearing in his right ear for the next two months.</p> <p>How many people in their building were killed? Vitaly counted, slowly: “One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight people we knew personally, just from our section of the block. And in the neighbouring block it was much, much worse,” he said.</p> <p>From the blown-out windows of the upper floors of their building, they could see plumes of smoke rising across Mariupol. Svitlana wondered about her parents on the other side of town. She had no idea if they were still alive, and no way of finding out. There was no electricity and no phone reception.</p> <p><strong>****</strong></p> <p>On days when there were deaths, a group of men from the block buried the bodies in the courtyard, working as quickly as possible to minimise the time spent outside. It was the old people who died first.</p> <p>“I knew those old women all my life. They sat outside the apartment block on the benches, chatting away, passing the time. And then you have to close the eyes of those women and bury them in their own courtyard,” said Vitaly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9c817242d0b9879d84eb1149225e1ca29fb0c58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9c817242d0b9879d84eb1149225e1ca29fb0c58/263_304_3509_2106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walk next to an apartment building hit by shelling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk next to an apartment building hit by shelling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five times, Grad missiles hit their apartment block, as Russian forces haphazardly attempted to target detachments of Ukrainian forces that had based themselves nearby. Vitaly and Svitlana’s flat caught fire after one of the strikes. By the time the flames died down, everything had been destroyed; even the wall between the kitchen and the living room had been incinerated.</p> <p>The cold nights, the lack of food and the constant bombardment were hard to stand. Svitlana’s daughter had bouts of hysteria and screaming. An old man on one floor kept asking the same question: “When will it end?” On another floor, a woman refused food. It would be better to end things sooner, she said quietly.</p> <p>On 17 March, after another rocket attack, Svitlana lost her pregnancy. She was bleeding heavily and feverish, but there was no chance to receive proper medical care. On the third day, one of the neighbours managed to find an ampoule of Oxytocin; Svitlana injected it herself and blood started flowing more freely.</p> <p>“I’m not 15, I know how these things work,” she said, when asked how she knew how to inject the medicine. It may have saved her life.</p> <p>After the miscarriage, the neighbours rallied around Svitlana with the few provisions they had left. Someone rustled up some vitamin pills. Someone else found a miraculously uneaten piece of cheese. She continued to bleed periodically, but felt as if she might survive.</p> <p>One morning, a part of the apartment block was hit by an airstrike, causing the entire building to shake and debris to fall from the ceiling and walls. As they regained composure, they could hear wailing from the ninth floor, where a woman had remained, living with her 11-year-old son throughout the bombardment.</p> <p>Vitaly rushed upstairs. He could see the boy’s arms and legs sticking out from under a pile of bricks and debris. He worked him free. The boy was shocked, but unhurt. His mother was dead.</p> <p>They were not able to bury her in the courtyard like the others; she had not been a slim woman, and it was too much to carry her down from the ninth floor. So they left her under the rubble.</p> <p>Afterwards, the boy displayed few emotions. He did not cry. He politely said thank you when someone gave him food, or a hug. But then, in the nights, he would let out terrible piercing screams amid his fitful bursts of sleep.</p> <p>Soon after the airstrike, the family moved to the basement of a neighbouring house, where another group of people were already sheltering. They took the boy with them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/mariupol1-zip/giv-6562RYjZYHwRqWMO/\" data-alt=\"How  the Mariupol advance unfolded\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/mariupol1-zip/giv-6562RYjZYHwRqWMO/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/mariupol2-zip/giv-6562T8pBfg9ZHzrT/\" data-alt=\"Mariupol smaller maps\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/mariupol2-zip/giv-6562T8pBfg9ZHzrT/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p>After a week living in the cellar, with only the briefest forays above ground during which the shelling seemed to have intensified further, the Russia-backed forces arrived on 31 March and ordered everyone out of the cellar.</p> <p>When the group emerged above ground, they were ordered to walk for half an hour, carrying their possessions with them and with shells flying overhead, to a spot where they joined others from the district. Women and children were crammed into buses while the men continued on foot.</p> <p>In the village of Sartana, Vitaly and some other men were put into the back of a truck that reeked of corpses. Nobody explained anything about where they were going or what would happen next.</p> <p>Svitlana and Vitaly were reunited in the town of Novoazovsk, part of the Russian proxy Donetsk People’s Republic, where they were housed in a school, 20 people to a classroom. There was nothing to sleep on, but they were given hot food. Soldiers confiscated their phones.</p> <p>They left the boy whose mother had died in Novoazovsk; his estranged Russian father would come to pick him up, they hoped. His father would take him to live in Russia, the country whose assault had killed his mother.</p> <p>After some days, Svitlana, Vitaly and the two children were again loaded on to buses, and driven to the town of Dokuchayevsk, where they joined hundreds of people waiting in the local Soviet-era House of Culture to undergo what the Russians have termed a “filtration” procedure.</p> <p>Svitlana was allowed into the mothers and children room; Vitaly was held in the main hall, where hundreds of men tried to grab a few hours sleep slumped on chairs. The smell was disgusting.</p> <p>The mothers and children room was hardly any better. Many of the children had diarrhoea or dysentery; Svitlana’s daughter was vomiting frequently. She herself still felt weak. There was almost no food: breakfast was tea, lunch was hot water and a biscuit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6916b4e2e640b3bfe99e08697f572b46c9f6921c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6916b4e2e640b3bfe99e08697f572b46c9f6921c/0_217_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emergency workers and volunteers carry an injured pregnant woman from a maternity hospital that was damaged by shelling in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emergency workers and volunteers carry an injured pregnant woman from the bombed maternity hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evgeniy Maloletka/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After two days, it was Vitaly’s turn for filtration. He was taken to the police station, where he was ordered to undress fully and examined for tattoos that might give away a Ukrainian nationalist affiliation. Then he was questioned, photographed and fingerprinted. The process took five hours. After that, the family were put on a bus to the border with Russia. They crossed after another round of questioning, and spent the night at a camp on the other side, from where the next morning yet another bus drove them to the train station in the city of Taganrog.</p> <p>In the filtration camps, Mariupol residents had been told they would be given resources to start a new life anywhere they wanted in the Russian Federation. But when they arrived at the station in Taganrog, there was one train, departing to Saransk, a dusty city 300 miles east of Moscow.</p> <p>For those who did not have their own travel plans, Saransk was the only option. Exhausted, weary and unwashed, they boarded the train to an uncertain new life.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Svitlana had found a better option. She had managed to contact a friend who had an acquaintance in Taganrog, who agreed to put the family up for three days. For the first time in two months, Svitlana and Vitaly slept in real beds and had hot showers.</p> <p>They told their host in Taganrog a little about what they had been through, and the woman was incredulous. But they did not go into detail.</p> <p>“We didn’t want to say too much about what we had seen while we were still in Russia; we didn’t want to attract attention, we wanted to be able to leave,” said Svitlana.</p> <p>She was still regularly bleeding from the miscarriage. Some of her skin had attained a blueish hue, and her legs were swollen “like a bear”, she said. On occasion, she fainted. But she did not seek medical treatment. Spending time inside Russia after the weeks of misery they had been through felt like further abuse, and she wanted to get out as soon as possible.</p> <p>From Taganrog, the family took a train to Moscow, then to St Petersburg. From there, they crossed to Estonia without problems, and made their way onwards to a western European country, where they are now trying to make a new home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/mariupol_journey_map/giv-6562Pkcktqtna26u/\" data-alt=\"Journey to Estonia \"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/mariupol_journey_map/giv-6562Pkcktqtna26u/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Soon after their arrival, doctors performed an operation on Svitlana that she should have had weeks earlier. Slowly, her life is getting back to normal. The children have calmed down a little. The aches and pains have dissipated and the swelling in her legs has subsided. She no longer jumps in fear every time someone opens or closes a door, and she can recount the awful ordeal she went through with clarity and poise.</p> <p>But the nights are harder than the days. Almost every night, Svitlana has visions of incoming artillery and missiles. She wakes up breathless and terrified.</p> <p>Many of the couple’s friends have simply disappeared. Are they still in Mariupol? Trying to start a new life after being dumped somewhere in a far-flung corner of Russia? Dead? They have no idea.</p> <p>Svitlana does know that her parents survived the siege of Mariupol. She has not spoken to them since the beginning of the war, and they do not currently have working phones. But twice, they called Svitlana’s sister from a borrowed phone, to give notice they were still alive.</p> <p>Svitlana has no more information than that; she does not know what horrors they went through in their part of the city, though she can guess it was not easy. It was not easy for anyone in Mariupol.</p> <p>Svitlana and Vitaly are pseudonyms. They asked not to use their real names, or give their address in Mariupol, because they fear for Svitlana’s parents. She hopes that soon, they too will be able to leave for Europe; she knows her father would not want to live under Russian rule, she said. The fate of her parents is a constant worry that prevents her focusing fully on starting a new life in Europe.</p> <p>One thing Vitaly and Svitlana are both certain of is that they will never go back.</p> <p>“Return to what?” asked Vitaly, bitterly. “There’s nothing there. Nothing. It’s over. Mariupol is over.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/26/kwasi-kwarteng-to-review-french-billionaires-bt-stake-over-security-concerns","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T14:31:24Z","webTitle":"Kwasi Kwarteng to review French billionaire’s BT stake over security concerns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/26/kwasi-kwarteng-to-review-french-billionaires-bt-stake-over-security-concerns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/26/kwasi-kwarteng-to-review-french-billionaires-bt-stake-over-security-concerns","fields":{"headline":"Kwasi Kwarteng to review French billionaire’s BT stake over security concerns","trailText":"Business secretary intervenes after biggest shareholder Patrick Drahi raised stake in UK telecom giant to 18%","body":"<p>The UK government has launched a “full national security assessment” of the French telecoms billionaire Patrick Drahi over the increase in his stake in BT to 18%.</p> <p>The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, on Thursday said he was exercising his “call-in power” under the National Security and Investment Act 2021 (NSI) after Drahi’s Altice company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/14/patrick-drahi-altice-increases-bt-stake-to-18\">increased its stake in BT</a> from 12.1% to 18% in mid-December making him the single biggest shareholder.</p> <p>The “call-in” powers granted through the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/uk-government-extends-powers-to-intervene-in-foreign-takeovers\">National Security and Investment Act</a> allow ministers to block transactions linked to important national assets and even unwind them retrospectively, if they are deemed to harm national security.</p> <p>The government had previously warned that it would “not hesitate to act” to protect BT from a foreign takeover, if necessary to protect the country’s fibre network.</p> <p>“The acquisition by Altice of [another] 6% of shares in BT [in December] has been called-in for a full national security assessment by business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng,” the government said in a statement.</p> <p>“The government has powers under the National Security and Investment Act 2021 to scrutinise and – if necessary – intervene in qualifying acquisitions on national security grounds.”</p> <p>BT said it would “fully cooperate with this review”.

Given the dismal record of such tax breaks, how much will seep away into “investments” that they would have made anyway, as with the abused research and development loopholes?</p> \n<p>This help comes better late than never, arriving just as the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds inequality taking off again, <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/publications/16054\">with the top 1% roaring away</a>, while the poorest people face the highest rate of inflation, <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/publications/16065\">which could hit 14% by Octobe</a>r. But this is a humiliating U-turn for a government that has made cutting benefits time and again its signature theme.</p> \n<p>This climbdown only comes now as its polling and focus groups show most people, including many Tory voters, are not as flint-hearted as the cabinet’s ideologues. Nor do voters blame food bank-users for a lack of cooking skills. The tide is turning, as the <a href=\"https://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/latest-report/british-social-attitudes-38/new-values-new-divides.aspx\">British Social Attitudes survey is showing</a>, when so many people can see that working hard on low pay doesn’t keep a family afloat.</p> \n<p>Labour’s spirits are high. The government may “move on” from Partygate, but the stench will follow them, just as John Major’s government couldn’t shake off “sleaze”. Two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/disgraceful-voters-in-key-byelection-seats-respond-to-the-sue-gray-report\">imminent byelections</a> will reveal how far Labour still needs to travel. But the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, ended her reply today to rousing cheers from her Labour colleagues when she called the benches opposite: “Out of ideas, out of touch and out of time … We lead, they follow.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p></li> \n</ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/may/26/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-sticking-plaster-climate-groups","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T14:07:15Z","webTitle":"Sunak’s windfall tax is a ‘sticking plaster’, say climate campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/26/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-sticking-plaster-climate-groups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/26/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-sticking-plaster-climate-groups","fields":{"headline":"Sunak’s windfall tax is a ‘sticking plaster’, say climate campaigners","trailText":"Tax on oil and gas companies described as ‘missed opportunity’ to tackle climate and cost of living crises","body":"<p>The windfall tax is only a “sticking plaster” to provide temporary relief on energy bills that does nothing to improve the UK’s leaky homes, and encourages oil and gas companies into more production, climate campaigners have said.</p> <p>They say this will increase the UK’s dependence on fossil fuels instead of supporting a switch to green energy.</p> <p>Experts have called for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/uk-must-spend-on-home-insulation-and-heat-pumps-ministers-told\">nationwide programme of home insulation</a>, as a quick and sure way to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/14/fund-home-insulation-and-heat-pumps-for-people-on-low-incomes-pm-urged\">bring down energy bills</a> that had been neglected by the government, and warned of the impact of using tax breaks to fuel new oil and gas exploration that would do nothing to ease bills in the short term and would lock in high greenhouse gas emissions in the long term.</p> <p>Ami McCarthy, a political campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “This windfall tax will serve only as a sticking plaster. While providing support to millions struggling with sky-high energy bills is 100% the right thing to do, by only skimming the top 25% off oil and gas company profits Sunak has missed a huge opportunity to tackle the root cause of the cost of living crisis, and the climate crisis together.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/26/sunak-announces-windfall-tax-energy-firms\">Rishi Sunak announces £5bn windfall tax on energy firms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said profits should have been taxed at 70%, more than doubling the cash available, which could have funded energy efficiency measures such as insulation for homes as well as the payments to households the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has agreed. Funding energy efficiency would protect against future bills as well as this year’s increases.</p> <p>Sunak also announced that oil and gas companies that invest in new fossil fuel production would receive a tax break worth 90% of the windfall tax. Yet new oil and gas production <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/12/oil-gas-mega-projects-climate-iea-fatih-birol-carbon-bombs-global-energy-crisis-fossil-fuel\">will take years, perhaps decades, to come to fulfilment</a>, making no impact on energy bills now and potentially busting the UK’s future carbon budgets.</p> <p>McCarthy said: “Instead of driving money into clean energy solutions, Sunak has used this announcement to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/more-cash-than-we-know-what-to-do-with-oil-and-gas-companies-report-bumper-profits?ref=quuu\">encourage oil and gas company investments</a>. Yet the current cost of living crisis is mostly a result of gas price rises – hard-up families shouldn’t have to wait for the prime minister and chancellor to deliver cheaper and cleaner energy to help with their bills.”</p> <p>Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, added: “Giving a tax exemption to the fossil fuel giants that have done so much to cause the climate emergency and profit from the energy crisis for more oil and gas extraction is plainly wrong. Green power and energy efficiency are the real solutions.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to Down to Earth, our exclusive weekly newsletter from our top climate crisis correspondents.\">  <iframe id=\"green-light\" name=\"green-light\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/green-light\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--green-light\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to Down to Earth, our exclusive weekly newsletter from our top climate crisis correspondents.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week, the government announced it <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/24/limits-on-renewables-will-keep-uk-energy-bills-higher-this-winter\">would allow for only about 12GW of new renewable energy capacity</a> in its annual auction round, although renewable industry experts say nearly 18GW of new offshore and onshore wind and solar projects are “shovel-ready” and could begin production this year or next year. Renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels.</p> <p>Jess Ralston, a senior analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the lack of a plan for insulation was a “glaring omission” that left open the question of what would happen to bill-payers when the “stopgap” windfall tax payments ceased. “Temporary solutions are a sticking plaster and all estimates show gas prices will be high for years to come, so investing in insulating our leaky roofs and walls makes the best long-term use of taxpayers’ money,” she said.</p> <p>Experts also urged the government to set out longer-term plans for dealing with the UK’s energy crisis. Michael Grubb, a professor of energy at UCL, asked: “What will the government do with the UK’s energy system? Our electricity market means consumers pay doubly for the high cost of gas – once through heating, and again through the impact of gas on electricity prices, even though renewable energy is now far cheaper. It is the system itself that needs bold measures: to invest in energy efficiency, remove obstacles to the cheapest and quickest renewables available, and reform how the market works.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2021/nov/04/charge-retreat-boris-johnsons-top-u-turns-in-no-10","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T14:06:52Z","webTitle":"Charge … retreat!

My colleague Lauren Gambino <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/georgia-primary-elections-kemp-carr-trump\">wrote about</a> how those victories were a major blow to Trump in his quest to punish those who refused to overturn the election.</p> <p>I can’t emphasize how much of a surprise it was that Raffensperger won the GOP primary outright on Tuesday. As late as a few weeks ago, it was widely believed that Raffensperger faced an uphill battle in fending off Hice. “Ultimately, it’s gonna be Hice that’s gonna win that thing,” Jay Williams, a Republican strategist in Georgia told me earlier this month. If Raffensperger had a chance, it was believed he would have to win in a runoff election.</p> <p>One takeaway I have from Raffensperger’s victory is that support for Trump and uncertainty about the election doesn’t necessarily translate into voting for other candidates. When I began to see Raffensperger doing well on Tuesday evening, I kept hearing the voice of Carolee Curti, an 82-year-old retiree in Rome, a city in Marjorie Taylor Greene’s deeply conservative district, who told me she voted for the secretary of state. “I felt that under all that pressure, he did a good job,” she said after casting her vote. “I know it upset Trump, and I’m a Trump person, but fair is fair.”</p> <p>Raffensperger also found a way to appeal to Republican voters concerned about fraud in elections while defending the 2020 election results. The central issue in his campaign was preventing non-citizen voting, which is virtually non-existent in Georgia. He also championed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/25/georgia-voting-restrictions-law-passed\">SB 202, Georgia’s new law </a>that imposes new restrictions on mail-in ballots and drop boxes, and prevents handing out food or water within 150 feet of a polling place.</p> <p>“He has been threading this needle from the outset of the 2020 election,” Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University, told me earlier this month. “From the moment he announced that the election results were what they were and that Joe Biden had won the election in Georgia, he immediately pivoted towards pledging to do more to improve election security, I would argue in an attempt to appease conservative voters who probably were not gonna be satisfied with him.”</p> <p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/politics/politics-blog/the-jolt-how-brad-raffensperger-pulled-of-the-upset-of-the-night-in-georgia/TQYGBFD25VCDZIHJCZIASNIM7Y/\">also has a good rundown</a> of some of the other reasons Raffensperger won. Georgia voters can choose to cast their votes in either party’s primary, and there appear to be tens of thousands of Democrats who cast ballots in the GOP contest. Hice also campaigned poorly, the AJC noted, never expanding his base and saving money for a runoff that never came.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, when I spoke with Raffensperger in Georgia, I asked him if he ever got tired of having to continue to debunk baseless claims about the 2020 election. When he said no, I asked him if he could continue to do it forever.</p> <p>“Don’t have to,” he said. “May 24. Then it’ll be decided.”</p> <p><strong>Also worth watching …</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Democrats are headed for a runoff <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2022-05-24/midterm-updates-texas-ag-runoff-tests-bush-family-clout\">in their nominating contest </a>for secretary of state.</p></li> <li><p>A Republican<a href=\"https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/republican-fake-elector-running-to-lead-wisconsin-election-commission/article_579af733-1272-54f9-9464-d7ab52ca21a1.html\"> who was part</a> of a fake set of electors for Donald Trump in Wisconsin wants to be the chair of the agency that oversees elections in the state.</p></li> <li><p>Five Republicans running for governor in Michigan face potential disqualification from the ballot after submitting fraudulent signatures.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/may/26/koechlin-the-seven-stars-symphony-vers-la-voute-etoilee-review-ariane-matiakh","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T14:00:04Z","webTitle":"Koechlin: The Seven Stars Symphony; Vers la Voûte Etoilée review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/26/koechlin-the-seven-stars-symphony-vers-la-voute-etoilee-review-ariane-matiakh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/may/26/koechlin-the-seven-stars-symphony-vers-la-voute-etoilee-review-ariane-matiakh","fields":{"headline":"Koechlin: The Seven Stars Symphony; Vers la Voûte Etoilée review – dazzling display of orchestral imagination","trailText":"An elegant performance to match the beauty and refinement of this bafflingly neglected master of 20th-century music","body":"<p>Among <a href=\"https://www.billaudot.com/en/composer.php?p=charles&amp;n=koechlin\">Charles Koechlin’s</a> huge catalogue of works – well over 200 with opus numbers, and plenty more without – there are four symphonies. Like most of Koechlin’s music they are rarely performed, but his Seven Stars Symphony at least gets sporadic performances, and, as the Capriccio release proves, even occasional recordings. Having been rather disdainful of silent film, Koechlin realised the potency of the talkies in 1932 when he saw Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel, and quickly became so enthralled by the new art form that the following year he composed the symphony, making each of its seven movements a portrait of a movie star.</p> <p>The Seven Stars Symphony is composed for huge forces, and the score is a dazzling display of Koechlin’s orchestral imagination, another reminder that as a master of instrumental colour and texture he had few equals in 20th-century music. In some cases the movements depict the stars in particular roles, so the first movement, with its languorous woodwind solos, is a homage to Douglas Fairbanks in The Thief of Bagdad, while the sixth movement is a portrait of Emil Jannings in The Blue Angel. Lilian Harvey is honoured with a gentle fugue, Clara Bow with an exuberant scherzo, while Greta Garbo’s mystery and remoteness are evoked by an ondes Martenot. Dietrich is honoured by a set of variations on the letters of her name, and the symphony ends with another set of variations, the longest movement in the work, for Charlie Chaplin.</p> <p>The Basel Symphony Orchestra’s performance under <a href=\"https://arianematiakh.com/en/biography\">Ariane Matiakh</a> has a wonderful lithe elegance, which matches the beauty and refinement of Koechlin’s writing in every respect. And they pair the symphony with the nocturne Vers la voûte étoilée (Towards the Starry Vault), also composed in 1933 (though not performed until 1989), another gorgeous piece by this ridiculously neglected composer that deserves a regular place in concert programmes.<br></p> <p><strong>This week’s other pick<br></strong>Perhaps one day <a href=\"https://fxroth.com/\">François-Xavier Roth </a>and the period instruments of <strong>Les Siècles</strong> will get around to Koechlin’s orchestral music, but in the meantime there is still plenty of the standard French repertoire for them to explore.

In between the concertos are three of Ravel’s song cycles, in which the baritone Stéphane Degout is Tiberghien’s wonderfully refined and subtle partner. The concertos receive vivid if slightly brittle performances, with crystal-clear textures and beautifully shaped solo playing from the Siècles woodwind, and from Tiberghien too.</p> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/26/knepp-estate-why-the-king-and-queen-of-rewilding-are-farming-again-after-20-years-aoe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T14:00:04Z","webTitle":"Knepp estate: why the king and queen of rewilding are farming again after 20 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/26/knepp-estate-why-the-king-and-queen-of-rewilding-are-farming-again-after-20-years-aoe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/26/knepp-estate-why-the-king-and-queen-of-rewilding-are-farming-again-after-20-years-aoe","fields":{"headline":"Knepp estate: why the king and queen of rewilding are farming again after 20 years","trailText":"Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree were pioneers of rewilding in the UK. Now they are setting their sights on regenerative agriculture, which will supply food to a new farm shop and cafe","body":"<p>It’s odd to hear the owners of the UK’s pioneering rewilding project at Knepp estate in West Sussex gushing about farming. But Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree are returning to a sector they left 20 years ago. In 2000, they let their unprofitable dairy and arable farm go to seed. Now Knepp Wildland is a <a href=\"https://knepp.co.uk/home\">1,400 hectare (3,500 acre) rewilding project</a>, home to a smörgåsbord of remarkable wildlife, including critically endangered <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22709696/111760622\">nightingales</a> and <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22690419/154373407\">turtle doves</a>. It is a success story that has inspired many to think differently about land, and how much wildlife we should expect in our countryside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bb5a5b7f1682283cd55fe35c22e20484e6bbb322\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb5a5b7f1682283cd55fe35c22e20484e6bbb322/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The rising sun seen through the branches of a tree with mist on a patch of water\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dawn at Knepp. The estate is home to a huge array of wildlife, including nightingales and turtle doves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Cullen/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, another chapter is being added to the Knepp story, as the last 150 hectares of land is amalgamated into the project. For decades, land scattered around the villages of Shipley and Dial Post was run by a tenant farmer who used it for grazing sheep. But the farmer has left and it is being scruffed up and transformed into the Knepp estate regenerative farm, which will supply local food to a new farm shop and cafe, due to open later this year. They are also opening a market garden, which will make use of manure from the cows. Knepp visitors will be able to go on farm safaris, just like they do on the rewilding project.</p> <p>I meet the couple in a farmyard which, until 2000, had been a commercial dairy for a century. At the moment it’s a big empty yard but it won’t be quiet for long. They already have 40 Sussex cattle in their regenerative farming herd, rising to 130 over the next 12 months. The barns are likely to house cattle over the winter months, when the clay fields become too wet underfoot. One of the cows – an unplanned pregnancy – gave birth in the barn just after I left.</p> <p>The “king and queen of rewilding”, as Burrell and Tree have been labelled, are normally photographed in front of a piece of scrub, standing in long grass or caressing an old oak tree. Today, their backdrop is a mess of barbed wire, some old fenceposts and a barn full of hay. It’s not your typical bucolic scene, but removing obsolete tangles of wire and beefing up hedgerows is part of bringing nature back to this farm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bce5ba84c11f62275ef94b4424c93b1f7ece0083\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bce5ba84c11f62275ef94b4424c93b1f7ece0083/0_0_6498_4332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A couple stand in a farmyard amid a pile of rusting wire fencing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree, owners of the Knepp estate, stand by old barbed wire fencing pulled out of hedgerows around the farm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Making their vision a reality requires a sizeable investment. The couple have injected £250,000 into the project, which their farm manager, Russ Carrington, expects to pay back over 20 years. The money will buy cattle, a cattle crush (which holds the animals still while they are examined), a cow brush (which allows them to scratch themselves), hurdles and gates, fencing, polytunnels and a caravan for interns.</p> <p>By year five, Carrington hopes to start turning a profit, although this is difficult to predict when the future of post-Brexit government farming grants remains uncertain. Burrell and Tree are fortunate in that revenue from rewilding will help to finance this relatively risky project. Many farmers could not afford it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The biggest change that is going to happen in our landscape is regenerative agriculture. It makes complete sense</p> <footer> <cite>Charlie Burrell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Burrell believes that if they had been farming regeneratively all along they may not have been saddled with the debt that forced them to take the decision to rewild in the first place.</p> <p>“The biggest change that is going to happen in our landscape is regenerative agriculture. I think we’re seeing this huge movement wherever we go,” says Burrell, who believes it will be the norm in the UK within a couple of decades. “It’ll be weird if you aren’t doing it. It makes complete sense.”</p> <p>A lot has changed in the past 20 years, and, increasingly, UK farmers are being encouraged to think about<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/17/why-not-start-now-on-the-track-to-regenerative-farming\"> farming for climate and biodiversity</a>, with the anticipated revolution in subsidies driving much of that change, although environmental groups are concerned that government schemes will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/02/farmers-in-england-to-be-paid-for-looking-after-soil-health-from-next-year\">fall short</a> of what has been promised.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"650b30dcc873bbdc8ee1332a0b26b2e730fc5ce3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/650b30dcc873bbdc8ee1332a0b26b2e730fc5ce3/0_0_6545_4363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man crumbles some compost in his hands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russ Carrington, who manages the regenerative farm on the Knepp estate, inspects compost, which wil be used in the new market garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is difficult to define regenerative farming, but at its centre is improving the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/16/poor-mans-rainforest-stop-treating-soil-like-dirt-aoe\">health of the soil</a>, which is key to a robust farming system. The main principles include limiting soil disturbance, growing a diversity of plants all year and keeping roots in the soil as much as possible.</p> <p>Burrell says: “Every time you plough, you are turning a whole living world upside down, and they’ve got to start again. If you keep doing that for long enough, you’re going to kill everything off. When you think of it like that, the regenerative agricultural movement just makes complete sense.”</p> <p>An important part of the project will be in-depth baseline surveys. They have taken soil samples from eight fields, including one control sample from a neighbour’s non-organic field, and also surveyed insect populations. Burrell is excited about the development of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/13/airborne-dna-used-to-detect-insect-species-in-breakthrough-for-ecologists\">airborne environmental DNA (eDNA)</a> to get even more complex data on water, soil and air samples.</p> <p>Tests will be done every five years. “We’re going to see if it’s right or wrong,” he says. “We’ll tease out on this bit of land what that looks like – we started with this and end up with that, and then we talk about it. Everything has to be as truthful as you can possibly make it. You’re not trying to push one particular idea.”</p> <p>In the rewilding project, biodiversity is the product with meat as a byproduct. On the regenerative farm, meat is the product, and biodiversity the byproduct. The livestock density on the rewilding side is 0.25 units a hectare, while the density on the farm will be four times greater.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"069f725363f43e7aac9c2b68fbc574734da3ce17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/069f725363f43e7aac9c2b68fbc574734da3ce17/0_0_6556_4371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A farmer holds a reel of wire followed by a herd of red cattle \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carrington unwinds an electric fence to ‘move the mob’ of cattle towards fresh grass around the estate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The issue of eating meat is one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/09/the-cow-in-the-room-why-is-no-one-talking-about-farming-at-cop26-aoe\">thorniest</a>, with conflicting views about what is the right amount to consume. Tree has previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/25/veganism-intensively-farmed-meat-dairy-soya-maize\">written for the Guardian</a> to say we should cut down, but promotes eating meat and dairy raised on traditional rotational grazing systems. Many scientists argue that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">going vegan is better</a> for the planet.</p> <p>Unlike in the rewilding project, where animals can roam freely, the farm is crisscrossed with temporary electric fences. The beef herd will be rotationally grazed in “mobs”, regularly moved on to fresh grass, so the land can be rested in the intervals. The idea is that the cows eat about a third of the grass on each piece of land, fertilising it with pats as they go, and are moved on before it gets too short, giving it plenty of time to grow back before it is grazed again.</p> <p>To move the herd on, all Carrington has to do is shout “fresh grass” and the cows are soon mooing and running into the next section. “I can get cows anywhere using those two words,” he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e388b56e857cd42b6b7415532a01b641209bc8a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e388b56e857cd42b6b7415532a01b641209bc8a2/0_0_6532_4355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A strip of grass between two ploughed fields with a polytunnel in the background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Land being developed into a new market garden on the Knepp estate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as the cows, he has bought 68 chickens, which will follow the herd around, scooping up insects and worms. He is starting vegetable boxes in June, and the first beef will be ready in 12 months. In year three he wants to start a “<a href=\"https://sustainablefoodtrust.org/key-issues/farm-stories/calf-at-foot-dairy/\">calf-at-foot” microdairy</a>, where calves stay with their mothers until they naturally wean themselves at about nine months old.</p> <p>Many of the initiatives on the Knepp regenerative farm come from the rewilding project, bringing a wilder aesthetic to the farmland. Carrington has been fencing off hedgerows so they start billowing out, providing more habitat for scrubland species generally tidied out of conventional farms. Like rivers, hedgerows are wildlife highways, linking the regenerative farm to the rewilding project. Dead wood will be left to rot, and boggy, unproductive patches of ground will be encouraged rather than removed. These features will help to provide a network in the landscape for wildlife to move through and find food.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/10/days-of-wine-and-olives-how-the-old-farming-ways-are-paying-off-spain-aoe\">Days of wine and olives: how the old farming ways are paying off in Spain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“If I was just trying to make money on this land, I wouldn’t do it that differently.

And Saber Interactive’s take on the guts and grue of the infamous comedy horror series Evil Dead is absolutely gleeful, a love letter to Sam Raimi written in blood using the middle finger of a dismembered hand. Four players take on the role of Ash and his companions, one player becomes the Kandarian Demon trying to kill them all, and everyone has a lot of fun.</p> <p>The good news is that you don’t need to have ill-advisedly read a page of the Necronomicon out loud to understand what’s going on. Every chainsaw-filled 30 minute bout across the sprawling atmospheric map has the same entertaining structure. As the Survivors hunt down pages and collect the Kandarian Dagger to take down cloaked big bads, the Demon glides along close to the ground in the swooshing style of Sam Raimi’s relentless horror camera – albeit occasionally catching on the scenery.</p> <p>Asymmetrical horror so often feels unbalanced, but the power struggle here is handled well. Where the Survivors can arm themselves to the teeth with weapons from the series – yes, that means boomsticks – they must keep their collective Fear Meter low by sticking together and gathering matches for fires and lamps. Conversely, the Demon starts off relatively weak, unable to interact directly with the humans – but it’s fuelled by terror, and can possess those who can’t keep their fear in check, as well as inanimate objects. You’ll be inventively booby-trapping supply crates with dismembered hands that will comedically bounce out and sucker on to faces, taking control of nearby evil trees, and even possessing Ash’s sputtering Oldsmobile and barrelling it through groups of Survivors. Whether you’re fighting Deadites or possessing them, the flow of each match feels compelling and suitably desperate.</p> <p>The pithy one-liners and spattery finishing moves are such fun that they almost make up for the inexplicable absence of a jump button. Unfortunately, those looking to feel as groovy in single-player will be disappointed with the series of small but ludicrously frustrating missions based around the events of the movies and TV show. These are needlessly difficult, and the lack of save points is a colossal oversight for those just looking to soak in the atmosphere of the beautifully realised sets.

That is not in any way to see to overlook the failings that took place when people drank too much alcohol and behaved outside of the rules, subsequently in a small number of occasions.”</p> <p>The workplace guidelines in place at the time said any in-person gatherings should be “absolutely necessary”, with people maintaining two-metre social distancing.</p> <p>Asked if he knew of any other workplaces that had interpreted the guidelines as allowing leaving drinks, the spokesperson said: “I can’t speak to what did or didn’t happen in different organisations, but certainly in relation to those staff that were in over that period, I think the view was that saying goodbye to staff was appropriate. What was not appropriate was staying on once those goodbyes had been said, late into the night.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/26/hong-kong-judicial-independence-overseas-judges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T13:56:57Z","webTitle":"Hong Kong judicial independence under systematic attack, legal figures warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/hong-kong-judicial-independence-overseas-judges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/26/hong-kong-judicial-independence-overseas-judges","fields":{"headline":"Hong Kong judicial independence under systematic attack, legal figures warn","trailText":"Signatories of legal opinion say territory’s government is using continued presence of overseas judges as ‘vote of confidence’","body":"<p>International judicial figures including the former UK attorney general Sir Robert Buckland have warned the remaining British, Australian and Canadian judges operating in Hong Kong that they are working in an environment where judicial independence has been wholly undermined and the Chinese Communist party can dictate the outcome of cases.</p> <p>The group has backed a legal opinion that says the systematic threats to Hong Kong’s judicial independence will continue to intensify, and that the continued presence of overseas judges is being used by the territory’s government as a vote of confidence.</p> <p>As attorney general, Buckland initiated the government review that led the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-supports-the-withdrawal-of-serving-uk-judges-from-the-hong-kong-court-of-final-appeal\">announce in March that serving UK-appointed judges would no longer sit</a> in Hong Kong’s top court, the court of final appeal.

Any business that refuses to provide services to guests due to their race or ethnic group is likely to be breaking equality law.</p> <p>“We signed a legally binding agreement with Pontins last year. We expected that to address our concerns about discriminatory behaviour. The company’s failure to comply has left us with no choice but to use stronger enforcement powers to investigate further.</p> <p>“The EHRC will continue to use all legal powers at its disposal to ensure that no one experiences racism, whether at a holiday park or elsewhere, simply because of their name, ethnicity or the community they belong to.”</p> <p>Declining to provide services to guests because they are of a certain race or ethnic group is unlawful under the Equality Act 2010, which recognises Gypsies and Travellers as a distinct racial group. When details of the Pontins blacklist <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/pontins-traveller-gypsy-blacklist-surnames-ehrc-892968\">was first reported by the i</a>, the EHRC compared it with “signs displayed in hotel windows 50 years ago explicitly barring Irish people and Black people”.</p> <p>The inquiry, which is expected to take months, will examine whether Pontins has committed race discrimination against Gypsy and Traveller guests or prospective guests in the past. It will also examine whether its booking policies and intelligence, information and record-keeping systems directly or indirectly discriminate on the basis of race.</p> <p>One of the things the EHRC will look at in terms of booking policies is the requirement for guests or prospective guests to be on the electoral register.</p> <p>The chief executive of the Traveller Movement, Yvonne MacNamara, welcomed the formal investigation and said Pontins had been set “an extremely low bar” inits agreement with the EHRC.</p> <p>“All they had to do was not commit unlawful acts of discrimination when providing services, and to take concrete steps to ensure that discrimination did not happen in the future,” she said.</p> <p>“That the human rights regulator is not satisfied that these very simple requirements have been adhered to is a damning indictment of the corporate culture and senior management at Pontins, which has failed not just GRT communities, but also rank and file employees.</p> <p>“Romany Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people are entitled to access the same services as everybody else, and we hope this investigation serves as a timely reminder to other businesses that discrimination will not go unnoticed.”</p> <p>THE campaigns officer at Friends, Families and Travellers, Chris McDonagh, said: “The EHRC is doing the right thing and we hope it sends a strong message.”</p> <p>The Guardian has approached Pontins for comment.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/26/ted-cruz-angrily-quits-interview-gun-control","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T13:37:43Z","webTitle":"Ted Cruz angrily quits interview after being confronted about gun control","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/26/ted-cruz-angrily-quits-interview-gun-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/26/ted-cruz-angrily-quits-interview-gun-control","fields":{"headline":"Ted Cruz angrily quits interview after being confronted about gun control","trailText":"Texas senator says ‘I’m sorry you think American exceptionalism is awful’ in response to questions about Uvalde massacre","body":"<p>The Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz confronted a British reporter and angrily left an interview after he was asked why school shootings like that in Uvalde, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-victims\">19 children and two adults were killed</a>, happen so often in the US.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/26/texas-school-shooting-news-victims-uvalde-elementary-school-latest-updates\">Texas shooting: onlookers urged police to storm school during gunman’s violent attack – latest updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’m sorry you think American exceptionalism is awful,” Cruz said. “You’ve got your political agenda.

It took Camavinga a month to get his first start. It was November before Ancelotti trusted him with a full 90 minutes in the league. Of his 39 games for Madrid, 23 have come as a substitute. He was on the bench for their last 10 Champions League games, including their entire run through the knockout stages. He will probably start on the bench again in Saturday’s final against Liverpool. And yet, with the possible exception of Karim Benzema, there is no Madrid player whose contribution will be more eagerly anticipated, no player of whom Liverpool will be more wary.</p> <p>To discover why, you need to look beyond the simple numbers. Camavinga has been Madrid’s 15th-most used player in this season’s Champions League, contributing just a single assist. But their run to the final has been secured on the back of three stunning second-leg comebacks against Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City. Without Camavinga, they would probably have lost all three.</p> <p>Against PSG, he replaced Kroos on the hour, allowing Modric the freedom to roam further forward and link up with Benzema, whose hat-trick turned a 2-0 aggregate deficit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/09/real-madrid-psg-champions-league-last-16-match-report\" title=\"\">into a 3-2 win</a>. Against Chelsea, his introduction immediately transformed a game that Real were meekly surrendering but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/real-madrid-chelsea-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">won 5-4 on aggregate</a>. Against City, he was simply everywhere: coming on after 75 minutes, breaking up City attacks, spreading play quickly, playing the cross from which Madrid would score the first goal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/04/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">in a remarkable 3-1 comeback victory</a>.</p> <p>What linked all three performances – 125 minutes during which Madrid scored eight times and conceded once – was speed. Camavinga is a player of immense physical gifts – pace, agility, balance, strength – but his real talent is speed of thought, the ability to see things quicker than anyone else. To snuff out the counterattack when it is still a concept. To play the forward pass with just enough speed and spin. His long diagonal balls are notable for their flat, skimming trajectory, switching the angle of attack without allowing defences time to reset themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a629ebbc1eee8803a8f75989b06a163494d18002\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a629ebbc1eee8803a8f75989b06a163494d18002/0_0_3598_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eduardo Camavinga tackles Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva during the Champions League semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eduardo Camavinga tackles Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva during the Champions League semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of which raises an interesting question: if Camavinga is so good, then why hasn’t he played more? Why isn’t he starting? “I don’t like not playing,” he said last week. But he’s also a realist. He knows that in Modric, Kroos and Casemiro he is trying to dislodge three of the greatest midfielders in the modern game. For now Ancelotti has convinced him – with his usual charm – to channel his energies into a high-impact closing role, seizing games against tiring opponents.</p> <p>“He must learn and gain experience,” Ancelotti said this season. “He doesn’t have it yet, but he’s only 19 years old. Every day that he trains with Modric, Kroos or Casemiro is a master’s degree. Camavinga is the present and the future of this club.”</p> <p>All the evidence suggests Camavinga is learning. After all, he has always had to grow quickly: born in a refugee camp in Angola, brought up in Fougères in the west of France, groomed for footballing stardom from an early age. When he was 11, his family lost everything they owned in a house fire. “You will rebuild this house,” his father told him. Now, as a man, Camavinga may be about rebuild Madrid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>After years of gravity-defying excellence, Kroos appears to be in gentle decline. Modric is still brilliant but will turn 37 in September; meanwhile, the pursuit of Aurélien Tchouaméni from Monaco is a recognition of the need for a long-term replacement for Casemiro. For almost a decade this trio have defined the identity of a Madrid team that crave control, that gradually try to strangle opponents. Camavinga represents a different ideal entirely: quicker, more dynamic, more vertical, more aggressive. If Modric and Kroos show where Madrid have come from, it is Camavinga who shows us where they may be going.</p> <p>And so to Paris in the springtime, and a game many of Real’s veterans – right the way up to Ancelotti – will probably take in their stride. By contrast, this will be the biggest 90 minutes of Camavinga’s short career, even if he will probably spend a fair chunk of them watching from the sidelines. For those of us waiting to see what this most precious of talents can do on the very biggest stage, the wait may just be over.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/26/america-will-never-get-better-if-we-refuse-to-diagnose-and-treat-its-problems","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T13:06:38Z","webTitle":"America will never get better if we refuse to diagnose and treat its problems | Maeve Higgins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/26/america-will-never-get-better-if-we-refuse-to-diagnose-and-treat-its-problems","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/26/america-will-never-get-better-if-we-refuse-to-diagnose-and-treat-its-problems","fields":{"headline":"America will never get better if we refuse to diagnose and treat its problems","trailText":"As we endure shooting after shooting, the US starts to seem like a body being attacked from within by some strange and debilitating illness","body":"<p>A nation is a body. For the whole body to function smoothly, each part must do its job. You’ll know from your own body that each part does not need to be perfect to get you through the day. You’ll know that a disabled body can be perfect once you understand what it needs and adjust accordingly. A nation, too, can have some body parts that break down and need help from other, stronger parts. The problems in a body start when some parts break, but instead of compensating for those parts and allowing them time to heal, the rest of the body ignores them.</p> <p>The body, this nation, insists that it must keep moving. The problems grow as the body becomes more and more stressed. Finally, in the worst cases, the body starts attacking itself. America today is a body being attacked from within; living here feels like living inside a huge autoimmune response. The system we once used to protect ourselves has gone haywire, and now it attacks us.</p> <p>I’m using these metaphors, nations as bodies and gun violence as an autoimmune response, because I can’t bear to write about the literal bodies of small children shot to death in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday. Someone with a gun killed 19 children and two adults at Robb elementary school; others were injured and remain in hospitals around the state. America’s latest mass shooting is at once familiar and impossible – a lone gunman, multiple weapons, little children, helpless teachers, terrified families waiting to hear the worst news imaginable and pure desolation for an entire community.</p> <p>Less than two weeks ago, another gunman shot 10 people dead in a supermarket in Buffalo, New York. A different man with different motives; the same terror of shots fired on yet another community. Elderly ladies buying groceries, small children excited about their summer break – these people are precious, and they are vulnerable, yet they are targets now. Across the country, we listen to distraught relatives cry out. Their grief, and our collective horror, weigh heavily on our minds and hearts.</p> <p>When the leader of besieged Ukraine makes time to send us his sympathies, we know our trouble is deep. “I would like to express my condolences to all of the relatives and family members of the children who were killed in an awful shooting in Texas in a school,” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said when he appeared virtually at a conference during the World Economic Forum in Davos. “This is terrible – to have victims of shooters in peaceful times,” he said.</p> <p>It is terrible. On average, almost 53 people are killed each day by a gun in the US. The BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081\">collated data</a> from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and reported that 45,222 people in America died from gun-related injuries in 2020, the last year for which complete data is available. More than half of those deaths were suicides; 43% of the deaths – amounting to 19,384 people – were murders.</p> <p>In the intervening pandemic years, gun sales have only risen. The BBC also cites figures from the Small Arms Survey – a Swiss-based research project – that show that the US has a ratio of 120.5 firearms for every 100 residents, up from 88 for every 100 in 2011, far surpassing other countries. There are more guns here than in most comparable countries; guns are relatively easy to get hold of legally and illegally. The evidence points to an almost complete failure to stop dangerous people from buying and using guns to kill and hurt other people and themselves.</p> <p>As a body, the American nation is still a relatively young one, just a couple centuries old now. This body has many broken parts – easy access to deadly weapons, toxic masculinity, racism, blood money in politics and warped ideologies built around the constitutionally enshrined right to bear arms. Instead of treating these broken parts, we keep going and haul these damaged parts with us. There are no mysteries here. We have the answers to the questions about how this has been allowed to happen and why it will continue to happen. The question now is this – how can we survive in a body that attacks itself?</p> <ul> <li><p>Maeve Higgins is a Guardian US columnist and the author of the book <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645596/tell-everyone-on-this-train-i-love-them-by-maeve-higgins/\">Tell Everyone on This Train I Love Them</a></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2022/may/26/christopher-wheeldon-like-water-for-chocolate-michael-jackson","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T13:00:03Z","webTitle":"Christopher Wheeldon: ‘Most boys at ballet school were closeted, terrified our parents would disown us’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/26/christopher-wheeldon-like-water-for-chocolate-michael-jackson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/may/26/christopher-wheeldon-like-water-for-chocolate-michael-jackson","fields":{"headline":"Christopher Wheeldon: ‘Most boys at ballet school were closeted, terrified our parents would disown us’","trailText":"As his version of Like Water for Chocolate opens at the Royal Opera House, the choreographer talks about how the ballet world is changing – and why he took on the Michael Jackson musical","body":"<p>One weekend in the early 1990s on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, 19-year-old dancer Christopher Wheeldon found himself at a loose end. He had recently moved from London to join New York City Ballet. “I hadn’t really made any friends yet and I remember a really lonely Sunday afternoon going to the cinema,” says Wheeldon. “There used to be a great art house at Lincoln Center, called Lincoln Plaza.” The film he saw there was Like Water for Chocolate, an adaptation of the Mexican author Laura Esquivel’s magical realist novel about thwarted love.</p> <p>“It just really stuck with me,” says Wheeldon. “I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic, I suppose.” Back then, he had no idea that 30 years later he would still be living in New York, now an internationally successful Tony and Olivier award-winning choreographer, turning the movie he saw into a ballet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine's biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having begun his choreographic career making abstract neoclassical ballets (including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/apr/15/royal-ballet-triple-bill-review\" title=\"\">Polyphonia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/26/dance\" title=\"\">Morphoses</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/may/20/dance.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Tryst</a>) based on streamlined beauty, patterning and musicality, Wheeldon has since made his name as a large-scale storyteller, who has tackled everything from the visual spectacle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/mar/01/alices-adventures-in-wonderland-review\" title=\"\">Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</a> to turning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/13/royal-ballet-the-winters-tale-review-royal-opera-house-london-christopher-wheeldon-shakespeare\" title=\"\">The Winter’s Tale</a>, supposedly one of Shakespeare’s “problem plays”, into an emotive ballet. He also choreographed and directed a hugely successful stage version of the Gene Kelly film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/21/an-american-in-paris-five-star-review-minnelli-musical-dominion-london\" title=\"\">An American in Paris</a> and recently opened the Michael Jackson musical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/04/mj-the-musical-review-broadway\" title=\"\">MJ</a> on Broadway.</p> <p>Esquivel’s novel is unlike any of these shows, but Wheeldon spotted some rich ingredients for ballet in the story of heroine Tita, forbidden from marrying her beloved Pedro because family tradition dictates she must stay at home to care for her demanding mother. As Tita cooks for the family, her emotions are transferred to the food and those who eat it, causing outbreaks of lovesickness and intense desire. Heightened emotions and simmering passion are things ballet does very well, and Wheeldon foresaw great ballerina roles for Tita, her mother and sisters (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/francesca-hayward\" title=\"\">Francesca Hayward</a> will be the first Tita). “And it’s a very dynamic story,” he says. “There’s a ghost, a band of revolutionaries and, of course, the magic.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"54533826f6c49709d369fc679cf8fbc4af19c691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54533826f6c49709d369fc679cf8fbc4af19c691/0_1_2286_2856/800.jpg\" alt=\"Marcelino Sambé and Francesca Hayward rehearse Like Water for Chocolate.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcelino Sambé and Francesca Hayward rehearse Like Water for Chocolate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrej Uspenski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the outset of the project, Wheeldon visited Esquivel in Mexico City and she cooked him a recipe from the book, a champandongo casserole. “I wouldn’t do this without Laura’s blessing,” he says, aware of the sensitivities of telling stories outside one’s own culture. “We have to make sure we’re asking all the right questions and have permission.”</p> <p>Wheeldon also worked closely with the Mexican conductor Alondra de la Parra and composer Tomás Barreiro, but has no intention of carbon-copying the novel’s world. Having researched a huge array of Mexican folk dances, he decided the best route was to invent his own language. Similarly, the score, by Joby Talbot, combines impassioned melodies and danceable rhythms with only hints of Mexican flavour. </p> <p>Even the story is abstracted somewhat, its “tightly woven, detailed tapestry” distilled into key relationships to suit ballet’s strengths. Wheeldon is well aware that for those unused to dance, watching even well-known story ballets on stage can be baffling. “I sat in on Swan Lake the other night, and thought: ‘If you’re coming to this for the very first time and you haven’t read what it’s about, you’re going to struggle.’”</p> <p>That may be why ballet so often falls back on the same old stories, something Wheeldon is no longer interested in. “I don’t think we should be afraid of tackling complex stories and not feeling like the audience has to understand every second; one of the beauties of dance is that we get to escape into this poetic abstraction, even within a story ballet.” Nonetheless, he is planning to send out a synopsis when people get their e-tickets, as well as links to a number of talks he has done about the work’s creation. “If you’re completely confused as to what’s going on, you’re not enjoying yourself; you can be made to feel stupid.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We focus on the creative process. Despite the fact Michael Jackson is so polarising, his music connects</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is a viewpoint sometimes missed by those, such as Wheeldon, who have been immersed in ballet since childhood. Born in Yeovil, Somerset, he started ballet at eight and was accepted into the Royal Ballet School at 11, based at White Lodge in Richmond Park, west London. He began choreographing straight away. “I was pretty bossy and I liked to organise,” he says, “so it just seemed natural. When the annual choreography competition happened, I was like: ‘Yep, I’m going to enter that and I’m going to win it.’” His first-year entry was chosen to be performed for Princess Margaret. “I was like: ‘Wow, somebody thinks my little piece is good!’ So often in class we were being told that we weren’t any good as dancers. When someone tells you you’re good at something, they give you that confidence – that for me was the big push.”</p> <p>At White Lodge, it was great to be surrounded by so many other people obsessed with ballet, but the intense competition could be hard. “If you didn’t get selected for something, like The Nutcracker, your name just didn’t go up on the board. Nobody took you aside to talk to you. It’s very different now,” he says. Back then there wasn’t a lot of talking about feelings in general. “Those are really formative years, you’re maturing, and whereas I feel kids now are encouraged to be free about who they are, these were not times when we shared or spoke about any sexual feelings. I think most of the boys in our year were gay and we were all so closeted, we were all terrified our parents were going to disown us. I went to New York to find myself. I wasn’t able to fully express myself as a gay man until I moved away.”</p> <p>Wheeldon is now happily married, to yoga instructor Ross Rayburn (they have just moved, with their dog, to an apartment block where, coincidentally, the esteemed choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/georgebalanchine\" title=\"\">George Balanchine</a> used to live). The way we talk about many things has changed since the 90s, and there is a gradual openness in the ballet world to conversations about diversity, body shape, gender, company hierarchy and power dynamics – subjects that previously weren’t addressed. “We’re reassessing what’s considered excellent on stage,” says Wheeldon. “It’s going to take a while. It’s going to be clunky and uncomfortable and awkward, but as long as we’re having the conversations and progress is being made I’m encouraged.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ded098f441f9a54cf5d6d1f33537058367a5ae0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ded098f441f9a54cf5d6d1f33537058367a5ae0/0_542_8090_4854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of Like Water for Chocolate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of Like Water for Chocolate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrej Uspenski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At White Lodge, students were allowed to put one poster up on their bedroom wall, and, while others had pictures of ballet stars, Wheeldon had a poster of Michael Jackson’s Bad (“I remember being obsessed with that album”). It’s another memory that resonated down the years when Wheeldon was asked to direct and choreograph MJ the Musical, recreating the preparations for Jackson’s 1992-93 Dangerous World Tour. A white, British, ballet-trained choreographer, with no expertise in hip-hop or funk dance styles, Wheeldon was not the obvious directorial choice. “I said that when they asked me! You do know who I am?” But the show’s Pulitzer prize-winning writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/lynn-nottage\" title=\"\">Lynn Nottage</a> had seen An American in Paris, and wanted a dance-maker at the helm.</p> <p>Inevitably, he had reservations about taking it on, because of the complexities of Jackson’s legacy. “Everyone has their own opinion,” he says. “Some people think it’s not appropriate; some people separate the art from the artist. We’re asking, in part, how do we have this conversation about this great body of work that’s going nowhere? We focus on the creative process. Despite the fact he’s so polarising, his music connects. On a nightly basis we have the most diverse audience in New York, all connecting through his music. I don’t regret having done it at all.”</p> <p>The pressure of creating a Broadway musical is different from making a ballet, “because you’re expected to make people money”, says Wheeldon. But as a result they have much more development time to get things right: numerous workshops before getting into rehearsals, six weeks of previews before press come in. “I still haven’t put two scenes together in Like Water for Chocolate,” he says. When will it come together? “The day before! Honestly, that’s usually what happens. Everything crashes together and then it’s opening night.” It’s a much riskier prospect. “But it’s kind of the excitement, too,” he says. “You just have to jump in at the deep end and get on with it.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/like-water-for-chocolate-by-christopher-wheeldon-details\">Like Water for Chocolate</a> is at the Royal Opera House, London, 2 to 17 June.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/26/voter-priorities-democrats-endorsements","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T12:59:45Z","webTitle":"Trump is no kingmaker in the Republican party.

Many Trump-endorsed candidates have lost, including Representative Madison Cawthorn, or been held to fairly low percentages, such as the Senate candidates Mehmet Oz and JD Vance. It’s clear that the 2020 election and personal loyalty to Trump have diminishing returns with Republican primary voters.</p> <p>While any Republican would certainly love to have Trump’s endorsement, he’s far from a kingmaker in the party. Fundamentally, most Republican voters vote Republican for the same reasons they always did: lower taxes and imposing conservative culture war policies on others. Elected officials whom Republican voters perceive as governing well and delivering results will be rewarded regardless of whether they tried to “stop the steal”. In the end, Trump’s single-minded fixation on the election, which most voters even in his own party consider a distraction, could do real damage to his prospects in 2024.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The commonality across Democratic primaries is that voters value loyalty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the Democratic side, both sides of the party’s civil war seem to have been drawn into a stalemate. The party’s centrist wing has landed on a potent strategy after being punched in the mouth by superior progressive organization and small-dollar fundraising in the last two cycles. Centrists used the OH-11 special election between Nina Turner and Shontel Brown to pioneer waiting until late in the race and then dropping enormous amounts of outside money through pro-Israel Pacs like Democratic Majority for Israel and Aipac to overwhelm progressives and leave them unable to counter. This strategy was used again to rapidly close an enormous lead in PA-12, but progressives were just able to pull out a win for candidate Summer Lee. As of this writing, the TX-28 race between progressive Jessica Cisneros and the conservative incumbent Henry Cuellar remains too close to call.</p> <p>The commonality across Democratic primaries is that voters value loyalty. DMFI and Aipac’s ads do not ever mention Israel. They savage progressive candidates for alleged disloyalty to the party and its agenda (ironically given Aipac’s endorsement of more than 100 Republican lawmakers who supported overturning the 2020 election). </p> <p>Progressive wins, however, have used the same attack. Despite unitary control of government, the Democratic party has no legislative accomplishments of note. Democratic voters understand that this is due primarily to the intransigence of specific lawmakers. The Pennsylvania Senate nominee John Fetterman hammered opponent Conor Lamb on ending the filibuster and his votes against the party’s agenda. The No Labels “unbreakable nine” who stymied Biden’s Build Back Better agenda have been bleeding out, with Kurt Schrader and Carolyn Bourdeaux losing by large margins and Henry Cuellar in serious danger. Democratic voters want more than anything a functional governing majority that is able to deliver clear results.</p> <p>Across both parties, it’s clear that voters value candidates they believe will govern and deliver on their priorities, far more than endorsements. Democrats who have endorsements from Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi but spent the past two years stymying their agenda will be punished, while Republicans that deliver wins will be rewarded even if they anger Donald Trump.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ben Davis works in political data in Washington DC.

The interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, had opposed allowing the burkini in municipal pools, calling it an “unacceptable provocation” and saying it ran against French values of secularism. On Darmanin’s instruction, the state governor of the Isère region, in south-east France, asked a local court to intervene to suspend the new pool rules from coming into effect on 1 June.</p> <p>The court decided in favour of the government and suspended the new rules on Wednesday night, arguing they “seriously violated the principle of neutrality in public service”. Darmanin tweeted that the decision was “excellent news”.</p> <p>But the city of Grenoble has appealed against the ruling, and the case will now to go France’s highest administrative court, the Conseil d’Etat.</p> <p>The case is significant because the state’s challenge was lodged under Emmanuel Macron’s new law to counter “Islamist separatism”, which was passed by parliament last year. This law allows the government to challenge decisions which it suspects undermine France’s secular traditions intended to separate religion from the state.</p> <p>The French republic is built on a strict separation of church and state, intended to foster equality for all private beliefs. This requires the state to be neutral in terms of religion and allows everyone the freedom to practise their faith as long as there is no threat to public order.</p> <p>Grenoble’s mayor has argued that wearing burkinis in pools had nothing to do with French secularism. State officials in France are not allowed to wear ostentatious religious symbols at work, to protect state neutrality, but Piolle said users of public services, such as swimmers, were simply members of the public who were free to dress as they pleased.</p> <p>The dispute has prompted a political row before next month’s parliamentary elections. It is not the first time full-body swimwear has caused political controversy before an election season.

It is not. Ofgem made a political decision to protect the privatised energy system and its excess profits at the expense of households in Britain. Sunak’s package announced today will not cover the costs of Ofgem’s choice and will leave millions of households exposed to soaring prices. A new approach is needed. The energy price must simply not be lifted in the autumn.</p> <p>This will be expensive. An £830 rise in the cap, spread over 22 million households, suggests a collective cost of up to £19bn. Halting the rise could cost as much. But so what? The chancellor’s “super deduction” tax break for big corporations <a href=\"https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/superdeduction_supplementary_release.pdf\">will cost almost £13bn</a> this financial year. The stamp duty holiday <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/covid-stamp-duty-holiday-prices-b1962775.html\">cost</a> £6.4bn. Both these choices, made by this chancellor, rewarded the wealthiest at the expense of the rest. The cost of both matches the cost of halting the cap increase. A serious tax on North Sea windfall profits <a href=\"https://www.taxjustice.uk/blog/a-north-sea-excess-profits-tax-could-turn-the-tide-of-the-cost-of-living-crisis\">would raise £13bn</a>, much more than Sunak’s £5bn.</p> <p>Meanwhile, BP and Shell, both headquartered in London, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/05/40bn-profits-for-bp-and-shell-fuel-calls-for-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms\">expected</a> to make a combined £40bn in profits this year across their global operations. But their super-profits are not the product of innovation or some brilliance in business management. They represent a pure transfer of money from consumers to the hands of BP and Shell shareholders. And despite frequent claims to the contrary, these companies’ shareholders are not long-suffering pensioners – Britain’s main pension fund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/08/windfall-tax-on-oil-giants-wont-hurt-british-pensioners-thinktank-finds\">owns</a> less than 0.2% of both companies. Nor are they, as the companies will claim, concentrating on investing these profits. BP and Shell are <a href=\"https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-10797137/BP-Shell-lead-FTSE-share-buybacks-set-hit-record-levels.html\">handing</a> out about £9.5bn to shareholders in share buybacks this year. Meanwhile, even as the major oil companies make super-profits, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/energy-market-massacre-looms-britain-scottish-power-chief-says-2021-10-21/\">smaller household suppliers face bankruptcy</a>, caught between demands for low household bills and soaring prices charged for wholesale gas.</p> <p>Despite all our technology, we live in an increasingly primitive form of capitalism. Observing the corrupt landowners of the early 19th century, David Ricardo, one of the fathers of modern economics, brilliantly described the excessive payments they were extracting from society as a result of nothing more than their claim to property. The more that was paid by society in these “economic rents”, in Ricardo’s concise economic model, the worse off the rest of society would become.</p> <p>Today’s fossil fuel giants are the 21st-century equivalent of those landowners, doing nothing other than squatting on a valuable resource and forcing the rest of society to pay them for the privilege of accessing it. As Oxfam’s research <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/pandemic-creates-new-billionaire-every-30-hours-now-million-people-could-fall\">showed</a> this week, the pandemic and its aftermath have seen the world’s super-rich become monstrously richer. And it is the owners of the essentials of modern life – in food, energy, pharmaceuticals and tech – that have seen the fastest growth in their wealth, with a new billionaire created every 30 hours. Just as Ricardo predicted, the flipside of wealth hoarding is impoverishment, with millions expected to be forced into extreme poverty over this year.</p> <p>Profits for the largest companies are at all-time highs, recovering rapidly from the initial pandemic shock. The Competition and Markets Authority last week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Frank_vanlerven/status/1521430860389621762?s=20&amp;t=jsif9AId0tYa5Y9WKDHbJg\">reported</a> that “mark ups” on prices, the amount added to the costs of something being sold in order to give the seller a profit, by the biggest and most profitable companies have risen from 58% in 2008 to 82% in 2020. It is market power that allows the oil and gas majors to extract their economic rents; so, too, with the four agribusinesses that <a href=\"https://www-cdn.oxfam.org/s3fs-public/file_attachments/rr-cereal-secrets-grain-traders-agriculture-30082012-en_4.pdf\">control</a> 90% of the globe’s grain trade; and pharmaceutical profits during the pandemic have been legendary. New research from the Boston Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/current-policy-perspectives/2022/cost-price-relationships-in-a-concentrated-economy.aspx\">shows</a> that markets increasingly dominated by a few companies are having a direct impact on inflation.</p> <p>This is the true source of inflation today. The world is increasingly subject to environmental shocks, such as <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00639-z\">disease outbreaks</a> and extreme weather events, and racked by political instability, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These shocks are real events, and genuinely make the world a harder and more dangerous place to live. As the effects of climate breakdown worsen, such shocks will become more frequent, threatening a future of high costs and widespread shortages in essentials from food to fuel. But when those shocks and shortages take place in a global economic system that privileges the extraction of profits for a few over the supply of essentials for the many, they turn into repugnant profiteering.</p> <p>Inflation is not being caused by having too much money circulating, or a “wage-price spiral”. Wages and salaries in the UK<strong> </strong>have scarcely risen for a decade, relative to prices. Instead, faced with rising prices for essential goods, but with incomes – whether from a salary, a pension, or universal credit – that are being left far behind, most of us can see straight away that the problem isn’t too much money in circulation, but far too little – at least in the hands of those that actually need it. Raising interest rates, or cutting wages, or both, is worse than useless under these circumstances.</p> <p>Sunak’s announcement today will not cancel out the cost of the price cap rise and will prove to be inadequate. There is a simple choice to be made: either protect the profiteers or protect society. The cap increase should be halted, and a better pricing system devised. Any failing supply companies should be nationalised, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-22/u-k-energy-supplier-bulb-will-enter-special-administration\">like Bulb Energy was last year</a>.

And like Randall at his mother’s funeral, I want to find the right thing to say. Every week without fail, this heartstring-yanking family saga about the big three – the triplets Kate, Kevin and Randall Pearson – made millions weep, myself included. It has been a six-year emotional juggernaut, a guilty pleasure to watch while sobbing into the sofa. It was comfort TV at its cosiest: a winning combination of twists and misdirection that kept you hooked and blindsided, with fantastic, fleshed-out characters delivering endless hokey speeches (Randall, you are the king!). It may have been a shameless schmaltzfest, but how we needed the release of a show as huge, messy and delectable as life itself.</p> <p>We have watched Randall, played by the wondrous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/23/sterling-k-brown-black-panther-marvel-people-oj-simpson-this-is-us\">Sterling K Brown</a>, go from anxious mathlete to dweeby dad to viral video star (after dancing topless in his office) to ace politician. We have seen him grapple with his adoption by a white family, meet and lose his birth father, and commune with the ghost of his birth mother in a lake. We have witnessed his breakdowns, his triumphs and his lifelong love affair with Beth (the comedy dynamite that is Susan Kelechi Watson).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49f8987433f7ecd0b79f77ffbdc884684bed2c46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49f8987433f7ecd0b79f77ffbdc884684bed2c46/1_5_731_439/500.jpg\" alt=\"Randall and his children in This Is Us\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The king of hokey speeches … Randall with his daughters in This Is Us.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Batzdorff/NBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His sister, Kate, played by Chrissy Metz, has gone from tentative teen singer to meeting her future husband Toby at a weight-loss group.

Jack (the lovely Milo Ventimiglia) is essentially America’s No 1 dad, a perfect moustachioed specimen always spouting cheesy lines about lemons. If the first two seasons led up to Jack’s death, the last was about the matriarch, Rebecca (a spectacular Mandy Moore), and her agonising descent into dementia, with two of her three children unable even to gaze in her direction because of the shell she had become.</p> <p>The last clutch of episodes have been masterly, showing Rebecca fading away and bidding farewell – only this show could pull off a train ride to the end of your life – and it was all planned to a T. Most of the final episode, showing the Pearsons having a peaceful day at home, was filmed years ago.

In those, she is a powerful figure, plotting a murderous revenge on her husband, Agamemnon, for sacrificing their daughter.</p> <p>In Marina Carr’s audacious version, the power lies squarely with Agamemnon, who consents to the ritual killing of their 10-year-old, Iphigenia, for his advancement in the war against Troy. Yet Clytemnestra is certainly not voiceless in this co-production with the Abbey theatre in Dublin.</p> <p>Carr tells the story of Clytemnestra (Eileen Walsh) and Agamemnon (David Walmsley) through a series of internal monologues with revisions that make us see the shocks of this story afresh. Innovatively directed by Annabelle Comyn, the production brings a deadly coolness to the searing revelations – unlike the frenzy we saw in Ivo van Hove’s recent retelling of the same story in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/06/age-of-rage-review-barbican-london\">Age of Rage</a>. The characters here feel larger than life as opposed to in van Hove’s version, where the humans seemed so small and insignificant amid the large-scale set.</p> <p>It is a counterintuitive venture with riveting results for the most part. A few moments feel static but these are brief and there is a terrible, startling drama inside the stillness. Carr’s story is so intimate in its telling, with so many off-stage scenes painted in words, that it verges on novelistic and makes it necessary for us to imagine much of what it is described. The lighting and sound take on a stupendous force, with an interplay of black and white as doors open suddenly and shafts of light reveal new figures on stage (lighting design by Amy Mae; video design by Will Duke). The sound of lapping waves or cawing birds is crisp and beautiful (composition and sound design by Philip Stewart). With Tom Piper’s spare set design, the combined effect is astonishingly atmospheric.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1062c9ad4e3b37e80549c2d9fb1d318c23cb7df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1062c9ad4e3b37e80549c2d9fb1d318c23cb7df/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exceptional … Kate Stanley Brennan as Cilissa with Walsh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exceptional … Kate Stanley Brennan as Cilissa with Walsh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Searle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The script itself has an epic quality – Homeric in its vivid detail and oral splendour – but it is at heart a pointed study of a marriage, profoundly unequal in its power. The bed on stage drives home the point that this story is about marriage, love, sex and childbirth.</p> <p>Walsh’s Clytemnestra is cool-headed, intelligent, and unable to forgive her husband for killing their daughter and then dancing at her altar. Her performance is self-contained and steely but profound in its maternal pain. The pitch-perfect cast includes an exceptional performance from Kate Stanley Brennan as Clytemnestra’s serving-woman, Cilissa.</p> <p>Agamemnon’s anguish is presented, too, and for a while we empathise as he tells us of his lack of options in the face of the oracle. Walmsley has a physical, prowling presence. His Agamemnon is both ancient and modern – a buffed-up soldier often stripped to the waist and pumped up on ego. Yet it is made clear that Clytemnestra controls his passions, and that his is a toxic love story of the highest order.</p> <p>Interspersed through this play are reports of other girls sacrificed at altars by men who want to win wars. “What is this terrible pact among men?” asks one character. While this human sacrifice comes wrapped in an ancient patriarchal order, it resonates with current legal wrangles around women’s bodies, in Ireland, America and beyond. There is one good man and loyal father in Clytemnestra’s father, Tyndareus (Jim Findley), an incredibly touching counterpoint to the play’s abounding male toxicity.</p> <p>Where Clytemnestra is killed by her children for her crime against their father in the original text, this play stops short of showing the story’s full circularity. Agamemnon is a monster by the end and Clytemnestra’s “vengeance” is a momentary loss of control – a mother’s crime of passion. It is bloody but feels discomfortingly just.</p> <ul> <li><p>At the <a href=\"https://kilntheatre.com/whats-on/girl-on-an-altar/\">Kiln theatre, London</a>, until 25 June.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/may/26/eddie-nketiah-arsenal-poised-sign-long-term-contract-after-deciding-to-stay","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T11:47:38Z","webTitle":"Eddie Nketiah poised for long-term Arsenal contract after deciding to stay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/26/eddie-nketiah-arsenal-poised-sign-long-term-contract-after-deciding-to-stay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/may/26/eddie-nketiah-arsenal-poised-sign-long-term-contract-after-deciding-to-stay","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Nketiah poised for long-term Arsenal contract after deciding to stay","trailText":"Eddie Nketiah is expected to stay at Arsenal after deciding to accept the club’s offer of a new long-term deal","body":"<p>Eddie Nketiah is expected to stay at Arsenal after deciding to accept the club’s offer of a new long-term deal.</p> <p>The forward, who turns 23 on Monday, had been expected to seek a new challenge upon the expiry of his current deal in June, with West Ham, Crystal Palace and Brighton among a number of clubs at home and abroad monitoring his situation.

Having rushed to launch the operation to avoid giving Ukraine time to bring up new weapons from the west, Russia has found that its depleted and exhausted units are unwilling and unable to assault Ukrainian positions without incurring unacceptable losses. The Russian army has, therefore, fallen back on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/russian-assault-eastern-ukraine-sievierodonetsk-donbas\">mass application of artillery</a>, destroying village after village, which they occupy after Ukrainian units withdraw.</p> <p>For the Ukrainian military, the current Russian tactics may be unsophisticated and nihilistic, but they are also dangerous. To stop the Russians from advancing, the Ukrainian armed forces must occupy the ground. This subjects their units to heavy bombardment, and is producing a steady accumulation of Ukrainian casualties. The Ukrainians are trying to limit the weight of Russian fire by raiding and striking the logistics supporting the Russian artillery.</p> <p>The challenge for the Russian military is maintaining troop levels. Moscow has begun an unannounced mobilisation of citizens with former military service, complementing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/russia-may-scrap-age-limits-for-soldiers-to-bolster-ukraine-invasion-force\">recruitment drive</a> for volunteers to take up short-term service contracts. The short-term contracts are intended to keep up the strength of units until mobilised personnel are organised and equipped. But with little training, low morale, poor unit cohesion following significant casualties and a steady influx of new personnel, Russian units continue to perform badly and suffer disproportionately in engagements.</p> <p>Although the short-term military trends currently favour Ukraine, the country faces hard choices. So long as Russia has a significant number of artillery systems and its air defences deny Ukraine air support, the Ukrainian military is forced to remain dispersed, limiting its available combat power at any one point and slowing the rate at which it can liberate territory. Ukraine must also guard against the risk that Russia moves into a large and more overt mobilisation of its population that, while politically risky, would threaten a significant offensive late in the year, requiring Ukraine to hold forces in reserve.</p> <p>If the Ukrainian military cannot liberate significant tracts of territory or bleed out the Russian army this summer then there is the risk of a protracted conflict. The principal security concerns for Kyiv are economic and political. Without a peace settlement, Ukraine will remain economically paralysed, its ports blockaded, its cities heavily damaged, and investment or reconstruction deterred by the ever looming prospect of missile strikes. Kyiv is expected to lose almost half of its GDP this year. Many internally displaced Ukrainians have been living off their savings. These will begin to run out.</p> <p>A protracted conflict also risks damaging internal cohesion. Ukraine has so far been politically unified, with Russia’s sympathisers in the Ukrainian state keeping a low profile or enthusiastically supporting the war effort. It would be dangerous to do anything else. As curfews and movement controls are lifted, however, and the political clarity of the need to defend Kyiv dissipates, there are renewed opportunities for subversion. How the government ensures it can provide heating for citizens away from the front as winter approaches, for example, is an issue over which criticism may be justified. But such issues can also be weaponised by Russia to degrade the country’s internal unity.</p> <p>In a protracted conflict, Ukraine will probably depend upon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/world-bank-approves-770m-ukraine-services-funds-russia\">financial assistance</a> from abroad, but it is also likely to need that assistance precisely when its international partners are under the greatest economic strain. Inflation in the UK is approaching 10%. There is a serious risk of recession. If job losses come in the autumn, it will coincide with people’s renewed need to heat their homes. Energy prices, meanwhile, are expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/energy-bills-likely-to-rise-by-800-in-october-says-ofgem-chief\">remain high</a>, and Russia has so far kept supplying Europe. Under these conditions European citizens may become less supportive of aiding Ukraine to fight a grinding war in Donbas when there is acute pain felt at home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/we-must-stop-letting-russia-define-the-terms-of-the-ukraine-crisis\">We must stop letting Russia define the terms of the Ukraine crisis | Slavoj Žižek</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given these dark clouds on the horizon, Ukraine’s partners must pursue two courses of action. First, Ukraine must improve its security position as much as possible over the summer. To do this it requires long-range artillery that can challenge Russia’s fires dominance. The US provision of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/world/europe/us-ukraine-howitzers.html\">M777 155mm howitzers</a> is a good start. Ukraine’s partners must also help in training new Ukrainian brigades so that the country can withdraw and reconstitute some of its units. It is also critical that the Russian army not be given the opportunity to recover the initiative. To prevent this, it is important to keep the rate of Russian casualties in Donbas high, so that mobilised personnel have to be immediately pushed into maintaining Russian positions rather than organised into new units able to open up new axes.</p> <p>The second line of effort must be a coordinated approach across Europe to build resilience for this winter and to begin working out the best means of offering economic support to Ukraine. There is also a need to inform the public early and clearly as to the direct correlation between Russia’s actions and the economic pain to come. Russian disinformation will inevitably portray the economic pain as a consequence of supporting Kyiv. Such distortions need to be preemptively undermined.</p> <p>Finally, there is the question of alliance unity. There are growing calls across Nato to consider negotiated solutions, often premised on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/22/ukraine-russia-ceasefire-deal-territory-donbas\">trading Ukrainian territory</a> for peace. While negotiations should never be abandoned, pushing for a ceasefire that would lock in Russian gains, allow the Russian army to recover and prepare for a renewed offensive and leave Ukraine economically crippled, is deeply naive. It is vital that the disagreements about objectives between key European partners are thrashed out and resolved as soon as possible. As Ukrainian citizens are put through filtration camps, and Russia plots the annexation of more of its territory, it must be understood that peace on Russia’s terms would be a very violent affair.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jack Watling is senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It will also have severe ripple effects, especially for Texas patients who had been traveling to Oklahoma in large numbers after the Texas six-week abortion ban went into effect in September.”</p> <p>The bills are part of an aggressive push in Republican-led states. Nash <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElizNash/status/1529611090245599232\">added</a>: Oklahoma and Texas are the tip of the iceberg. We estimate that 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion if abortion rights are overturned. And the supreme court is poised to overturn Roe v Wade in the next few weeks.”</p> <p>It is unclear what will happen to women who qualify under an exception. The author of the law, state representative Wendi Stearman, says doctors will decide which women qualify for abortions in hospitals. Providers and activists warn that trying to prove qualification could prove difficult and even dangerous.</p> <p>Stitt signed a six-week ban earlier this month. A third Oklahoma bill is to take effect this summer. It would make it a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. That bill contains no exceptions for rape or incest.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/may/26/dining-across-divide-come-from-latvia-support-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T11:30:06Z","webTitle":"Dining across the divide: ‘How can he come from Latvia and support Brexit?’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/26/dining-across-divide-come-from-latvia-support-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/26/dining-across-divide-come-from-latvia-support-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Dining across the divide: ‘How can he come from Latvia and support Brexit?’","trailText":"They both accept the EU’s failings, find common ground on Covid and the climate crisis, but can an accountant and actor strike up a friendship post-referendum?","body":"<p><strong>Dans, 28, Birmingham</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e0ce807947363430eed7e53a2fd8bb1824a9f33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e0ce807947363430eed7e53a2fd8bb1824a9f33/1418_329_2920_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Occupation</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>Accountant</p> <p><strong>Voting record </strong>Left Latvia before he was old enough to vote.

In Spain, it was brutal. Everyone had to wear masks all the time.

But Gray’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-report-full-breakdown-findings-no-10-parties\">60 pages of findings</a> leave several questions unanswered:</p> <h2>Why did Gray not investigate the Downing Street flat event?</h2> <p>This is, more specifically, two questions. The first is what happened on the evening of 13 November 2020, after the departure of key aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, when Boris Johnson, his wife, Carrie, and others decamped to the Downing Street flat, where food and alcohol was consumed. No 10 says this was a work meeting, others argue it was clearly a party. The full truth is not known.</p> <p>That leads to the second issue: why Gray chose not to look into the flat gathering. In her report, she said this was because, first, the Metropolitan police examined it, and then, it was “not appropriate or proportionate” for her to investigate further. This does not seem to make sense given Gray did look into other events investigated by the Met, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-failure-to-investigate-alleged-abba-party-in-pm-flat-irks-mps\">prompting concerns</a> Downing Street may have leant on her.</p> <h2>How did Johnson not know what was happening?</h2> <p>This is less of a question for Gray than one that necessarily follows from her report. As well as the extent of lockdown socialising – 15 events on eight dates – there is also the issue of the scale and premeditation. For the “bring your own booze” garden party on 20 May 2020, organised by Johnson’s then principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, invitations were sent to about 200 staff. Johnson turned up to that and was present at seven other events detailed in the report. The prime minister’s defence that he either did not see what was happening, or else attended but did not think it was a social event, feels implausible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST<br></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How did Johnson get away with one fine?</h2> <p>This was a question <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/boris-johnson-and-partygate-how-did-pm-only-get-one-fine\">already raised</a> at the end of the Met police inquiry last week, when Johnson received a fixed-penalty notice for the gathering on his birthday in June 2020, but not for other events he attended, for which others were penalised. But Gray’s report, with its pages of detail about drunken staff, spilled wine, karaoke machines and inebriated scuffles, sets out a wider context of apparent mass illegality. The Met agreed, issuing 126 penalty notices. How Johnson escaped with one remains a mystery.</p> <h2>How much leeway did Gray have in compiling her report?</h2> <p>While the inquiry was repeatedly billed by ministers as independent, Gray is a Cabinet Office civil servant ultimately managed by Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, among those named in the report, and then Johnson. As well as the implicit pressure on her to pull punches, questions remain about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/23/uk-government-briefings-accusing-sue-gray-of-playing-politics-condemned-by-minister\">meeting No 10 arranged</a> between Johnson and Gray earlier this month, and whether pressure from Downing Street led to any scrutiny of the flat party being dropped.</p> <h2>How is Martin Reynolds still in a job?</h2> <p>The man now known to the nation as “Party Marty” is no longer principal private secretary. He works at the Foreign Office and is reported to be in line to become ambassador to Saudi Arabia – a place where organising “bring your own booze” parties would bring extra challenges. This is, however, a man mentioned 24 times in Gray’s report, who exchanged repeated messages about organising social gatherings despite warnings from other staff, remarking after one that we “seem to have got away” with it. It is fair to say that in most other settings, disciplinary proceedings would be well under way.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/may/26/lucy-bronze-leaving-manchester-city-women-stanway-weir","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T11:15:04Z","webTitle":"Lucy Bronze adds to Manchester City Women’s high-profile exodus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/26/lucy-bronze-leaving-manchester-city-women-stanway-weir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/may/26/lucy-bronze-leaving-manchester-city-women-stanway-weir","fields":{"headline":"Lucy Bronze adds to Manchester City Women’s high-profile exodus","trailText":"Manchester City Women have announced that Lucy Bronze will join Georgia Stanway and<strong> </strong>Caroline Weir in leaving this summer when her contract expires","body":"<p>The exodus of players from Manchester City Women continued on Thursday with the club announcing that Lucy Bronze would leave this summer at the end of her contract.</p> \n<p>The England defender becomes the third high-profile player whose departure has been confirmed in the past 10 days.

The two did not mesh at all and Land of the Lost remains one of Ferrell’s strangest missteps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/22/super-mario-bros-movie-killing-fields-chariots-fire-video-game\">‘The stench of it stays with everybody’: inside the Super Mario Bros movie</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>17 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/22/super-mario-bros-movie-killing-fields-chariots-fire-video-game\">Super Mario Bros</a> (1993)</h2> <p>Fun fact: Super Mario Bros was released two weeks before Jurassic Park, but those two weeks now feel like 25 years. Everything about this film is dismal, not least the fact that its central conceit – the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs created a parallel dimension of humanoid dinosaurs led by Dennis Hopper – has very little to do with Mario.</p> <h2>16 The Flintstones (1994)</h2> <p>The same dino fad that inspired Theodore Rex also gave us The Flintstones, a 1994 live-action remake of the beloved cartoon series. While not a good film by any stretch – John Goodman looks embarrassed to be playing Fred Flintstone, for instance – it still has its moments. If nothing else, its depiction of Dino is relentlessly cute.</p> <h2>15 Tammy and the T-Rex (1994)</h2> <p>I promise this is a real film. Denise Richards plays Tammy, a college girl whose life is turned upside down when her boyfriend’s brain is implanted into a giant animatronic dinosaur. Legend states that the film was made only because the director found a model dinosaur that nobody was using. It shows.</p> <h2>14 The Land That Time Forgot (1974)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b92893926169983af8be5f6581a992b0f79859b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b92893926169983af8be5f6581a992b0f79859b9/16_8_3035_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Land That Time Forgot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"771\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Land That Time Forgot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amicus/Kobal/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a 2009 movie of this name produced by the creators of Sharknado. Please avoid that and head for the good stuff: Kevin Connor’s 1974 version. True, the dinosaurs lack the finesse of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/07/ray-harryhausen-dies\">Ray Harryhausen</a> production – some are puppets, and some are men dressed up – but the story is mostly faithful to the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel. Plus, it features one of the all-time great cinematic jump scares.</p> <h2>13 The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)</h2> <p>Were it not for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, this would be the worst Jurassic movie. Another attempt to deviate from a perfect story, The Lost World fails on many fronts. Half the original cast is missing (replaced by Vince Vaughn and others), all the characters know exactly what to expect from the island, and the finale (in which a T rex goes nuts in San Diego) sails far too close to pastiche.</p> <h2>12 The Valley of Gwangi (1969)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25bb25e6417bee74f1fcf50156342fd2b5f17123\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25bb25e6417bee74f1fcf50156342fd2b5f17123/0_0_2400_1709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Valley of Gwangi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Valley of Gwangi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three years after One Million Years BC, Harryhausen had another, less successful, stab at dinosaur creation with The Valley of Gwangi. Essentially, some cowboys find a load of dinosaurs and have a big fight with them. The whole thing is ridiculous and isn’t remembered with much fondness. But if HBO can reimagine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/westworld\">Westworld</a> as an expensive prestige drama series, then The Valley of Gwangi deserves the same.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/30/tyrannosaurus-rex-was-a-sensitive-lover-new-dinosaur-discovery-suggests\">Tyrannosaurus rex was a sensitive lover, new dinosaur discovery suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>11 <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0016039/\">The Lost World</a> (1925)</h2> <p>Arthur Conan Doyle’s novel has been adapted countless times, but the most effective version is Harry O Hoyt’s silent offering from 1925. It is is an exceptional production, utilising stop motion, full-body makeup and real animals. Points added for the climax, in which a loose brontosaurus smashes up a beloved Soho drinking establishment. Points lost for other elements ageing very, very badly indeed. You will know them when you see them.</p> <h2>10 Jurassic Park III (2001)</h2> <p>What a weird film. For the bulk of its running time, Jurassic Park III is intent on correcting the wrongs of The Lost World: Jurassic Park. The story is more compact, the scares are scarier; everything is going swimmingly. Then it comes to an abrupt end, as if the production ran out of money. A wasted opportunity.</p> <h2>9 A Journey to the Beginning of Time (1955)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUobdR5-3YQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iUobdR5-3YQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for A Journey to the Beginning of Time.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It is incredible to think that Karel Zeman’s 1955 movie is almost 70 years old. While the story has decayed a little over time – kids row a boat down a river and gawp at the animals on the banks – the experience of watching it remains undimmed. In terms of animation, set design and ambition, this film is a miracle. Wes Anderson is a fan for a reason.</p> <h2>8 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/03/ice-age-dawn-of-dinosaurs-review\">Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs</a> (2009)</h2> <p>Having backed itself into a corner with the environmental sermon Ice Age: The Meltdown, the franchise decided to fudge history and introduce some dinosaurs into proceedings. For many, this is where the series began to lose its way, but there are plenty of delights to be had in the deliberately unfaithful dinosaur depictions.</p> <h2>7 The Land Before Time (1988)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ab69920c135ef53d4a1f28ae43d4fca416692d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ab69920c135ef53d4a1f28ae43d4fca416692d8/15_10_2665_1833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Land Before Time\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Land Before Time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the series eventually meandered into direct-to-video infinity, for a while The Land Before Time was <em>the</em> dinosaur movie. Directed by Don Bluth and executive-produced by Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, it was envisioned as “Bambi with dinosaurs” and it absolutely nails the assignment. In parts syrupy, scary and profound, it is worth a rewatch.</p> <h2>6 Jurassic World (2015)</h2> <p>A huge financial success, Jurassic World isn’t so much a sequel as a remake. You could argue that its mimicry becomes rote and that Chris Pratt is no Jeff Goldblum, but there is something thrilling about a story being told well all over again. And, hey, if you are going to rip off anything, it might as well be Jurassic Park.</p> <h2>5 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/07/the-tree-of-life-review\">The Tree of Life</a> (2011)</h2> <p>OK, you have to ignore most of the film to consider this a dinosaur movie. But that is fine, because you will just be ignoring lots of middle-aged men having bland quasi-existential crises. The moment in question comes when Terrence Malick gets bored by his film and decides to show us the history of the universe instead. There is a dinosaur sequence that cannot be forgotten.</p> <h2>4 The Good Dinosaur (2015)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25jMqzRWZBE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/25jMqzRWZBE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch a clip from The Good Dinosaur.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This was overlooked on release, thanks to the cultural crater left by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/23/inside-out-review-high-iq-family-entertainment\">Inside Out</a>, but Pixar’s The Good Dinosaur is an oasis of quiet charm. The story of a young apatosaurus who finds himself in charge of a small, mute human, The Good Dinosaur isn’t particularly spectacular or inventive, but it has charm by the bucketload and a supremely weepy ending. The best talking-dinosaur film.</p> <h2>3 One Million Years BC (1966)</h2> <p>Even compared with some of the duds on this list, One Million Years BC is wildly inaccurate. Human beings weren’t around 1m years ago and the last dinosaurs died tens of million of years before that. But your mind would have been blown in innumerable ways had you watched Harryhausen’s spectacular dinosaur animation in a cinema in the 60s.</p> <h2>2 King Kong (2005)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d28a8fee7a20974d0906de6a829fd367688c9953\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d28a8fee7a20974d0906de6a829fd367688c9953/0_0_4050_2288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"King Kong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"565\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King Kong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have opted for Peter Jackson’s 2005 behemoth, but feel free to sub in your preferred Kong. While New York is the setting for the famous climax, the real fun is had back on Skull Island. This is where Kong goes at it with a prehistoric beast, fending off an attack so savagely that his power will never again be underestimated.</p> <h2>1 Jurassic Park (1993)</h2> <p>How could it be anything else? Jurassic Park is more than a film; it is a line in the sand after which the modern blockbuster came into being. It is a marvel of technological progress and (mostly) accurate creature depictions, tied to a propulsive plot that understands exactly which buttons it needs to press at any given moment. An incontestable classic, this film will still be top of the list a century from now.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2022/may/26/alfie-templeman-mellow-moon-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"Alfie Templeman: Mellow Moon review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/26/alfie-templeman-mellow-moon-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/may/26/alfie-templeman-mellow-moon-review","fields":{"headline":"Alfie Templeman: Mellow Moon review – teenage adulation awaits","trailText":"Upbeat debut with surprising sonic touches succeeds as amiable, fresh-faced pop, yet there’s a feeling of a young artist pulling his punches","body":"<p>The debut album by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/25/one-to-watch-alfie-templeman-happiness-in-liquid-form\">Alfie Templeman</a> was launched not with a lavish party or extensive and spendy press campaign but a gig built within the sandbox video game Minecraft – or “an immersive music festival in space”. Users were encouraged to take part in scavenger hunts in order to gain entry to a secret spaceship and hear extracts from the album.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86967973df127bfe0fbc8f809f3228cb5d3b0e90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86967973df127bfe0fbc8f809f3228cb5d3b0e90/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alfie Templeman: Mellow Moon album cover.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alfie Templeman: Mellow Moon album cover.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That tells you a lot about the area of music in which Templeman operates. Some 60% of Minecraft’s players are teenagers and Templeman – still a teenager himself – deals in a very specific, very teenage strain of 21st-century pop-rock. It lives in those areas of the Radio 1 playlist not colonised by hip-hop, UK rap and pop-house, and in branches of H&amp;M and McDonald’s. It is music in which George Ezra and Harry Styles occasionally dabble, but Sea Girls, Tom Grennan and Thomas Headon – who was one of the support acts at Templeman’s Minecraft show – play full-time. It is a little bit guitar-y, occasionally piano-led, but mostly electronic. In among its influences lurk the brightest, most 80s-inspired singles by the 1975, Jungle’s whitewashed pop-R&amp;B, Tame Impala’s hazy electronic psych and Bastille’s ever-so-fractionally left-of-centre pop. Somewhere in the recipe there are also sprinklings of stadium-sized ambition and warm mid-70s AOR. It is very commercial but nondescript of image and doesn’t seem to have a name, though some of its fans – and indeed Spotify – persist in referring to it as “indie”, perhaps in an attempt to rile any parents in earshot who can remember when indie meant the Jesus and Mary Chain staggering paralytic around a stage for 20 minutes, pausing from making a horrendous racket only to tell their audience to fuck off. Then again, upsetting parents really doesn’t seem to be part of the deal with this stuff. It is amiable, upbeat, fresh-faced, successful and unthreatening: Nice Boyfriend Music. It sounds like it did well in its A-levels and is looking forward to a sick gap year backpacking in Australia.</p> <p>If the gauzy textures of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/28/our-managers-were-like-its-going-to-be-a-dud-how-glass-animals-became-the-biggest-british-band-in-the-world\">Glass Animals</a> represent this kind of thing at its most exploratory and expansive, then Templeman is at its dead centre. Alongside the usual, his most obvious inspiration is Coldplay: not Coldplay the grandiose stadium ballad-mongers but Coldplay in pop mode. The kind of tumbling, echoing guitar found on Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall and Adventure of a Lifetime turns up on Broken and 3D Feelings, while Templeman’s lyrics tend towards Chris Martin-ish one-size-fits-all generalities when dealing with serious matters, such as his struggles with anxiety and depression: “Life ain’t got a manual / It came without instructions … Don’t you feel like you’re broken?” That said, it’s hard to escape the feeling that Templeman is actually slightly better than Coldplay when it comes to pop: his songs flow more naturally, they feel less considered and forced; their metaphorical grin is less fixed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w00IDEqfl_Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w00IDEqfl_Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Alfie Templeman: Broken – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In fact, within the confines of what he chooses to do here, Templeman is pretty good. The love lyrics are a bit cutesy (on Do It, he frets about sounding “sappy”, something he perhaps should have considered before writing the title track, on which he imagines himself flying to the moon on “a hundred unicorn balloons”). The cheeky spoken-word asides occasionally grate. And listeners substantially older than the target audience may find themselves puzzling at the presumably unintentional resemblance between the synth riff of Candyfloss and the theme tune to Cagney &amp; Lacey. But there’s no getting around the fact that Templeman is possessed of a keen melodic facility, that Colour Me Blue is a very well-written song or that Leaving Today is incredibly pretty. There are nice sonic touches here and there: the off-key slide guitar that opens Folding Mountains; the filtered house squelch of Best Feeling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So on its own terms, Mellow Moon succeeds. Even so, you wonder if it might not reflect a young artist pulling his punches. Templeman also self-releases music as Ariel Days – the name a reference to Ariel Pink dating from “before I found out he was a massive prick” (after a history of misogynist comments, the US musician was pictured at the January 2021 riot at the US Capitol building, to “peacefully show my support for the president”). That project is a little less bright-eyed and eager to please than the music here, couching the same melodic facility in lower-fi production and more opaque, chaotic and intriguing arrangements. You get a whisper of its sound on Mellow Moon’s beautiful closing track Just Below the Above: an intimation of greater depth, just as the occasional lyric here hints at a sharper, sarkier character lurking beneath the surface: “I’m in a mid-life crisis at the age of 18.” Maybe it’ll rise to the top in time. For now, Alfie Templeman is perfect Nice Boyfriend material and teenage adulation awaits.</p> <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWTXh1xAVpM\">Art </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWTXh1xAVpM\">d’Ecco – Midlife Crisis</a></strong><br>A dollop of arty, Sparks-y glam atop a slice of glitzy synth pop, and anthemic to boot.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/may/26/celebrated-virgins-review-ladies-of-llangollen","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T10:52:01Z","webTitle":"Celebrated Virgins review – a loving tribute to the Ladies of Llangollen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/26/celebrated-virgins-review-ladies-of-llangollen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/may/26/celebrated-virgins-review-ladies-of-llangollen","fields":{"headline":"Celebrated Virgins review – a loving tribute to the Ladies of Llangollen","trailText":"<strong>Theatr Clwyd<br></strong>Fifty years of a tender idyll are reimagined with dignity, grace – and the odd meta moment","body":"<p>At the time of her death in 1829, at the grand age of 90, Eleanor Butler had been living with Sarah Ponsonby in Plas Newydd, Llangollen, for half a century. Feted in their lifetime and together known as the <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/desire-love-and-identity/ladies-llangollen\">Ladies of Llangollen</a>, they welcomed the great and good of Georgian society into their home. It’s still open to visitors “at a rather reasonable rate, out of season”, Sarah knowingly jokes to the audience.<br><br>Such deft meta turns are speckled throughout Katie Elin-Salt and Eleri B Jones’s Celebrated Virgins, which charts Butler and Ponsonby’s relationship from the first tentative pangs of unarticulated love to the serenity of their eventual “silent, pensive days” spent among the roses. Although based on real events, it is noted as a reimagining of the ladies’ narrative and aims to reclaim their story on their own terms.

Pop culture has defanged vampires in modern times, but the undead of Swansong – an RPG-meets-detective-thriller, in which conversations replace combat – are truly fearsome. They’re not Harryhausen monsters or twinkly eyed teen idols. They’re something closer to those frightening people on LinkedIn who get promoted every three weeks, live every second of their lives in tailored suits and run their own consultancy by age 23. They’re the pallid overachievers who run our society with no concern for the rest of us, other than what we can offer them. In this case, of course, what we can offer them is blood.</p> <p>It’s lucky the premise is as strong as it is, because Swansong inducts you into this world with a barrage of information. While dust gathers on your controller, you’re introduced to a shadow covenant of vampires, its many rules and political power struggles, a trio of protagonists, <em>and</em> a code-red event that threatens the order and secrecy you only just learned about, all in swift succession.</p> <p>Should you still be standing after that tidal wave of exposition, there’s a thriller on the other side with real tension. The perspective shifts between Emem, Leysha and Galeb, three of the vampire prince’s inner circle with wildly different concerns and motivations, and you really feel the weight on their shoulders. You want to protect their friends. You want to be a good mother to your daemon child. You want to live up to the prince’s expectations. And this being a game that doesn’t present its dilemmas with neat, satisfying moral clarity, you never <em>quite</em> know whether you’re succeeding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0103b00ef9a5e7a866782f416a3fee17cd5cd696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0103b00ef9a5e7a866782f416a3fee17cd5cd696/0_0_8337_5005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The protagonisits … Leysha, Galeb and Emem\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The protagonisits … Leysha, Galeb and Emem</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Essentially you’re playing as three nocturnal detectives digging around after an attack. Vampire: The Masquerade began as a tabletop RPG and there’s still some of the old rulebook in here – you have action points to spend on anything from hacking a laptop to conversational techniques, while feeding on humans replenishes your unholy abilities. Beyond the more prosaic walking, talking and sweeping rooms for clues like files and photos, you impress yourself upon the plot in confrontations. These work like conversational boss battles, in which you use a variety of supernatural social engineering tricks to persuade, intimidate or dominate your foils into seeing things your way.</p> <p>The outcomes of those confrontations offer some diverging narrative paths, but the real forks in the road happen when you’re thrown more binary dilemmas. Do you sell out your friend to the prince or help them escape to live with other vampires who refuse to live by the code? If that seems like the kind of quandary that’d play on your mind afterwards, consider that it happens within the opening half-hour.</p> <p>Moral murkiness helps preserve the tension across Swansong’s duration. There’s always something at stake – your life, the masquerade, your integrity – and that does a lot to infuse some meaning into all the talking and scouring rooms for notes. I doubt that Swansong is set to become a vampire RPG of legend, like 2004’s Bloodlines, but it nonetheless makes vampires scary again.</p> <ul> <li><p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong is out now; £34.99</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2022/may/26/cps-guidance-worse-for-survivors-victims-commissioner-says","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T10:24:37Z","webTitle":"CPS guidance ‘makes things worse’ for rape survivors, victims’ commissioner says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/26/cps-guidance-worse-for-survivors-victims-commissioner-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/may/26/cps-guidance-worse-for-survivors-victims-commissioner-says","fields":{"headline":"CPS guidance ‘makes things worse’ for rape survivors, victims’ commissioner says","trailText":"Vera Baird calls for therapy notes to be excluded from criminal trials, as they are in Australia","body":"<p>New guidance designed to give rape victims confidence to get therapy before their trial “makes things worse” for survivors and lessened their protections, according to the victims’ commissioner, Vera Baird.</p> <p>The guidance issued by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) aims to “alleviate victim concerns that accessing counselling could damage the prosecution case,” but Baird echoed concerns from campaign groups that they, in fact, reduce protections and called for therapy notes to be excluded from criminal trials, as they are in Australia.</p> <p>Additionally the attorney general, Suella Braverman, has released <a href=\"https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxNkEFuwyAQRU8TdrEIYBwvWHTTa1gYJg4KGSwYkrqnL443lRDioxl485wlWFLezJoKsX2baFvBILxLBCLIrBbIU_BGcDWMehiYN8pfrv2VhTLdMsDThmgoV2BrnWNwlkLCvWMYe8nZ3XiuFQjv3U3fYJAXp5WXs-WSaxBydMe_tvoA6MDAC_KWEJhLzycg7U-xaO5EaznJr5P4buv9fndLenX10UI7QMa9toV_EKVFS5QywnZeACHbWM5LDR5iQCjnhGcfioup1AwstBmF4L3QXHPeD53sLoMax9sgHDRaK8RJ8eciulLnQtY9uobIsrERfiz6bDtK6xpwaWV0h6Xa7IPFT1XDmvaBKgbaJkA7R_CHNjrsf0ROByaBnyyZi-5lr9T1KrTih6Ymo2-3Sja1DcOn1oUmp1_AGfLyB9cgoMc\">guidelines </a>designed to stop intrusive demands for rape victims’ private information during criminal investigations, with the aim of increasing the proportion of rape and sexual assault convictions, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/23/fewer-than-one-in-60-cases-lead-to-charge-in-england-and-wales\">have fallen to historic lows since 2016</a>.</p> <p>The new government guidelines are designed to prevent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/25/revealed-uk-police-demanding-access-data-potential-rape-victims\">mass data collection from rape victims</a>, which is being replaced with a new system that requires a written justification for each request for personal data such as mobile phones, social media conversations and medical and social services records.</p> <p>The CPS has stated that it will not discourage rape or other victims – who are facing record waiting times to get to court – from seeking psychological therapy before a trial starts.</p> <p>It said the material should only be sought when relevant, with police and prosecutors asked to give “very serious consideration as to whether requesting therapy notes represents a reasonable line of inquiry”.</p> <p>The new guidance states: “Any requests for therapy notes must be specific and only sought when necessary. Any unfocused requests to browse patients’ files should not be made. These notes will only be shared with the defence if they contain material capable of undermining the prosecution case or assisting the suspect.”</p> <p>But Baird and campaigners said the new CPS guidance used looser language than previous guidelines, which required prosecutors to request therapy notes only if there was evidence to suggest they would undermine a case. The new guidance states that they can be sought if deemed “relevant”.</p> <p>“The pre-trial therapy guidance is worse than the draft the CPS produced a year ago and does nothing to limit the accessibility of notes,” Baird said.</p> <p>“These are fine words, but the CPS has not looked at this issue with sufficient rigour from the victims’ perspective to make sure that the culture change will go through. In fact, they have fallen back on their conservative approach and used a wider test, which will only make things worse.

And if it doesn’t quite achieve that, settling in the end for something more generically crime-oriented, it’s still very good. Naples looks wonderful here, although very different from the city that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/paolo-sorrentino\">Paolo Sorrentino</a> depicted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/01/the-hand-of-god-review-sorrentino-maradona-italian-film-maker-neapolitan-drama\">The Hand of God</a>. A middle-aged guy comes back to his home town after 40 years away, arriving on a plane from Cairo: this is Felice, played by the craggily expressive Pierfrancesco Favino. A great deal of the film’s opening movement is just Felice walking around, overwhelmed with bittersweet memories that he cannot put into words: the streets, the stores, the churches, the balconies, the kids. (The film uses silent Super 8 flashbacks to make explicit some of what he’s remembering.)</p> <p>Felice makes an emotional visit to his ageing mother, Teresa – a delectably sad portrayal from Aurora Quattrocchi – and is angry to see that she has sold the apartment he grew up in and has moved to a dingy ground-floor flat in what he suspects was a ruinous deal. But mother and son are deeply moved to see each other again and there is a touching scene when Felice takes her tiny naked body in his arms and bathes her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/03/paolo-sorrentino-lets-say-that-almost-everything-is-true\">Paolo Sorrentino: ‘Let’s say that almost everything is true’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there is a hidden wound beneath all this. Felice’s boyhood friend Oreste (Tommaso Ragno), with whom he indulged in petty crime back in the day, is now a much-feared dead-eyed local mobster, and clearly has something to do with Felice leaving his beloved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/naples\">Naples</a> in the first place. Don Luigi, the local priest, played by Francesco Di Leva, is a passionate campaigner against Oreste’s murderous gangsterism, and after reacting angrily to Felice’s secular “confession” that he was this notorious figure’s best friend, begins a subtle plan to flush Oreste out. This involves introducing Felice to all his parishioners (thus inciting the gossip that will get back to Oreste) and even encouraging the non-drinking Felice to take a little wine.</p> <p>Nostalgia is tremendously shot, and terrifically acted by Favino. It challenges the idea of “nostalgia” as broadcast in the title: it isn’t simply that nostalgia is delusional, or that the past wasn’t as great as it appears when viewed through rose-tinted spectacles. It is that there is no past and present. Naples then and Naples now are the same – and for Felice his fears and loves never really went away or even changed that much. A strong, deeply felt, valuable movie.</p> <p>• Nostalgia screened at the Cannes film festival.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/26/birmingham-hockley-flyover-murals-grade-ii-listed-status-william-mitchell","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK

Hockley flyover murals get listed status","trailText":"Artworks by sculptor William Mitchell, designed to encourage public interaction, earn Grade-II accolade","body":"<p>A group of concrete murals on a flyover in Birmingham, known as a “brutalist climbing wall”, have been given listed status.</p> <p>The three-banked mural walls flanking the entrance to the Hockley flyover underpass feature geometric shapes and abstract patterns and were designed by the sculptor William Mitchell to encourage public interaction.</p> <p>They recently attracted attention when climbers from the University of Birmingham mountaineering clubs plotted bouldering routes across the structures.</p> <p>After an application by the Twentieth Century Society, the murals have been listed at Grade II by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on the advice of Historic England.</p> <p>Mitchell, who died in 2020 aged 94, had described Hockley flyover as “one of the greatest things that ever happened in this country because it was the first of its kind and certainly of its scale”.</p> <p>Louise Brennan, the Midlands regional director at Historic England, said: “The murals at Hockley Circus are among the best examples of William Mitchell’s work and showcase his playful and lively style to great effect.”</p> <p>Two public artworks in Stevenage have also been given Grade II-listed status.</p> <p>The first is a colourful tiled mural by the Hungarian-born artist Gyula Bajo at the former Co-operative House, the first large retail premises to open in Stevenage town centre, in June 1958.</p> <p>It is the earliest of four large, surviving murals by the Co-op group from the 50s and 60s, and depicts the “four cornerstones of a balanced economy – industry, commerce, transport and agriculture”.</p> <p>A two-part sculptural wall mural at Park Place underpass in Stevenage, called Scenes Of Contemporary Life, has also been given Grade II status.</p> <p>Designed by Mitchell, it depicts social, political and cultural events of the day, including a US air force space rocket and cosmonauts in a Soviet landing capsule, alongside scenes of everyday life in Stevenage.</p>  <figure class=\"element

Century Society said it welcomed the mural listings but had concerns that proposed regeneration plans for Stevenage New Town would see a number of important buildings demolished or drastically altered, and would risk “undermining the coherence and integrity of the historic town centre”.</p> <p>The heritage minister Nigel Huddleston said: “These three iconic public artworks are seen and enjoyed by thousands of people every day, bringing the arts to everyone.</p> <p>“It is fantastic that these works have been listed in recognition of the important contribution they make to their local area and to protect them for the future.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/may/26/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-57","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life

A big one. More than 45 million Americans – more than the population of California – now owe a collective $1.7tn in student debt.</p> <p>What to do about that debt has become a hot political issues as midterm elections approach.</p> <p>The vast majority of the money is owed to the federal government, which has been backing or directly offering student loans for higher education since 1958. While student loans are not new in the United States, the amount of student debt has doubled over the last 16 years.</p> <p>The Biden administration has recently <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-weighing-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-income-cap-under-125k-2022-5\">hinted</a> that some form of student debt forgiveness could be announced soon – specifically, canceling at least $10,000 in student debt for Americans earning less than $125,000 a year. With that threshold, most student loan borrowers will qualify for some debt forgiveness.</p> <p>If the executive action is undertaken, it will be the first large debt cancellation by the federal government to address the student debt crisis. Understanding the impact of such a dramatic policy requires unpacking the student debt crisis, beginning with its origins.</p> <h2>How the student debt crisis started</h2> <p>In 1957 the Soviet Union successfully launching the first earth-orbiting satellite, Sputnik. With the cold war raging the federal government feared the US education system was failing to produce enough scientists and engineers to compete with the Soviets and, in 1958, started handing out student loans through the <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Sputnik_Spurs_Passage_of_National_Defense_Education_Act.htm\">National Defense Education Act.</a></p> <p>Nearly a decade later, the Higher Education Act of 1965 allowed more people to take out loans as the federal government promised to pay back banks for any loans that were not repaid.</p> <p>“It all started from this choice, which I think was a terrible choice, to decide that as a policy matter we should support higher education … by giving [students] an opportunity to get a loan,” said Dalié Jimenez, professor of law and director of the Student Loan Law Initiative at the University of California at Irvine. “It was just a terrible mistake.”</p> <p>Starting in 2010, the federal government started directly lending money to student borrowers. In the wake of the Great Recession, the amount of student debt began to increase rapidly. Colleges were seeing increased enrollment as people left the workforce to go back to school. States slashed their higher education budgets, leading to higher tuition. More students were turning to for-profit colleges, which tend to be more expensive than public colleges.</p> <p>Over the last few years, the amount of grant aid, which does not need to be paid back, has risen. Yet despite this appearance of more financial support for students to attend college, the cost of attendance has remained the same.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/archive-zip/giv-65623C7g8Ap6cBym/\" data-alt=\"Two line charts comparing the gap between the listed price and what it actually costs to attend public and non-profit private institutions.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/archive-zip/giv-65623C7g8Ap6cBym/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The cost of attending public college has actually increased at a higher rate than the cost to attend a private college. The net cost of attendance for four-year public colleges, which takes into account any grants students receive, went from $17,500 in 2006 to $20,210 in 2016, according to <a href=\"https://research.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/trends-college-pricing-student-aid-2021.pdf\">data</a> from College Board.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/archive-zip/giv-6562C6jWLlfyiwLr/\" data-alt=\"Line chart of the costs of public and private non-profit increasing and then slightly decreasing from 2006-07 to 2020-21 school years.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/archive-zip/giv-6562C6jWLlfyiwLr/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“That era 10 years ago was a really formative moment for producing a lot of debt that’s still out there,” said Kevin Miller, associate director for higher education at the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Economic Policy Project. “The cost of college attendance has gone up a lot while household incomes in the United States haven’t … there’s a real sense that if grant, state or institutional aid isn’t filling the gap, that just leaves debt as the only option.”</p> <h2>What student debt looks like today</h2> <p>For the 2021-2022 school year, the average cost of tuition and fees for a four-year public college is $10,740. The cost is nearly quadrupled for private institutions, at an average of $38,070. Even with grant aid, the cost of attendance is an average of $19,230 for public institutions and $32,720 at private schools.</p> <p><a href=\"https://ticas.org/affordability-2/student-aid/student-debt-student-aid/report-class-of-2019-four-year-graduates-average-student-debt-is-28950/\">Estimates</a> put the average debt of those in the class of 2019 who took out student loans at $28,950. The number is close to the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized\">maximum</a> $31,000 that students who are dependents of parents or guardians can borrow from the federal government to fund undergraduate education.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/archive-zip/giv-6562ZRfyToqzFcMp/\" data-alt=\"Area chart of student debt increasing from Q1 2006 to Q1 2022.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/archive-zip/giv-6562ZRfyToqzFcMp/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Continuing racial wealth disparities are reflected in who has to take out loans to fund college. About <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-by-race\">half</a> of Black college students take out student loans, compared with 40% of white students. Black Americans owe an average of $25,000 more in debt than their white counterparts and are more likely to be <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2021-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2020-student-loans.htm\">behind</a> on their payments.</p> <p>Despite the amount of debt many students need to take on to attend college, nearly 20 million Americans still enroll in college every year. While earnings can depend on a person’s industry, those with a bachelor’s degrees <a href=\"https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/collegepayoff2021/#resources\">earn</a> 75% more in their lifetime than those with just a high school diploma.</p> <p>“The message is you have to get a college degree. It’s not just a rhetorical message, it’s an actual truth that if you don’t have a college degree, particularly if you are Black or brown … you will not be able to get a job that is better than your parents,” Jimenez said.</p> <p>Those with graduate and professional degrees earn even more, but the price for an advanced degree is even higher. A good chunk of student debt – <a href=\"https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics\">about 40%</a> – is held by those who took out loans to pay for graduate school.</p> <h2>What the government has done to address student debt</h2> <p>The most substantial policy addressing student debt was first implemented by the Trump administration, which paused student loan payments and interest accrual at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Both Trump and Biden extended the pause over the last two years, and it is now set to expire on 31 August.</p> <p>Since the beginning of this year, Biden has announced a slate of additional policies alongside the pause extension. Those who have defaulted or are delinquent on their federal student loans will be <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/06/statement-by-president-biden-extending-the-pause-on-student-loan-repayment-through-august-31st-2022/\">returned</a> to good standing. Biden <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/17/education-department-forgives-415-million-in-private-student-debt-.html\">forgave</a> $415m in student debt for borrowers who attended predatory for-profit schools.</p> <p>His administration also <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/06/statement-by-president-biden-extending-the-pause-on-student-loan-repayment-through-august-31st-2022/\">announced</a> changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which forgives the student loans of borrowers who are non-profit and government employees after 10 years of debt or after 120 payments are made. Over 113,000 borrowers with a cumulative $6.8bn in debt are now eligible for forgiveness. Over the years, the program has been under much criticism, as relief through the program was rare and borrowers were often deemed not qualified for logistical reasons.</p> <h2>The debate over debt forgiveness</h2> <p>Even as it seems Biden is prepared to cancel some debt, the idea has gotten some criticism over the last few months.</p> <p>Republicans have been using student debt as a talking point against Biden as the midterm elections start rolling.</p> <p>Senator Mitt Romney suggested that Democrats canceling student loans is a way of bribing voters. “Other bribe suggestions: Forgive auto loans? Forgive credit card debt? Forgive mortgages?” he wrote on Twitter. JD Vance (who went to Yale Law School) told the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/15/biden-student-loan-forgive-cancel/\">Washington Post</a> that “Biden essentially wants blue-collar workers like truck drivers – who didn’t have the luxury of going to college to get drunk for four years – to bail out a bunch of upper-middle-class kids.”</p> <p>The reality is that the student loans of those in the highest income quartile – people making more than $97,000 – do <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/which-households-hold-most-student-debt\">make up a third</a> of all outstanding student debt. But many low-income Americans also have student debt, though the amount of debt they have is smaller. Those making below $27,000 a year make up 17% of all borrowers, but their loans comprise 12% of all the outstanding debt.</p> <p>An income threshold could be a way for the government to target forgiveness to those who need it most. But some have pointed out that an income ceiling does not take into consideration a person’s wealth.</p> <p>“You’re looking at a snapshot of what your income was this year or last year, that tells you very little,” Jimenez said. “If your family has no wealth, you’re very differently situated from someone who has family wealth or personal wealth from previous careers.”</p> <p>Those who have been advocating for student debt cancellation say that $10,000 in forgiveness will not be enough to address the breadth of the crisis. Democratic lawmakers, including Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have called on Biden to cancel up to $50,000.</p> <p>“I don’t believe in a cutoff, especially for so many of the frontline workers who are drowning in debt and would likely be excluded from relief,” Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post. “Canceling $50,000 in debt is where you really make a dent in inequality and the racial gap. $10,000 isn’t.”</p> <h2>Ending the student debt crisis for good</h2> <p>Even if Biden forgives some student debt, future college students will continue to take out loans – and at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/05/06/1096884527/beware-new-student-loan-borrowers-interest-rates-are-about-to-jump\">higher interest rates</a>. Tackling the price tag of college will come with its own complications, but advocates say it will be necessary to ensure student debt does not get worse.</p> <p>While Biden’s plan for free community college was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/08/joe-manchin-build-back-better-biden\">killed</a> along with the rest of the social and climate spending bill that was making its way through Congress, some efforts for better college funding are happening at the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/03/05/tuition-free-college-states/\">local level</a>.</p> <p>In March, the governor of New Mexico signed a bill that would use $75m in state funds to cover tuition and fees for undergraduate students at two- and four-year colleges. Drives for similar government support have been seen in <a href=\"https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/04/leader-of-pa-state-universities-sees-movement-toward-free-college-as-way-to-fill-talent-gap.html\">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/education/2022/04/uc-cal-state-middle-class-scholarship/\">California</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wmtw.com/article/community-college-will-be-free-for-some-maine-students/39790199\">Maine</a>.</p> <p>“The cost of college is too high for a lot of students to manage without debt. Making it so that students can go without debt or take less debt in the first place is the thing that we really need to be focusing on,” Miller said. “What about the next generation or the one after that?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2022/may/26/bitter-orange-tree-by-jokha-alharthi-review-a-life-far-from-home","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"Bitter Orange Tree by Jokha Alharthi review – a life far from home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/26/bitter-orange-tree-by-jokha-alharthi-review-a-life-far-from-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/may/26/bitter-orange-tree-by-jokha-alharthi-review-a-life-far-from-home","fields":{"headline":"Bitter Orange Tree by Jokha Alharthi review – a life far from home","trailText":"In the followup to the International Booker winner Celestial Bodies, a student reflects on her roots in Oman","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/02/celestial-bodies-jokha-alharthi-review\" title=\"\">Celestial Bodies</a>, Jokha Alharthi’s second novel, used four generations of a family in the Gulf state of Oman to gauge breakneck social transformations after the discovery of oil in the 1960s.

Isolated in an alien tongue, or as she awkwardly expresses it, “bound to a wheelchair that was language’s incapacity to fully express me”, she fears turning into her mother, whose postnatal depression was never dispelled.</p> <p>Zuhour retraces the bonds to her homeland, reimagining the life of Bint Aamir, a distant poor relation who cared for Zuhour’s father, and later his children. In the most engaging passages, this grandmother’s spirit, with her scent of “civet musk, precious aloeswood oil, and ancient soil”, emerges in vivid anecdotes. Rebuffing a predatory shopkeeper’s advances, she is a girl with one unsighted eye who toils with the charcoal-makers. She saves up for a fruitless trip on a Bedford truck to consult a missionary doctor, at a time when villagers needed the colonial governor’s permission to venture to Muscat.</p> <p>Through Bint Aamir’s expulsion from her father’s home, and her thwarted dreams of owning an orchard, the novel evokes a history of hunger and sickness after the world wars, when wells dried up and villages emptied. The devastating toll of emigration – a theme shared with Cities of Salt (1984-89), the trenchantly satirical cycle of novels on the rise of an oil-rich desert kingdom by the late Saudi-Jordanian writer Abdelrahman Munif – is here exemplified by Shaykha, a neighbour with dementia who trudges half-naked through the narrow lanes searching for a son who departed 40 years earlier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Zuhour’s spooling memories of Oman are interspersed with new student friendships, with the vegan American Christine and two Pakistani sisters. Suroor, with “jet-black hair rippling down her back and a dazzling smile”, was “born in her father’s luxurious villa in Karachi, speaking nothing but English all of her carefree life”. Failing to rise above cliche, her privilege and snobbery are deployed as a crude foil to Bint Aamir’s deprivation. Suroor’s sister Kuhl and Kuhl’s lover Imran, a Pakistani peasant turned scholarship boy whom her family would deem unsuitable, furnish the central plot. When the couple contract a secret mutaa marriage – a temporary liaison deployed more subversively in Hanan al-Shaykh’s 2018 novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/27/the-occasional-virgin-by-hanan-al-shaykh\" title=\"\">The Occasional Virgin</a> – Zuhour’s interest grows, signposting an incipient love triangle.</p> <p>The narrator’s claim to know Imran better than his lover by virtue of her own vicarious acquaintance with poverty – “my grandmother would have given anything to be a peasant farmer” – is never challenged or qualified. Rather, Zuhour, who “made the imaginary my life”, assumes an authorial omniscience. When she comments on the lovers’ disparate backgrounds that “the weave of his trousers was not spun along with the weave of her skirt, and so it all unravelled”, the distance between author and narrator dissolves, and with it, the tension in the plot.</p> <p>At times, the narrator’s projected emotions risk obscuring their object. The tale of Bint Aamir’s lost suitor is eloquent enough. But a chapter entitled “The Virgin” risks sentimentalising the putative tragic spinster, who “left the world as she lived it … without a beloved to hold her close … and never having had children who came out of her own body”. Kuhl’s mother, a Londoner with frustrated ambitions in the theatre, reluctantly accepted the “sanctified status of mother” to gain authority in her husband’s family. Yet overwrought prose reinforces conventional attitudes to womanhood questioned elsewhere.</p> <p>The global allusions are as unconvincing. Imran is said, vaguely, to return to his “village without a name in his Pakistani hinterland”. Zuhour imagines the “child he had been. Barefoot and hungry, coming out of his mud-brick home at dawn.” When an Omani moves to “the Congo”, his “tiger-hunting expeditions” in the Congolese rainforest might be construed as myth in their misapprehension of African fauna.</p> <p>Zuhour’s “agony of regret and remorse” over Bint Aamir is compounded by sorrow at the fate of her own sister, Sumayya, a “dynamo” stilled by a brutal husband. Yet, like several other episodes in this uneven novel, Sumayya’s numb revenge at an Omani beauty spot appears to be a fine short story poorly integrated into the whole.</p> <p><em>• </em>Bitter Orange Tree by Jokha Alharthi, translated by Marilyn Booth, is published by Scribner (£14.99).

Set up camp along the broad sandy banks of the Ribeira de Aljezur as it makes its sweeping escape into the Atlantic. An idyllic stroll westward takes you from tranquil cliffside curves out into the roaring force of the Atlantic – a surfer’s dream. But the greatest pleasure is the river itself – hop in and let the water gently carry you on a lazy river like no other.<br><strong>Robin Dear</strong></p> \n<h2>White sand alcove, south of Lisbon</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62f1907ea90974d60345f42f51efa6c1560de235\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62f1907ea90974d60345f42f51efa6c1560de235/0_15_5560_3336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portinho da Arrabida\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>My favourite beach in the world is <a href=\"https://www.travel-in-portugal.com/beaches/portinho-da-arrabida.htm\">Portinho da Arrábida</a> near Setúbal.

Its relative inaccessibility has protected it so far from overcrowding. To reach it you pass through some truly beautiful hilly green scenery. The beach is of fine white sand and there’s a desert island about 200 metres offshore to swim to. It’s best in May and June, out of the holiday season. <br><strong>Pedro Santos</strong></p> \n<h2>Dramatic cliffs, near Sintra</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5c1419bc5020e38575d88bfcf2f7d75794dc5da5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c1419bc5020e38575d88bfcf2f7d75794dc5da5/0_380_5696_3417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Praia da Adraga\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>We love <a href=\"https://www.lisbonbeachesguide.com/sintra/praia-da-adraga-beach.html\">Praia da Adraga</a> on the Atlantic coast, 19km north of Cascais, and easily accessible (by car) from historic Sintra. It’s a wonderful place to escape the summer crowds. Somewhat more sheltered than nearby <a href=\"https://lisbonlisboaportugal.com/lisbon-beaches/Praia-Guincho-beach-lisbon.html\">Guincho</a>, yet still great for surfers, it combines dramatic cliff scenery and golden sands studded with black volcanic rock formations reminiscent of semi-submerged dragons.

A family I was staying with drove me there to show me the benefits of not heading for beaches too near the capital. It’s not usually crowded and has a lovely stretch of white sand curving round a sheltered turquoise sea where you can swim easily. There is even a small library on a rustic terrace where visitors of all nationalities can leave or take beach books, often novels that have been read while sunbathing. Try the seafood at the casual restaurant <a href=\"https://comporta.biz/restaurants/dinis-carvalhal-beach/\">Dinis</a>: it’s run by a fisherman and barefoot waiters will serve you octopus salad and crisp white wines on the beach.<br><strong>Greta</strong></p> \n<h2>Take the train to the beach, west of Lisbon</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.portugalvisitor.com/portugal-travel/linha-cascais\">Linha de Cascais</a> is the train line running along the coast from Lisbon to Cascais. Any beach along here is worth visiting but my favourite is <a href=\"https://www.travel-in-portugal.com/beaches/praia-das-avencas.htm\">Praia das Avencas</a> near Parede station. Named for the medicinal avenca plant (an evergreen fern) that grows there, the beach is tucked away under the cliffs, which providie welcome respite from the afternoon winds. Designated an area of biodiversity, the small beach is a favourite among snorkelers but often goes unnoticed by tourists.

One that I find is overlooked by most tourists is <a href=\"https://www.visitmadeira.com/pt-pt/explorar/detalhe/praia-do-garajau\">Praia de Garajau</a>, on the south coast and backed by huge cliffs. The only way you can access the beach is either by cable car or a long walk down a winding road. Once down there, Garajau offers tranquil views with breathtaking blue waters contrasted against the grey stone beach. It’s also a natural marine reserve with a vast number of fish species.<br><strong>Jonathan Bernardino</strong></p> \n<h2>Surfing for doughnuts, western Algarve</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b14705f41851200a0cc79add8c6c529840d29dc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b14705f41851200a0cc79add8c6c529840d29dc/0_113_5886_3532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Praia do Amado\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.visitalgarve.pt/en/2124/praia-do-amado.aspx\">Praia do Amado</a> is a stunning beach in the western Algarve, a 40-minute drive from the popular city of Lagos.

I visited with some Italian friends while doing an EU Erasmus-funded placement in Seville. Olhão is easy to reach being near Faro, but you can only get to the island via a few ferry crossings a day, and with no cars on the island, you feel totally cut off from the world. A boardwalk leads to beaches that are wide, windy and deserted. We pottered around on the sand and collected clams, which my friends later cooked with garlic and pasta. You can stay in pastel-coloured beach huts facing the Atlantic, and eat incredible stews with vinho verde at the handful of restaurants.

Even the bin store has a living roof.</p> <p>Now, the front garden is left to its own devices and is a bountiful haven for birds, small mammals and insects. And I don’t need to mow it!

The insects attract many birds too, bringing even more life to what was once a dull piece of lawn. <br><strong>Ros Page, retired civil servant, Oxfordshire </strong></p> <h2>‘The cats liked playing jungle’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ac637c069953f560a70c72c2919d68dd1e8498a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ac637c069953f560a70c72c2919d68dd1e8498a/0_10_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Burgess’s cat Deedee.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Burgess’s cat Deedee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Burgess/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After I stopped mowing, there was a parade of flowers, buttercups, creeping charlie, dandelions and clover. It got to over half a metre high in some places, so I cut the middle of the lawn but left the edges wild all summer. In the end it was nearly a metre high, with amazing wild grasses and flocks of butterflies everywhere.</p> <p>The cats liked wandering along the little paths I made and playing jungle. Luckily they don’t hunt. Towards the end of the summer, I attacked everything with the lawnmower, but I only have a small mower and it choked up in a couple of minutes. So I had to get some garden clippers to cut it all by hand. The clippers were blunt so in the end I resorted to scissors. I am not sure cutting a long lawn with a pair of scissors is the right look for an experienced gardener, but was a lot of fun. <br><strong>Jo Burgess, 64, entertainment agent, Exminster, Devon </strong></p> <h2>‘We were blessed with this beautiful carpet of daisies’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"447ca47efeaf43ba1699edcc55e38305b1b9fb2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/447ca47efeaf43ba1699edcc55e38305b1b9fb2f/0_0_2854_3806/750.jpg\" alt=\"Jemima Harrison’s garden.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jemima Harrison’s garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jemima Harrison/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We have left our front lawn to its own devices over the past few weeks and were blessed with this beautiful carpet of daisies.

If detected early, it can be treated and managed.</p> \n<p>It is one of the <a href=\"https://goldcopd.org/2022-gold-reports-2/\">top three causes of death worldwide, and 90% of deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries</a>. Globally, there are 3 million deaths a year from COPD but this number is expected to rise to 5.4 million by 2060, according to the <a href=\"https://goldcopd.org/2022-gold-reports-2/\">latest report from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50e10dc6e75020190a2d2ed62ed7cdea6b2bfb8c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50e10dc6e75020190a2d2ed62ed7cdea6b2bfb8c/0_0_3240_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The National Center of Cardiology and Internal Medicine in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The National Center of Cardiology and Internal Medicine in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danil Usmanov/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“In Kyrgyzstan, COPD is a very serious problem,” says Prof Talant Sooronbaev, director of the National Centre of Cardiology and Internal Medicine, located in Bishkek, the capital city.

These illnesses end the lives of approximately 41 million of the 56 million people who die every year – and three quarters of them are in the developing world.</p>\n    <p>NCDs are simply that; unlike, say, a virus, you can’t catch them. Instead, they are caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types are cancers, chronic respiratory illnesses, diabetes and cardiovascular disease – heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 80% are preventable, and all are on the rise, spreading inexorably around the world as ageing populations and lifestyles pushed by economic growth and urbanisation make being unhealthy a global phenomenon.</p>\n    <p>NCDs, once seen as illnesses of the wealthy, now have a grip on the poor. Disease, disability and death are perfectly designed to create and widen inequality – and being poor makes it less likely you will be diagnosed accurately or treated.</p>\n    <p>Investment in tackling these common and chronic conditions that kill 71% of us is incredibly low, while the cost to families, economies and communities is staggeringly high.</p>\n    <p>In low income countries NCDs – typically slow and debilitating illnesses – are seeing a fraction of the money needed being invested or donated. Attention remains focused on the traditional disease threats, yet cancer death rates have long sped past the death toll from malaria, TB and HIV/ Aids combined.</p>\n    <p>A common condition is a new Guardian series reporting on NCDs in the developing world; their prevalence, the solutions, the causes and consequences, telling the stories of people living with these illnesses.</p>\n    <p><b>Tracy McVeigh, editor</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"73a5c30b6fc5a151d01c1ac3dde01b7ce938c692\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73a5c30b6fc5a151d01c1ac3dde01b7ce938c692/0_0_2160_3240/667.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Talant Sooronbaev\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Talant Sooronbaev</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danil Usmanov/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“We have patients who don’t understand why they have a cough, or problems with breathlessness.

Sooronbaev says the country has more than 500,000 smokers, and there is widespread indoor pollution caused by people in mountainous and remote regions heating their homes with wood, dung or coal during long and harsh winters.</p> \n<p>Sooronbaev decided to act. Treatment for COPD in many countries involves prescribing oxygen, inhalers and antibiotics, which patients have to buy. In Kyrgyzstan this can cost more than a monthly salary. Sooronbaev and his team started experimenting with pulmonary rehabilitation, a physical exercise programme designed in 2016 for people with lung conditions, as part of an <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/en/projects/success-stories/all/breath-fresh-air-tackling-lung-diseases\">EU-funded research project called Fresh Air</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I didn’t believe it would work.

Now it is being adopted by Kyrgyzstan’s health ministry, and is already in place in three hospitals and two GP surgeries. It runs for six weeks, with a couple of two-hour sessions a week. Added to lectures, dietary information and patient support groups is a regime of physical exercise incorporating elements of volleyball – which is popular in Kyrgyzstan – walking, cycling on exercise bikes, and dance. The idea is that patients can continue with what they are taught afterwards at home.</p> \n<p>Dr Azamat Akylbekov, a pulmonologist in Bishkek, has seen the transformative effect. “I remember one woman who was 63,” he says. “She cried because she had severe shortness of breath, coughed all the time, was dependent on oxygen, and took a lot of strong antibiotics and inhalers. She was really depressed.”</p> \n<p>She was invited to take part in the programme and the results surprised him. “Afterwards, she was like a flower – she smiled and her body language was more active.

This year is being pushed as the centenary of modernism, since The Waste Land and Ulysses were both published in 1922. But Edvard Munch had TS Eliot and James Joyce beat. In 1892, Munch painted the first modernist masterpiece of the city, anticipating their radical visions of urban life by a full three decades. Now that masterpiece, Evening on Karl Johan, has come to Britain as part of a precious loan of incendiary Munchs from a collection in Bergen, Norway.</p> <p>These people really need to work from home. They come towards us at the close of day, their faces harrowed by the misery of the office or factory. They are ghoulish grey cartoons of loneliness and sadness lit by yellow glowing windows. A woman stares out with white circles for eyes, her pupils shrunk to dots, while a man in a funereal top hat has a shrunken skull-like face, as if modern life has reduced him to one of the walking dead. In fact, they are all workaday zombies, their bodies stunted, their pace robotic, approaching in a single mummified mass.</p> <p>This is the very alienation Eliot would put into words 30 years later: “A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, / I had not thought death had undone so many. / Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, / And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.” Evening on Karl Johan prophesies the 20th-century city of lonely crowds trudging hopelessly between nowhere and nothing.</p> <p>If being first means being the best, Munch deserves the title of the first true modernist, making this the movement’s 130th anniversary rather than its 100th. But that is just one way to judge art. What marks out Munch is the authenticity of the pain. Raw as Evening on Karl Johan is, it’s eclipsed by the painting next to it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5db7ae7954d5c18fac136a09445a6f83f2fb51b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5db7ae7954d5c18fac136a09445a6f83f2fb51b/93_100_8333_6165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Life has been stolen from them … At the Deathbed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"740\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life has been stolen from them … By the Deathbed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dag Fosse/Kode</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the Deathbed portrays people standing over a child’s motionless body. Their agony is so complete there is hardly anything left of them. The woman closest to us has a mask of whiteness, like a bandage, over her face, leaving just little patches of pink around her eyes. Her features have been destroyed by her loss. Another woman has already gone further, her face just a pale cartoon with dot-eyes. All we can see of the departed is a small thin form under the sheets with lank brown hair. But we see death in the mourners’ black-clad forms. It has entered every fibre of their being. Life has been stolen from them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Munch’s creamy brown and violet sky, above a dead purple sea, expresses the young man's mood perfectly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was stolen from Munch as a child, too. This painting remembers the devastating loss of his favourite sister Sophie from tuberculosis, which had already killed his mother. Grief infected how he saw life. TS Eliot’s protagonist in The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock admits he was “not Prince Hamlet” – but the young man in Munch’s painting Melancholy clearly resembles the tragic Scandinavian hero as he broods by the shore, his head resting on his hand in a medieval symbol of melancholia that is as old as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2012/aug/03/lewis-chessmen-harry-potter-british-art\">Lewis Chessmen</a>. Munch’s creamy brown and violet sky above a dead purple sea lets you feel his mood for yourself.</p> <p>That is why it is so special to see Munch’s paintings up close, as opposed to his prints. This show may be modestly scaled, with just 18 paintings, but that is a lot of Munch on canvas – and in this perfectly lit, perfectly spaced exhibition you can get not just an eyeful but a soulful of the ecstatic sorrow of his colours. Munch wallows gloriously in his pain. All that melancholy spills out in his luxurious feel for paint. Among the dark green woods in his huge 1894 canvas Woman in Three Stages is what looks like a big bloodstain: he has hurled red paint at the canvas to create this gash of horror. Or at least that’s what I’m assuming happened. Perhaps they should test to see if it’s blood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b57767f3eb494a0b8c0e2b186124131b3a45fa99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b57767f3eb494a0b8c0e2b186124131b3a45fa99/73_71_8342_5459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A luxurious feel for paint … Munch’s Woman in Three Stages.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A luxurious feel for paint … Munch’s Woman in Three Stages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dag Fosse/Kode</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As if the overpowering sense of grief wasn’t enough, Munch’s art unashamedly confesses to massive sexual hangups. There’s a young man to the right of this work, brooding beside three images of women: one is a dreamer by the shore, another walks wraith-like in the woods, and in the very middle stands a tall naked woman with her head cocked in sexual challenge. You’d think Munch’s male alter ego would be pleased but he looks wretched. And in Man and Woman, a naked man has his head lowered in despair as he helplessly sits facing his nude girlfriend. This bedroom scene is nothing if not unmanning. Munch clearly identifies with this male ego crushed into impotence by the woman’s nudity. How many artists have been this frank?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/26/walter-sickert-review-serial-killer-tate-britain-london-show-women-victorian-painter\">Walter Sickert review – serial killer, fantasist or self-hater? This hellish, brilliant show only leaves questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This exhibition shows how Munch leapt from lovely 1880s post-impressionist scenes – including a portrait of his sister Inger by a misty sea – to his intense, abstract <em>fin de siècle</em> images of unveiled emotion, so extreme it seems he is missing a skin. Self-Portrait in the Clinic, painted in 1909, shows why he could not go on like that. Munch’s most expressive period was bought at the expense of traumatic love affairs and alcoholism. In 1908, he had a breakdown and entered a “nerve clinic”. This painting shows him in recovery: at first sight it may seem a more formal work, with Munch adopting a respectable, serious pose, but then you realise he is actually painting himself trying on this pose, in the uneasy hope he can maintain it from now on.

But it’s tough for referees to develop when there’s much more incentive for them to quit than there is for them to stick with it and improve. </p> <p>It’s a simple spiral. Referees drop out of the sport, especially after discovering the joys of extra free-time during the pandemic. Less experienced referees fill their spots. Coaches, players and parents harass and abuse the less experienced referees. Then <em>those </em>referees quit. And then the pool of referees drifting upwards to the top level is that much smaller.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/oct/30/using-artificial-intelligence-to-rule-on-handball-is-a-tantalising-possibility\">Using artificial intelligence to rule on handball is a tantalising possibility | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The story is familiar to players in England, where some semi-professional games are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/when-saturday-comes-blog/2022/jan/13/footballers-need-to-show-referees-some-respect-we-are-in-short-supply\">going forward with teenagers</a> and some games below that level have no officials at all. In the US, the shortages are rampant at youth level and can even reach up to MLS Next, Major League Soccer’s academy program, for which some grassroots referees in Virginia have seen urgent calls for help. </p> <p>In Utah, the state youth association had reached the point of canceling 570 matches and rescheduling more than 1,000 in one season. They sent out an email trying to drum up interest in referee certification. The response was telling. </p> <p>“We were flooded with responses stating they would never register as referees or allow their children to register because they’ve seen how horrible the treatment of referees has been, and they refuse to be subjected to it,” said Jen Rader, the Utah association’s marketing and media manager.</p> <p>The response: A <a href=\"https://www.utahyouthsoccer.net/blog/oygbhz5lpk3suvgawms3kwi4kvh7pe?fbclid=IwAR0eGBTHHoh7smIDHdgdBN3qlf4WX48ATytdtl6_jrNg4TL94L079Hn0Ezg\">”zero tolerance” policy</a> on complaining to referees. The name is more draconian than the actual policy, which recognizes the reality of heated competition. </p> <p>“Exclamations in the moment are part of the game,” <a href=\"https://www.utahyouthsoccer.net/blog/oygbhz5lpk3suvgawms3kwi4kvh7pe?fbclid=IwAR0eGBTHHoh7smIDHdgdBN3qlf4WX48ATytdtl6_jrNg4TL94L079Hn0Ezg\">the policy states</a>. “A ‘handball’ or ‘offside’ as an immediate response to a situation is more than acceptable so long as that exclamation ends there.”</p> <p>Coaches and players can still speak respectfully with refs. And if things are unresolved, there’s a complaint procedure that takes place electronically, not with a barracuda parent going after a terrified teenager.</p> <p>To an extent, referee shortages aren’t new. Wisconsin’s youth association instituted <a href=\"https://www.wiyouthsoccer.com/assets/75/6/zero_tolerance_policy_approved.pdf\">its own zero tolerance policy</a> in 2015, citing a “persistent shortage of referees.” The most recognizable referee in recent history, the imposing Pierluigi Collina, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-fifa-collina/collina-calls-for-steps-against-abuse-towards-referees-idUSKBN16U0SM\">warned in 2017</a> that soccer may face a global shortage of referees. The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), which oversees all US scholastic sports, <a href=\"https://www.nfhs.org/articles/nfhs-launches-national-officials-recruitment-campaign/\">launched a recruitment drive</a> in 2017.</p> <p>But the pandemic has worsened the situation. The US is dealing with labor shortages in many fields, all part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/great-resignation-quitting-us-unemployment-economy\">what has been called the Great Resignation</a>, and refereeing is no exception. Spending weekends somewhere other than a soccer field has proven alluring for some, especially when players apparently have pent-up frustration to unleash.</p> <p>“Since the pandemic, I have seen more heated parents, coaches and players than usual,” said Janet Campbell, who chairs referee abuse and assault hearings for North Texas Soccer. “They need to settle down and let the children play the game and let the referees do their jobs. They don’t seem to understand that you have to have referees to play the game.”</p> <p>And the NFHS, five years after launching that recruitment drive, has had to <a href=\"https://www.nfhs.org/articles/with-loss-of-50-000-officials-nfhs-organizes-consortium-to-find-solutions/\">redouble its efforts</a> after seeing referee numbers drop from about 240,000 to 200,000 in three years. </p> <p>Wisconsin is now offering financial incentives – paying for certification and uniforms for new refs, then raising game fees paid to referees in fall 2022 – in addition to beefing up its zero tolerance enforcement.</p> <p>“Zero tolerance policies continue to be enforced and we are also taking steps to be more transparent back to referees and referee leadership of suspensions and sanctions that have been assessed to show the association is working to curb behavioral issues,” said Brandon Wachholz, Wisconsin’s youth referee administrator.</p> <p>Another factor feeding the frenzy on the sidelines – the US now has no shortage of games on television, which means parents and players witness (and are perhaps tempted to emulate) pundits and the professionals dissenting referees’ decisions. </p> <p>And to be sure, sometimes the critics have a point. Though <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wb5T5clApCU?t=7140\">Kyle’s rant of nearly three minutes</a> over what was, at worst, a simple mistake was over the top, NWSL fans can’t be faulted for complaining about a few institutional issues. Namely:</p> <ul> <li><p>The Professional Referee Organization (PRO) assigns NWSL games to Tier B and Tier C referees in <a href=\"http://proreferees.com/pro2/the-pro2-ladder/\">their development ladder,</a> multiple tiers below MLS. </p></li> <li><p>The league lacks VAR, which might have shed some light on the incident Kyle decried as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EqualizerSoccer/status/1523008583641706496\">a horror tackle</a>, committed by Washington’s Sam Staab, of which the referee didn’t have a clear view – screened, as is so often the case even with top-notch referees, by the defender trailing back to catch the attacker. </p></li> <li><p>MLS has some transparency via a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/instantreplay\">weekly YouTube review</a>, while PRO offers a weekly behind-the-scenes look at <a href=\"http://proreferees.com/category/education/inside-video-review/\">VAR in MLS</a>. </p></li> <li><p>Refs assigned to the league also have a curious aversion to red cards – in 2018, Carli Lloyd and Marta were <a href=\"https://fbref.com/en/comps/182/2945/stats/2018-NWSL-Stats\">the only players</a> to be sent off.</p></li> </ul> <p>Kyle also happened to be on the field for one of the most controversial games in recent international play – a 2012 Olympic semi-final in which her Canadian team suffered two dubious calls in quick succession that allowed the US to get back into the game and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/06/london-2012-canada-usa-womens-football\">eventually march on to the final</a>. That game still elicits <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/an-oral-history-soccer/article24914992/\">strong feelings in Canada</a>. It was also the <a href=\"https://www.worldfootball.net/referee_summary/christina-pedersen/1/1/\">last major international game</a> officiated by Norway’s Christina Pedersen, who was just 31 at the time. By <a href=\"https://www.socceramerica.com/publications/article/47658/sorry-canada-the-ref-was-right.html\">the letter of the law</a>, she didn’t even make mistakes – she simply made decisions that aren’t usually made. Fifa and Uefa aren’t prone to announcing that a referee has been removed from the public arena, but whether her disappearance was their decision or Pedersen’s, those two calls were clearly pivotal.</p> <p>Pedersen’s exit from the international stage also proves that referees <em>are </em>held accountable – in many ways, more than players or coaches are. One bad game or even a couple of simple mistakes can sink a referee’s career. Players can fill blooper reels and still get called up to national teams. Players, coaches and even commentators can look at a play multiple times and still misunderstand the call. Case in point: On a 2010 World Cup broadcast, Efan Ekoku ranted about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/11/world-cup-2010-south-africa-mexico-live\">what he considered</a> an erroneous offside call, either failing to notice that the attacker was well past the goalkeeper or failing to realize the rules say “second-to-last opponent,” not “last outfield player.” </p> <p>And there’s no shortage of commentators. Ex-players happily line up to take a microphone, not a whistle. We’ll never hear of a broadcast in which the broadcaster simply couldn’t find anyone willing to take the gig. </p> <p>But if the referee pool keeps dwindling, plenty of games will go forward without a full officiating crew. Maybe Kyle’s three-year-old should go ahead and sign up now.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/26/worlds-oldest-tree-cypress-chile","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T09:00:01Z","webTitle":"Ancient cypress in Chile may be the world’s oldest tree, new study suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/26/worlds-oldest-tree-cypress-chile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/26/worlds-oldest-tree-cypress-chile","fields":{"headline":"Ancient cypress in Chile may be the world’s oldest tree, new study suggests","trailText":"The tree, in Chile’s Alerce Costero national park, is known as the Great-Grandfather and could be more than 5,000 years old","body":"<p>Scientists in Chile believe that a conifer with a four-metre-thick trunk known as the Great-Grandfather could be the world’s oldest living tree, beating the current record-holder by more than 600 years.</p> <p>A new study carried out by Dr Jonathan Barichivich, a Chilean scientist at the Climate and Environmental Sciences Laboratory in Paris, suggests that the tree, a Patagonian cypress<strong>,</strong> also known as the <em>alerce </em><em>milenario</em>, could be up to 5,484 years old.</p> <p>Maisa Rojas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/we-need-politicians-and-experts-maisa-rojas-how-chile-putting-climate-crisis-first\">who became Chile’s environment minister in March</a> and is a member of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, hailed the news as a “marvellous scientific discovery”.</p> <p>Known in Spanish as the <em>alerce</em>, the Patagonian cypress, <em>Fitzroya cupressoides</em>, is a conifer native to Chile and Argentina that belongs to the same family as giant sequoias and redwoods.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/we-need-politicians-and-experts-maisa-rojas-how-chile-putting-climate-crisis-first\">‘We need politicians and experts’: how Chile is putting the climate crisis first</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They grow incredibly slowly and can reach heights of up to 45 metres (150ft).</p> <p>In 2020, Barichivich took a bore sample from the <em>Alerce Milenario</em>, a tree he would visit as a child, but the tool he used was not able to reach its core.

Their mother talks about taking on the Met, and how she carries on in the face of overwhelming grief","body":"<p>Mina Smallman’s home is idyllic. Overlooking Ramsgate harbour, in Kent, it is bathed in natural light. A sign in the kitchen says: “Welcome to Party Palace”. Tiny speakers are embedded in the ceiling from the party days. A gorgeous family photograph is framed on the wall, with her husband, Chris, towering over Mina and her three daughters. “We’ve got lovely memories here with the girls,” Mina, 65, tells me.</p> <p>On 6 June it will be two years since her life was ripped apart. Two of the daughters were murdered by a stranger at Fryent country park in Wembley, north London. Bibaa Henry was a 46-year-old senior social worker, Nicole Smallman a 27-year-old photographer. A group of 10 friends had been celebrating Bibaa’s birthday with a socially distanced picnic in the park – Britain was in lockdown and indoor gatherings were banned. By 12.30am the friends had left, but Bibaa and Nicole stayed on, dancing to music, draped in fairy lights, taking joyous selfies. At 1.05am Nicole sent a text to her boyfriend, Adam Stone, saying she and Bibaa were dancing in a field by themselves.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/28/danyal-hussein-jailed-for-35-years-for-murdering-sisters-in-london-park\">Soon afterwards they were killed</a>. Danyal Hussein was a 19-year-old satanist who had pledged to “perform a minimum of six sacrifices every six months for as long as I am free and physically capable” in exchange for winning the Mega Millions Super Jackpot. He stabbed Bibaa eight times, Nicole 28 times. </p> <p>Although the women were reported missing at around 5am, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/25/metropolitan-police-to-apologise-to-family-of-murdered-sisters\">the police did not search the park</a>. Instead, the family were left to look themselves. That afternoon, Adam discovered the bodies. Horror soon piled upon horror. Mina was informed that the two police officers designated to guard the crime scene, Deniz Jaffer and Jamie Lewis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/24/met-officers-sacked-sharing-whatsapp-photos-murdered-sisters\">had taken photographs of the dead women’s corpses</a> and posted them on WhatsApp groups, referring to the women as “dead birds”. One of the WhatsApp groups, called “the A team”, contained 41 police officers. The other, containing friends of Jaffer, was called “Covid cunts”.</p> <p>With all her remaining strength, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/26/met-chief-dumbfounded-at-officers-alleged-photos-of-murdered-sisters\">Mina took on the Metropolitan police</a>. She was convinced that, had her daughters been white, the police would have searched the park, and Jaffer and Lewis would not have taken the photographs of her daughters. Hearing how the officers violated Bibaa and Nicole, she felt she had lost them for a second time. “I hadn’t even imagined what they looked like until we were told the officers had taken photographs. I began to have flashes of what I thought they looked like. Your kids are murdered and then you hear this. In the natural order of things, you would say the kids being murdered is the worst thing. However, when you are hanging on to a life raft, trying to keep yourself together to function, get up, dress, do what you’ve got to do … when that happened, any reserves that we had were stripped away.”</p> <p>Throughout it all, she showed an astonishing dignity and capacity for forgiveness. She forgave the killer because he was obviously sick. And when the two officers were eventually sentenced, last December, to 33 months in jail after pleading guilty to misconduct in public office, she said she was prepared to meet them as part of a restorative justice process.</p> <p>Yet the horror has not abated. Two weeks ago, she and Chris were in court again to hear the officers unsuccessfully appeal against their sentence. Mina thought the stress would kill her. “I had palpitations and my head was pounding. I thought to myself: ‘Am I going to have a heart attack or a stroke here and now?’” She was disgusted by the arguments used by their defence: that the photographs were shared only with close friends and would have gone no further; that taking selfies is just what people do nowadays to show what they have been up to. Jaffer’s barrister asked how his two teenage daughters would cope when he was in prison, oblivious to the casual cruelty of his question.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68174d875c4c6408478773124869f696a3ab606f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68174d875c4c6408478773124869f696a3ab606f/0_0_3088_2320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bibaa Henry (left) and Nicole Smallman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bibaa Henry (left) and Nicole Smallman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Metropolitan Police/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She had been prepared to give the officers the benefit of the doubt. Now, she tells me, she has withdrawn her offer to meet them. “If they’d served their time without complaining, I would understand that they had repented. But when they challenged the sentence I thought that was bullshit.” Why had she agreed to meet them originally? “I’ve said all along I don’t need to meet with them to bring <em>me</em> peace. I wanted to be a mirror so they can look at the mother of the two girls they took photos of. I froze the request because I don’t want them to use it as part of their defence – ‘The mother has reached out and we’ve said yeah we’re going to meet her.’”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Mina Smallman is as tough as she is warm. She says she had to be to progress as a working-class woman of dual heritage (her mother was Scottish, her father Nigerian). She left school with two CSEs, then returned to do O-levels as a mature student, graduated with a bachelor of education in her early 30s, then taught drama for 15 years. After gaining a degree in contextual theology she was ordained into the Church of England at St Paul’s Cathedral in 2006. In 2013, she became Britain’s first black female archdeacon. Throughout her career she says she experienced misogyny and racism, mainly from privileged white men who questioned her right to a place at the table.</p> <p>She became part of the establishment, but never stopped challenging it. When she was asked to mentor students from ethnic minorities, she agreed only if she could also mentor the white working-class boys she felt were equally disadvantaged. Later, she introduced unconscious bias training for vicars. She says she has always been able to sniff out institutional bigotry, and never more so than now.</p> <p>Bibaa (Mina’s daughter from her first marriage, along with her surviving daughter, Monique) was black while Nicole (Mina’s daughter with Chris) was of dual heritage. Smallman believes that they were victims of racial profiling and classism; that the police were not interested in searching for them because Bibaa lived on a notorious estate in Wembley. The former Met chief superintendent Dal Babu supported her, saying: “If this was a 40-year-old professional white woman, I question whether we would have had the delay and difficulties we have had.”</p> <p>Mina was furious when the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) concluded that although the level of service provided to family and friends of the women after their disappearance was “unacceptable” (the duty inspector closed the police logs after receiving information about the sisters’ possible whereabouts, while a call handler referred to one of the sisters as a “suspect”), it was not a result of bias. “I call the IOPC the three blind monkeys – hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Independent? They can’t even investigate the Met without the Met agreeing they can investigate.”</p> <p>Chris, a former English teacher, arrives home. He has an Everton shirt on. “As soon as he knows you love footy, you’ve got your old bromance thing going,” Mina says. He takes off his trainers. “Chris, your shoes stink.”</p> <p>“The other guys say that, too.”</p> <p>They laugh. She asks him to leave the trainers outside.</p> <p>Chris and Mina have very different coping methods. He keeps himself active with sport and tutoring. She has her faith and activism. So many couples separate after suffering such extreme trauma. How has it affected their relationship? “It’s made us closer. Chris and I were good friends before we were a couple.” She smiles. We’re brother/sister, husband/wife, we squabble, we’re real. He doesn’t judge me for the way I grieve and I don’t judge him for the way he grieves. He needs to be out there playing tennis, <a href=\"https://thewfa.co.uk/\">walking football</a> – he talks to everyone in the street. I retreat. My challenge now is to be out there more.”</p> <p>She has just made Two Daughters, a BBC documentary about her life since the girls were murdered. I ask why she has stayed in the public eye. She quotes Emmeline Pankhurst on fighting for women’s suffrage: “You have to make more noise than anybody else, you have to make yourself more obtrusive than anybody else, you have to fill all the papers more than anybody else.” She says there are two Mina Smallmans: one is the activist, the other is the mother. In the documentary, we see a lot of the activist, campaigning about women’s safety and Black Lives Matter. But in the most devastating scene she howls with grief, inconsolable. This is Mina the mother.</p> <p>Today, I get to see plenty of the latter. She talks lovingly about her daughters. Bibaa, the oldest, was a pocket-sized dynamo – barely 5ft, stylish, streetwise and a devoted social worker. She had an adult daughter and was about to become a grandmother. Nicole had gone to a performing arts school, was a talented musician and a natural-born hippy. Despite their age difference, Bibaa and Nicole were exceptionally close.</p> <p>Monique is a personal trainer who lives in Holland. I ask how she is coping. “It’s been hard,” Mina says. “The first few times she came here, we never talked about it. We couldn’t. The girls used to share a room if they came at the same time. Just by habit, I said: ‘Your room’s ready.’ The next day I asked how she slept and she said: ‘I just kept thinking of the times I’d stayed in this room with Nikki.” When Monique visits now, she sleeps in a different room.</p> <p>The longer I spend with Mina, the more I realise the number of lives devastated by the murders. Mina’s sister, Anne, died soon after her nieces were killed. “I think Bibaa’s murder finished her. She was fighting with cancer for five years and she was particularly close to Bibaa. She wanted to talk about her, and I couldn’t do it. I was broken. I couldn’t even go to her funeral because it was only few months after the girls’. I couldn’t go back there.”</p> <p>I ask what life used to be like before the murders. “It wasn’t great. I have battled with my physical and mental health.” She was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, and in 2016 took early retirement. But in the months before the girls were killed, she was feeling more positive. “I was beginning to come out of the darkness …” She trails off, disconsolate. </p> <p>Once she knew the girls had not been sexually assaulted or tortured, she told the police she did not want to know the details. But they came out at the trials of Hussein and the police officers. “When your child has been murdered and you have to listen to their last moments …” Again, words fail her. “Horrific. <em>Horrific</em>.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4d6c47f75facc155557112d8223bbae85f5b98b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4d6c47f75facc155557112d8223bbae85f5b98b/0_0_4238_2825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mina and Chris outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mina and Chris outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hussein’s legal team argued that because the officers entered the crime scene to take the photographs, they could have contaminated it. “That sick monster had said he was going to kill six women every six months, so another four women were going to be murdered, and he could have got off because of what those officers did. From my perspective, I’m thinking we have spared potentially another four families.” She pauses. “No thanks to those police officers.”</p> <p>The photographer arrives and suddenly the house is busy. As Mina has her photo taken, Chris and I chat. Chris says his daily routine hasn’t changed much since losing Bibaa and Nicole. He tries to keep himself active. “I’ve got a good friendship group through walking football. That’s been a saviour. I’m pretty matter of fact as to the way I handle it. I’m not going into a spiral of emotional despair, which can easily happen. The way I look at it is the girls wouldn’t want me to go into a hole and give up. They’d they want me to keep going.” Has it been tempting to go in to a hole? “Not for me, no. I’m not a very emotional person. If Everton lose, I get upset!”</p> <p>For about five years, he was both father and schoolteacher to Nicole. Was that difficult for her? “No, she loved it!” Did she ever call him Dad in class? “She did a couple of times.” He smiles at the memory.</p> <p>Although he is trying his best to get on with life, he says that there are thoughts he can’t get out of his head. “It’s all the ifs and buts. Why the <em>fuck</em> did they stay there when everybody else went? Why wasn’t the weather the same as it was the night before, because it had been raining then? It was the one night that was lovely. It’s all whys and ifs. The thing is it wouldn’t have happened, but Boris said get out, don’t have parties in your house. All those little things you think …”</p> <p>Mina returns and he leaves the room to make us a drink. I tell her what Chris said to me about being unemotional and ask if it’s true, or whether he was saying it because he didn’t want to go there. “The second,” she says quietly. “If you speak to him about Nikki and Bibaa and what he loved about them, he can’t get through that without crying.”</p> <p>I mention that one of the what-ifs he spoke about was lockdown. Mina had earlier told me she can go from nought to 90 in a nanosecond, and now she proves it. Last month the government minister Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed the Partygate scandal as “fluff” and “fundamentally trivial”, and she’s still apoplectic. Not least because she keeps thinking how the police would have reacted if his children had gone missing. “The truth is if Bibaa hadn’t had the picnic outside, if she had decided to break the rules, she and Nikki would still be alive. It’s like how <em>dare</em> you, Rees-Mogg?”</p> <p>Without a breath she turns her attention back to the Metropolitan police, which announced last October that it would apologise to the family because its response after Bibaa and Nicole went missing “fell short” and “compounded the distress felt by their loved ones”. “Say sorry?” she fumes. “You know sorry is what you say when you bump into someone in the street.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/26/mother-of-murdered-sisters-bibaa-henry-nicole-smallman-met-police-apology\">Mina finds it difficult to forgive the government hypocrisy</a> or the police officers, but none of her anger is directed at the killer. She pities him. She mentions Gee Walker, the mother of Anthony Walker, who was brutally murdered in an unprovoked racist attack 17 years ago. “After his murder, she said: ‘I forgive the killers because my faith tells me I should.’ I <em>preached</em> on that, saying this woman is amazing because I’m not sure I could do it.”</p> <p>And has she done? She pauses. “Yeah, I’ve forgiven Hussein.” Would she meet him? “No, because he clearly isn’t well. Maybe with some therapy support, years later that might be possible.”</p> <p>What advice would she give to other people looking to forgive? “I would say to someone who has lost their child in extreme circumstances, try to let the anger go. You’re not letting your loved one down by letting go. If you imagine them looking down, they would be so upset that you have punctuated your life, so the aggressor, the murderer, wins. Let the anger go.”</p> <p>Yet still the grief remains overwhelming, and there are times she simply doesn’t want to be here. Has she come close to giving up? “Absolutely,” she says. “Only now I can’t take the escape route because I have personally felt how heartbreaking it is. I couldn’t do it to Chris and Monique. I’ve experienced the loss of my girls, and I would <em>never</em> want to inflict that on Chris and Mon.”</p> <p>We’ve been talking for hours. Mina is exhausted. Chris offers me a lift to the station.</p> <p>I ask if she has reached a stage where she can wake up and think it’s a lovely day. She has recently been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. “No. No. No, I can’t. I don’t go outside. I recently went shopping, and I tried to get back in the house before anybody saw me. I don’t know why – our neighbours are amazing.”</p> <p>She is finding it easier to get on with her public life as an activist than her private life as a mother. “I talk to my counsellor about the mum and the activist, and she said: ‘They’re both you, Mina, you don’t need to separate them.’” Is she trying to reconcile the two? “Yeah,” she says. But it seems more a question than a statement. “As the activist, I feel totally empowered. But as the mum …” She comes to a painful stop. “I think I’m moving forward, but there’s a lot of work still to be done.” <br><br></p> <p>• <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0017x5x\">Two Daughters</a> will air on BBC Two at 9pm on Sunday and be available on iPlayer shortly after broadcast.</p> <p>• In the UK and Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/\">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on 116 123, or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

He constantly worries about losing his Medicaid and Social Security disability insurance due to income and asset eligibility requirements and is very concerned about losing Medicaid when continuous enrollment ends.</p> <p>“As I’ve been learning, trying to maintain my eligibility, you get a different story every time and you just have to hope one of them is right. And I’ve sort of been learning, none of them are really right,” said Brown.</p> <p>Without Medicaid, he would have to rely on his parents, who work full-time, to provide the care he needs and pay out of pocket for care to the extent his family could afford it. These options, Brown argued, aren’t feasible as he is planning to start law school this fall at Rutgers University, and his parents shouldn’t have to uproot their lives to help him function, which is the responsibility of Medicaid.</p> <p>“There shouldn’t be a cutoff date. There’s no reasonable argument for not giving disabled people the care they need to survive,” added Brown. “Regardless of what you’re feeling on whether people should have free healthcare, the disabled need it. There are no alternatives for us. It’s Medicaid or bust, and when the Medicaid rules are this convoluted and hard to keep track of, it almost feels like a full time job just keeping my benefits.”</p> <p>During the pandemic, the federal government required states to continuously enroll Medicaid recipients into the program, providing $100.4 bn in new funds to cover the costs of doing so, halting coverage gaps and loss of eligibility for those who rely on healthcare coverage through Medicaid.</p> <p>The current pandemic health emergency declaration is set to<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-16/us-set-to-extend-covid-19-public-health-emergency-past-july\"> expire</a> in mid-July. It is expected to be extended again, but an extension date has yet to be set by the US Department of Health and Human Services.</p> <p>“Medicaid provided invaluable coverage to individuals during the pandemic. And there’s evidence that it helped insulate people from loss of coverage that is associated with job losses, especially in the early stages of the pandemic,” said Dr Eric T Roberts, assistant professor of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh. “Now, we face this unwinding of those provisions and a lot of confusion to beneficiaries and the public about how individuals will navigate that process and the schedule on which they will be required to do so. I think the great concern is that people lose their coverage without really knowing it, until they need it.”</p> <p> Roberts said policymakers need to address these problems, as Medicaid determination and redetermination is complex already. Those complexities are magnified when states have to start conducting those determinations on such a large scale without the proper administrative and navigational assistance and resources in place.</p> <p>“There is already a significant amount of administrative complexity to navigate Medicaid from the beneficiaries’ perspective and that can uniquely disadvantage people who have greater difficulty just navigating the healthcare system in general, the most vulnerable,” added Roberts.</p> <p>Federal government subsidies to make healthcare plans more affordable on the insurance marketplace are <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/without-build-back-better-will-the-end-of-the-public-health-emergency-leave-even-more-people-uninsured/\">expected to end</a> on 31 December 2022, making health insurance plans more expensive, possibbly resulting in more Americans losing health insurance coverage because they can’t afford it.</p> <p>Zachary Fusfeld of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a PhD candidate in epidemiology at Drexel University, is anticipating the loss of his Medicaid coverage when continuous enrollment ends, because his university stipend increase will put him over the income limit.</p> <p>A type one diabetic who suffers from other illnesses, Fusfeld said he will have to rely on his student healthcare and pay out of pocket for copays on medications, medical supplies, and doctor visits when his Medicaid coverage ends later this year, the costs of which are not affordable and not covered by his pay increase.</p> <p>He recently required surgery on his ankle and is worried about affording the physical therapy he requires, though he noted there are many people who are facing the loss of Medicaid and don’t have any sort of supplemental insurance coverage as he does.</p> <p>“I’m really worried that I’m just not going to be able to properly manage my health and life in a way that I can stay as healthy as I need to be,” said Fusfeld.</p> <p>Chris Bergh of St Louis, Missouri, relies on Social Security disability insurance for income and Medicaid for medical coverage. He’s concerned about the risk of losing medical coverage through Medicaid when the pandemic emergency is lifted.</p> <p>“I’m at risk of losing coverage because I lost track of a piece of mail and the instructions in the letter were unclear about how I was supposed to proceed,” said Bergh.</p> <p>He has repeatedly attempted to call Medicaid’s service hotline, but hasn’t been able to get through to speak to an actual person. Without Medicaid, he wouldn’t be able to see his doctors, afford his prescription medicine, or get dental care.</p> <p>“I think they make this system harder than it has to be, in the hopes of weeding people out, just like other public assistance programs,” added Bergh. “I’m on social security so I have a fixed income and don’t make enough to cover the out of pocket cost of these things and still be able to eat and do other things.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/26/european-fishing-fleets-accused-illegally-netting-tuna-indian-ocean","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T08:56:16Z","webTitle":"European fishing fleets accused of illegally netting tuna in Indian Ocean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/26/european-fishing-fleets-accused-illegally-netting-tuna-indian-ocean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/26/european-fishing-fleets-accused-illegally-netting-tuna-indian-ocean","fields":{"headline":"European fishing fleets accused of illegally netting tuna in Indian Ocean","trailText":"Reports handed to EU claim vessels likely to have entered coastal states’ waters where stocks are dwindling","body":"<p>European fishing fleets have been illegally netting tuna from dwindling stocks in the Indian Ocean, according to data presented to EU authorities and analysed by expert groups.</p> <p>EU purse seine (a type of large net) fishing vessels were present in the waters of Indian Ocean coastal states, where they were likely to have carried out unauthorised catches, and have reported catches in the Chagos archipelago marine protected area and in Mozambique’s exclusive economic zone.</p> <p>Two investigations were made of fishing in the Indian Ocean, <a href=\"https://www.bluemarinefoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/OceanMind-IOTC-catch-effort-2016-2020-and-cross-reference-with-behaviour-in-HRA-for-piracy-in-2019-2020.pdf\">one conducted by the group OceanMind</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bluemarinefoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Tuna_Report_FINAL.pdf\">another</a> by the charity Blue Marine Foundation along with Kroll, the corporate investigation company.

In order to fight IUU in the IOTC convention area, the EU has also tabled a proposal to establish a high-sea boarding and inspection scheme, based on the work already done within the IOTC. </p> <p>“This would be an important tool to control better the fishing activities in the high seas and continue to fight against IUU fishing. We have also tabled a proposal to improve the traditionally weak IOTC compliance process, by putting more emphasis on the categorisation and follow-up to established situations of non-compliance.”</p> <p>The spokesperson said fishing crews may have valid reasons for switching off their AIS technology, and that the transmission power and signal can vary from place to place. </p> <p>“[Going dark] does not imply that they fish illegally. The AIS might be switched off under certain circumstances by professional judgment of the master,” the spokesperson said. “The information given by the AIS may not be a complete picture of the situation in the area and of the vessel’s activity.”</p> <p>Charles Clover, the executive director of Blue Marine Foundation, defended its claims. “The report showing the locations of EU vessels is based on the findings of a study commissioned by Blue Marine Foundation and undertaken by OceanMind – a highly reputable organisation – which in turn was based on publicly available data reported by the EU and published by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission on its website,” he said. </p> <p>“This data shows, for example, evidence of fishing on the part of vessels flagged to Spain in the waters of Somalia, in 2017 and 2018, and India, in 2018 and 2019.”</p> <p>He added: “There is evidence to suggest that some of these fleets are fishing in coastal states’ waters without any kind of authorisation and we call on the European Commission to investigate these instances as a matter of urgency.”</p> <p>The Guardian also approached the Spanish government for

general was scathing of the Frydenberg campaign to retain Kooyong and the Coalition’s campaign messaging generally, Smith also wrote that it was “a global phenomenon that wealthy inner-urban elites are voting for the Left”.</p> \n<p>“The Liberal campaign in Kooyong had no message, aside from ‘Keep Josh’, but most importantly it said nothing about what the Liberal party stands for that will improve the lives of the people of Kooyong or anywhere else in the years ahead,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>This came as Tim Wilson urged his Coalition colleagues not to abandon their position on climate change, telling an industry conference that it was not the main issue that led to their election defeat.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think we should go backwards on our position and I don’t think anyone seriously is entertaining that,” Wilson, who lost his seat of Goldstein to the independent Zoe Daniel, told the National Energy Efficiency Conference in Melbourne on Thursday.</p> \n<p>“Where our role has to be is really to give the communities that are represented by the Coalition a voice in the conversation – to make sure that they’re not lost, because that’s always been my fear.”</p> \n<p>Wilson said he was concerned the Greens, who could hold the balance of power in the Senate, will dictate the terms of the transition to renewable energy without consideration for outer suburban, regional and rural communities.</p> \n<p>“I very strongly believe, and still believe, the best way to build that sense of consensus … [and] support was actually under us because we were the ones that could have the conversations with those communities,” he said.</p> \n<p>“It’s an extreme challenge, and one we should all be excited about, but we shouldn’t be deluded just how much any change of that structural nature can lead to dislocation.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"811f61b244a0a47b7feee7a3d7550d239c9cfc5e\"> \n <img

climate and energy debate from outside federal parliament.</p> \n<p>Wilson was one of several Liberal MPs who lost blue-ribbon seats to independent candidates, who ran community-backed election campaigns on climate, integrity and gender equity.</p> \n<p>But he denied the government’s emissions policy, including a target of net zero by 2050 and a 2030 target described as unambitious, led to the losses.</p> \n<p>“I think there are other issues that played out very strongly in the election, which made it harder for people to win their seats, including myself, which aren’t related to climate change. That doesn’t mean that it’s not an important part of that, but it was a subset of issues,” Wilson said.</p> \n<p>Amid the fierce debate about the future direction of the Liberal party after their election rout, Smith wrote that the party needed to “stop obsessing with the woke causes of inner-urban elites” and turn its attention to the “true forgotten people” of suburbia and rural Australia.</p> \n<p>“Swings at this election against Labor in their working-class heartland prove this is where the Liberal party must focus,” he wrote.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily morning briefing newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download the free app</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/mar/17/make-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend?CMP=cvau_atom\">get our weekend edition</a> for a curated selection of the week's best stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/guardianaustraliagdn\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia\">TikTok</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_atom\">\"Full Story\"</a> in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“These are the Australians who will bear the brunt of what the ‘teals’ are demanding in terms of emissions reductions by 2030.</p> \n<p>“The people of Kooyong, Wentworth, Goldstein, North Sydney and Mackellar aren’t forgotten or quiet.

The Long Distance, Part II, sees him go even further, travelling to India, while a 2020 follow-up sheds yet more light on the scammers’ motivations.

If anything, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak</a>’s surcharge on the profits of energy companies has a strong pedigree among leaders who defer to the free market, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher\">Margaret Thatcher</a> and the former chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a>. Here is a brief history of Britain’s windfall taxes:</p> <h2>The 1980s</h2> <p>In 1981 Thatcher’s then chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, accused high street banks of escaping the recession. He introduced a special budget levy that creamed off 2.5% of the banks’ non-interest-bearing current account deposits to generate about £400m in extra revenue – equivalent to around a fifth of their profits in those 12 months.</p> <p>The following year, Treasury officials came to the same conclusion when oil prices soared, and imposed a special tax, raising £2.4bn. North Sea oil firms argued at the time that extra taxes would limit investment, but the industry flourished.</p> <h2>The 1990s</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown\">Gordon Brown</a> as chancellor vowed to stick by Tory tax commitments, forcing him to adopt a windfall tax to generate extra revenue. He took aim at utilities that were privatised under the Tories at giveaway prices. They were widely considered to be making excessive profits from their monopolies of sectors previously under state control.</p> <p>Around £5bn was paid by firms including BAA, British Gas, British Telecom and Powergen.</p> <p>As the Institute for Government explained: “The tax owed was calculated as 23% of the difference between ‘company value’, calculated by reference to profits over a period of up to four years after privatisation, and the value placed on the company at the time of flotation.” The thinktank said the tax raised £5.2bn, equivalent to around £13bn in today’s terms.</p> <h2>The windfall tax that never happened</h2> <p>In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crash, oil prices soared. A YouGov poll commissioned by the centre-left pressure group Compass and the Observer showed that 67% of Britons “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/24/energy.economy\">a one-off tax should be levied on oil and gas companies</a>. Gas prices had doubled since 2000, and electricity prices were up by nearly two-thirds. Energy companies’ profits had climbed nearly sixfold in three years.</p> <p>A large group of Labour MPs backed the poll, but Brown, now prime minister, rejected the idea, arguing that a tax on profits could damage economic competitiveness at a fragile time with a recession looming, while costs might be passed on to consumers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk<br></figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br>Osborne’s oil tax</h2> <p>In 2011 Osborne <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/03/north-sea-oil-tax-budget\">increased the surcharge on North Sea oil and gas producers</a> from 20% to 32% above the normal rate of corporation tax, arguing that “when oil prices are high … UK oil and gas production is more profitable … so it is fair that companies should contribute more”.</p> <p>It’s a bit of a cheat to include Osborne in the list because his botched scheme wasn’t designed as a one-off windfall tax, but a multi-year increase that would last as long as prices remained high. Instead the 12 percentage points increase, which raised £2bn in its first year, was supposed to underwrite a 1p reduction in the duty on petrol and diesel and scrap a further 5p increase due under plans agreed by the previous Labour government.</p> <p>It became a windfall tax after the oil and gas industry responded by cutting investment, spooking the Treasury and forcing a U-turn. A year later Osborne, who had promised the industry a stable tax regime and failed to give any advanced warning, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/george-osborne-north-sea-oil\">offered to shield £500m of investment from tax</a>. Later, and as the oil price plummeted, he cut the headline rate of tax back to previous levels.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/26/putin-anarchists-join-ukraine-war-effort","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T08:31:48Z","webTitle":"‘Putin’s terror affects everyone’: anarchists join Ukraine’s war effort","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/putin-anarchists-join-ukraine-war-effort","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/26/putin-anarchists-join-ukraine-war-effort","fields":{"headline":"‘Putin’s terror affects everyone’: anarchists join Ukraine’s war effort","trailText":"Activists from Kyiv and around world join state forces in fight against totalitarianism","body":"<p>In an unnamed basement bar in central Kyiv, Ukrainian anarchists have created a headquarters where they gather supplies to send to their peers on the frontlines and welcome anarchists from abroad who have come to fight.</p> <p>It is unusual to see anarchists supporting state structures, but they say taking action against Russia is necessary for their survival. “We are fighting to protect the more or less free society that exists in Ukraine,” said an activist, Dmytro. “Without which there would be no space for activism or underground movements.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"af80006448aa12698cb4e4caf4eb03de43d8aab9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af80006448aa12698cb4e4caf4eb03de43d8aab9/0_89_768_461/500.jpg\" alt=\"An anarchist fighter in Ukraine.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anarchist fighter in Ukraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He added: “Putin’s terror is happening [in Ukraine] and it is indiscriminate. It is happening against every part of the population, but especially against the Russian-speaking parts of the population that Putin supposedly came here to liberate,” referring to the fact that the war has been heaviest in eastern and southern Ukraine.</p> <p>“His regime is an ultraconservative, rightwing dictatorship that represses anarchists in Russia, the free press, LGBT networks. It scares even the most banal, grassroots initiatives, like animal rights activists. We see the conflict between Ukraine and Russia as a conflict between a more or less democratic state and a totalitarian one.”</p> <p>The activist left is relatively small in Ukraine, where the memory of Soviet communism lingers, and its anarchist component is even smaller. But from 1917-21 Ukraine was home to one of the world’s most famous anarchist movements, which sprung out of the power vacuum created by the fall of Tsarist Russia. </p> <p>Led by the anarchist Nestor Makhno, the movement argued for the rights of Ukraine’s peasantry and quickly grew in popularity under the slogans “Death to those who stand in the way of free working people” and “Power breeds parasites, long live anarchy!”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f89d1024c6349917a4de919c4faf1a6d3006d58f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f89d1024c6349917a4de919c4faf1a6d3006d58f/0_248_4695_2817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nestor Makhno (centre) in 1919.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nestor Makhno (centre) in 1919.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chronicle/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the height of the movement, self-governing communes existed across most of southern and eastern Ukraine under the protection of Makhno’s army. His base was in Huliaipole, a town in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, which has been frequently fought over since February. The Bolsheviks defeated Makhno’s army and he died in exile in Paris.</p> <p>Those at the Kyiv anarchists’ headquarters admit that these are no longer “Makhno times”. Today, the anarchist movement in Ukraine is small and a battalion acting independently would collapse on a modern-day battlefield, they say.</p> <p>About 100 anarchists have signed up to fight in Ukraine’s army and territorial defence forces, according to Serhiy Movchan, the group’s spokesperson. In addition, about 20 foreign anarchists have signed up, including a Russian who fled his country three years ago. Others have come to Ukraine to work as volunteer paramedics.</p> <p>“We have a strict screening process,” said Dmytro, who was eager to stress that the foreign volunteers differ from some of the others who have arrived in the country since February. “We don’t want people who just come here to kill; we want them to understand what they are fighting for.”</p> <p>Before the 24 February invasion, the anarchists – small in number – would join forces with wider leftwing activist networks. But attracting supporters faced obstacles due to the country’s experience of the Soviet era.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afea736115864c1ab49ea7b4f63ce926b5b3797b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afea736115864c1ab49ea7b4f63ce926b5b3797b/820_238_4648_2789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ukrainian flag flies behind a statue of Nestor Makhno in Zaporizhzhia, south-eastern Ukraine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ukrainian flag flies behind a statue of Nestor Makhno in Zaporizhzhia, south-eastern Ukraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the name of socialism, mass murders were carried out, a man-made famine was created, and swathes of culture and history, including the Ukrainian language, were repressed. A controversial set of <a href=\"https://khpg.org/en/1430783454\">de-Communisation laws</a> were passed in 2015 to deal with this legacy, but many on the left feel the wider population began to associate everything on the left with the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Then, under Putin’s Russia Kremlin spin doctors and their allies co-opted leftist rhetoric to create pro-Russian political parties across the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine. These parties were used to appeal to those voters who harboured nostalgia for communist times.</p> <p>Leaked emails in 2016 revealed how the Kharkiv regional leader of the Communist party of Ukraine, banned the previous year for promoting separatism, had received emails from the office of the former Kremlin spin doctor Vladislav Surkov on how to foment separatism and campaign for federalisation. (Since 2014 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/kiev-sees-russian-federalization-plans-as-attempt-to-destroy-ukraine/2014/04/05/a5ed291c-fd65-4a3b-bf4f-5c83f2574944_story.html\">the Kremlin has been pushing</a> for federalisation in Ukraine as Russia’s way of re-gaining leverage in national politics.)</p> <p>Dmytro also pointed to the “leftwing” messaging used by the Kremlin when creating the self-declared people’s republics in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Russian-backed unrecognised states in eastern Ukraine. He said that the irony is that the entities have been headed by ultra-rightists such as Igor Girkin, who promoted Russian nationalism, <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/the-executioners-of-slovyansk/30743132.html\">carried out extrajudicial killings</a>, and banned freedom of speech and association.</p> <p>The recent full-scale invasion by Russia has brought another layer of mud for activists on Ukraine’s left, said Movchan.</p> <p>“Putin has appropriated the word anti-fascist and he exploits it to justify his war,” said Movhcan. “[Ukrainian] nationalists say if you’re anti-fascist, you’re pro-Russian, but that’s not the case.”</p> <p>Movchan said far-right nationalism has always failed to gain popular support in Ukraine, but moderate nationalism – which emphasises religion, language and the army – became mainstream after 2014.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many Ukrainian politicians assumed nationalist messaging in an ensuing competition to present themselves as Ukrainian patriots. This nationalism promotes conservative, non-progressive ideas and therefore presents a “big problem”, said Movchan.</p> <p>“I think both sides of the elite did a lot to create a situation whereby Ukrainians argue a lot about language and versions of history instead of how Kryvyi Rih Stal was privatised,” said Movchan, referring to Ukraine’s largest steelworks that was privatised in 2004 by oligarchs close to the then-president.</p> <p>Movchan said that this form of nationalism has given those in power a tool to ignore Ukraine’s social issues, but that people need to be clear that Ukraine’s internal problems are not to blame for the war. “The cause of the war is the Russian Federation,” said Movchan.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/26/ukraine-pleads-for-more-weapons-to-tackle-russian-onslaught-in-donbas","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T08:18:23Z","webTitle":"Ukraine pleads for more weapons to tackle Russian onslaught in Donbas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/ukraine-pleads-for-more-weapons-to-tackle-russian-onslaught-in-donbas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/26/ukraine-pleads-for-more-weapons-to-tackle-russian-onslaught-in-donbas","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine pleads for more weapons to tackle Russian onslaught in Donbas","trailText":"Bombardment continues in 40 towns including the key city of Sievierodonetsk as police in Lysychansk collect bodies for mass burials ","body":"<p>Fierce battles have continued to rage in eastern Ukraine with Russian troops on the verge of encircling a key industrial city, bringing a sharp rebuke of the west from Volodymyr Zelenskiy for not doing enough to help Kyiv win the war.</p> <p>As the Ukrainian military reported on Thursday that 40 towns in the Donbas region were under Russian bombardment, Luhansk governor Sergiy Gaiday described fighting outside Sievierodonetsk, a key military goal for Russia, as “very difficult”, saying Russian troops were shelling the city from the outskirts with mortars.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/ukraine-war-weighs-heavy-as-apocalyptic-mood-shrouds-davos\">Ukraine war weighs heavy as apocalyptic mood shrouds Davos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The coming week will be decisive,” Gaiday said in a video posted on Telegram, adding he believes Russia’s goal is to “capture the Luhansk region no matter what cost”.</p> <p>“There is a colossal amount of shelling,” he added.</p> <p>Having failed to seize Ukraine’s capital or its second city, Kharkiv, after invading in February, Russia is trying to take full control of the Donbas, comprised of two eastern provinces Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.</p> <p>Russia has poured thousands of troops into the region, attacking from three sides in an attempt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/russian-assault-eastern-ukraine-sievierodonetsk-donbas\">to encircle Ukrainian forces holding out in Sievierodonetsk</a> and its twin, Lysychansk.

This grant could rise to as much as £500.</p> \n<p>The government could also bring forward a planned increase in benefits that had been expected next year or offer a council tax rebate. </p> \n<p>The Times reported that the previously announced £200 loan on energy bills would be replaced with a grant that will not have to be paid back, with the discount possibly increasing to as much as £400.</p> \n<p>After the head of Ofgem, the energy regulator, said it was on course to raise the cap on energy bills by a further £800 in October, the government faced significant pressure to swiftly announce further financial support for struggling households.</p> \n<p>The measures will be funded in part by a windfall tax on energy firms, after a fierce battle within the government over the policy, which has been bitterly opposed by some cabinet ministers including the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. The measure could be extended to all electricity generators and may include exemptions for investments.</p> \n<p>A senior party official admitted the decision had caused splits in the government. “The arguments have been tested rigorously both within the Treasury and within government and there is high pressure to make sure that the gain is worth the pain and that it does not jeopardise investment,” they said.</p> \n<p>“We do not want to introduce random taxes that make the environment unpredictable for global companies that can go anywhere. We have to set the bar high and do something genuinely impactful and put in massive safeguards to ensure we do not jeopardise investment.”</p> \n<p>In an interview with BBC Breakfast, Barclay avoided questions about why the government would support a windfall tax after ministers and Tory MPs spent weeks rubbishing Labour’s proposal, but said they had been wary of risking “inward investment” by offshore energy companies.</p> \n<p>He said the government was considering how to fund extra financial support by “looking at the balance, how much is done through debt, how much is done through revenue raising” while also recognising “we do need a long-term energy strategy, and one that attracts inward investment”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1517ed8d-34b6-4821-b68c-cf4104640a27\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S6lt92x4l7A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Oil and gas producers have benefited from rocketing global energy prices during Russia’s war in Ukraine. Higher gas prices have pushed up wholesale prices across the electricity market, including for some producers of renewable and nuclear power.</p> \n<p>The Treasury has reportedly analysed whether the tax should be expanded beyond North Sea operators such as BP and Shell to generators including renewable energy operators such as windfarms.</p> \n<p>It is estimated the plan could tax more than £10bn of excess profits, although City analysts said that figure was far beyond their estimates. Labour’s plan for a one-off levy applied only to North Sea oil and gas producers would raise an estimated £2bn.</p> \n<p>A Treasury spokesperson said: “We understand that people are struggling with rising prices, which is why we’ve provided £22bn of support to date. The chancellor was clear that as the situation evolves, so will our response, with the most vulnerable being his number one priority.”</p> \n<p>Economists say living costs for Britain’s poorest households are expected to increase by almost twice the rate of those for the richest when energy bills rise this autumn.</p> \n<p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the fresh surge in gas and electricity bills expected in October could lead to average annual inflation rates of as high as 14% for the poorest 10th of households.</p> \n<p>Economist Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, said the support should be as targeted as possible. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I do think we need to be careful … Putting tens of billions into the economy at a time of high inflation could stoke additional demand and make the inflation much more permanent in the economy.”</p> \n<p>The energy crisis was thrown into sharp focus this week when Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of the energy regulator Ofgem, indicated the energy price cap would increase by a further £830 to nearly £2,800 in October.</p> \n<p>The increase is likely to hit poorer families disproportionately because a larger share of their total spending goes on energy. The IFS said the poorest 10th of households typically spend almost three times as much of their budgets on gas and electricity as the richest 10th.</p> \n<p>This means low-income homes are experiencing a much higher rate of inflation than the wealthy. The IFS predicts that while inflation for those on the breadline will reach 14% this autumn, the richest 10th could see rates of about 8%. Across all households, inflation is likely to reach 10%, the highest rate since 1982.</p> \n<p>In a sign of the growing pressure on households, figures on Wednesday showed average petrol prices hit a new record high of 170.4p a litre, up from 129p a litre a year ago.

That is creatively well-documented of course – Lassie, anyone? But we also can’t help ourselves when it comes to real-life tales of incredible dog bravery. Most recently, it was when a woman who was attacked by a cougar while out hiking in California was saved by her “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/california-woman-dog-mountain-lion-attack\">amazing and loyal</a>” Belgian malinois, Eva. The story made headlines around the world, but drill down a little and you’ll discover that the dog, which weighs around 25kg, hit the cougar but was very quickly outclassed by the giant cat. The woman, 24-year-old Erin Wilson, went at the cougar with rocks, a pipe, a tyre iron from her vehicle, her fists, and finally some pepper spray and the help of a passing stranger, in order to save the dog, which had been dragged off the trail she was walking on by said cougar. Can we really say that the dog saved her?</p> <p>Over the years, we’ve heard of dogs saving people from <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4997101/amazing-moment-a-hero-stray-dog-saves-an-innocent-woman-from-a-street-mugger/\">muggings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dog-saves-elderly-owners-life-25757473\">fires</a> and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/bear-attack-dog-dies-saving-owner-monksville-new-jersey-pete-cathi-stephen-parisi-a8210956.html\">bear attacks</a>, and even alerting new parents to <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Family/hero-dog-credited-saving-babys-life/story?id=81788578#:~:text=%27Hero%27%20dog%20helps%20save%20baby%27s,was%20in%20need%20of%20help.\">very ill babies</a>.

None of these are more powerful than the dogs and cancer stories. In the late 90s, a Pekinese reportedly discovered its owner’s breast cancer by barking incessantly at it. It seems this was neither era- nor breed-specific, and has been repeated since by a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-19048005\">cavalier king charles</a> that sniffed and pawed at its owner’s breasts, a <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/514695/Breast-cancer-symptoms-detected-by-dog\">labrador</a> that also sniffed out cancer, and a border collie that sensed its owner’s cancer while also having breast cancer itself.

When you consider that they can offer emotional support and find drugs, dogs really are like the Swiss army penknife of public servants.</p> <p>All of this really is an answer to the bigger question of: do our dogs love us? As in, do they love us the way we love them? Old-fashioned dog behaviourism has said not, pointing to the fact that they can be rehomed and recover almost immediately. More recent research, however, from evolutionary psychologists Brian Hare and Vanessa Woods, particularly (in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-genius-of-dogs-9781780743684\">The Genius of Dogs</a> and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/survival-of-the-friendliest-9780861541294\">Survival of the Friendliest</a>), shows that dogs respond positively to positive emotions.

They have a specific facial muscle group for those “puppy dog eyes”, and after sustained human contact, according to one study, their oxytocin levels soared. The spike was much more pronounced in their owners, though.</p> <p>This directs us to the more important thrust of Howard’s book, which is that the question isn’t how well dogs love us; it’s how we are changed by loving dogs. The effort of stretching our conscious empathy to encompass another species makes us love one another better, as well as re-situating us within nature as participants rather than overlords. Without this shift, meaningful environmentalism will always be out of reach.</p> <p>Besides which, every fine quality we perceive in the dog, we mirror ourselves, which is how we might find ourselves trying to punch a cougar, rather than run away.

They can’t see that she’s there; she is a ghost, haunting her old home. This story lends its title to Miranda Seymour’s new biography, which places Rhys’s upbringing in the Caribbean at the centre of the narrative. She was born Ella Gwendolen Rees Williams in 1890, the daughter of a Welsh doctor and a white Creole mother descended from slaveowners on the island of Dominica, “[t]he island which haunted her mind and almost everything that she wrote” and “the wellspring of Rhys’s art”. For the rest of her life Rhys would feel as though she belonged nowhere – not on the island where she felt so at home, and not in England, where she would always be seen as an outsider, her very voice, with its “seemingly ineradicable island lilt” betraying her origins.</p> <p>This is not the first big biography of Rhys; Carole Angier’s 1990 study is richly detailed and still holds up. But as one of the major writers of the 20th century, Rhys deserves as many biographies as people want to write (or read). So long, that is, as they sensitively and rigorously attempt to understand this complex woman – particularly the relationship between her turbulent life and her brilliant work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Seymour’s biography excels in conjuring up Rhys as an actual person, especially in the early years </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is where Seymour’s biography excels – in conjuring up Rhys as an actual person, especially in the early years: a born rebel; “delicate” but determined; a perennial outsider. Through a lifetime that included two world wars, the death of a child, her own imprisonment and that of two of her husbands, poverty, rejection, desperation, obsession and breakdown, this delicate young woman became a belligerent drunk, who would “spit, bite, or scratch a perceived opponent”. Into the work it went, writes Seymour; “all became grist to Rhys’s fiction-making mill”.</p> <p>Rhys wrote from a very young age, but it was in London during the first world war, after a devastating affair that led to an illegal abortion, that she started writing something between a diary and the staging ground for her future works of fiction. She continued – in a series of exercise books – through her move to Paris with her first husband (an erratic Dutchman called Jean Lenglet who nevertheless comes across, in Seymour’s account, as a stalwart source of love and support in Rhys’s life, as well as a brave resistance fighter during the second world war). “Glimpses of the world through which she drifted […] appear in the stories that now began to take their final form from pages of urgently scrawled notes,” Seymour writes.</p> <p>Around this time Rhys fell under the tutelage of novelist and critic Ford Madox Ford, who would become her lover as well as her mentor. That, too, would end badly. She and Lenglet divorced in 1933, and there followed a hand-to-mouth existence with two subsequent husbands, which left Rhys languishing in squalid bungalows around Cornwall and Devon until her late-in-life rediscovery and the publication of Wide Sargasso Sea. At this point her fortunes turned, and her life became somewhat more comfortable – just in time, we might observe with mordant, Rhysian irony, for old age with all its discomforts to set in.</p> <p>More than Rhys’s previous biographers, Seymour distinguishes clearly and conscientiously between the person and the work. “At the centre of Rhys’s life,” she explains, “stood her writing, a resource that is entirely absent from the lives of the women she described in her novels.” Her fiction consistently represents women who are poor and friendless; Seymour’s biography tells a different story, of a woman who saw her fortunes fall and rise, but who was supported by caring friends and lovers, as well as her daughter Maryvonne. It was Rhys’s great gift as a novelist and short-story writer that she was able to draw on her own experiences of alienation and exclusion to write these fictions of the downtrodden. By reading the fiction too closely to the life, we risk obscuring that literary achievement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seymour returns to her leitmotif of Rhys as ghost – a frequent touchstone is one of Rhys’s favourite books, Nadja, André Breton’s 1928 novel. “I am a wandering soul,” Nadja tells the narrator. But Breton reserved a sad fate for his antiheroine, cruelly banishing her to an asylum at the end of the novel; she cannot be integrated into the mainstream world the narrator himself inhabits. And though Rhys wandered – Seymour pays keen attention to her various places of residence – in the end, she was happy to settle down in Devon, with her garden and her view of the nearby fields, relieved when her editor Diana Athill’s attempts to move her somewhere more salubrious fell through.</p> <p>Seymour reserves most space for discussions of Wide Sargasso Sea, which some consider Rhys’s masterpiece. One moment in her reading stands out, in the context of Seymour’s interest in ghostliness: “Locked away by a husband who scorns and seeks to banish her (‘She was only a ghost. A ghost in the grey daylight’), Antoinette refuses to become another in that anonymous throng of nameless sufferers, that nearly inaudible incantation from the depths of the Great Forest”. It was reading this passage that I realised: Rhys’s fiction is an attempt to prove that she has <em>been</em> there, lived there, dwelled there; that the ghostly women she conjures up eluded even those they were standing before, plain as day. Rhys wrote to keep from becoming a ghost.</p> <p><em>• </em>I Used to Live Here Once: The Haunted Life of Jean Rhys is published by William Collins (£25).

It’s been sitting [in the Senate] for two years,” Kerr said. “There’s a reason they won’t vote on it: to hold onto power.”</p> \n<p>By the end of the press conference, Kerr was too angry to continue. “It’s pathetic. I’ve had enough,” he said and walked out the room.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/07/steve-kerr-golden-state-warriors-trump-nba-china\">Coach v the White House: inside Steve Kerr’s extraordinary feud with Donald Trump</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kerr, along with figures such as his mentor, Gregg Popovich, and star players LeBron James and Chris Paul, is one of the moral centers of the NBA. It’s no surprise that gun violence is such an emotive topic for Kerr. <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a32561473/steve-kerr-father-malcolm-kerr-death-true-story/\">His father was shot dead</a> in Beirut in 1984. Kerr was playing college basketball in Arizona at the time, and the incident has defined much of his life.</p> \n<p>“There are a few issues that I am particularly passionate about, one being gun control,” he told me when I spoke to him for my book <a href=\"https://www.akashicbooks.com/events-tag/we-matter-athletes-and-activism/\">We Matter: Athletes and Activism</a>. “My father was murdered, so gun control is always something that I am very passionate about, and that was really the first issue that I brought up with the media years ago.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/us/uvalde-texas-elementary-school-shooting-wednesday/index.html\">According to CNN</a>, the 18-year-old gunman in the Texas shooting had legally purchased two assault rifles and ammunition for his birthday in the days before the massacre. The gunman accused of the murders in Buffalo is also 18 and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/us/buffalo-mass-shooting-guns-suspect/index.html\">had also legally bought assault rifles</a>, one of which he is alleged to have used in the killings. Why any teenager needs – or is allowed – to own an assault rifle is beyond belief. Politicians, as usually, offered empty words after the Texas shooting. Republican Tony Gonzales, who represents Texas’ 23rd Congressional District, which includes Uvalde, tweeted a message in which he said: “I know the people of Uvalde. I love them. There are absolutely no words to describe the pain our community is carrying right now.” This is the same politician <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-who-represents-uvalde-ripped-twitter-response-gun-support-1709755\">who in March 2021 tweeted that</a>: “I am a proud supporter of the 2nd Amendment and will do everything I can to oppose gun grabs from the far Left”.</p> \n<p>All of this speaks directly to the heart of Kerr’s frustration and why he was livid at his press conference on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>“I’m so tired of getting up here and offering condolences to the devastated families that are out there. I’m so tired,” Kerr said. “Excuse me. I’m sorry. I’m tired of the moments of silence. Enough.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ade80cb6d5c044df92a065e9b6b35ae3150ee7a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ade80cb6d5c044df92a065e9b6b35ae3150ee7a/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Kerr makes his emotional statement before the Warriors’ playoff game in Dallas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Kerr makes his emotional statement before the Warriors’ playoff game in Dallas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Strazzante/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Warriors ended up losing the game to the Mavericks 119-109, but Kerr’s bravery was not lost on the Warriors players. Golden State’s star guard Stephen Curry retweeted his coach’s entire pre-game press conference, along with the caption: “Watch this as much as you watch the game tonight.”</p> \n<p>Curry followed up that tweet with further praise for Kerr. “I appreciate his leadership. It’s on everybody’s mind coming into the game,” Curry said. “It’s kinda hard to stay focused on playing basketball. It happened in this state. I got kids, take them to school every day, drop them off.”</p> \n<p>His teammate Damion Lee agreed after the game. “It’s just sad. You saw Steve’s pregame presser. Those are my exact same sentiments,” Lee said. “It’s sad the world we live in. We need to reform that. It’s easier to get a gun than baby formula. It’s unbelievable.”</p> \n<p>As a former player I can attest to the fact that trust and respect are crucial to the relationship between player and coach. During my interview with Coach Kerr in my book, he explained how he gives players the freedom to be who they are and discussed with me topics his team are passionate about.</p> \n<p>He supported his players when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/25/golden-state-warriors-visit-obama-white-house\">they refused to visit the White House</a> while Donald Trump was in office, and backed them when they spoke out about racism and police brutality. Indeed, Kerr himself has had his own battles with Trump and attacked the former president’s proposed ban on refugees and travelers from some Muslim-majority countries in 2017.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I would just say that as someone whose family member was a victim of terrorism, having lost my father, if we’re trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to this country, by really going against the principles of what our country is about and creating fear, it’s the wrong way of going about it,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/30/steve-kerr-terror-father-trump-travel-ban\">said Kerr at the time</a>.</p> \n<p>He told me how that desire to listen to players is reciprocated when he is passionate about something like gun control. He told me the Warriors have team discussions, share opinions, learn from each other, and how that benefits them as a team. In that sense, Kerr is treating his team like a second family. “International issues and societal issues and political views were discussed at the dinner table [when Kerr was growing up],” Warriors assistant coach Bruce Fraser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/08/steve-kerr-golden-state-warriors-coach-political-views\">told the Guardian in 2018</a>.</p> \n<p>Players and coaches supporting each other as they speak out on topics they value is important as they seek to make positive changes in society.

Talking to him, it’s clear he hasn’t had time to reflect on the run of form that’s made the Kent opener the leading batsman in the country, and won him a call-up for the County Select XI to play New Zealand on Thursday.</p> <p>“It’s all been so relentless that I don’t think it’s really sunk in,” he says. “I’ve just been busy trying to stay in the moment.” Compton has played nine games in nine weeks, and made 129 against Essex, 104 not out and 115 against Lancashire, 89 against Hampshire, 93 against Yorkshire, 47 and 63 not out against Surrey, 140 and 68 not out against Northants. With 878 County Championship runs at an average of 109 he must worry that if he thinks too hard about it he’ll wake himself up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/25/cricket-statistics-moneyball-andy-zaltzman-the-spin\">The Spin | Cricket stats give us deep joy, but can never reflect the game’s true drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This time just last year, Compton was playing for Plumtree in the Nottinghamshire Premier League, against Radcliffe-on-Trent, Cavaliers &amp; Carrington, and Kimberley Institute, picking off runs against club bowlers who had played for a minor county, or had a match or two in first-class cricket. Compton was one of them himself. He came here from South Africa when he was 19. In 10 years of trying to get ahead in English cricket, he’d played five first class matches for Nottinghamshire, when he’d made 98 runs at an average of 14 and a top score of 20.</p> <p>The rest of the time, Compton was playing for Wimbledon, or Richmond, or Plumtree, or slogging away in the county second XIs. Now he’s taking hundreds off some of the best attacks in the country. “I understand it comes across like I’ve come from nowhere,” Compton says, “People ask me where I’ve been and I try to explain that I had two-and-half years at Notts and that I was the leading run scorer in the country in second-team cricket for the last couple of years. It’s just that it’s all been away from first-team level.”</p> <p>After Nottinghamshire let Compton go at the end of last summer he went out to play for the Mountaineers in Zimbabwe. Since then he’s made 1,357 first class runs at an average of 97, and another 360 at 52 in one-day cricket. At Nottinghamshire, he had been competing with Haseeb Hameed, who the club had signed at the same time, and he found first-team opportunities were so rare that he “felt like I was batting for my life”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"870cce76b6cc2f4f31602abf7ab0e744cf20a17d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/870cce76b6cc2f4f31602abf7ab0e744cf20a17d/65_72_4963_2978/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Compton hits out against Yorkshire at Headingley.

It helped that Kent, who knew Compton from a spell in their second XI, were so clear about what they wanted from him. They needed a steady left-handed batsman. “I can’t promise,” he told them, “but I think I can do that for you.”</p> <p>You can understand why Compton had felt so desperate at Nottinghamshire. He had been waiting six years for that chance to prove to himself, and everyone else, that he could do it. “I knew I wanted to be a pro in England,” says Compton. “The dream was there from a young age but what was difficult for me was that I was on the outside for such a long time. Trying to earn an opportunity was something I really found difficult. I just didn’t get a chance.</p> <p>“I was just playing club cricket, trying to show what I could do, and doing a lot of work behind the scenes to make sure that my game was in good order. But the reality is county teams look to recruit from their academies, and as a guy coming from the outside it feels like you’ve sort of got to do twice as well as those guys to get the opportunity.”</p> <p>Hampshire gave him a couple of second XI games, so did Durham, but it never led to a contract. A lot of people would have given up. Compton stuck with it “because I felt very firmly that this was what I wanted to do, but those younger years, 20 to 24 were very tough.” He gave himself until he was 26, and the end of the Open University degree he was studying for. In the meanwhile, he survived on what he earned in club cricket, and by coaching. Nottinghamshire got him just in time. When that didn’t work out, he was lucky Kent were smart enough to take a chance on him.</p> <p>This isn’t just a story about Compton, but about opportunity in English cricket. If you don’t know, or hadn’t already guessed, he is part of one of the great cricketing dynasties. His father, uncle, and great uncle all played first-class cricket, his cousin, Nick, played for England, Somerset, and Middlesex, and his grandfather, Denis, was (of course) one of the greatest batsmen who ever played the game. He died when Ben was three so he only knows him “through stories, and family chats, or old guys telling me: ‘Oh I watched your grandfather in 1947’”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-spin\" name=\"the-spin\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-spin\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-spin\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nick was his role model growing up. Imagine having all that going for you and still finding it so hard to break your way into the game because you didn’t come up through the usual route. Now imagine how much harder again it must be for all the players out there who don’t have one of the most famous names in the sport behind them, or access to a network of family connections, or the ability to support themselves on what they can earn in club cricket. There are a lot of them out there.</p> <p>Compton has played with and against some himself. “I know a lot of guys who decided to move on, lads who ended up out of the sport by 24, when, realistically, the prime years for a batsman start when they’re 27 and you really begin to understand your game,” he says. “I always felt like I was doing all the right things, it just wasn’t in the place where people were looking.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/26/grantham-statue-margaret-thatcher-striking-miners","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"My home town doesn’t need a fawning monument to Margaret Thatcher | Frances Ryan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/26/grantham-statue-margaret-thatcher-striking-miners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/26/grantham-statue-margaret-thatcher-striking-miners","fields":{"headline":"My home town doesn’t need a fawning monument to Margaret Thatcher","trailText":"Grantham can do much better than this – an Iron Lady statue facing off with a bronze poll tax protester would be more fitting","body":"<p>You could say I grew up under the shadow of Margaret Thatcher. Raised in Grantham, Lincolnshire, I went to Thatcher’s former primary school, a mix of brick and portable buildings that by the 1990s were a fitting symbol of a decade of her underfunding. I went on to attend her old secondary school, both of us moving from near the street where her father once ran a grocery shop to the opportunity of the leafy state grammar. For seven years, I ate my lunch in the dining hall named after her – and only choked on my sandwich once.</p> <p>Until this month, though, Grantham noticeably had no monument to Thatcher. You could walk through the town centre and see more charity shops than references to an ex-PM.<strong> </strong>In contrast, Sir Isaac Newton, who went to school in Grantham, has long been immortalised in brass, and even had the local shopping centre named after him – and no, it doesn’t just sell apples. The storm that has emerged since Thatcher’s long-delayed statue was erected last week is a clear lesson as to why. Within two hours of its installation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/15/margaret-thatcher-statue-grantham-egged-within-hours-of-it-being-installed?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">a man was seen egging it</a>. The £300,000 statue, made by the sculptor Douglas Jennings, had already been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/05/margaret-thatcher-bronze-statue-to-be-erected-in-grantham?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">rejected by Westminster council</a> in 2018 to stand next to parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/16/margaret-thatcher-statue-egging-university-of-leicester-staff-member\">Leicester University ‘does not condone’ staff member egging Thatcher statue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Grantham agreed to give the (bronze) iron lady a home, it did so on the quiet; the planned £100,000 unveiling ceremony was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/mar/02/grantham-council-wont-pay-for-thatcher-statue-unveiling\">ditched after a local outcry</a>. The council was so concerned by the prospect of political activists making a<strong> </strong>pilgrimage<strong> </strong>for the town, it placed the statue on a 3-metre (10ft) high plinth to make it more difficult for protesters to damage. One desperate local Tory councillor suggested protecting Thatcher from vandals by<strong> </strong>placing the statue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/05/margaret-thatcher-bronze-statue-to-be-erected-in-grantham?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">in a pond</a> (this is a sign of respect in Lincolnshire).</p> <p>You don’t have to be a raging Thatcherite to think there should be a monument to her in her home town. Some argue that Grantham producing Britain’s first female prime minister is something that should be marked with a statue, regardless of the ideology. There’s a certain sense in this. The Thatcher exhibition in Grantham’s museum attracts tourists – and their cash – from all over the world and many reportedly long asked why there wasn’t a statue. As Nick Jones, a trustee of the museum told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/22/margaret-thatcher-statue-splits-birthplace-of-grantham?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">the Guardian</a>: “The primary attraction is Margaret. I’d like to say it’s the Isaac Newton exhibition, but he doesn’t bring them in.” Sure, Newt, you were a key figure in the Enlightenment and helped to give the world infinitesimal calculus but did you ever sell off a nation’s council housing stock?</p> <p>The problem with the “historical importance” argument is that statues are not simply commemorative – they are celebratory. Thatcher, erected 10ft in the air with her lofty gaze presiding over passers-by, has – quite literally – been placed on a pedestal. To be immortalised in bronze is to be given an honour, one that signifies (or at least suggests) local pride in the person and aligns the area with their legacy. That’s why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">toppling of statues of slave owners</a> became synonymous with the Black Lives Matter movement. The residents of Bristol didn’t want<strong> </strong>to write these figures out of history – they just didn’t want to carry on lauding them.</p> <p>Statues are, by definition, static – they take a point of history and freeze it, staying revered and unmoved as society’s values change. In many ways, they are a particularly conservative snapshot of history, taking the viewpoint of the establishment and promoting it as the final narrative. There is a reason we got a statue of Thatcher and not a striking miner. Thatcher being a woman does not make any of this more progressive – she is immortalised for the high street just as bigots and warmongers are up and down this country.</p> <p>Grantham’s dilemma over<strong> </strong>Thatcher in many ways speaks to the bigger question of how towns and residents deal with their complex past. The issue is never confined to the statue itself – it’s about what the statue represents. What is the legacy of the figure and what does the statue symbolise? What is it actually saying? Fairly or not, the style of the Thatcher monument hardly suggests a town ready to come to terms with the reality of her life’s work. Her hands clasped piously below her lap and draped in a robe, there hasn’t been a softer portrayal of the iron lady since Meryl Streep <a href=\"https://www.goldderby.com/article/2018/meryl-streep-the-iron-lady-oscar-win-best-actress/amp/\">won the Oscar</a>.<strong> </strong>That the local museum “contextualises” Thatcher’s premiership, including discussing her critics, will mean little to passers-by who see her statue looming over them, like a Midlands’ Maggie the Redeemer.</p> <p>I can’t help but think Grantham would be better off pulling down the statue and getting creative. If locals want a traditional monument, a statue of Thatcher facing off with a bronze poll tax protester would be more fitting to her spirit – and faults. Better yet, sell the valuable statue to one of her <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/16993217.jacob-rees-mogg-behind-margaret-thatcher-50-note-campaign/\">wealthy admirers</a> and use the cash to open an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/cacc0b40-c3a4-473b-86cc-11863c0b3f30\">LGBTQ+ youth centre</a> in her name. A statue that has to be hoisted up and shielded from the public’s touch is the ultimate example of how far removed monuments are from the communities they claim to be for. Our home town can do better than a fawning statue of Thatcher. Or we will all have egg on our faces.</p> <p>• Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He felt consumer energy prices could be lower if he removed the GST from power bills. Bugger the states. Perhaps Australia also needed a royal commission into the power companies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/peter-dutton-pledges-to-make-liberal-party-a-broad-church-as-he-confirms-leadership-tilt\">Peter Dutton pledges to make Liberal party a ‘broad church’ as he confirms leadership tilt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The intermittent smiling and the rollercoaster pitch didn’t get him there. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/24/scott-morrison-to-become-australian-pm-as-turnbull-denounces-insurgency\">Morrison got the numbers, got the prime ministership</a>, won an election, then failed upwards. Last Saturday, the Liberal party was trounced in its progressive metropolitan heartland because the personal brand Morrison cultivated had turned toxic.</p> <p>If the Liberal party had full control of its destiny, or if there were a suite of viable options, this political movement would not be presenting a fresh leadership team of Dutton and Barnaby Joyce as the answer to Saturday’s electoral rout, because – how can I put this politely? – that would be nuts.</p> <p>The next leader of the Liberal party was supposed to be Josh Frydenberg. Dutton would have wanted the opposition leadership, and fought Frydenberg for it, but I strongly suspect Frydenberg would have won. Senior moderates have been steeling themselves for the ascension of Dutton for weeks given the likelihood that Frydenberg would lose Kooyong.</p> <p>Colleagues have been telling themselves Dutton is more complicated than the performative absurdity he carries on with. Yes, Dutton can be a parody of a hardman, a Saturday Night Live sketch, but he’s actually bright, personable and competent when he clocks off from playing the role of Peter Dutton. He’s not sneaky. He’s straightforward.</p> <p>Colleagues also tell themselves and each other that Dutton will need to refashion himself into a plausible portrait of putative prime ministership, and that will be an automatic stabiliser to any wholesale lurch to the right.</p> <p>There are a couple of problems with this thesis. The first is this optimism overlooks recent history. Dutton is not going into the prime ministership, where prime ministerial tone is required; he’s going into opposition. The Coalition has craved high visibility contrast in opposition, alpha male swagger, burning the village to save the village.</p> <p>Perhaps Dutton has the credibility and clout within his faction to repudiate Tony Abbott’s playbook. Anything is possible. But this would be one hell of a shapeshift. Dutton, like Abbott, is a ferocious partisan. This cohort of politician tends to think that ends justify means.</p> <p>Dutton’s record in public life in fact speaks only to ferocious partisanship: Manchurian candidates, Chinese spy ships, late campaign boat arrivals. This reckless, destructive, self-serving caper might delight 2GB and the Sky News nightshift, but Canberra’s defence and intelligence establishment felt the need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/25/australia-louder-than-we-should-have-been-in-criticising-china-says-former-asio-chief\">distance themselves</a> from Dutton’s ripping yarns in a way I’ve not seen in more than two decades of political reporting.</p> <p>Anthony Albanese did inject an ameliorating character assessment after Dutton finally confirmed on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/peter-dutton-pledges-to-make-liberal-party-a-broad-church-as-he-confirms-leadership-tilt\">that his big moment had arrived</a>.</p> <p>Albanese said Dutton was a trustworthy character; someone who kept counsel when necessary and did what they said they would do – an assessment that rings true. This quality certainly isn’t everything, but it is something in Australia’s tortured, brutal, half-unhinged politics.</p> <p>The test will be whether Dutton persists with these positive character traits when he’s on the path to the biggest prize in politics. Dutton has just watched Albanese (the former Tory fighter) win the prime ministership with a political strategy that wasn’t entirely about winner-takes-all. Dutton is human. Perhaps he can learn.</p> <p>In any case, Dutton’s got a huge job ahead. The remaining Liberal moderates have zero interest in being shackled to a doctrine of numpty populism espoused by the faux everyman of Australia’s Trump-lite political right – seeing that as a recipe for permanent opposition.</p> <p>They will want Dutton to grapple with hard electoral arithmetic – the reality that the Liberals can’t lose six or more heartland seats in major cities and then expect to form majority government in the future.</p> <p>Some rightwingers will want Dutton to push through with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/the-red-wall-and-what-it-means-for-australias-election-campaign\">strategy Morrison tried and failed to execute</a> in the 2022 campaign: writing off metropolitan professionals and grabbing outer suburban and regional seats from Labor. They’ll think Dutton is a better frontman for that strategy, and that’s probably right in theory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/scott-morrison-confirms-he-will-remain-in-politics-after-election-defeat\">Scott Morrison confirms he will remain in politics after election defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dutton will also fancy his capacity to bounce off a new Labor government trying to avoid the crosshairs of a progressive parliament. Dutton’s experience will tell him just as the election of 2022 is a correction to the poll of 2019, 2025 can be a correction to the centrist progressivism of 2022 if Albanese can’t keep his agenda on an even keel.</p> <p>So there’s opportunity, and opportunity consistent with Dutton’s political brand. But managerially, Dutton has the significant challenge of keeping his own house in order. The remaining Liberal moderates want to refill the broad church rather than empty it, and if the new leader tacks too far right, he could easily split his own party.</p> <p>Dutton is opening by trying to walk all sides of the street.</p> <p>He told his old mate Ray Hadley on Thursday morning: “The Liberal party has to get back to being the Liberal party, the broad church, making sure we represent all Australians but with a particular focus on people out in the suburbs, people who are doing it tough, people who are struggling to fill up the cars at the moment, people who are working hard and getting nowhere.”</p> <p>A head pat for the right. A head pat for the left.</p> <p>Hadley tried to prompt him to declare a side. The Sydney shock jock thought the Liberals under Dutton might be a broad church with “a conservative leaning”. Dutton didn’t take the bait. He said he was a suburban guy who had remained true to his values, but he’d learned during the Howard era that things worked best when there was a fusion of views between wets and dries.</p> <p>On Thursday there was no reference to smiling more, or scratch royal commissions into power companies. Dutton said he wasn’t an extreme rightwinger. He wasn’t religious. He was the leader of the Liberal party, not the moderate conservative party or the conservative moderate party.</p> <p>Dutton’s locution this time was about showing Australian voters the complete character. Leadership furnished that opportunity.</p> <p>Well, Peter. By all means.</p> <p>We’re watching. Bring it on.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2022/may/25/texas-school-shooting-news-victims-uvalde-elementary-school-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T06:32:45Z","webTitle":" Texas school shooting: gunman was inside for 40 minutes, officials say – updates as they happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/25/texas-school-shooting-news-victims-uvalde-elementary-school-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2022/may/25/texas-school-shooting-news-victims-uvalde-elementary-school-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":" Texas school shooting: gunman was inside for 40 minutes, officials say – updates as they happened","trailText":"Texas governor and local officials share more details about the shooting at the Robb elementary school in Uvalde","body":"<div id=\"block-628f16998f08e646defae23a\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-26T06:00:48.883Z\">7.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It is the early hours of Thursday morning in Uvalde, where residents are still reeling after Tuesday’s school shooting.</p> \n  <p>Here are the latest developments and what we know so far:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The young victims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-victims\">have now been identified.</a> </strong>A law enforcement official said all victims were in<strong> </strong>the same fourth-grade classroom at the Robb Elementary School. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>The 18-year-old gunman charged into one classroom where he barricaded himself by locking the door, forcing a staff member to open the room with a key</strong> after Border Patrol agents struggled to breach the classroom door, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told the Associated Press. Earlier, Lt. Christopher Olivarez of the Department of Public Safety told CNN the gunman “barricaded himself by locking the door and just started shooting children and teachers that were inside that classroom”.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>About “40 minutes or so” elapsed from when the gunman opened fire on the school security officer and when the Border Patrol team shot him</strong>, Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Onlookers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/25/texas-school-shooting-news-victims-uvalde-elementary-school-latest-updates?page=with:block-628ee0f58f084f9a73ca6540#block-628ee0f58f084f9a73ca6540\">reportedly urged police officers to charge into the school.</a> </strong>Juan Carranza, 24, who saw the scene unfold from outside his house across the street, told the Associated Press he felt arriving officers should have entered the school sooner. Javier Cazares, whose daughter, Jacklyn Cazares, was killed in the attack, said he raced to the school and arrived while police were still massed outside the building. “Let’s just rush in because the cops aren’t doing anything like they are supposed to,” he recalled. “More could have been done.”</li> \n   <li>However, <strong>US Border Patrol chief Raul Ortiz said a</strong><strong>gents “didn’t hesitate” when responding to the shooting. “</strong>They didn’t hesitate. They came up with a plan. They entered that classroom and they took care of the situation as quickly as they possibly could,” he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than 100 federal officers responded to Uvalde school shooting, </strong>Ortiz added. “When it was all said and done, we had over 80 officers immediately on the scene, and then right after that, 150 or so officers converged on this area,” he told CNN. Those officers came from several divisions, including the Border Patrol, Air and Marine Operations and Homeland Security Investigations.</li> \n   <li><strong>Before attacking the school, the gunman shot and wounded his grandmother at her home.</strong> Neighbours called police when she staggered outside and they saw she had been shot in the face, Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Travis Considine said.</li> \n   <li><strong>The gunman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/texas-school-shooting-gunman-facebook\">sent three online messages</a> <strong>in the half-hour before the mass shooting, </strong></strong><strong>according to the governor of Texas, Greg Abbot. </strong>In the first message, he wrote that he was going to shoot his grandmother. The second message reportedly confirmed that he had shot her and in the last note, sent about 15 minutes before he reached Robb Elementary, he said he was going to shoot up an elementary school.</li> \n   <li><strong>The private, one-to-one messages were sent via Facebook</strong>, and were “discovered after the terrible tragedy,” company spokesman Andy Stone said. He said Facebook is cooperating with investigators.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The gunman had legally bought the rifle and a second one like it last week, just after his birthday</strong>, authorities said.<br></li> \n   <li>Investigators have so far shed no light on the motive for the attack.</li> \n   <li><strong>Community members attended a prayer vigil Wednesday evening at the Uvalde County Fairplex Arena.</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Authorities in Texas have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/texas-school-shooting-republican-leaders-respond\">called for more

A key difference between the Daniel Defense rifle and the military version is that the military weapon can switch to fully automatic or fire a three-round burst depending on the model.</p> \n   <p>AR-15-type rifles can be purchased for as little as $400, but the Daniel Defense rifle is on the high-end of around $2,000 or more. These rifles can also be financed, with customers paying less than $100 a month.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Photos of the shooter’s guns suggest he also had purchased a battery-powered holographic sight, which allows a shooter to hit targets more quickly, the AP reported. The gunman legally purchased two rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition last week after his 18th birthday, officials say. </p> \n  <p>USA Today <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2022/05/25/guns-used-uvalde-shooting-prompt-outcry-could-lead-lawsuits/9929998002/\">reported</a> that Daniel Defense could face years of costly litigation following the shooting, and that the company has ties to military production. The paper noted that Daniel Defense’s name no longer appeared on the list of exhibitors scheduled for the NRA’s annual conference in Texas this week, and a company spokesman told USA Today: “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and community devastated by this evil act.”</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

Ted Cruz, the US senator from Texas, said just a few hours after the school attack that the best way to keep kids safe was to have armed law enforcement present on campus.</p> \n  <p>Ken Paxton, Texas’s attorney general, told the rightwing news outlet Newsmax that the way to save lives was to have “teachers and other administrators who have gone through training and who are armed”.</p> \n  <p>Their arguments were belied, however, by the facts of the Uvalde massacre. As the shooter entered the elementary school, two local police officers and a school guard opened fire in an attempt to stop him, but failed to do so, allowing him to carry on with his gruesome plans.</p> \n  <p>In recent years Texas has led the US in its lax approach to gun controls with a steady stream of initiatives loosening restrictions on firearms ownership. Last year its Republican governor Greg Abbott <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=87R&amp;Bill=HB1927\">enacted a law</a> that removed almost all restraints on carrying handguns in public – despite the fact that Texas has been the scene of several of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/el-paso-shooting\">most horrifying mass shootings</a> in US history.</p> \n  <p>Biden and other campaigners for greater gun controls face the numbing reality that in the US there are more firearms in circulation than there are people. The pandemic has seen a dramatic uptick in gun sales, and with it a surge in violent gun deaths.</p> \n  <p>In the last decade there have been at least 3,500 mass shootings defined as incidents killing or injuring four or more people, according to the <a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/\">Gun Violence Archive</a>. The rate of deaths of children under 14 has also <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/mortality-dashboard.htm\">risen sharply</a> since the pandemic.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element

And again, just begin shooting numerous children and teachers that were in that classroom. Having no regard for human life, just a complete evil person, by not having any regard for children, anyone that’s inside that classroom, just began shooting anyone that was in his way.</p> \n   <p>At that point we had a tactical law enforcement team arrived, made up of multiple federal officers, local officers as well as state troopers. They were able to make forcible entry into that classroom. They were met with gunfire as well, but they were able to shoot and kill that suspect.

The opening of his nonfiction breakthrough, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/03/the-adversary-emmanuel-carrere-jean-claude-romand-shelf-life-rachel-cooke\">The Adversary</a> (translated by Linda Coverdale), juxtaposes spree killer Jean-Claude Romand murdering his family with Carrère attending a parent-teacher meeting, as if determined to occupy, rather than bridge, the gap between author and subject. His biography of Philip K Dick, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/04/featuresreviews.guardianreview15\">I Am Alive and You Are Dead</a> (translated by Timothy Bent), eerily collapses that same distance, constructing for Dick a paranoid inner life so intimate that it feels claustrophobic. Now comes Yoga, with a cast both real and invented.</p> <p>One way to understand Carrère’s oeuvre is to dispense with the idea of him as the author of discrete works. His books, each of which draws on and augments what has gone before, are a single, interrelated project, the subject of which is the project itself – its fraught emergence, its blurred limits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we last saw Carrère, at the conclusion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/24/the-kingdom-emmanuel-carrere-review-john-lambert\">The Kingdom</a>, he was on a Christian retreat, finding solace in the ritual washing of a stranger’s feet. The version of him we meet at the start of Yoga is ebullient. The Kingdom was a creative and professional high-water mark. “I was full of myself,” he says. “I was happy. I believed it would last.”</p> <p>He’s also, perhaps, trying to recapture The Kingdom’s<em> </em>alchemy of the personal and spiritual. Carrère, we learn, has long been a devotee of yoga and meditation. Now it has occurred to him that the subject would suit “a short, unpretentious book in a conversational tone” – one that, given yoga’s popularity, “could sell like hot cakes”. On the hunt for material, he signs up for 10 days of silent vipassana meditation, deep in the French heartland.</p> <p>Initially, that “conversational tone” feels almost flippant. Apparently uninterested in differentiation, Carrère blitzes “eastern” thought into a distinctly beige stew. We get bits of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chogyam-Trungpa\">Chögyam Trungpa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Patanjali\">Patanjali</a>, tai chi, Iyengar yoga. When he first hears the voice of vipassana meditation’s Indian founder, <a href=\"https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/about/goenka\">SN Goenka</a>, Carrére is reminded, distastefully, of “the English of Peter Sellers in The Party”<em>.</em></p> <p>Carrère, though, is well attuned to his flaws. Directing his attention to the patterns of his breath, he finds a disturbing insight into his mode of being. According to yoga, says Carrère, “inhaling … is taking, conquering, appropriating, which I have no problem with at all. In fact, I can’t do anything else … Exhaling is different. It’s giving rather than taking, returning rather than keeping. It’s letting go.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>From its deceptively glib beginnings, Yoga’s inexorable emotional arc has been obvious</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We can glimpse, here, the project Carrère envisaged – chatty, replete with bankable insights, destined to sell like hot cakes. It is not to be. When terrorists attack the offices of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/charlie-hebdo-attack\">Charlie Hebdo</a><em>, </em>killing one of his friends, Carrère’s retreat is cut short. Briefly, yet another book seems possible, one hinging on easy oppositions between asceticism and engagement, pacifism and violence. But Carrère nods towards the reductive, only to reject it. The Charlie Hebdo<em> </em>attack is not, in fact, Yoga’s<em> </em>defining crisis. Nor is it Carrère’s. “My life,” he writes, “which I believed to be so harmonious, so well fortified … was in fact heading for disaster. And this disaster did not come from external circumstances, cancer, a tsunami or the Kouachi brothers kicking open the door without warning and massacring everyone with Kalashnikovs. No: it came from me.”</p> <p>Carrère experiences a catastrophic mental breakdown. “Everything that’s ever mattered to me,” he says, “everything I’ve dreamed of, glory and mansions, love and wisdom, has lost all meaning.” He doesn’t just want to die, he wants “<em>to be dead</em>, to have never existed”. At the age of 60, having been happy for a decade, he is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, removed to a secure ward, and subjected to electroconvulsive therapy.</p> <p>Now Carrère’s need to inhale becomes not appropriative, but pained and poignant. Alienated from the person he thought he was, he tries to breathe himself back in. He reads his own psychiatric reports, where his “moral suffering” moves with terrifying swiftness from “significant” to “intolerable”. He goes back over his own work, searching for traces of the mania that was to come. He even reviews a glossy New York Times profile of himself, worrying away at the veneer of professional success, exhuming the personal nadir it thinly conceals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/13/97196-words-essays-emmanuel-carrere-review\">97,196 Words by Emmanuel Carrère review – essays from a French superstar writer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Carrère is drawn as if by sirens to extremes. Desperate for a “chance to get away from myself”, he retreats to a Greek island and finds himself teaching a small class of young refugees. From its deceptively glib beginnings, through the shocks and catastrophes that shake it, Yoga’s inexorable emotional arc has been obvious. And yet still the force of its final third, in which a fragile, agonisingly unhealed Carrère fills his psychic wound with the wounds of others, borders on the unbearable. One child recounts packing a small bag, alone, knowing he will never return home, and recalls his aunt telling him: “Stop crying, my boy. In life you have to leave everything, always, and in the end it’s life you have to leave, so there’s no use crying.” Another cannot even verbalise his trauma, and so simply hits his head repeatedly, wordlessly, against the desk. In Carrère’s helplessness, his stunned inadequacy, we finally see what he has offered us: not a self-portrait, but a collective one. Here, anatomised, is the white western capitalist everyman – wandering the aisles of the spiritual supermarket, shopping for garishly packaged bliss, in terror of a threat from without, blind to the threat from within, and wholly, tragically incapable of incorporating into his reality the very subject of all the diluted eastern spirituality with which he is so enamoured: the truth of suffering, the crushing inevitability of loss.</p> <p>“Life,” Carrère observes, “is a machine for separating people.” What, then, is the machine that brings them together? Carrère offers no easy answers. He doesn’t need to. His singular, ever-expanding work, in which one pain need never obscure another, in which truths and half-truths are held not in opposition but in delicate, precarious balance, is an answer in itself.</p> <p>• <em>Sam Byers’s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/come-join-our-disease-9780571360093\">Come Join Our Disease</a> is published by </em><em>Faber</em><em>.</em><em> Yoga by Emmanuel Carrère, translated by John Lambert, is published by Vintage (£16.99).

All forms of early, primitive or wild sheep either shed their wool or it falls out.</p> <p>“We bred them to have massive fleeces because of the wool trade; that was great, because wool was a fibre that was incredibly popular.

There was no home farm, so I just looked at what I thought made the most sense economically. Wool didn’t feature in that.</p> <p>“I am going to struggle to affect the price I sell a lamb for at the end, but I can affect the costs it takes me to get to the point of sale. By reducing the wool element and the jobs associated with it, I am reducing those costs,” says Edwards.</p> <p>A sheep’s fleece has the potential to be a serious welfare issue for the animal if it is not maintained and shorn every year. Wool-shedding sheep are more resistant to a condition called fly strike – where an animal is eaten alive by maggots that hatch in its fleece.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"947eb204e7b7c8f753fe6168948b39c2176b985a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947eb204e7b7c8f753fe6168948b39c2176b985a/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shed exlana wool in a field\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shed exlana wool in a field.

His raps and rap sheet captivated the internet. His breakout success was immediately and intricately tied up with the horrifying domestic abuse, which, in that moment, didn’t seem to bother Onfrey in the slightest. His celebratory squeal, which the film plays against the haunting and twisted sounds of Look at Me, leaves knots in the stomach.</p> <p>“Every day was an ethical quandary,” says Look at Me’s director, Sabaah Foloyan. She’s describing her experience grappling with the legacy left behind by the Billboard-topping artist, who was murdered at 20 during a 2018 gunpoint robbery. Before she got involved, Foloyan says she set her terms with the film’s producers, who include Onfrey’s mother, Cleo Bernard, and his manager, Solomon Sobande. She said the documentary about the Florida musician would have to honestly confront “the good, the bad and the ugly”, including the assault and battery allegations that Onfrey publicly denied while he was alive.</p> <p>“Women don’t have any incentive to lie about abuse allegations,” says Foloyan, declaring a stance that’s diametrically opposed to all the toxic XXXTentacion stans who trolled and terrorized Ayala on social media, refusing to believe what she endured at Onfrey’s hands. Foloyan says she half-expected Bernard and Sobande to be scared off from her position. Instead, they embraced her take on Onfrey’s story, which isn’t simply about a celebrity behaving badly.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJVgJFzgdJU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uJVgJFzgdJU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Onfrey was diagnosed bipolar. He struggled with that openly in his music. Fans gravitated towards his vulnerability on hit songs like Sad, which gets into abusive and suicidal thoughts. His social media feed is also a live document of wildly erratic and violent behaviour, tearful pleas for empathy and heartfelt hopes for healing as he passed through various recording studios and detention centres. His is a story about mental illness, a predatory music industry that rewards bad behaviour and a carceral system that stands in the way of healing.</p> <p>Foloyan is uniquely suited to tell that story. She has been a mental health advocate at the Urban Justice Center and also worked at the Osborne Association, an organisation that assists individuals and families affected by the justice system. She has an intimate understanding of how the criminal justice system exacerbates the country’s mental health crisis – too many resources are directed towards incarceration instead of assistance and healing.</p> <p>Look at Me also makes for an interesting follow-up to Foloyan’s first film, Whose Streets?, which was about the protests in Ferguson fafter the shooting death of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. Whose Streets? homed in on the power social media gave the community to organize and demand justice for a Black teen. Look at Me is about how social media brought out the monster in a Black teen who didn’t have access to the help he needed.</p> <p>In Look at Me’s early scenes, we see Onfrey as social media savvy in the worst ways. He would live-stream his vicious attacks because he knew they would get people to notice both him and his Soundcloud account. He had his friends create multiple online accounts to engage people in his music and tweak algorithms in his favour. As previously mentioned, his arrest after leaving Ayala battered landed him millions of followers, a new manager and a record deal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f62ce1f84720143b5a8bdcf6ba32e8ab6db81c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f62ce1f84720143b5a8bdcf6ba32e8ab6db81c7/124_0_1687_1013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Onfrey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> Look Aat Me is about how social media brought out the monster in a Black teen who didn’t have access to the help he needed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Hulu/Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is also the story of hip-hop. The genre was born to represent, uplift and empower but it also has the tendency to glamorise misogyny and violence.</p> <p>“These young people are responding to what sells,” says Foloyan, explaining that young talents like Onfrey can’t calculate how their contributions affect society. “They’re responding to what is incentivised on a very basic level. I think it’s a question of who are the adults in the room? … Who is really profiting off of the way that this culture is shaped? I do think a lot of responsibility needs to be taken by the people who hold structural and trendsetting power.”</p> <p>I asked Foloyan how much responsibility falls on Onfrey’s manager, Sobande, who entered the scene while the teen was doing his six-month bid, and whether there’s something predatory about the documentary he is producing, which could be accused of finding yet another avenue to profit off bad behaviour.</p> <p>“Solomon’s perspective is that he was an advocate for a young man who was really, really troubled and really, really talented,” says Foloyan, who adds that she isn’t ready to assign blame to anyone. “But I think that this person’s manager and representative is a part of that overall machine. Solomon came into this situation without really much clout. He was acting out of survival and personal ambition. That’s a little bit different than someone who is sitting on top and greenlighting and financing certain things.”</p> <p>Foloyan’s refusal to place blame is true to an overall ethos she brings to this conversation. She doesn’t find blame helpful or constructive. She feels the same way about condemnations against Onfrey online, which she likens to posturing rather than problem solving.</p> <p>“We have an unevolved revenge-based carceral reaction when something bad happens,” says Foloyan. “We run to a corner, raise our flag and say, ‘I’m on this side. This is what I believe. Look at how right I am.’ But what happens in this situation is Geneva was left out to dry. She was unprotected and unsupported, even with all the energy that was put behind canceling him. The energy that was put behind canceling him ended up magnifying him further.</p> <p>“What we’re really doing is just consuming people’s pain as entertainment,” Foloyan adds, acknowledging that this conversation also resonates with the way the public is digesting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/22/metoo-is-over-if-we-dont-listen-to-imperfect-victims-like-amber-heard\">Amber Heard and Johnny Depp trial</a>, which has inspired memes and TikTok parodies mocking the former for not being the perfect victim. “Our public scrutiny is not always constructive. And I think that it’s more constructive if we were a little bit more curious about our own lives and the people around us. Because we have a situation where survivors are unprotected and unsupported.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Look at Me: XXXTentacion is now available on Hulu in the US with a UK date to be announced</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/may/26/support-staff-at-no-10-subjected-to-bullying-for-years-union-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Support staff at No 10 ‘subjected to bullying for years’, union claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/26/support-staff-at-no-10-subjected-to-bullying-for-years-union-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/may/26/support-staff-at-no-10-subjected-to-bullying-for-years-union-claims","fields":{"headline":"Support staff at No 10 ‘subjected to bullying for years’, union claims","trailText":"Sue Gray report found cleaners and security guards have been subjected to ‘lack of respect and poor treatment’","body":"<p>Support staff at No 10 and the Cabinet Office have been subjected to bullying and harassment for years, according to a union member in Whitehall.</p> <p>The claim comes after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/read-sue-grays-full-report-into-downing-street-parties\">Sue Gray’s report</a> into the Partygate scandal disclosed that cleaners and security guards have been subjected to a “lack of respect and poor treatment”, and yet felt “unable to raise [this] properly” with the authorities.</p> <p>A member of the Public and Commercial Service (PCS) union working in the Cabinet Office said: “The prime minister’s apology is too little, too late.

The owner, Liz Mitten Ryan, reckons the vaccine is a “bioweapon designed to reduce the population of the unaware and compliant”. She is, she says, awaiting the “great awakening” when “good will overtake evil”.

This counts as good news, sustainability-wise, but I would have been even happier if they’d gone to the local charity shop.</p> <p>I’ve loved a good chazza, as no one in Leith calls it, since I spent most of my childhood getting dragged around them. Coming across one of those rotating bookcases stuffed with Georgette Heyer and PD James paperbacks is a deeply Proustian experience for me. Charity shops are microcosms of our high streets, telling us all we need to know about the cut of a place’s jib. Anything that’s kind to the climate and mean to capitalism should be welcomed as warmly as a vintage porcelain boxer dog for £3. (No regrets.) There should really be a Great British Charity Shop Off on telly by now.</p> <p>I love them for their specificity, and the identi-kitsch that lies within: the dressmaking patterns, maps, mugs, dusty glassware, Jamie Oliver cookbooks and James Last records. When I go home to visit my dad and sister in south-west London, it’s all last season’s Margaret Howell and, no matter the decade, giant Monsoon dresses. The kind of charity shops Mary Portas once spruced up. Here in Leith, people do their actual shopping in them and as the cost of living crisis deepens, they will be used more. How appalling that it should fall, once again, to charities.</p> <p>They’re also where the best encounters happen. Yesterday I was examining a Count Basie record for scratches in my local British Heart Foundation shop when a middle-aged man tapped me on the shoulder. My first thought was: “HE WANTS TO TAKE MY £2 COUNT BASIE RECORD! NEVER!” Swiftly followed by: “HE WANTS TO MANSPLAIN JAZZ TO ME! NEVER!” Well, he wanted to let me know that in “the Bethany up the road there are three Basies, rare ones, £1.50 each”.

The city of Houston needs to kick them out,” said Woods, an activist and founder of Black Lives Matter Houston. “We have to be just as tough about these things as they are.”</p> <p>Woods is helping organize one of several protests planned just outside the George R Brown Convention Center, where NRA members will browse through exhibits of firearms and gun paraphernalia and hear speeches from key Republican leaders.</p> <p>The goal of the Black Lives Matter protest, Woods said, is to “get loud” outside while powerful speakers – including the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, Texas senator Ted Cruz and former US president Donald Trump – take the podium inside. Woods said the issue of firearms was particularly important to the civil rights group that primarily tackles issues of police brutality in America.</p> <p>“Whether it be death by suicide, death by cop, death by mass shooter, we need to control the access people have to deadly weapons,” Woods said. “These things are interconnected.”</p> <p>The NRA is a powerful lobbying organization in American politics, spending nearly $5m in 2021 to pressure lawmakers to oppose measures like universal background checks for gun sales and bans on powerful assault weapons.</p> <p>About 55,000 NRA members are expected to attend the event in Houston. The annual meeting is often a draw for activists and counter-protests as members inside discuss firearms policy – often the need for expanding access to guns.</p> <p>Outside the convention center, multiple counter-demonstrations are expected in Houston – especially in light of a mass shooting that killed 19 children and two adults at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.</p> <p>Houston police are also expecting crowds at the convention center. Jodi Silva, a police spokeswoman, said the department does not share details of its policing strategies, but that there would be a visible presence of officers.</p> <p>“We always are aware of the demonstrations and/or counter-demonstrations and staff accordingly,” Silva said. “We staff accordingly to make sure that everyone can participate and be safe.”</p> <p>Megan Hansen and the Rev Teresa Kim Pecinovsky watched the news updates from Uvalde on Tuesday in shock. When they found out the NRA would be in Houston Friday, they decided they also needed to take action.</p> <p>“We live in a state full of people who love their guns more than they love the lives of the children in their community,” Pecinovsky said. “I had to do something with that amount of rage and lament.”</p> <p>Hansen and Pecinovsky have organized an interfaith gathering that will include a silent march and a moment of reflection when organizers will read the names of those who died in Uvalde.</p> <p>While Texas’s politics are staunchly conservative, the Houston area has become a bastion of progressivism. Harris county, which includes Houston, voted for Joe Biden by 56% in 2020. Hansen said she wants others to know that the NRA’s message does not reflect that community.</p> <p>“Houston is the most diverse city in the United States and we have people from all over the world who do not agree with the rhetoric of the NRA,” Hansen said. “We want to just say, remember the people who we lost and how can we take this feeling and turn it into action?”</p> <p>That action – specifically legislative measures to restrict access to high-powered firearms – is unlikely to come from Republican lawmakers in the state. Yet activists in Houston want the shooting in Uvalde and protests this weekend to spark more pressure on political leaders to prevent the next tragedy.</p> <p>“I’m hopeful this will not just be something people attend and then leave,” Pecinovsky said. “It needs to be a catalyst for real and tangible change.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/may/26/cancelling-socrates-howard-brenton","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Cancelling Socrates: how the great philosopher sealed his fate with comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/26/cancelling-socrates-howard-brenton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/may/26/cancelling-socrates-howard-brenton","fields":{"headline":"Cancelling Socrates: how the great philosopher sealed his fate with comedy","trailText":"Playwright Howard Brenton asks why ancient Athens turned on its famous citizen, and how such an uncompromising free-thinker might fare in our own ‘age of rage’","body":"<p>Did Socrates “cancel” himself? At his trial in Athens, in 399BC, did he deliberately incense the jury with an outrageous comic speech to ensure they condemned him to death?</p> <p>Socrates was charged with denying the gods exist and inventing new ones, and of corrupting youth. Actually, Socrates was deeply religious and it was fighting dirty to accuse him of sacrilege. But powerful people had had enough of him. A scruffy 70-year-old man hanging out in public places surrounded by adoring pupils, teaching that a life unexamined is not worth living but we must learn we know nothing, corroded certainty. And certainty was what the city craved.</p> <p>The uncompromising voice of Socrates in a dangerous time resonates with our own “age of rage”. After Tom Littler, artistic director of the small but heavy-punching Jermyn Street theatre, proposed a Socrates play, I drafted a scene based on Plato’s dialogue Euthyphro – a hilarious encounter between Socrates and an upright Athenian citizen outside the law courts. Socrates came across as impish, empathic and provocative, great fun to write. Then his wife and the mother of their two sons, Xanthippe, and his lover Aspasia, the one powerful woman in Athenian politics we know of, took over the next scene. The play was up and running.</p> <p>Socrates never wrote anything, though in jail he composed poems based on Aesop’s fables. Or Plato says he did. And there is the problem: the four dialogues we have describing the trial and execution are vivid, shot through with humour and drama, yet they are suspect, distorted by Plato’s worldview. There is one other account of Socrates’ speech by Xenophon but it is a dull read and has nothing whatever in common with Plato’s. Plato is effectively our only source.</p> <p>Euthyphro, Defence of Socrates and Crito are thought to have been written near the time of the execution. A fourth dialogue, Phaedo, is obviously much later: Plato has Socrates believe in reincarnation, of which there is not a trace in the early works – but his intensely moving description of his teacher’s death and cryptic last words rings true. So, turn the glass this way and that and a very real Socrates emerges.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In bad times, cutting down tall poppies was an Athenian sport. And Socrates was a very tall poppy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Athenian democracy in 399BC was fragile. There had been a brutal coup by oligarchs in 411BC, which collapsed after a year. There was a second coup when Athens surrendered to Sparta in 404BC. Democracy was restored but national pride was deeply wounded. The economy was threatened: farms had been burned by Spartan troops and there were outbreaks of plague. People were angry, exhausted, and wanting to blame someone – in bad times, cutting down tall poppies was an Athenian sport.</p> <p>And Socrates was a very tall poppy. He was the most famous man in the city, but not universally popular. He only held public office once, for a day, as president of the Assembly. He used his vote to try to block the execution of six generals when the whole city was baying for their blood, arguing that their trial was illegal. He had a long, passionate relationship with his student Alcibiades, a war hero who defected, twice, first to Sparta then to Persia. He was wildly popular with the young, and parents worried he was leading their sons astray.</p> <p>The jury of 501 was probably merely out to clip his wings, narrowly condemning him on a first vote. The law allowed Socrates to propose an alternative punishment – exile, or a large fine – which the jury would accept and everyone would go home. But he did not ask for exile or a fine; instead he asked to be given free dinners for life by the state – an honour accorded to national heroes. Enraged, the jurors voted heavily to confirm the death sentence. Then, in jail, he refused to escape, arguing that to flee would destroy his reputation, and that he must honour the laws of the democracy, even though it be perverted by enemies.</p> <p>Was he testing the state to destruction by destroying himself? Or was it the culmination of a profound inquiry: does the soul survive death?

The ceiling is low, as is the temperature, and the granite walls are covered in engravings: overlapping patterns of wavy lines and psychedelic swirls, like giant notepad doodles etched in stone. We stumble slowly along the passage, peering at the carvings by torchlight. It feels a bit like being in an art gallery during a power cut – except here, the gallery in question is a 6,000-year-old burial chamber on an uninhabited island.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/may/2022-05-09T10:48:15.html\" data-alt=\"Vannes map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/may/2022-05-09T10:48:15.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“This is the Cairn de Gavrinis,” says my guide, Maude, as I emerge blinking into the French afternoon. “We call it the neolithic Sistine Chapel. It’s empty now, but we think it held the most important members of local stone age society.” I’ve come to the Gulf of Morbihan, a natural harbour speckled with more than 30 green islands on Brittany’s south coast, but I’ve been beaten to it by some six millennia. The cairn’s builders, and its original occupants, were here in an era so distant that the islands here weren’t islands at all, but low hills separated by rivers.</p> <p>The megalithic legacy left by these settlers, in the form of dolmens, stone circles and this richly decorated burial chamber – which sits at the heart of a mansion-sized cairn – is one of the bay’s chief attractions. But there are other good reasons to visit this relatively little-known corner of north-west France. If mention of the Brittany coastline throws up images of windblown cliffs and ferry ports, the Gulf of Morbihan turns such lazy generalisations on its head. Looking out from the mainland on my first morning, I’m greeted by a scene that seems to belong to another place entirely, with pink camellias and shaggy vegetation fringing a calm, glassy inlet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5216eda037ebcb250f5cd60d27123bb1c3bcf1bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5216eda037ebcb250f5cd60d27123bb1c3bcf1bc/0_8_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the cairn of Gavrinis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cairn de Gavrinis – the ‘neolithic Sistine Chapel’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tuul and Bruno Morandi/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gulf is no blink-and-you’ll-miss-it backwater. About 30 miles east of the seaport of Lorient, it’s more than 12 miles long and runs north-south for about seven miles. It opens into the Bay of Biscay, but is almost entirely enclosed by two long headlands, giving the gulf and its sleepy islands the feel of somewhere hidden from the wiles and waves of the ocean.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2e9dfb6432cafcb3d48fb00a8054488be262609\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2e9dfb6432cafcb3d48fb00a8054488be262609/426_171_4694_2816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cairn on Ile de Gavrinis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cairn is a prominent feature on Ile de Gavrinis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hemis/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I’m here to sample a new four-night walking itinerary offered by <a href=\"https://www.keadventure.com/holidays/self-guided-walking-on-brittany-south-coast-france\">KE Adventure</a>, an operator that made its name running trips to the Himalayas. This break is intentionally a far tamer affair, with an emphasis on slow days and quiet coastal paths: less K2 and crampons, more coffee and croissants. I’ve travelled here by train, initially by Eurostar to Paris, then on a two-and-half-hour ride to Vannes, the capital of Morbihan, a journey which seems in keeping with the whole no-rush experience. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I venture inland to reach the spectacular Neolithic tomb of the Dolmen de Penhap, where I’m the sole person present</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My base is the family-run <a href=\"https://www.hotel-parcfetan.com/\">Parc Fétan hotel</a> (swimming pool at the back, gooey brie de Meaux on the breakfast buffet), in the small mainland commune of Larmor-Baden. It’s a likable waterside village with bay views, a few seafood restaurants and a boulangerie that does fantastic baguettes, but only seems to open when you’re looking the other way.</p> <p>The hiking, too, is laid-back. My first full day is taken up with a gentle nine-mile wander along the shore, following a meandering, needle-strewn path that largely sticks to GR34, one of France’s official national trails. Giant cypresses and maritime pines arch overhead, while the gulf itself has an almost lake-like quality, with the odd fishing boat the only sign of life. Islands slumber off the beaches, low-slung and tree-cloaked.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5defff632000e91f43d11088f2047ea818450076\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5defff632000e91f43d11088f2047ea818450076/0_238_7170_4302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A village on Île-aux-Moines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A village on Île-aux-Moines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascale Gueret/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The walk is a combination of the familiar and the more exotic. The surface underfoot is laced with knobbly roots and scattered with pinecones. White-tailed bumblebees bump around beds of sea campion. Long-tailed tits jitter among the cypress boughs. Grebes dive offshore, robins hop across the path, and at one point – thrillingly – two <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/hoopoe/\">hoopoes</a> swoop overhead. I pass well-tended houses and a striped Breton flag flapping from a garden pole.

The bay has a handful of tidal islands – accessible by foot, but only at certain times. One, the plurally named Sept Îles, is part of the first day’s walk, while another, Berder, is factored in today. The timetable says it can be reached at 13.11; I brave the 100 metre crossing at 12.56 and arrive with wet socks. The island just two miles round,appears to be entirely uninhabited – although there is a locked chapel with morose gargoyles. Its trees are tall, bluebells grow in the grass, and the water in its coves is cold and clear. “Berder is <em>un bijou – </em>a jewel,” I’d been told that morning at the hotel. “It’s all about seeing life slowly.” And the visit is a precursor to my late-afternoon boat trip to Gavrinis, where it’s all about the prehistory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b82ab83a42cd1442a7b8037b46ee75a010154b1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b82ab83a42cd1442a7b8037b46ee75a010154b1d/0_0_4256_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view from Île-aux-Moines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view from Île-aux-Moines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claude Thibault/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gulf would make a fine short-break destination in its own right, thanks to the twin appeal of delicate light and ancient remains. The larger islands are all reachable by foot or boat – longer bay cruises are also available – and the concentration of megaliths (and accommodation) around the little town of Locmariaquer, on the gulf’s western shore is a further draw.</p> <p>Even as a walking holiday, this is a break more focused on pottering and puttering than clocking up the kilometres. There are terraces to linger on, which qualifies me to recommend <a href=\"https://www.bieresbretonnes.fr/brasseries/brasserie-kerblei-morbihan/\">Brasserie Kerblei</a> for local beer, and <a href=\"https://la-cidrerie.fr/\">Cidrerie du Golfe</a> for cider, enjoyed with Emmental-stuffed galettes.

Some 600 lucky souls live out here. Egrets step in the shallows; horse chestnuts tower over the paths. I stick mainly to the shaded, gorse-laden shore, but venture inland to reach the spectacular neolithic tomb Dolmen de Penhap, which I have to myself. Drizzle comes in, so I shelter on a wall under a blackthorn thicket. Somehow I nod off, and when I wake up the rain has gone and the whole harbour seems to zing with freshness.</p> <p>Folk have been drawn to this part of the French coast since at least 4,000 BC. Were their stone-carved swirls and zigzags some sort of tribute to the shifting watery landscapes they saw around them? We’ll never know.

I had both on-duty, off-duty, folks that were in a training environment all responded to this location,” Ortiz said, adding that between 80 and 100 officers responded.</p> \n<p>“They didn’t hesitate. They came up with a plan.

Authorities have said the victims were all killed in the same fourth-grade classroom, where the shooter barricaded himself inside.</p> \n<p>A high school dropout, Ramos lived in Uvalde and had no known criminal record or history of mental health problems, Abbott said.</p> \n<p>Investigators have also been scrutinizing an Instagram account that apparently belonged to the gunman. In the days before the shooting, posts featured a photo of a hand holding an ammunition magazine and another photo of two AR-15-style rifles. The account asked another Instagram user to share the latter photo with her 10,000 followers; she declined, saying it was “scary” and she barely knew him.</p> \n<p>On the morning of the massacre, the account linked to the attacker sent her an ominous message: “I’m about to.”</p> \n<p>Instagram declined to answer questions from the Associated Press about the postings.</p> \n<p>The latest mass shooting is likely to further intensify pressure on social media companies to heighten their scrutiny of online communications. The attack in Texas follows the shooting at a Buffalo grocery store less than two weeks ago, where the gunman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/buffalo-shooting-unease-in-new-zealand-as-live-stream-of-christchurch-inspired-attack-finds-foothold\">used social media</a> to plan, promote and live-stream the massacre that killed 10 people. The New York attorney general has since opened an investigation into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/twitch\">Twitch</a>, 4chan, 8chan and Discord along with other platforms the Buffalo shooter used to amplify the attack.</p> \n<p>Facebook’s parent company, Meta, has said it monitors people’s private messages for some kinds of harmful content, such as links to malware or images of child sexual abuse. But images can be detected using unique identifiers – a kind of digital signature – which makes them relatively easy for computer systems to flag. Trying to interpret a string of threatening words – which can resemble a joke, satire or song lyrics – is a far more difficult task for artificial intelligence systems.</p> \n<p>Facebook and other platforms therefore rely on user reports to catch threats, harassment and other violations of the law or their own policies. As evidenced by the latest shootings, the information often comes too late, if at all.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/26/evil-will-not-win-sorrow-and-disbelief-as-uvalde-mourns-its-children","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T05:46:33Z","webTitle":"‘Evil will not win’: sorrow and disbelief as Uvalde mourns its children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/26/evil-will-not-win-sorrow-and-disbelief-as-uvalde-mourns-its-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/26/evil-will-not-win-sorrow-and-disbelief-as-uvalde-mourns-its-children","fields":{"headline":"‘Evil will not win’: sorrow and disbelief as Uvalde mourns its children","trailText":"Town comes together to try to come to terms with horrific attack in which 19 young children and two teachers were killed","body":"<p>The tears started before anyone even spoke.

There, pastors, seated on a stage on the dirt normally reserved for horses, tried to offer solace to their community.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"049b9484db294fdb33b60a818b73eda9fd851725\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/049b9484db294fdb33b60a818b73eda9fd851725/0_0_3500_2407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephanie and Michael Chavez of San Antonio pay their respects at a makeshift memorial outside Robb Elementary School.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephanie and Michael Chavez of San Antonio pay their respects at a makeshift memorial outside Robb elementary School.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nuri Vallbona/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Pray for those children that saw what happened to their friends … pray for each of us as we help them,” said Pastor Tony Grubin, feeling nervous as he addressed the crowd of adults and children, many of them wearing red school shirts. “Evil will not win.”</p> <p>Grubin and other pastors urged the town to rely on its faith and on one another, encouraging them to join together in prayer. As the pastors spoke, attendees in the bleachers bowed their heads, sometimes joining hands and singing or just holding loved ones as they cried.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-victims\">‘He was just a loving little boy’: the victims of the Texas school shooting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Grubin said the idea for the vigil came up on Tuesday night as he and other pastors sat with families who were waiting to hear whether their loved ones had survived. “We thought tonight should just be as simple, as respectful and as loving as we knew how to be,” said Grubin, who said several prayers to the crowd.</p> <p>“I’m afraid to be in front of people, but my fear is inconsequential to the needs of others,” he added. “We just wanted to provide some encouragement and an expression of love.”</p> <p>Sophia Fulcher, 15, reunited with her friends at the vigil for the first time since Tuesday when her school, along with all the others in town was on lockdown. “It was emotional, just a lot of emotions. I don’t know how to feel,” she said. “How sickening it is for someone to do something so violent like that.”</p> <p>In this tight community of 16,000, the shooting has touched almost everyone, if not directly then through relatives of friends and co-workers.</p> <p>Downtown on Wednesday afternoon, cars honked and passersby waved to a group holding supportive signs. Ravenn Vasquez and several friends spent the afternoon on Main Street waving their signs with phrases like “Uvalde strong”.</p> <p>“We just didn’t know what to do. We don’t want to be glued to our phones and just mourning,” said Vasquez, who graduated from Uvalde high in 2019. “We want to be there for the community and let them know we’re out here.</p> <p>“I haven’t slept,” she added. “I couldn’t sleep last night. I couldn’t shake that feeling … you hear about this in other cities. It’s really sad to see in Uvalde.”</p> <p>Signs of what happened this week are all around, from the dozens of messages reading “pray for Uvalde” and “Uvalde strong” at businesses to the endless stream of news media vans at the civic center and the elementary school. Outside the campus itself, dozens of white, yellow and red flowers surrounded the Robb elementary school sign, barely visible in between the TV cameras and law enforcement vehicles.</p> <p>The welcoming town is known for its rivers, a Labor Day rodeo and music festival, and as the birthplace of Matthew McConaughey, Vasquez said, but now it’s known for something horrific. Vasquez tried not to think of that. Instead she tries to remember the happy moments the elementary school students experienced, like an event on Monday where the graduating seniors came to visit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a54714f3cebf83ecfd6258be6d70b6bfcbafacbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a54714f3cebf83ecfd6258be6d70b6bfcbafacbd/0_0_9504_6336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People mourn as they attend a vigil for the victims of the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People mourn as they attend a vigil for the victims of the mass shooting at Robb elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Dinner/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Desiree Vera was at Robb elementary school on Monday, where she and other high school seniors, dressed in their red caps and gowns, stopped by their old classrooms and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UHSProud/status/1528750175803564033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1528750175803564033%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Flive%2F2022%2F05%2F24%2Fus%2Fshooting-robb-elementary-uvalde\">high-fived the young students</a>: “It was sweet to see the school and all the kids who were one day gonna be us.”</p> <p>No one ever expects such a tragedy to befall their community, several residents remarked, and coming to terms with the fact that it happened here is difficult.</p> <p>“You would never think that something like this could happen in such a small town, but then you have to think, don’t ever think it can’t happen to you, because it can and it did happen to us,” said Desiree Vera, a Uvalde High senior.</p> <p>Her sister, Monica, added: “It just doesn’t feel real. Did this actually happen in our home town?” Monica was in the middle of a geometry class at the high school when the shooting started, prompting their school to go into lockdown for four hours. “I don’t think we’ll ever recover. Everybody is close here, so it affects everybody.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/26/first-edition-sue-gray-report-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T05:44:41Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: Gray’s report confirms Boris Johnson’s agenda - his own survival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/first-edition-sue-gray-report-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/26/first-edition-sue-gray-report-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: Gray’s report confirms Boris Johnson’s agenda - his own survival","trailText":"In today’s newsletter: When limiting the harm of the Partygate scandal is the government’s number one priority, what does that mean for how the country is run?","body":"<p>Good morning.

Here are some of the ways Johnson’s government appears to have reoriented its mission from the good of the country to the good of the prime minister.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Big announcements are emerging with suspiciously good timing</p> <p>After weeks of delay and disagreement, a package of measures to help with the cost of living will finally be announced today – and if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/rishi-sunak-to-announce-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms\">Rishi Sunak’s embrace of the near-mythological windfall tax</a> helps to turn the page on the Sue Gray fallout, so much the better. The day after Johnson became the first serving prime minister to have been found to have broken the law while in office, the government’s controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/13/priti-patel-finalises-plan-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda\">plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda</a> to be processed was all over the front pages. And if Volodymyr Zelenskiy wants to know when he’s going to get a phone call from the British prime minister, all he has to do is set a Google alert for “new Partygate revelations”.</p> <p>Governments always time their announcements for maximum political impact, and dead cats can be so overrated as a theory of politics as to edge into conspiracy. But there is now a sense that governing priorities are being specifically tailored to minimise the harm of the Partygate story to the prime minister, instead of to the benefit of the government and the country as a whole.</p> <p>“I’m generally wary of that sort of thinking,” said Rafael Behr. “But with this lot – one former cabinet office official said to me, if you are ever in doubt about the motives for anything they’re doing, imagine the most cynical, short-termist reason you can think of, and there’s your answer. [Boris’s] entire career has been about getting out of scrapes, and that means there won’t be any sustained thinking behind anything.”</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>The people in the background</p> <p>“The entire senior management has changed,” Boris Johnson said yesterday, doughtily ignoring the hecklers who pointed out that actually, one quite important part of the senior management had stayed the same. Nonetheless, it’s true that he has a new chief of staff, a new director of communications, and a new parliamentary private secretary. The question is whether we should be persuaded that this is really about instituting a new working culture – or firming up the prime minister’s grip on power.</p> <p>The most controversial new appointment is one Johnson didn’t mention in the House of Commons: the installation of David Canzini, an acolyte of his previous election guru Sir Lynton Crosby, as deputy chief of staff. Canzini “has a very similar ethos to Dominic Cummings”, said Rafael. His idea, inherited from Crosby, of getting “the barnacles off the boat” and focusing on the most broadly appealing policies, is “a campaign ethos, not a governing ethos”.</p> <p>Canzini has set about instituting “dividing line” policies which are driving the government further to the right. He is said to have been an enthusiastic advocate for the Rwanda policy, and responsible for the government’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/04/lgbt-groups-quit-uk-conference-failure-ban-trans-conversion-practices\">drop a ban on conversion therapy for trans people</a>.</p> <p>“It’s kind of amazing that the appointment of deputy chief of staff can change the whole strategic direction of government,” one backbencher <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-canzini-the-key-player-in-westminster-youve-never-heard-of-5t7fftckm\">told the Times</a> (£) recently. “But that’s a reflection of Boris. For Boris it doesn’t matter what the policies are, as long as he’s still prime minister.”</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <p>Backbenchers are dragging the government to the right</p> <p>When Johnson won an 80-seat majority in the last election, it was hailed by some as a chance for him to show his true colours as a “one nation” Tory or – <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/how-right-wing-is-boris-johnson-election-parliament-brexit\">in his own words</a> – a “Brexity Hezza” who believed Tories should be “the warriors of the dispossessed”. But there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the threat of his removal has been enough to neuter those instincts and force him to pander to the most rightwing voices in his party.</p> <p>“All that’s gone out of the window,” Rafael said. “Johnson knows the underlying dynamics of his party well enough to understand that when you are unpopular, the bit of the party you have to be wary of is the faction that has done in just about every Tory leader in our lifetimes.” Indeed, one MP, described as a senior Brexiteer, told the BBC’s Newsnight last night: “We have to destroy Boris Johnson for the sake of this country and the sake of our party.”</p> <p>That might explain why Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/13/uk-delays-ban-on-supermarket-junk-food-deals-and-pre-watershed-ads?CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium\">delayed – or dumped – </a>measures designed to attack Britain’s obesity crisis, like an end to “buy one get one free” deals on junk food and a pre-9pm watershed for TV advertising.

It shows Tacoma, near Seattle, as scarred by drugs and lack of investment in housing, education and employment. With opportunities scarce, gangs offer a seductive sense of identity. One former gang member recalls: “I got addicted to being feared.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL7eHbqD-KA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SL7eHbqD-KA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Sheppard, who teaches at a liberal arts college in Tacoma, says: “It’s like Everytown USA. It has been a victim of gentrification, a legacy of people not being able to have bank loans, or any kind of loans, to rehabilitate their homes. As a result, these neighbourhoods become infested with public health issues. Disinvestment in communities and education and employment comes with gentrification.”</p> <p>In 1993 Washington became the first state in the US to pass <a href=\"https://willdefendwa.com/washington-three-strikes-law/\">a “three strikes” policy</a>, which mandates life in prison without parole for people thrice convicted of certain offences, from robbery to assault to murder. The consequences were devastating for a generation. By the end of 2020, Black people, representing 4% of the state’s population, accounted for 38% of those sentenced under the law.</p> <p>Speaking via Zoom from her home in Seattle, Sheppard reflects: “It’s not just the three strikes and you’re out but a culture of punishment that you see in many different urban communities, particularly Black, brown and poor communities. Tacoma, Washington, is a visual metaphor for the legacy of those things.”</p> <p>This was the era of moral panic and so-called “tough on crime” policies across America that targeted Black “super-predators”, including three-strikes laws that sent young people to prison for life. President Bill Clinton signed a national crime bill now widely blamed for giving the US the <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/US.html\">highest incarceration rate</a> in the world.</p> <p>Mary Flowers, an anti-racism organiser, says in the film: “This country is based on fear. When you have a country that is based on or has grown out of colonisation and slavery, people don’t rest easy. That’s why everyone needs to be armed in this country to protect what they have, because what they have was stolen.”</p> <p>But this is also a documentary about resistance and reinvention. For more than a decade Sheppard has been teaching sociology classes in Washington state prisons through the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blackprisonerscaucus/\">Black Prisoners’ Caucus</a>, which started half a century ago and is now in a dozen prisons across Washington. She was surprised by the inmates’ academic discipline and engagement. </p> <p>“I taught this concept of sociological imagination that looks at a person’s biography and how history informs that biography,” Sheppard recalls. “I was getting all this brilliant analysis and I was like, ‘I’m supposed to impart this. You all know this! Where’s the scaffold for this political and creative thinking?’</p> <p>“So then I went to a summit of the Black Prisoners’ Caucus talking about youth violence, legislative process; they brought representatives, senators, the head of the department of corrections, some victims that could and other people in the community, their families, and I thought to myself, as James Baldwin said, to be an artist is to be a lover.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1ec2c69b0c2ddcebaae159723694b6d6dc123df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1ec2c69b0c2ddcebaae159723694b6d6dc123df/0_0_2000_1125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still image from the film Since I Been Down © PRISON EDUCATION LLC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>“If I love you, I have to show you things that you don’t see. I didn’t see this and I dare say I’m not sure a lot of people saw who we are imprisoning in our culture of punishment, even with the triumphs and redemptive possibilities of these men and women in prison. I just wanted to share that in my art.”</p> <p>In 2013 Carter and the caucus created a programme called Taking Education and Creating History (Teach) in which prisoners teach literacy, maths and language courses to one another. It includes white inmates and is now at three Washington prisons. Carter now teaches algebra, financial literacy, interpersonal communication and African studies.</p> <p>Sheppard witnessed how the initiative gives incarcerated people a sense of purpose, self-possession and hope. “When you meet one member of a community that has been shut off and wants to maintain those views of fear and hate and all those things, but that one member of that community gets a little bit of light, it’s hard to stop that light from shining. I’m not talking about optimism. I’m talking about real work.”</p> <p>She was particularly struck by a “healthy thinking” class “to understand that to have education is not enough. What is your perspective? Who are you looking at as the good guys and the bad guys? Does history repeat itself or do people repeat history?</p> <p>“In those classes I heard from different incarcerated folks from their heart and soul about their families, how they could cry together, going deep into remorse. One guy said his son wanted to come to prison so he could be with him. Or there’s one white guy who says, ‘I got seven kids. I don’t want to be like this. I want to change the way I’m thinking,’ Oftentimes prison is not a place where you can reflect. But these prisoner-initiated programmes realise what is needed in a person’s life and oftentimes they would invite some of the staff.</p> <p>“When they go and hear these guys talking, they can’t help but listen a little bit. I am not naive to think that everybody’s going to change, but maybe a member of that community has something else that they haven’t looked at, and who knows what they can do?”</p> <p>Carter, a leader in the Black Prisoners’ Caucus, emerges as the documentary’s central protagonist. Sheppard came to admire his “compassionate leadership and vision”, she says. “He would look at situations, but also imagine what was possible, hence his development of Teach across race lines. He’s remorseful but his remorse is not in a kind of grieving that’s only filled with tears but a kind of grieving that’s filled with activity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"986118e1db2974fce57fbb6353b8f3d0aafb97de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/986118e1db2974fce57fbb6353b8f3d0aafb97de/0_0_2500_1404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still image from the film Since I Been Down © PRISON EDUCATION LLC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene in he film Since I Been Down.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prison Education LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Just the other day, my film was shown at a juvenile facility, <a href=\"https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/services/juvenile-rehabilitation/residential-facilities/green-hill\">Green Hill school</a> – young men between the ages of 16 and twentysomething – and they were very quiet afterwards. Kimonti Carter calls in sometimes when I’m doing these post-screening discussions and it was the most amazing discussion you could ever hear. He’s devoted his life to this<em>.”</em></p> <p>In 2006 Carter spoke at the Black Prisoners’ Caucus justice reform summit, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-X_DOnHeoQA\">apologising to the family</a> of Pittman and taking responsibility for his crime. His life sentence was based on arbitrary legal technicalities. If he had been on the street instead of inside a moving vehicle at the moment he opened fire, or if he had been just six weeks younger when he committed the crime, he would probably now be a free man.</p> <p>Yet the lack of a parole option meant he was told that, irrespective of how he behaved in prison, he would never be released. Sheppard reflects: “You’ve been held accountable. You did the time. But not only did you do the time, you helped to redeem so many other people who were in prison, across race lines.”</p> <p>Carter’s sentence was finally vacated after the Washington supreme court ruled that mandatory life sentences without parole are unconstitutional for people aged 18 to 21, not just those under 18. <a href=\"https://www.kimonticarter.com/resentencing\">At his hearing on 8 July</a>, Carter will ask a judge to resentence him to “time served”, amounting to the 25 years that he has been imprisoned already. This would allow the 43-year-old to be released immediately.</p> <p>In one scene of the film, Carter is seen hosting a caucus meeting. Wearing white T-shirt and beige trousers, with pen behind ear and notebook in hand, he tells fellow inmates: “Not only do you have to make a commitment but you have to make a choice: if I still want to continue living the life that got me here or I want to try to live a better life, right? We can never become somebody different but we can become a better version of who we are.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Since I Been Down is now available on Sundance Now or to rent digitally in the US with a UK date to be announced</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/may/26/the-network-of-organisations-seeking-to-influence-abortion-policy-across-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T05:10:00Z","webTitle":"The network of organisations seeking to influence abortion policy across Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/the-network-of-organisations-seeking-to-influence-abortion-policy-across-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/26/the-network-of-organisations-seeking-to-influence-abortion-policy-across-europe","fields":{"headline":"The network of organisations seeking to influence abortion policy across Europe","trailText":"The ultra-Christian, anti-abortion and far-right network is allegedly seeking to replicate anti-choice efforts in the US","body":"<p>A network of ultra-Christian, anti-abortion and far-right organisations is building momentum in its quest to influence abortion policy in Europe as the US supreme court considers striking down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade\">Roe v Wade</a>, the 1973 ruling that legalised the procedure in America.</p> <p>Elements of the network originally came together under the name Agenda Europe, holding yearly summits across the continent between 2013 until at least 2018, by which time it had grown to comprise 300 participants, including politicians and Vatican diplomats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/oklahoma-abortion-post-roe-world\">‘This is real’: in Oklahoma, a post-Roe world has arrived</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The aim of the group was to “restore the natural order” by devising ways to gradually erode abortion rights, gay rights and policies on combating violence against women, as well as to reduce access to contraceptives.</p> <p>Organisers behind Agenda Europe summits included Terrence McKeegan, a former legal adviser to the Holy See’s mission to the UN in New York, and Gudrun Kugler, a Catholic theologian, member of the Austrian parliament and human rights spokesperson for the Austrian People’s party.</p> <p>“It is a rather loose network that brought together all the different groups – mostly from around Europe – that identify themselves as pro-life or pro-family, so anti-abortion or anti-LGBT rights,” said Neil Datta, secretary of the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights who conducted an inquiry into the network and shared documents detailing the group’s aims, meeting programmes and participants. </p> <p>“You can see they started out trying to find their relevance, and by the third meeting they were actually coming up with proactive ideas about how to roll back human rights in sexuality and reproduction.”</p> <p>Today, people connected to Agenda Europe are linked to the Political Network of Values (PNfV), a global platform with strikingly similar values that sprung up as the former’s visibility appeared to diminish. </p> <p>PNfV is hosting its fourth <a href=\"https://politicalnetworkforvalues.org/en/what-we-do/transatlantic-summit/transatlantic-summit-iv-budapest-2021/\">transatlantic summit</a> – which includes Kugler and other Agenda Europe personalities among the speakers – in Budapest on Thursday and Friday.</p> <p>When it comes to abortion rights, the network is allegedly seeking to replicate recent anti-choice efforts in the US, where rightwing activists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/22/the-scheme-senators-highlight-rightwing-influence-supreme-court\">gradually manoeuvred people</a> who share the same views <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/nov/05/trump-lawyers-supreme-court-brett-kavanaugh\">into the judicial and political systems</a>.</p> <p>“They’ll be really pumped up by the potential reversal of the Roe v Wade,” Datta added. </p> <p>“Firstly, because it provides them with a model of one of the most advanced countries taking a position that conforms to their own thinking.

We’ve always had objectors but now the life of a doctor who does do abortions has been made more difficult as you have these anti-abortion people going into hospitals pressuring them, and women, not to abort. </p> <p>“They are also trying to rewrite medicine by paying people to produce material on the dangers of abortion that are purported to be scientific.”</p> <p>An influential politician with the League is Simone Pillon, who until his election as senator in March 2018 was an adviser on the board of Novae Terrae, an anti-abortion organisation headed by his close friend, Luca Volantè, a politician with the now defunct Union of the Centre party and former chairman of the parliamentary group of the European People’s party. </p> <p>Novae Terrae was an integral player in Agenda Europe, at least until Volantè was investigated for money laundering. Volantè was recently cleared of the allegations.</p> <p>Pillon said he is aware of Agenda Europe, which he described as akin “to a group of friends getting together”, but never attended any of its meetings.</p> <p>Pillon has a 20-year history of close relationships with Italian anti-abortion groups and attended a large anti-abortion demonstration in Rome on Saturday.</p> <p>“I am from the pro-life world and then I entered into politics to bring forward the voice of the pro-life associations,” he said.</p> <p>Pillon said he was “envious” of the situation regarding Roe v Wade in US, adding that a similar outcome would arrive in Europe “sooner or later”.</p> <p>“It was an ideological current that brought the liberalisation of abortion to the US in the 1970s, which then led to European legislation being adapted to this way of thinking,” said Pillon. “I am convinced this new wave will [unfold] in Europe.

It follows Jack (a superbly cast Dylan Llewellyn as “a closeted mummy’s boy with a newly dead dad and a crap perm”). Despite not wanting to leave his mum, he takes the leap to university, where he shares accommodation with Danny (Jon Pointing) – a mature student who wants a wingman for pulling “fit birds”.

As he appears alongside Christopher Walken in Outlaws, the actor talks about dodgy directors, the joy of physical contact – and his booming synth pop sideline","body":"<p>This spring, film fans and theatregoers got a lot of Claes Bang for their buck, with the brilliantly named Danish actor starring in two of the most talked-about offerings of the season. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-hamlet-outrageous-violence\">The Northman</a>, he was the evil Fjölnir the Brotherless, stealing the crown of his nephew Amleth (Alexander Skårsgard). In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/07/daddy-a-melodrama-review-black-art-white-money-almeida-london\">“Daddy”</a>, at the Almeida theatre in London, Bang played Andre, the gay billionaire art collector who struck up a relationship with a much younger, much poorer, emerging Black artist, and installed him in his Hollywood pad – complete with a real pool that drenched the front row.</p> <p>Bang infused both roles with sinister charm – he was also, let us not forget, a superb <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/01/dracula-review-bbc1-steven-moffat-mark-gatiss\">Dracula</a> on the BBC – while exhibiting a very Scandinavian attitude to nudity. In The Northman, he was swordfighting in the buff, while at the Almeida, a small venue in which there is no hiding place, he and co-star Terique Jarrett ambled around completely nude for quite a while. “I’ve done two plays where I was naked for the entirety,” he says. “I thought, ‘That’s it. I’ve done my naked duty. No more.’ But then I was approached for ‘Daddy’, loved everything about it, and it makes total sense that we are naked for that stretch of time.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I had a five-week break while shooting The Northman – but they wouldn’t let me leave</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bang is talking via Zoom from a cabin in the Danish countryside, which he and his wife, Lis Kasper, bought at the outset of the pandemic. “From Christmas 2020 to spring last year we were here 95% of the time,” he says, surveying an overgrown, deer-infested garden. “It was a nightmare to be in Copenhagen – there’s nothing worse than a city that is closed.”</p> <p>Bang says working on “Daddy” was a much-needed antidote to The Northman, which was shot around Belfast before vaccines had been developed. If one actor had got the virus, the whole film would have been shut down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d6e8048e91fae70aae0176b385f0ced4153619a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d6e8048e91fae70aae0176b385f0ced4153619a/75_0_5368_3222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Alienating process’ … Bang as Fjölnir the Brotherless in The Northman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Alienating process’ … Bang as Fjölnir the Brotherless in The Northman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Filming during Covid has been a very alienating process,” he says. “For one thing, I have not been able to really see the director because everyone’s in masks and visors. I think, in the street, I’d probably walk past 95% of the people I worked with on that movie, because I wouldn’t be able to recognise them. Normally there’ll be a bit of socialising – you go out for dinner or to a football game – and we couldn’t do that, either. In the middle, I had a five-week shooting break, so I asked if I could go back to the cabin. But they wouldn’t let me leave.”</p> <p>Bang was overjoyed to get back to the hands-on world of theatre – so much so that when the Almeida sent him an email saying he would have to be masked during rehearsals, he threatened to quit. “I said, ‘I’m super happy to do your play, but if we’re not allowed to work without masks in the rehearsal room, I will have to ask you to find someone else because that is exactly what I need.’ It’s become very clear to me during Covid that the contact thing is why I’m here.”</p> <p>There is certainly plenty of contact in “Daddy”: snogging, spanking, sodomy. “I thought it was important that we really got in there,” Bang says. “And I have to say, the director and the intimacy coordinator and Terique and I, we did a really good, very respectful job of getting that relationship to be as alive as I thought it was.” Bang is a big fan of intimacy coordinators, who guide actors through sex scenes movement by movement, with the agreement of everyone involved. He recently pulled out of a film that had three major explicit scenes because the director wouldn’t employ a coordinator, saying: “I think they’re just in the way.”</p> <p>Bang explains: “I’ve had directors back in the day who would say, ‘OK, it’s a sex scene. There’s the bed, get undressed, do your thing and I’ll be filming it.’ But I’ll say, ‘Um, but hey, excuse me, this will be far too private if you don’t say what you want it to be. Should it be a tender or a rough thing? Dominant or messy?’ If you’ve put the scene in the movie, you want to say something. It can’t be just about seeing two people shagging.’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f3cf72f452c8dbaa1c5ab929eac074f2de75dd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f3cf72f452c8dbaa1c5ab929eac074f2de75dd9/0_0_1841_1227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Christopher Walken really makes a fool of me’ … Bang will appear in next month’s Outlaws.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Christopher Walken really makes a fool of me’ … Bang will appear in next month’s Outlaws.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 55, Bang is far too long in the tooth (and not just when wearing his Dracula fangs) to be pushed into doing something against his better judgment. After years as a jobbing actor in Denmark, five years ago he made an international breakthrough with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/19/the-square-review-ruben-ostlund-elisabeth-moss-cannes-2017\">The Square</a>, which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes. It stars Bang as an urbane art museum director who makes a succession of increasingly terrible decisions, from sleeping with a journalist played by Elisabeth Moss to commissioning a promotional video in which a toddler is blown up.</p> <p>It’s a brilliant portrayal of the carelessness and weakness lurking within a middle-aged high flyer – and it made Bang into a singular kind of star. Not many actors speak four languages fluently – namely Danish, Swedish, German and English, which he speaks with an estuary-tinged accent that makes him sound a bit like David Bowie. Even fewer are touted by some journalists as possible Bonds, despite him being a grandad twice over.</p> <p>Bang points out that in his wife’s family, everyone has children when they’re 20. “Children have come into my life in a little bit of a weird way,” he says. “When I met my wife, aged 39, she had Bella who was eight and Sarah who was 19, and now Sarah’s had two kids – the youngest turned two a month ago and the older one just turned 13. I don’t know how that happened but it’s been a blessing. It’s probably been the best way of getting children into my life because for some reason I couldn’t pull myself together and have some of my own.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d521c301e076bd76c79b39e3f69982e0dd92e17b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d521c301e076bd76c79b39e3f69982e0dd92e17b/0_243_5557_3335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I loved everything about it’ … with Terique Jarrett in ‘Daddy’.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I loved everything about it’ … with Terique Jarrett in ‘Daddy’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pandemic descended just as Bang’s career was hitting full throttle – he had three indie films out in 2020, each barely making it into the cinema. Now, however, he is back in business, as a villain in <a href=\"https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-outlaws-stephen-merchant-christopher-walkens/\">Stephen Merchant’s The Outlaws</a>, broadcast next month, in which he stars with Christopher Walken. “He really makes a fool out of me, but he was lovely.” After that comes <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/comedy/sharon-horgan-bad-sisters-first-look-newsupdate/\">Bad Sisters</a>, a series for Apple TV+ in which he plays Anne-Marie Duff’s husband. As well as having a female showrunner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/09/sharon-horgan-when-youre-in-your-50s-madness-descends\">Sharon Horgan</a>, and five female leads, all the directors on the show were women. “The whole entertainment business is getting serious about diversity,” Bang says. “I’m proud to be part of it.”</p> <p>Which brings us back to The Northman, whose whiteness, machismo and Norse mythological roots have seen it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/norse-code-white-supremacists-reading-the-northman-robert-eggers\">embraced by some extreme right-wingers</a>. “I remember when the trailer came out around Christmas, there was this voiceover that says, ‘You have to choose between kindness for your kin or hatred for your enemy.’ And I was like, ‘Woah, wait a minute – it’s Donald Trump!’ If it is being used by white supremacist groups, I think that’s bloody horrible. It was not something I thought about when we were filming – the script is based on the Danish story of Prince Amlet, the one that Shakespeare turned into perhaps the greatest play in the world.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jRUZTfKOBM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_jRUZTfKOBM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Bang spent much of the time lurking in his trailer, either trying to avoid Covid or preparing for yet another of director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/10/the-northman-director-robert-eggers-interview\">Robert Eggers’</a> many takes. There he indulged his other creative passion: music, which he releases under the name This Is Not America (and, sadly, not Claes’ Bangers). It’s not half bad, particularly if you have a weakness for 80s electro pop. I tell Bang that Tale of a Broken Heart, on his new EP, reminds me of the Johnny Marr/Bernard Sumner supergroup Electronic. “Oh my God!” he says. “That’s making me so proud. New Order, the Smiths, Pet Shop Boys – that’s my DNA.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/feb/20/claes-bang-could-i-do-bond-no-id-be-too-old-\">Claes Bang: ‘Could I do Bond?

Not that that’s how he sees it: “Look, when it comes to this [gender stuff], I wish I could be all: ‘I wanted to change the world!’ But it’s more that it’s a byproduct of what we’re doing,” he says. “If you look at pop icons over the years, fashion is such an integral part of their image, like Björk in the swan dress, Britney in the schoolgirl outfit. I’m aware that what I do is having an impact, but is that top of the agenda for me? No.”</p> <p>We’re sitting on a bench in the communal garden behind his two-room studio in Hoxton, east London. In one room, platform shoes spill out of an Ikea Kallax unit. In the other, rails of clothes sit. Lambert, 35, is warm and chatty, with a gentle East Anglian accent and short bleached hair. He’s wearing wide-legged Marni trousers in chequerboard brown, large black pearls and a T-shirt lightly stained with breakfast.</p> <p>Celebrity stylists are relatively new. In Hollywood’s golden age – Lambert’s favourite era – actors were styled by costume designers from the studios. By the early 70s, the studio system was over, so stars dressed themselves, which didn’t always go well (Google any Oscars ceremony in the 1980s).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b44566d4bf38050d4f0ed897c5cee48466e67b79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b44566d4bf38050d4f0ed897c5cee48466e67b79/0_452_7343_4406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Corrin at the Olivier awards in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘We thought: “Let’s do something that most people aren’t going to get”’ … Emma Corrin at the Olivier awards in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for SOLT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn’t until the mid-00s and Rachel Zoe – who turned her cadre (Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan) into avatars of her stick-thin self, and is rumoured to have commanded <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/hollywoods-top-10-power-stylists-decade-1283568/\">$10,000 a day</a> – that stylists became as famous as their clients.</p> <p>Today, the red carpet is an economy unto itself, built on the (often false) idea that what celebrities wear is an extension of their personality rather than, say, a mutually beneficial marketing tool brokered between label, celebrity and stylist. No one knows how much money changes hands, but given that many celebrities require stylists as much off stage as on (the walking-to-the-car-holding-a-juice outfit, can be as considered as what is worn to the Grammys) the celebrity stylist has never been more powerful. Which explains why some of the big Hollywood ones – Law Roach, say, who put Zendaya in a hot pink breastplate, or Karla Welch, who put Justin Bieber in extra-long sleeved T-shirts – are household names, if you live in that sort of home.</p> <p>Unusually for a stylist, Lambert has just four clients: Styles, Everton footballer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/23/evertons-dominic-calvert-lewin-reveals-talking-saved-my-life\">Dominic Calvert-Lewin</a>, and The Crown actors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/24/emma-corrin-in-the-end-i-had-an-appreciation-for-dianas-complexity-the-crown\">Emma Corrin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/11/the-crown-josh-oconnor-my-advice-to-21-year-old-self-find-a-therapist-mothering-sunday\">Josh O’Connor</a> (each of whom has a body double who tries on outfits the day before). Lambert gets approached a lot, but usually says no. “I only style people who – sorry to sound all LA – I connect with, or who I can transform. I once styled Kylie [Minogue] – but what do you even do with Kylie?”</p> <p>It’s reasonable to say that O’Connor’s look is the most conventional. Standouts include a navy double-breasted sailor suit with ceramic buttons by SS Daley, worn to last year’s TV Baftas, “but there’s always a little twist, or flourish”, says Lambert “It can never be conventional – I hate that.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd9f9b060ca631653221654771ad59d11dcc7f05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd9f9b060ca631653221654771ad59d11dcc7f05/24_36_671_839/400.jpg\" alt=\"Josh O’Connor in his suit by SS Daley.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The most conventional look … Josh O’Connor in his suit by SS Daley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Harry Lambert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Corrin, whom he met through a friend, came out as queer last year, and uses clothes to communicate this. “There’s a pressure on girls in acting to be sexy, to be a bombshell, to have [their] boobs out. Emma is sexy, but it’s about playing with people’s perceptions of what is beautiful,” says Lambert. I say the Loewe dress and balloon bra she wore to the Olivier awards in April certainly felt like an in-joke. “The Oliviers are a bit stuffy, so we thought: ‘Let’s do something that most people aren’t going to get,’” he says with a laugh. “It’s a conversation, but in a dress. Even the Daily Mail loved it.”</p> <p>As with all stylists’ muses, there is an obligation to wear designers if they are linked with them – Corrin was the face of Miu Miu, Styles of Gucci, and O’Connor of Loewe. But in using vintage pieces as well as pushing smaller designers such as Daley, Edward Crutchley and Harris Reed, whose gender-fluid designs have since ended up at the Met Gala, Lambert is attempting to redress the power balance.</p> <p>Earlier this year, he turned down the chance to appear on the cover of The Hollywood Reporter. “I didn’t get into this job to be on a [magazine] cover. Fashion is scary, fashion week is scary,” Lambert says. “There are ‘faces’, like Anna Wintour, and then there are people like me.”</p> <p>But because of his job – and because of social media – he is a face of sorts. “Someone took my picture on the bus and tagged me this week. So I’m famous to a particular group of people.” The Harrys have nicknames for each other (Lambert is Susan, and Styles is Sue) and the internet has fun with their relationship, with Reddit threads devoted to to unpacking what these names mean. Again, Lambert won’t comment, but it seems an efficient way to differentiate between two people called Harry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be23c90d0f554f419dbf7d6b3b2f9811f726eaa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be23c90d0f554f419dbf7d6b3b2f9811f726eaa1/13_113_1543_1927/801.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Styles performing at Coachella in April.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘If you look at pop icons, fashion is an integral part of their image, like Björk in the swan dress’ ... Harry Styles performing at Coachella in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Coachella</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Growing up in Norwich, Lambert was into clothes, not fashion. He cycled through trends familiar to a millennial (the skateboarding emo phase, the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ripped loose jeans phase) and, at school, drifted towards art. He studied photography at Rochester University and while he loved the narrative side, he tripped up on the technicalities, and instead spent his summers interning at various magazines.</p> <p>He then moved to east London, just at the end of nu-rave. “I got into the industry right at the end, just after [the recession], when everyone had money, but also just before styling became a thing,” he says. He got work as a commercial stylist – including a stint at fast fashion “factory” Asos, and later Topman, but his Damascene moment was “bejewelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/09/little-boots-working-girl-review-anaemic-pastel-pop\">Little Boots</a>’ roller skates on a shoot”.</p> <p>His most recent client is Calvert-Lewin, one of the few footballers who doesn’t dress as if he has been vomited on by a bank. Last winter’s Arena Homme+ cover, in which he wears a flared short suit and a glittery pink Prada handbag, was a blue-tick Lambert look – high fashion with an androgynous twist. Is Lambert a football fan? “No. I had to do half a season at Norwich City – Delia Smith’s team – when I was a kid, but only to escort my little brother.”</p> <p>You only need to look at Little Richard, David Bowie or Prince to see that androgyny has been part of pop since the beginning. Yet in football, outward expressions of so-called femininity are few and far between. Is Lambert trying to drive a conversation about gender by introducing this fashion to the Premier League? Lambert laughs again. “I didn’t bring the handbags to Dominic. He has three or four Chanel handbags of his own. But just because someone is a masculine straight guy in the football community, and has a handbag, it shouldn’t be a big deal.” But it is a big deal, I say, in a good way. “OK, yeah, I understand how toxic the [football] industry can be, so to see a man with a Chanel handbag is … something. But everyone is trying to tap into that market,” he says of fashion and sport. “Back in the day, if you were into clothes you were gay. Now caring about how you look – it’s almost normal.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5895ffd99a6a88bb9fbbf1d2690534ec0d013669\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5895ffd99a6a88bb9fbbf1d2690534ec0d013669/39_148_3499_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Styles at the 2019 Met Gala in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flares with a side of camp … Harry Styles at the 2019 Met Gala in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Theo Wargo/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s unsurprising then that Gucci recently signed pomade-loving footballer Jack Grealish to front a future campaign. At the mention of his name, Lambert shifts around, then denies all knowledge of the signing. I’d put a tenner on him being involved.</p> <p>“I think how men dress is changing,” he says. “The Loewe aesthetic is going to be the next super-brand for youth in the way that Balenciaga and Vetements [two of the brands responsible for luxury logo streetwear] rewrote what was cool. You can see it happening.” To translate, Lambert means clothes that are pretty and surreal, logo-free knitwear and lots of colour. Like Styles’ famous rainbow cardigan – effeminate and fun. “It’s the vibe shift, yeah.”</p> <p>“When I’m gone,” Lambert says, “I just hope it’s silly things such as putting Harry [Styles] in pearls and that men can wear necklaces and it not be a thing – that’s the stuff I want to be remembered for. That and when people dress up as Harry for Halloween.” He claps his hands. “It means that we’ve done something that has had cultural impact. It means we’ve got through.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/26/microplastics-sewage-poison-land-britain-waterways-chemicals","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Microplastics in sewage: a toxic combination that is poisoning our land | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/26/microplastics-sewage-poison-land-britain-waterways-chemicals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/26/microplastics-sewage-poison-land-britain-waterways-chemicals","fields":{"headline":"Microplastics in sewage: a toxic combination that is poisoning our land","trailText":"Policy failure and a lack of enforcement have left our waterways and farmland vulnerable to ‘forever chemicals’, says Guardian columnist George Monbiot","body":"<p>We have recently woken up to a disgusting issue. Rather than investing properly in new sewage treatment works, water companies in the UK – since they were privatised in 1989 – have handed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2314ae0-9e17-425d-8e3f-066270388331\">£72 bn in dividends</a> to their shareholders.

It contains a wide range of other toxins, including PFASs: the “forever chemicals” that were the subject of the movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/27/dark-waters-review-todd-haynes-mark-ruffalo-west-virginia-dupont-poison-\">Dark Waters</a>.

What happens when the filth is filtered out and the water flowing out of sewage treatment plants is no longer hazardous to life? I stumbled across the answer while researching my book,<strong> </strong>Regenesis, and I’m still reeling from it. When the system works as it is meant to, it is likely to be just as harmful as it is when bypassed by unscrupulous water companies. It’s an astonishing and shocking story, but it has hardly been touched by the media.</p> <p>We are often told that the microplastics entering the sewage system, which come from tyre crumb washing off the roads, the synthetic clothes we wear and many other sources, are a wicked problem, almost impossible to solve. But a modern, well-run sewage treatment works <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025326X18304053\">removes 99%</a> of these fibres from wastewater. So far, so good. But – and at this point you may wish to decide whether to laugh or cry – having screened them out of the water supply, the treatment companies then release them back into the wild. In the UK, of the sewage sludge screened out by treatment works, <a href=\"https://assuredbiosolids.co.uk/about-biosolids/\">87% is sent to farms</a>. The microplastics so carefully removed from wastewater by the treatment process are then <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237839\">spread across the land</a> in the sewage sludge the water companies sell to farmers as fertiliser.</p> <p>Then what happens to them? Some – perhaps most – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138334\">wash off the soil</a> and into the rivers: in other words, whether sewage is screened or not, the microplastics it contains end up in the same place. Others <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.368\">accumulate in the soil</a>.</p> <p>It’s hard to decide which is worse. Experiments show how microplastics cascade through <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2020.1268\">soil food webs</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.04.066\">poisoning</a> some of the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113174\">animals</a> that inhabit it. When they decompose into nanoparticles, they can be absorbed by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14020\">soil fungi</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-020-0707-4\">accumulated by plants</a>. We currently have no idea what the consequences of eating these contaminated crops might be.</p> <p>The testing of sewage sludge has not been updated since 1989, so there is no checking for plastic particles or most other synthetic chemicals. <a href=\"https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/02/04/sewage-sludge-landspreading-environment-agency-report/\">A study</a> commissioned but then kept secret by the government found that the sewage sludge being spread on our farmland contains a remarkable cocktail of dangerous substances, including PFASs, benzo(a)pyrene (a group 1 carcinogen), dioxins, furans, PCBs and PAHs, all of which are persistent and potentially cumulative.</p> <p>Where did they come from? Because our waste streams are not separated and poorly regulated, anywhere and everywhere. The major source of PFASs in sewage is probably the building trade. “<a href=\"https://greensciencepolicy.org/docs/pfas-building-materials-2021.pdf\">Forever chemicals</a>” are found in paints, sealants and coatings, caulks, adhesives and roofing materials. Evidence sent to me by an industry insider suggests that regulators the world over turn a blind eye to liquid waste disposal on construction sites. Tools are washed and surfaces sprayed with water that’s then poured down the drain. Without regulation, contractors have <a href=\"https://researchdirect.westernsydney.edu.au/islandora/object/uws:61436\">no incentive</a> to use technologies that ensure liquid waste is contained. Why go to this expense if your competitors don’t have to?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/02/untreated-sewage-discharge-england-coastal-bathing-waters-2021\">Raw sewage ‘pumped into English bathing waters 25,000 times in 2021’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Could this story get any worse? Oh yes. Microplastics are sometimes <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/pdf/39168%20Intentionally%20added%20microplastics%20-%20Final%20report%2020171020.pdf\">spread </a><em><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/reach/pdf/39168%20Intentionally%20added%20microplastics%20-%20Final%20report%2020171020.pdf\">deliberately</a></em> on the soil by farmers, to make it more friable. Across Europe, thousands of tonnes of plastic are also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/environments7050038\">added to fertilisers</a>, to prevent them from caking; or to delay the release of the nutrients they contain. Fertiliser pellets are coated with plastic films – polyurethane, polystyrene, PVC, polyacrylamide and other <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.agron.2017.10.003\">synthetic polymers</a>­– some of which are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.01.037\">known to be toxic</a> and all of which disintegrate into microplastics. It is almost unbelievable that the deliberate contamination of agricultural soils with persistent and cumulative pollutants is both widespread and legal.</p> <p>This practice, as well as the spreading of contaminated sewage sludge, urgently needs to be stopped, before large tracts of farmland become unusable, and the damage to ecosystems, from soil to sea, irreversible. It’s tragic that the nutrients in sewage sludge can’t safely be used, but it seems to me that there’s no immediate solution, in our dysfunctional system, but to incinerate it. Only when toxic, accumulating chemicals are banned, waste streams separated and proper tests conducted will sewage be safe to spread.</p> <p>Right now we are poisoning the land and, in all likelihood, poisoning ourselves.

From the moment I woke up from the operation I could move them.”</p> <p>Gallagher spent about four weeks in Leeds general infirmary after the operation in December 2021, and has regular visits to hospitals in Glasgow for physiotherapy and monitoring. His condition is improving more than five months on from the operation, and although he cannot do tasks requiring great dexterity such as doing up buttons, the father of three can do things like stroke his family’s dog.</p> <p>“It has given me a new lease of life,” he said. “I’m still finding things hard just now but things are getting better every week with the physio and the occupational therapists, everything is just slowly getting better.

The company took over responsibility for nearly half of the specialist firefighters in July 2019, after winning a 12 year contract priced at £525m.</p> <p>The number of firefighters based at Faslane, the Trident nuclear submarine base in Scotland, had fallen significantly since privatisation, the MPs added. A total of 38 out of 524 had left on a voluntary basis as of last December, and further 150 had asked to be allowed to quit.</p> <p>“We find these figures surprising,” the committee concluded. “Whilst Capita argue that its job retention rate is ‘good’, the number of voluntary exits suggests that there may be more than meets the eye.”</p> <p>Mark Francois, a Conservative MP, added that the government should change the law in the forthcoming procurement bill to allow ministers to consider “a bidder’s past performance” when awarding contracts in future.</p> <p>The former junior defence minister has been a persistent critic of Capita, and has called for the company to be stripped of its contract to supply army recruitment. “The performance of certain sub-contractors is well known both within industry and the defence community,” Francois added.</p> <p>Army recruitment has been handled jointly by Capita and the British army since 2012. But performance has been mixed: targets were missed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/07/british-army-recruits-rise-as-covid-seems-to-act-as-rallying-cry\">six years out of eight</a>, the army remained below its 82,050 official requirement and the website was offline for weeks in the spring after an apparent leak of data belonging to 120 recruits.</p> <p>The committee also complained that staff terms and conditions were sometimes eroded once a service had been privatised. Defence firefighters employed by Capita had 27 days’ holiday compared to 30 in the MoD.</p> <p>Capita said its record of delivery on the DFRS contract was strong, and the company had met all of its targets. Recommendations over staffing levels “at any MoD site have to be endorsed by the MoD, and ultimately approved by the individual site’s military<strong> </strong>leadership team,” a spokesperson added.</p> <p>A MoD spokesperson said outsourcing was used to deliver “maximum value” for taxpayers. “Our contracts ensure that staff are paid fairly and contracted ancillary staff often have training and career prospects superior to an in-house service,” they added.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/26/msc-orders-inquiry-into-shark-finning-on-tuna-vessels-in-the-pacific","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"MSC orders inquiry into shark finning on tuna vessels in the Pacific ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/26/msc-orders-inquiry-into-shark-finning-on-tuna-vessels-in-the-pacific","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/26/msc-orders-inquiry-into-shark-finning-on-tuna-vessels-in-the-pacific","fields":{"headline":"MSC orders inquiry into shark finning on tuna vessels in the Pacific ","trailText":"Campaigners report incidents of the cruel practice on several certified boats, amid allegations of a flawed auditing system","body":"<p>The Marine Stewardship Council, which certifies fisheries under its blue tick sustainability label, has ordered an independent investigation into allegations of shark finning on tuna vessels in certified Pacific fisheries.</p> <p>Shark finning is the cruel practice of removing fins from live sharks. A <a href=\"https://www.sharkguardian.org/post/slipping-through-the-net\">report</a> by the UK charity <a href=\"https://www.sharkguardian.org/\">Shark Guardian</a> with CNS Global Consulting, a sustainable development consultancy, has alleged it took place on board three vessels operating in the western central Pacific that were certified by the MSC, which runs the world’s largest fishery certification programme.</p> <p>Official documents from independent observers who monitor fishery compliance, seen by the Guardian, said shark finning happened on board vessels in MSC-certified fisheries in 2019 and early 2020. They reported silky sharks and a black-tipped reef shark as having “DFR” or “discarded fins retained”, a reference to the practice of cutting fins off live animals and discarding their bodies overboard. Both species are classified as “near threatened” with extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p> <p>A third of shark and ray species have been overfished to near extinction, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/06/third-of-shark-and-ray-species-face-extinction-warns-study\">a study found last year</a>. </p> <p>Despite documented evidence, little action was taken to prevent the boats from operating under the MSC banner, the charity said, nor was anyone prosecuted.</p> <p>There is no suggestion the MSC was aware of the observer reports that alleged shark finning. However, the MSC’s third-party certification boards – known as conformity assessment bodies (Cabs) – which audit fisheries and read observer reports, have a duty to remove certification if shark finning is detected, or if a vessel is convicted for it. This duty was strengthened in September 2020 to require “zero tolerance” of shark finning, the MSC said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09ce3921f1f569f599ef7e0d8988ea632b0f3b18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09ce3921f1f569f599ef7e0d8988ea632b0f3b18/0_172_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A finned hammerhead shark is discovered in the Pacific Ocean.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A finned hammerhead shark is discovered in the Pacific Ocean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VW Pics/Universal Images Group/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Jean-Jacques Schwenzfeier, director of CNS Global Consulting, said: “The observers told us their reports are constantly being ignored and shark finners are not being prosecuted.</p> <p>“We are not saying the MSC is a bad programme.

But the auditing system is flawed and needs improving.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the MSC said it took the allegations “seriously” and had asked Assurance Services International, which oversees Cabs, to investigate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/02/european-countries-dominate-half-asian-shark-fin-trade-ifaw-report-reveals\">European countries dominate half of Asian shark fin trade, report reveals </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Shark finning is completely prohibited in MSC-certified fisheries and we take the allegations contained in the Shark Guardian report, relating to vessels fishing in the western central Pacific, seriously.

At 1.42am, two of the three individuals on screen simultaneously turned their attention towards the side gate, then scarpered in the opposite direction.

Hopping out of the shadows, it dodged a perambulating hedgehog and slipped beneath the bird table in search of spilt seeds. Silently, a silver-rosetted Bengal cat leapt down from the fence and crouched low, every muscle tensed. It crept forward, laser-focused on its quarry. Pressing its paws into the ground and wiggling its hindquarters, it sprang towards the bird table, just as the recording cut off.

The children of two of the country’s most powerful families agreed to join forces: dictator’s son Ferdinand Marcos Jr would run to be president in an alliance with Sara Duterte, the tough-talking daughter of the populist incumbent, Rodrigo Duterte.</p> <p>Last week, they won a thumping victory. Marcos Jr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/new-era-for-philippines-begins-as-ferdinand-marcos-jr-officially-proclaimed-president\">secured 31 million votes</a>, according to an unofficial count, thought to be the biggest mandate in decades. Sara Duterte, who ran to be vice-president, also won by a huge margin.</p> <p>The pair were backed up by a host of powerful political names including the former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who reportedly brokered their alliance, and the family of former president Joseph Estrada. The heavyweights grouped together to oppose the rival candidate, Leni Robredo – a reformist who wanted to pass an anti-dynasty law, and ultimately came second.</p> <p>“When we look at the results in the numbers, that alliance worked,” said Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, who teaches political science at the University of the Philippines, pointing to how the candidates combined their respective support bases in the north and south of the country. “They worked as a team and they were supported by all the traditional politicians.”</p> <p>Political parties are weak in the Philippines, and it is instead influential families who struggle for power, using patronage, vote-buying, intimidation and, at times, violence to keep relatives in office. The clout of families can rise and fall – and rise again in the case of the Marcoses.</p> <p>Marcos Jr’s father, Ferdinand Marcos Sr, ruled for two decades, including a period of martial law, where he had absolute power, before he was ousted by a popular uprising in 1986.</p> <p>Marcos Sr promised voters he would tackle the country’s dynasties, but instead merely replaced elites with cronies. He plundered up to $10bn (£8bn) and presided over rife rights abuses, where political opponents were tortured, arrested and disappeared.</p> <p>Campaign alliances aside, the Marcoses, said Aries Arugay, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, do no not pair up and rule as co-equals. “The Marcoses rule by themselves.”</p> <p>Marcos Jr’s’ recent announcement that he will appoint Sara Duterte to lead the Department of Education – and not defence, as was her preference – has raised eyebrows.</p> <p>In a statement, Duterte, a reserve officer, brushed off any suggestion she had been sidelined. “I expect that people who want to see the new administration fail will fabricate intrigues about my loyalty,” she said.</p> <p>Rodrigo Duterte, who was blocked by the constitution from seeking a second term, did not endorse Marcos Jr, who he <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/duterte-does-not-endorse-marcos-jr-last-day-campaigning-may-2022/\">previously called a spoiled child</a> and weak leader. Instead, he has openly <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1514859/duterte-baffled-by-saras-decision-to-run-for-vp\">expressed frustration</a> that his daughter Sara, who was leading opinion surveys last year, did not go for the top job.</p> <p>But for all his protests at his daughter’s decision, Rodrigo Duterte himself fuelled the rise of the Marcoses, analysts say. He not only recommended a hero’s burial for Marcos Sr in 2016 – a highly controversial decision that contributed to the whitewashing of history – but once described Marcos Jr as his preferred successor were he to stand down early.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55ad28f2ba4855e601601236dee75ea4945e68b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55ad28f2ba4855e601601236dee75ea4945e68b2/0_214_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The burial of Marcos Sr at the heroes’ cemetery in Manila in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The burial of Marcos Sr at the heroes’ cemetery in Manila in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout Duterte’s term, the Marcos family was building its base, with online disinformation campaigns flooding social media with false stories portraying Marcos Sr’s rule as a golden era.<br><br>The Dutertes “allowed this because the Marcoses were doing the work that the Duterte administration was too lazy to do or did not have the time to do, which is to pummel the opposition”, Arugay said. Such glorification of martial law also benefited Duterte’s authoritarian style of leadership.</p> <p>“What Duterte and his administration failed to see is that it empowered the Marcoses even further in return,” he added.</p> <p>The power of Philippine dynasties has only increased in the decades since the ousting of Marcos, distorting democracy and worsening inequality.</p> <p>According to a 2019 study by Manila’s Ateneo School of Government, about 80% of governors belonged to “fat dynasties”, meaning clans with two or more members in power at the same time – and up from 57% in 2004. Political families also held 67% of seats in the House of Representatives, and 53% of mayoral posts.</p> <p>“Without dynasty regulation called for by our constitution, and given [the] little effort to curb vote-buying, and mixed record of anti-corruption in the past six years … then it is clear to see how dynastic politicians can further concentrate power,” said Dr Ronald Mendoza, who authored the study.</p> <p>The pandemic and unemployment also increases people’s vulnerability to patronage, a longstanding problem in the Philippines, said Mendoza.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/18/marcos-power-philippines-dicators-son-presidency-social-media\">The return of a Marcos to power in the Philippines is a warning to the world | Nicole Curato</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Local media reported that, in the days after the election, stores in some areas sold out of mobile phones, and restaurants were busier than usual, with shoppers openly saying they had received money from politicians running for congress and provincial posts.</p> <p>The Commission on Elections told local media it had verified more than 100 cases of vote-buying, but did not believe such reports had affected the outcome of the vote.</p> <p>Unless Marcos Jr, with a huge mandate, alters the constitution, he too will be limited to one six-year term.</p> <p>Regardless, many more Marcoses are waiting in the wings.

They ambushed us, and we couldn’t fight back. We had to surrender,” said Anton, a 21-year-old Russian serviceman, in an interview with the Guardian.</p> <p>Anton was taken captive by Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv on 2 March with five other soldiers from his unit, as Russian forces were staging an offensive on the strategically important shipbuilding city near the Black Sea.</p> <p>Anton, who asked not to be identified with his real name, would spend the next 45 days in Ukrainian captivity. He was eventually released in mid-April after Moscow arranged a prisoner exchange with Ukraine, and spoke to the Guardian from Russian territory.</p> <p>Anton’s story is a very rare account of a Russian PoW who has since been exchanged, as both Russia and Ukraine have released very little information about the fate of the hundreds of captive Russians.</p> <p>Moscow does not publicise the names of its service people captured in Ukraine. However, during his captivity, Anton was interviewed as a Russian prisoner by a prominent Ukrainian vlogger.

They told us at the very last moment about this, the night before the invasion,” he said.</p> <p>“Ultimately, it is really not fair how the Russian authorities treated me. I was sent to Ukraine completely unprepared.”</p> <p>Anton’s account, which depicts a military unit that was kept in the dark about the invasion, echoes a number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/they-were-furious-the-russian-soldiers-refusing-to-fight-in-ukraine\">other Russian soldiers who have similarly said that they did know they were going to war</a> until they crossed into Ukraine. Military experts have argued that the decision to not tell a large number of its troops about the invasion is one explanation for Moscow’s halting military campaign.</p> <p>On 25 February, the day after Russian troops entered Ukraine, Anton’s unit was ordered to cross into the country from Crimea.</p> <p>He said they were driven in armoured vehicles to the outskirts of Mykolaiv, which was under heavy attack from Russian forces in the early days of the war.</p> <p>As they continued on foot, part of the unit split from the main group and was ambushed by Ukrainian forces on 2 March, less than a week after entering the country. Anton said he was hit by a Ukrainian bullet while being captured, fracturing a bone in his hand.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were constantly told that Russia is finished, that we belonged to the bottom of society. They’d threaten to starve us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Soon after, Ukrainian forces put a bag on his head as he was transferred to a prison cell, the location of which he said he still does not know.</p> <p>At first, life in captivity was dominated by fear. “You shake at the smallest of noises. Every day you hope that this won’t be your last and you will not be killed,” Anton recalled.</p> <p>He said that he was not physically assaulted during his time in captivity but alleged that Ukrainian guards would mentally torment him and other Russian soldiers.</p> <p>“We were constantly told that Russia is finished, that we belonged to the bottom of society. They would threaten to starve us.”</p> <p>Anton added that while some guards looked like “they wanted to hurt you”, the majority remained calm and “would not let their animal instinct set in”.</p> <p>Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk, who is in charge of negotiating prisoner exchanges, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Under the Geneva conventions, the detention of PoWs after capture should not be seen as a form of punishment but as a means to prevent further participation in a conflict.</p> <p>But it was the daily boredom that soon emerged as the biggest challenge, Anton said.</p> <p>“If we were lucky, we would be given something random to read. Sometimes they let us watch Ukrainian propaganda on television.</p> <p>“Most days we would just stare at the walls in front of us,” he said, adding that he was moved three times during his captivity.</p> <p>At one point, he was asked to record an interview about his capture with a prominent Ukrainian vlogger.</p> <p>Ukrainian officials have given journalists and vloggers access to interview their Russian PoWs. Such videos have been watched by hundreds of thousands of people on YouTube, but they have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/often-a-russian-mother-has-a-tv-for-a-brain-ukraine-youtuber-films-pows-calling-home\">faced criticism for violating the Geneva conventions</a>.</p> <p>“In such a situation, as a prisoner, you understand there isn’t really a choice to say no.

On 4 April, Ukraine said that it held about 600 Russian military prisoners of war. Russia does not release exact figures, but in late March its human rights ombudswoman said there were more than 500 Ukrainian PoWs in Russia.</p> <p>That number has since grown significantly after at least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/russian-prosecutions-azov-fighters-geneva-conventions-ukraine\">transferred to Russian-held territory</a> when the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces last week. Ukraine has said that the Azovstal fighters would be involved in a prisoner swap, but some Russian officials have said they could be tried or even executed.</p> <p>According to Anton, he was part of a one-for-one swap involving 17 other Russian soldiers, which took place near the Ukrainian city of Melitopol.</p> <p>As soon as he was back in Russia, he was intensely questioned by the security services about his time in Ukraine.</p> <p>“They wanted to know if they could still trust me. It was standard procedure,” he said.</p> <p>But it was only days after he was discharged from a Russian hospital that he felt the full toll that his time in captivity had inflicted on his mind and body.</p> <p>“During my captivity, I blocked most of my emotions.

The news surprised Australia and New Zealand, the Solomon’s traditional security partners, as well as other Pacific nations and the US. This week – as Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi embarked on a 10-day visit to the Pacific taking in eight countries – news broke that Beijing was seeking to secure a sweeping economic security deal with 10 countries that would mean a dramatic expansion of its influence in the region.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/five-things-we-learned-about-chinas-ambitions-for-the-pacific-from-the-leaked-deal\">Five things we learned about China’s ambitions for the Pacific from the leaked deal | Anna Powles</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Why are Australia, New Zealand and the US concerned?</h2> <p>All three countries have voiced concerns that an increased Chinese security presence in the Pacific would destabilise the region, with the biggest fear regarding the Solomons deal being that China could eventually establish a military base on the islands, just 2,000km from Australia’s east coast. Beijing and Honiara have denied such a plan.</p> <p>China’s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2116b29-e58b-4fa0-8003-d28d18ddf06f\">reported interest in establishing a similar deal with Kiribati</a>, meanwhile, has been of concern due to its fishing resources and geostrategic location in the central Pacific. Kiribati and Solomon Islands both had diplomatic relations with Taiwan until 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/20/taiwan-loses-second-ally-in-a-week-as-kiribati-switches-to-china\">when they switched to recognise China</a>.</p> <p>News of Wang’s visit and the potential multilateral security and economic deal will have set fresh alarm bells ringing in Washington, Canberra and Wellington.</p> <p>“When you consider the extent of China’s global interests and the relatively small size of the Pacific countries, that tells you immediately that Beijing has ambitious long-term plans in the region,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/26/duelling-diplomacy-in-the-pacific-should-dispel-the-notion-of-a-china-australia-reset\">Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at Australia’s Lowy Institute, says</a>.</p> <h2>What are they doing about it?</h2> <p>In her first days in office, Australia’s new foreign minister, Penny Wong, has made it clear that the Pacific will be one of Canberra’s priorities after years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/scott-morrison-has-not-spoken-to-solomon-islands-prime-minister-since-calling-election\">friction between the Pacific and the previous Liberal-National coalition government</a>. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/australia-to-stand-with-pacific-islands-on-climate-crisis-and-respect-region-penny-wong-says\">recorded a video address</a> to regional leaders soon after her inauguration pledging to make climate a priority and that Australia would be a “generous, respectful and reliable” partner. On Thursday she set off on her own competing visit to the Pacific, with a meeting with Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, and a speech at the Pacific Islands Forum in Suva on the agenda.</p> <p>The US sent a high-level delegation to Solomon Islands last month to express its concerns about the China deal, with ambassador Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, later refusing to rule out military action should China establish a military base in the Solomon Islands.</p> <p>New Zealand has taken a softer approach, with prime minister Jacinda Ardern this week saying it was “not for us to speak on behalf of other Pacific nations” but that Wellington stood “ready to respond” to security needs in the region.</p> <h2>What deals has China signed in the Pacific and what’s in the pipeline?</h2> <p>The Solomons deal marks Beijing’s first known bilateral security agreement in the Pacific. It is widely expected that China will sign further agreements with Solomon Islands during Wang’s visit and will be looking to sign agreements with other Pacific nations during the tour as well.</p> <p>Teburoro Tito, Kiribati’s ambassador to the US and the UN, told the Guardian this week that China had agreed in principle to finance the refurbishment of a world war two runway on Kanton island, but denied reports that a broader security deal was in the works.</p> <p>There are concerns that Kiribati could sign a deal with China, giving it special fishing rights in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA), which was one of the world’s largest marine protected areas, until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/16/kiribati-to-open-one-of-worlds-largest-marine-protected-areas-to-commercial-fishing\">the Kiribati government announced last year it would open up the PIPA to commercial fishing</a>.</p> <p>Vanuatu has just signed a contract with China for the construction of a new runway extension at Pekoa airport on the island of Santo, to allow access for larger aircraft, making it accessible for the delivery of humanitarian aid.</p> <h2>So have Australia, New Zealand and the US dropped the ball?</h2> <p>The Pacific islands have long accused Australia of failing to take their concerns on climate – which they view as an existential threat – seriously. Canberra’s leaders have also been caught mocking the Pacific over its concerns. In 2015, then prime minister Tony Abbott and his immigration minister, Peter Dutton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/11/peter-dutton-jokes-with-tony-abbott-about-rising-sea-levels-in-pacific-nations\">were caught joking</a> about rising sea levels in the region. After a 2019 meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum, several leaders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/23/former-tuvalu-pm-says-he-was-stunned-by-scott-morrisons-behaviour-at-pacific-islands-forum\">accused then prime minister Scott Morrison of dismissive and insulting behaviour</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/fiji-pm-frank-bainimarama-insulting-scott-morrison-rift-pacific-countries\">Bainimarama telling the Guardian</a> his condescending attitude was pushing the Pacific towards China.</p> <p>New Zealand has a more positive relationship, and 60% of its foreign aid goes to the region. However its influence has declined in recent years, with Dr Anna Powles, senior lecturer at the centre for defence and security studies at Massey University, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/power-shifts-new-zealand-reconsiders-pacific-role-as-chinas-influence-grows\">putting this down to</a> “assumptions that Australia and New Zealand didn’t need to put considerable effort into the region to maintain their perceived primacy”.</p> <p>The US has also been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/08/the-us-strategy-to-counter-china-in-the-pacific-could-be-a-1bn-misstep\">accused of disinterest</a> and focusing on undermining China rather than responding to what Pacific leaders want. </p> <h2>What do the deals mean for the Pacific?</h2> <p>There are fears that deals mean not just a loss of sovereignty for island nations but also that they would make them the centre of unwanted geostrategic competition. Some of the second world war’s bloodiest battles took place in the Pacific. In Solomon Islands there are also fears that Chinese military or police could be brought in to quell protests.</p> <p>In a letter to 21 Pacific leaders seen by Reuters, David Panuelo, the president of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), which will be holding a virtual meeting with Wang, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/deal-proposed-by-china-would-dramatically-expand-security-influence-in-pacific\">said his country would argue</a> that the proposed multilateral deal should be rejected, because he feared it could spark a new “cold war” between China and the west.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/26/households-face-steep-power-bill-increases-as-generation-costs-soar","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T03:28:10Z","webTitle":"Australian households face steep power bill increases as generation costs soar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/households-face-steep-power-bill-increases-as-generation-costs-soar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/households-face-steep-power-bill-increases-as-generation-costs-soar","fields":{"headline":"Australian households face steep power bill increases as generation costs soar","trailText":"Customers in NSW could see power bill increases of up to 18%, South Australia almost 20% and parts of Queensland could see rises of 12%","body":"<p>Households in Queensland, New South Wales and elsewhere will face double-digit increases in their power bills from July after the regulator lifted its standard electricity price after generation costs soared by close to half.</p> <p>The Australian Energy Regulator, which was ordered to delay <a href=\"https://www.aer.gov.au/retail-markets/guidelines-reviews/default-market-offer-prices-2022%E2%80%9323\">the release of its default market offer</a> (DMO) from 1 May until Thursday by the outgoing Morrison government, said residential customers in south-east Queensland will see increases of 11.3%-12.6%, or about double the expected inflation rate.</p> <p>Similarly in NSW, residential customers will see increases 8.5%-18.3%, or much higher than the inflation rate.

The offer serves as a price cap for residential and small business customers for how much energy retailers can charge electricity consumers on default plans, known in the market as standing offer contracts.</p> <p>Rising gas and coal prices globally have contributed to a spike in wholesale power prices to record levels. Repairs or outages to as much as a third of the coal-fired power fleet have also contributed to the recent jump.</p> <p>The incoming energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the sharp increase in the standard market price was the result of “nine years of delay and denial” by the Coalition government that would now be left with households and businesses to pay.</p> <p>“The Liberal legacy is higher power prices” for the residents of Queensland, NSW and South Australia covered by the so-called default market offer, he said. “Nine years of policy chaos means we don’t have enough renewables in the system” nor enough transmission to link them up “the cheapest form of energy” to the grid.</p> <p>Bowen also took aim at his predecessor, energy minister Angus Taylor, for acting to delay the release of the higher DMO. As reported by Guardian Australia earlier this week, Taylor ordered the regulator to delay the new offer from 1 May until today, after the election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dylanjmcconnell/status/1529398246178967552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And here&#39;s today&#39;s crazy electricity price graph: <br><br>Quarter three prices up *$30-$40/MWh* in one day, across all mainland NEM regions. <a href=\"https://t.co/bWaOsPIxqF\">pic.twitter.com/bWaOsPIxqF</a></p>&mdash; Dylan McConnell (@dylanjmcconnell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylanjmcconnell/status/1529398246178967552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 25, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>“Angus Taylor knew this report was coming out,” Bowen said. “They sat on this report.

These increases were “due to reductions in thermal generation resulting from unplanned outages and higher coal and gas prices, slowing of investment in new capacity, and increasingly ‘peaky’ demand (sharp highs and lows) driving up the cost of wholesale electricity contracts for retailers”.</p> <p>The rise in generation costs had preceded Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, and the resulting increase in global prices for gas, coal and other energy supplies had compounded Australia’s increases. Extreme weather in NSW and Queensland had also affected coal supplies and electricity demand, as had further unplanned outages at multiple generators, the regulator said.</p> <p>“In setting these new DMO prices, we understand the significant impact they will have on some consumers who may already be struggling with cost of living pressures,” Clare Savage, AER’s chair, said in a statement.</p> <p>“We have given scrutiny to all factors affecting the DMO calculation and have set safety-net prices that reflect the current conditions and underlying costs to retailers.”</p> <p>“If a large number of retailers are unable to recover their costs and are forced to exit the market – as we have seen recently in the United Kingdom – that will add more cost to consumers,” Savage said.</p> <p>The rises come as the Queensland government raised the rebate offered to households to $175 to help cope with soaring prices, up from $50 promised in February. The state’s wholesale electricity prices are the highest in the nation.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up forGuardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“People are having to make difficult choices including going without,” the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, told parliament on Thursday, noting the rebate was possible “because Queenslanders own their power assets – the generators, the transmission and the distribution.</p> <p>The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, announced his state will increase the amount of money available for households struggling to pay the bills by a third, starting Monday. <br><br>“Eligible customers can receive payment assistance of up to $400 per application for electricity and up to $400 per application for gas bills twice a year,” Kean said in a statement.</p> <p>“This means the annual maximum limit of vouchers has increased from $1,200 to $1,600 per household.”</p> <p>Weston Energy early this week told the market it could no longer supply gas to customers as agreed.

If you put it up too high people on the DMO end up paying above the odds,” Dufty said. “If you put it too low all people out on market offers might see greater increases in prices than those on the DMO.</p> <p>“It also indicates to me that households with solar are likely to see an increase in feed-in tariff to match the increase in wholesale prices – so may be somewhat insulated from the price changes,” he said.</p> <p>It was now a “great time” for people with healthcare cards and pension cards to be reminded that there are energy concessions available, Dufty said.</p> <p>Kellie Caught, Acoss’s energy program director, said the new Albanese government could act to shield low-income households from some of the increases.</p> <p>“As an immediate first step, the federal government should update its guidelines to the Australian Energy Regulator to set the Direct Market Offer at an efficient price by lowering retail margins, as has been done in Victoria,” she said. This would ensure people do not pay more than is required for an essential service.”</p> <p>“Other priorities include improvements to energy concessions and expanding access to energy efficiency measures and rooftop solar for low-income homeowners,” Caught said. “We also urge the government to immediately increase income support payments to at least $70 a day, so everyone can cover the basics.”</p> <p>The regulator said residential customers switching from the Dmo price to the median market offer could save between $294 and $443 depending on their network region. For small business customers, the switch could save between $733 and $1,308.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/may/26/rare-aboriginal-art-to-return-to-australia-after-victorian-government-chips-in-500000-at-last-minute","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-26T02:24:07Z","webTitle":"Rare Aboriginal art to return to Australia after Victorian government chips in $500,000 at last minute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/26/rare-aboriginal-art-to-return-to-australia-after-victorian-government-chips-in-500000-at-last-minute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/may/26/rare-aboriginal-art-to-return-to-australia-after-victorian-government-chips-in-500000-at-last-minute","fields":{"headline":"Rare Aboriginal art to return to Australia after Victorian government chips in $500,000 at last minute","trailText":"Two works from 1897 by Wurundjeri artist William Barak purchased at auction in New York ","body":"<p>The Victorian government has contributed $500,000 to secure the purchase of two rare artworks by Wurundjeri artist William Barak at auction in New York, in order to bring them back to the state.</p> <p>The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Corporation had raised $117,627 via a crowdfunding page to buy the artworks – a painting and a parrying shield – which were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/20/bring-them-home-australian-crowdfund-campaign-seeks-to-buy-wurundjeri-art-at-new-york-auction\">being sold by auction house Sotheby’s in New York</a> on Thursday morning, Melbourne time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"75cc3f60a2772bffbc5cb45346b387c259873f3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75cc3f60a2772bffbc5cb45346b387c259873f3a/0_0_800_1067/750.jpg\" alt=\"The parrying shield by Wurundjeri artist William Barak that sold for more than $74,000.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The parrying shield by Wurundjeri artist William Barak that sold for more than $74,000.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The state government contributed $500,000 after a meeting with the corporation late on Wednesday night – a last-minute shift in the government’s position.

Frustrated by the mounting uncertainties and lack of economic opportunities, they are resorting to a new buzzword – bai lan (摆烂, or <em>let it </em><em>rot</em> in English) – to capture their attitude towards life.</p> <p>The phrase, bai lan, which has its origin in NBA games, means a voluntary retreat from pursuing certain goals because one realises they are simply too difficult to achieve. In American basketball, it often refers to a player’s deliberate loss of a game in order to get a better draft pick.</p> <p>On Weibo, <a href=\"https://s.weibo.com/topic?q=%E6%91%86%E7%83%82&amp;pagetype=topic&amp;topic=1&amp;Refer=weibo_topic&amp;page=1\">the bai lan-related topics</a> have generated hundreds of millions of reads and discussions since March. Netizens also created different variations of the bai lan attitude. “Properties in Shanghai too expensive? Fine, I’ll just rent all my life, as I can’t afford it if I only earn a monthly salary anyway,” one grumbled.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/china-generation-z-resisting-marriage-and-babies\">‘Stop nagging!’: Why China’s young adults are resisting marriage and babies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In recent days, this phrase – and more previously ‘<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/05/the-low-desire-life-why-people-in-china-are-rejecting-high-pressure-jobs-in-favour-of-lying-flat\">tang ping’ (lying flat, 躺平)</a>, which means rejecting gruelling competition for a low desire life – gained popularity as severe competition and high social expectations prompted many young Chinese to give up on hard work.</p> <p>But bai lan has a more worrying layer in the way it is being used by young people in China: to actively embrace a deteriorating situation, rather than trying to turn it around. It is close to other Chinese phrases, for example ‘to smash a cracked pot’ (破罐破摔) and ‘dead pigs are not afraid of boiling water’ (死猪不怕开水烫).</p> <p>State media have taken note of this trend. “Why modern young Chinese like to ‘bai lan’?” one recent article in official media outlet asked. “In fact, this is as a result of negative auto suggestion, repeatedly telling oneself I cannot make it… And this kind of mentality often leads people to adopt the ‘bai lan’ attitude.”</p> <p>But the reality is not quite as state media suggested, says Sal Hang, a 29-year-old creative industry professional in Beijing. He says that for his generation of young Chinese, this attitude of letting things rot is likely to be caused by a lack of social mobility and increased uncertainty in today’s China.</p> <p>“Unlike my parents’ generation, young Chinese today have much bigger expectations, but there are many more uncertainties for us, too. For example, we cannot make any long-term plans for our lives any more, because we do not know what is going to happen to us even five years down the road.”</p> <p>After working as a flight engineer in south-western China, Hang moved to Beijing three years ago to work in music, his passion. But the workplace reality changed his initial ambition.</p> <p>“My boss often sets unrealistic targets for me. But however hard I try to meet his KPIs, I always fail.

the last gas supply station was hit.</p> \n  <p>Haidai added that Russian forces were attempting to “completely destroy” the city of Sievierodonetsk in an attempt to conquer the Donbas region, near Russia’s border. “They are simply erasing Sievierodonetsk from the face of the Earth,” Haidai said on his Telegram channel.</p> \n  <p>After failing to seize Kyiv or Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv,

part of the Ukrainian-held Donbas pocket, the city of Sievierodonetsk on the east bank of the Siverskyi Donets River and its twin Lysychansk, on the west bank, have become a pivotal battlefield as

Remarking how tall she’d grown since the last time he saw her, Biden turned to the audience and recalled that Gianna told him the first time they met: “My daddy is gonna change the world.”</p> <p>Biden began his remarks by addressing the massacre of 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas on Tuesday. “We’re here today for the same purpose – to come together and say, ‘Enough,’ ” he said.</p> <p>Wednesday’s action, which will apply to more than 100,000 federal law enforcement officers, reflects the delicate balance Biden has sought to strike on policing after promising to do “everything in my power” address racism and excessive use of force.

Floyd, who was Black, was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe.</p> <p>His death ignited a national movement against racial injustice and dramatically shifted long-held views on racism and policing. But translating the outcry into legislative action has proved elusive for Democrats, who narrowly control both chambers of Congress.</p> <p>Last year, the House passed legislation named in Floyd’s honor. But negotiations stalled in the evenly divided Senate, where 60 votes are needed to pass most legislation.</p> <p>Speaking before Biden on Wednesday, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, said Senate Republicans who opposed the legislation “walked away from their moral obligation” to address an issue that “caused millions of Americans to march in the streets”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"99e29b9fee85675bfeea9466e2a08adfc84af662\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99e29b9fee85675bfeea9466e2a08adfc84af662/0_0_3500_2187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Floyd’s daughter Gianna Floyd was among those at the signing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Floyd’s daughter Gianna Floyd was among those at the signing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>White House officials said the order had been finalized after more than 100 hours’ work and as many meetings with stakeholders including law enforcement officials, lawmakers, civil rights and civil liberties groups and families of victims of police violence.</p> <p>The resulting order is far narrower in scope than was initially sought, but civil rights leaders – and some major police groups – welcomed the policies.</p> <p>“We know full well that an executive order cannot address America’s policing crisis the same way Congress has the ability to but we’ve got to do everything we can,” Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP, who attended Wednesday’s signing ceremony, said in a statement.</p> <p>“There’s no better way to honor George Floyd’s legacy than for President Biden to take action by signing a police reform executive order.”</p> <p>Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd to the ground with his knee, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison.

Biden does not have direct authority over state and local agencies. But White House officials said the order incentivizes law enforcement agencies at every level to participate in the national police registry and to adopt the new accountability standards and de-escalation policies established by the order.</p> <p>Democrats are navigating a complicated political landscape on the issue of policing and crime with less than six months before the midterm elections. Republicans have sought to blame Democrats for rises in violent crime in some cities, a dubious claim that they tie to calls made by activists after Floyd’s death to slash police funding.</p> <p>As a candidate and as president, Biden has denounced efforts to “defund the police”, repeating, to the frustration of some in his party, that departments need more funding, not less.

But it does increase the pressure on the larger Pacific players – particularly Australia and New Zealand – to bolster their relationships and partnerships within the region. Earlier in May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/new-zealand-foreign-minister-blames-relationship-failure-for-china-solomons-security-deal\">Mahuta told the Guardian</a> that a shock security pact between China and Solomon Islands was evidence of “a relationship failure” and had taken both Australia and New Zealand by surprise.</p> <p>New Zealand’s opposition foreign affairs spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said news of the deal “begs the question: has our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Pacific missions been blind sided again?” In a morning radio appearance, Brownlee asked, “How didn’t they have some idea of why there was a 10-country visit by the Chinese foreign minister with a party of 20 others, and have some idea from their contacts in the Pacific what this was all about?”</p> <p>He said the fact that China had been able to “capitalise” on desire for development in the region, “puts a whole lot back on countries like New Zealand, Australia and the United States to be more involved”.</p> <p>Ardern was speaking to reporters after a meeting with senators and representatives in Washington DC. She said they had discussed “regional issues, the role of China in our region, the United States’ engagement with China”. Asked specifically about China’s new drafted Pacific deals, Ardern said: “I see it as China is trying to increase their engagement with sovereign nations – but expanding into a space where actually the need around security arrangements, we are able to meet within our region.”</p> <p>New Zealand’s foreign policy strategy under Ardern and Mahuta has been to emphasise that multilateral responses, primarily the Pacific Islands Forum, should be the first port of call for any security discussions. “China is seeking to draw in a wide membership of the Pacific,” Ardern said. “From New Zealand’s perspective, we see it as incredibly important that the response to it and those discussions actually come from within the Pacific as well.</p> <p>“The Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ meeting will be incredibly important as an opportunity for the Pacific to canvass its view on that increasing presence and the actions of China to increase its role in the Pacific.”</p> <p>On Wednesday, Mahuta met her Solomon Islands counterpart and announced New Zealand would renew its defence deployment to the country.</p> <p>“New Zealand will continue to work in partnership to weather the profound challenges that face our region,” she said. “Our region faces a range of complex security challenges, including climate change and increased economic vulnerability as a result of Covid-19.

China will want a significant public concession of some kind from Australia but in the current climate it is nigh on impossible to deliver anything while Beijing keeps multiple trade sanctions in place.</p> <p>While striking a positive tone, Xiao has also said that Beijing expects Australia to be “objective and rational” and “adopt a positive policy toward China”.</p> <p>Translated, that means keeping quiet about issues that Beijing regards as sensitive, like Hong Kong, Xinjiang and human rights issues, something that Australia won’t do.</p> <p>The Pacific diplomacy underlines that, however much either side tempers their rhetoric, regional competition is the name of the game. Certainly, that is Beijing’s priority, and everything is secondary.</p> <p>As Kevin Rudd, Australia’s former prime minister and China specialist, noted in comments before the election, Beijing’s professed desire for better ties with Australia sits oddly with its diplomatic rush in the Pacific.</p> <p>“I could not have prescribed a worse thing to do than say, ‘I know what we’re going to do, we’re going to announce or have agreed with our new best buddies in Honiara, this security pact with the government of Solomon Islands,’ ” Rudd said. “It is just politically illiterate for the Chinese party apparatus to have approved that as an approach.”</p> <p>There is no reason that Australia shouldn’t restart ministerial level talks with Beijing. Our partners the US, Japan and India all have such channels open to them.</p> <p>But nobody should mistake a resumption of such dialogue for a reset in bilateral relations. The coming week’s diplomatic frenzy in the Pacific should put an end to such notions for good.</p> <p>• Richard McGregor is a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2022/may/26/review-calls-for-child-protection-overhaul-in-england-after-two-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T23:01:48Z","webTitle":"Review calls for child protection overhaul in England after two deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/26/review-calls-for-child-protection-overhaul-in-england-after-two-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/may/26/review-calls-for-child-protection-overhaul-in-england-after-two-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Review calls for child protection overhaul in England after two deaths","trailText":"Report in wake of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson killings proposes new specialist teams","body":"<p>Child protection services in England face a shake-up after an independent review of safeguarding failures that led to the killings of six-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/02/arthur-labinjo-hughes-lockdown-played-part-in-childs-violent-death\">Arthur Labinjo-Hughes</a> and the toddler <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/14/star-hobson-murder-verdict-savannah-brockhill-frankie-smith\">Star Hobson</a>.</p> <p>The review’s central proposal is the creation of specialist child protection teams including social workers, mental health workers, police officers, paediatricians and child psychologists to oversee cases where children are at serious risk of harm.</p> <p>The report sets out the circumstances of what it calls the “unimaginably horrific deaths” of Arthur and Star and highlights a number of chances missed by child protection teams to save the children. There were multiple warnings from wider family members that the children were in danger.</p> <p>In both cases serious shortcomings in local child protection practice reflected wider national weaknesses, the report says. Safeguarding was too often ineffective and there was a lack of experience to handle complex and high-risk decisions, it says, requiring a strengthening of local and national safeguarding arrangements.</p> <p>“We think that there is too much inconsistency and ambiguity in child protection practice in England. This does not serve children, their families or practitioners well,” said the chair of the child safeguarding practice review panel, Annie Hudson, who carried out the review.</p> <p>Although she said this did not mean that the system was “broken” – every day, many thousands of children are protected from harm by conscientious, committed and capable professionals – Hudson said the current arrangements were “not consistently supportive or sophisticated enough to ensure the very best practice”.</p> <p>Child protection work is intrinsically complex and complicated and should be led by multi-agency child protection units, the report says. Too often inexperienced professionals – social workers in particular – are asked to undertake this work without sufficient supervision and support. “This is not fair to the social workers or the children they serve,” it says.</p> <p>The proposed new teams would be based in council children’s services departments, and would carry out formal investigations into local children at risk of harm, and chair child protection case conferences. Professionals from a range of agencies would be seconded to the units.</p> <p>The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, welcomed the review and promised to publish a “bold implementation plan” later this year to put its recommendations into action. “We must waste no time learning from the findings of this review – enough is enough,” he said.</p> <p>Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/02/arthur-labinjo-hughes-lockdown-played-part-in-childs-violent-death\">abused, tortured and beaten to death</a> by his stepmother, Emma Tustin, of Solihull, in June 2020, during the first Covid lockdown.

In December Savannah Brockhill, of Bradford, was sentenced to life for the murder, while Star’s mother, Frankie Smith, got eight years, later <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/frankie-smith-has-prison-sentence-increased#:~:text=On%2015%20December%202021%2C%20Frankie,the%20murder%20of%20Star%20Hobson.\">increased to 12</a>, for causing or allowing the death of a child.</p> <p>In each case, social workers, police and other professionals missed opportunities to intervene. They failed to develop a proper understanding of what daily life was like for Arthur and Star, or robustly share or interrogate and assess new information that came to light about them, the review found.</p> <p>Arthur’s wider family repeatedly raised concerns with police and social workers that he was being beaten and abused, but their reports were not taken seriously, the erport says. Safeguarding officials were too quick to accept Hughes’ explanation that his relatives’ warnings was “harassment” of him and Tustin.</p> <p>Star’s relatives’ warnings were similarly ignored, with professionals assuming wrongly that relatives were motivated by dislike of Brockhill and Smith’s lesbian relationship.

It is certainly more intimate than a film like The Year of Living Dangerously (1982), often more resembling an erotic hotel-room chamber piece.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a3574c415131260dd6745940f57861e6a93d9e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a3574c415131260dd6745940f57861e6a93d9e0/1227_0_5546_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Worrying close to Roger Moore … Joe Alwyn in Stars at Noon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worrying close to Roger Moore … Joe Alwyn in Stars at Noon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy: Cannes Film Festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Margaret Qualley plays Trish, who has come to the capital, Managua, as a freelance journalist but infuriates her sometime editor back in the US (a nice Zoom cameo for John C Reilly) by being utterly useless and unreliable. She is unable to get any lifestyle/travel articles off the ground and a rash political piece criticising corruption has earned her the loathing of the authorities.

But Trish – wily and streetsmart in ways that Daniel isn’t – tells Daniel this man is clearly a Costa Rican cop working for a government agency making common cause with the CIA against what Uncle Sam sees as an unhelpful nation state. Soon, this man is after Daniel’s head. Daniel, too, is not what he seems and as their danger increases, Trish and Daniel embark on a passionate affair.</p> <p>It is reasonably acted, although the cool, enigmatic sophistication required of Alwyn brings him worryingly close to Roger Moore territory.

Of the three previous ones, two were immediate failures in that Johnson made a poor impression on MPs, and non-loyalist commentators, straight away. The only one that was moderately successful was the last one, following the Met’s decision to fine Johnson last month, which worked because Johnson managed to maintain a tone of contrition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/apr/19/boris-johnson-partygate-covid-lockdown-fine-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-625ef0228f08931717fb431c#block-625ef0228f08931717fb431c\">more or less throughout the whole thing.</a> But then he ruined it later by going to a private meeting with Tory MPs and sounding unrepentant - which prompted Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and fearsome backbench organiser, to declare that he was no longer capable of forgiving Johnson (quite a statement - Baker is a devout Christian) and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/apr/21/boris-johnson-news-latest-partygate-inquiry-election-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-626154378f088371a5f3f6b8#block-626154378f088371a5f3f6b8\">he wanted him gone.</a></p> \n  <p>Today Johnson did not sound remotely “humbled”. He even sounded reluctant to use the words briefed out in advance: “I am humbled by the whole experience.” (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/may/25/partygate-live-sue-gray-report-published-boris-johnson-downing-street-no-10-drinking?page=with:block-628e027d8f08b48a6e743ba4#block-628e027d8f08b48a6e743ba4\">11.24am.)</a> When Johnson first delivered the line, it was “we are humbled by the experience” implying - not for the first time - that others were at fault, not him (although Johnson did go on to say “I am humbled” later). Then, to make things worse, he embarked on an attack on Keir Starmer which at the best of times would have sounded churlish, but which ended up sounding puerile too, because Johnson could not resist a cheap pun. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/may/25/partygate-live-sue-gray-report-published-boris-johnson-downing-street-no-10-drinking?page=with:block-628e1a808f084f9a73ca5dd9#block-628e1a808f084f9a73ca5dd9\">1.06pm.)</a> Dominic Raab’s response (see below) was very telling.

He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is clear from what Sue Gray has had to say that several of these gatherings then went on far longer than was necessary. They were clearly in breach of the rules and they clearly fell foul of the rules.</p> \n   <p>I have to tell the house - because the house will need to know this, and again this is not to mitigate or extenuate - but I had no knowledge of subsequent proceedings because I simply wasn’t there, and I have been as surprised and disappointed as anyone else in this house as the revelations unfolded.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But did he really not know that these sort of parties were going on late into the night in Downing Street?

Inside the Press Office a further 15-20 people were present. </p> \n   <p>There was food and alcohol available which had been bought and brought in by staff. Some members of staff drank excessively. The event was crowded and noisy 32 such that some people working elsewhere in the No 10 building that evening heard significant levels of noise coming from what they characterised as a ‘party’ in the Press Office. A cleaner who attended the room the next morning noted that there had been red wine spilled on one wall and on a number of boxes of photocopier paper. </p> \n   <p>The event lasted for several hours, with varying levels of attendance throughout, including because officials left to attend official meetings.

Martin Reynolds does not recall any such conversation. In addition, Dominic Cummings has also said that he too raised concerns, in writing. We have not found any documentary evidence of this. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T11:04:07.275Z\">at 12.04pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-628e07348f08b48a6e743bf2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T10:44:21.725Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sue Gray never fully investigated alleged party in Downing Street flat, report reveals</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On 13 November 2020, the day Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain quit No 10, it was claimed Carrie Johnson, the PM’s wife, hosted a party for her special adviser friends in the Downing Street flat. Carrie Johnson was very pleased to see Cummings and Cain go, and there were reports that Abba music was playing so loudly it could be heard some distance away. Boris Johnson attended at some point and there was surprise that neither he, nor his wife, were fined by the police over the event.</p> \n  <p>According to the Sunday Times, Carrie Johnson claimed that she and her advisers were holding a “strategy meeting”. The PM reportedly said he was interviewing an adviser about a possible job.</p> \n  <p>The report reveals that Sue Gray never properly investigated this. It says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Following the announcement of the departure of Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, a meeting was held in the No 10 flat from some time after 18.00 to discuss the handling of their departure. Five special advisers attended. The prime minister joined them at about 20.00. Food and alcohol were available. The discussion carried on later into the evening with attendees leaving at various points. </p> \n   <p>The information collected on this gathering is limited as the process of obtaining evidence had only just been commenced when the Metropolitan police announced their own investigations, which included events on the 13 November 2020. At this point I stopped my investigation, given the need to avoid any prejudice to the police investigation. Following the Metropolitan Police announcement on 19 May 2022 I considered whether or not to conduct any further investigation into this event but concluded it was not appropriate or proportionate to do so.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T10:48:46.718Z\">at 11.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-628e06468f08b48a6e743be5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T10:36:26.801Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is a picture from the report of the cabinet room on the occasion of the surprise birthday party for Boris Johnson.

They are similar in tone to the conclusions of her interim “update” published in January but there is new detail about how security and cleaning staff were treated by officials in No 10. “I was made aware of multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff,” Gray says.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The general findings set out in my update of 31st January 2022 still stand.</p> \n   <p>Whatever the initial intent, what took place at many of these gatherings and the way in which they developed was not in line with Covid guidance at the time. Even allowing for the extraordinary pressures officials and advisers were under, the factual findings of this report illustrate some attitudes and behaviours inconsistent with that guidance. It is also clear, from the outcome of the police investigation, that a large number of individuals (83) who attended these events breached Covid regulations and therefore Covid guidance. </p> \n   <p>I have already commented in my update on what I found to be failures of leadership and judgment in No 10 and the Cabinet Office. The events that I investigated were attended by leaders in government. Many of these events should not have been allowed to happen. It is also the case that some of the more junior civil servants believed that their involvement in some of these events was permitted given the attendance of senior leaders. The senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture.</p> \n   <p>In my update I made a number of general limited findings, I am pleased progress is being made in addressing the issues I raised. I commented on the fragmentary and complicated leadership structures in No 10. Since my update there have been changes to the organisation and management of Downing Street and the Cabinet Office with the aim of creating clearer lines of leadership and accountability and now these need the chance and time to bed in. </p> \n   <p>I found that some staff had witnessed or been subjected to behaviours at work which they had felt concerned about but at times felt unable to raise properly. I was made aware of multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff. This was unacceptable. I am reassured to see that steps have since been taken to introduce more easily accessible means by which to raise concerns electronically, in person or online, including directly with the Permanent Secretary in No 10. I hope that this will truly embed a culture that welcomes and creates opportunities for challenge and speaking up at all levels. </p> \n   <p>I also made a recommendation that steps should be taken to ensure that every Government Department has a clear and robust policy in place covering the consumption of alcohol in the workplace. Since then guidance has been issued to all Government Departments.</p> \n   <p>The matter of what disciplinary action should now take place is outside of the scope of this report and is for others to consider. Nothing set out in this report can be taken as constituting a disciplinary investigation or findings of fact appropriate for such a purpose. However, I do offer a reflection: while there is no excuse for some of the behaviour set out here it is important to acknowledge that those in the most junior positions attended gatherings at which their seniors were present, or indeed organised. I have no doubt that they will have taken the learning from this experience and, while this is not a matter for me, I hope this will be taken into account in considering any disciplinary action. </p> \n   <p>Many will be dismayed that behaviour of this kind took place on this scale at the heart of Government. The public have a right to expect the very highest standards of behaviour in such places and clearly what happened fell well short of this. It is my firm belief, however, that these events did not reflect the prevailing culture in Government and the Civil Service at the time. Many thousands of people up and down the country worked tirelessly to deliver in unprecedented times. I remain immensely proud to be a civil servant and of the work of the service and the wider public sector during the pandemic.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T11:02:46.800Z\">at 12.02pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-628e04398f08b48a6e743bc3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T10:26:18.610Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sue Gray report published</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Sue Gray report has been published.

Australia’s foreign relations are looking up, but Anthony Albanese has some tricky economic problems to get into at home. Here are the headlines to lead you into the day.</p> \n<p>America is still absorbing the shock of another bloody mass shooting, a day after an 18-year-old man wearing body armour and carrying assault rifles entered a primary school in Texas and <strong>gunned to death at least 19 children and two adults.</strong> The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/25/texas-school-shooting-news-victims-uvalde-elementary-school-latest-updates\">said at a press conference</a> that the shooter had posted on Facebook three times before his attack. The rightwing Abbott has presided over a weakening of gun regulations in Texas, despite repeated mass shootings in the state.

He told Guardian Australia the Morrison government had been widely seen as “refusing to take responsibility” to act on the climate crisis, and <strong> </strong>the Albanese government’s stronger stance was a “gamechanger” that would open doors to more cooperation internationally.</p> \n<p>Speaking of foreign policy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/25/australia-louder-than-we-should-have-been-in-criticising-china-says-former-asio-chief\">former intelligence chief Duncan Lewis has said</a> <strong>Australia has been “rather louder than we should have been” in public criticism of China</strong>, as the Chinese foreign minister embarks on an “extraordinary” Pacific tour – and that given escalating regional tensions, the wiser approach would’ve been to “speak softly and carry a big stick”.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile the <strong>UK’s partygate scandal continues.</strong> Sue Gray’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-law-breaking-no-10-parties-published-boris-johnson\">damning final report</a> on the string of boozy Downing Street lockdown parties was published yesterday.

But no. That old warhorse Location, Location, Location is back; Sarah Beeny is about to return with Little House, Big Plans; and, in between them, is George Clarke’s Flipping Fast (Channel 4).</p> <p>This new show, has, at least, captured something of the zeitgeist by adding a competitive element – and a faint whiff of desperation that thickens as the series progresses – to the standard property show. Six teams get £100,000 each to buy, revamp and resell as many places as they can for as much profit as they can in the space of a year. At the end of that time, the team that’s made the most profit gets to keep the £100,000 – as blandly personable host George Clarke puts it. I suspect the winner actually gets an additional £100,000. If the losing teams have to pay theirs back, it would bankrupt most of them and make for a very dark ending to the series. Still, it’s 2022 – it would be in keeping. I advise all competitors to check the small print.</p> <p>As ever with this kind of show, a simple setup provides a complex, addictive journey down the highways of misplaced optimism, the byways of human folly, the occasional slalom into the brick wall of actual stupidity, and the even more occasional emergence into the sunny uplands of a working intelligence.</p> <p>Our companions on the highways, byways and slaloms of the opening episode – all that is available for review – are Gordon and Pamela, a husband and wife from Norfolk. This couple listen attentively to the advice that sibling property developer team Scarlette and Stuart Douglas offer all the teams, and cheerily proceed to do the exact opposite. It is glorious.</p> <p>“Research the area you’re planning to buy in!” cry Scarlette and Stuart, because of basic common sense. “All right!” cry Gordon and Pamela. “Not!” They opt for a house in Stockton-on-Tees, a place they have never seen or heard of. Property prices in the area, we are told, have fallen 11% in the last year.</p> <p>“Have a good look round the property before you buy it!” cry Scarlette and Stuart, because of sanity.</p> <p>“Absolutely!” say Gordon and Pamela. “We will not!” They buy a house online, without so much as a survey. “It looks different to the pictures!” says Pamela when they arrive at their newly purchased wreck, as happily as if she is happening upon an overstuffed box of chocolates. “Got our work cut out for us!” says Gordon, apparently happening across the same box. “There’s a shower in the kitchen!” says Pamela, in – inexplicably – a tone that suggests she has just spied a top-notch peppermint cream.</p> <p>“This should not come as news to you, the purchaser of the house!” cries every viewer watching. “This should never come as news to you, the purchaser of any house!”</p> <p>“Do not go over budget at any stage!” cry Scarlette and Stuart. “£100,000 is not, when it comes to buying and flipping properties, an awful lot of money. Have a care, do.”</p> <p>“We,” say Gordon and Pamela, as they move the shower out of the kitchen, “won’t!” They have broken their budget buying the house, for £3,000 less than a fully renovated equivalent nearby would have cost. The unexpected expense of rewiring the place takes half their total planned renovation budget of £6,000. Then there’s the water that starts leaking everywhere (“Better turn the electrics off, Gordon!” laughs Pamela) when they try to manage everything themselves. That’s probably got to be sorted.</p> <p>“I think our gamble’s paid off,” says Gordon. “Let’s buy another place for £31,000 in celebration!”</p> <p>“Really interesting strategy, that,” says Clarke.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Harriet, a 28-year-old sports journalist, gets busy buying a one-bedroom flat, dragooning her highly skilled relatives into doing it up with her, and selling it for £19,000 profit.</p> <p>The other four are yet to get off the blocks.

The list of past winners is impressive – Antoine Dupont, Maro Itoje, Owen Farrell, Jonny Wilkinson – but an Anglo-French duopoly has existed since 2012 when Rob Kearney, the Leinster, Ireland and Lions full-back, collected the award.</p> <p>This time around the all-action Grégory Alldritt will be a warm favourite if La Rochelle win Saturday’s Champions Cup final in Marseille. Should Leinster prevail, though, they have three strong shortlisted contenders in Caelan Doris, James Lowe and Josh van der Flier. It is no disrespect to the excellent Doris and Lowe to suggest the latter would be a worthy winner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/24/leinsters-savage-beauty-could-make-them-europes-greatest-champions\">The Breakdown | Leinster’s savage beauty could make them Europe’s greatest champions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because the 29-year-old Van der Flier – pronounced as in “fear” rather than “liar” – has been comfortably the most improved top player in the northern hemisphere these past 12 months. This time a year ago he was conspicuously overlooked for the British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa; if it was being picked this week he would be all but inked into the Test back-row.</p> <p>If there has been a recurring image across this season, aside from the blue shirts of the all-conquering French national team, it has been the unmistakable red headgear of Van der Flier, either pouncing repeatedly on breakdown opportunities or being singled out by the TV cameras as the man of the match. He was not named Ireland’s players’ player of the year this month on a whim.</p> <p>So what has he suddenly started having for breakfast? The flanker seems to enjoy the joke – “I wish there was a bit of spinach I could put it down to” – but the biggest difference is the way he now approaches the game. There was a time when he was in danger of becoming so bogged down in detail and so obsessed with not making an error of any description that he was starting to limit the all-round contribution he could offer.</p> <p>Instead, encouraged by the Australia international forward Scott Fardy, he made a deliberate effort to try and relax more. The subsequent transformation has been striking. “I guess I’ve tried to grow my game a bit – to demand the ball more in attack, get a few more carries and involvements and have a bit more of an impact on defence. In the last two years I’ve probably made more mistakes than I ever have. Before I’d have been quite strict with myself about just doing my role and doing the simple things.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b745ba1cc779a6a7736233c4fd838747d2f229b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b745ba1cc779a6a7736233c4fd838747d2f229b0/0_205_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ireland’s Josh van der Flier, scoring against Scotland in March, has become a mainstay for both club and country.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ireland’s Josh van der Flier, scoring against Scotland in March, has become a mainstay for both club and country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A simple lesson gleaned from the former All Blacks captain Richie McCaw’s autobiography has also helped. “Initially, like me, he’d be disappointed if he didn’t get any turnovers in a game. But after a while he started to measure himself more in terms of how many opportunities he took. You could get three turnovers but that could actually be a poor result because you should have had 12. That approach to rugby and performance has certainly helped me. Otherwise you just end up chasing.”</p> <p>The Wicklow-born Van der Flier, whose Dutch grandparents moved to Ireland in the 1950s to open a radiator factory, also cites the input of the former England head coach Stuart Lancaster, now a key coaching cog at Leinster.</p> <p>“He has a huge focus on making individual players better. He’s been an incredible asset, certainly for me because he’s an ex-No 7 himself. Stuart runs a lot of our day-to-day training and his knowledge around growing a team and an organisational culture, along with [head coach] Leo Cullen, has been great for us. I’ve learned a huge amount from him.’</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-breakdown\" name=\"the-breakdown\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-breakdown\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-breakdown\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bulk of the credit, though, clearly goes to Van der Flier himself. “A year and a half ago I was kind of alternating with Will Connors, who was starting a lot of the games. That really pushes you on. You have to be better or people are going to overtake you.”</p> <p>Since last year’s Lions squad was named, tellingly, he has been on the winning side in 22 of the 24 games in which he has played. And now here is, a 40-cap international rubbing shoulders with the crème de la crème of European rugby. If Leinster do secure a fifth victory in the competition, their red-hatted flanker will be among the main reasons why.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/may/25/colin-kaepernick-las-vegas-raiders-workout-nfl","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T20:44:57Z","webTitle":"Raiders reportedly offer Colin Kaepernick first workout since start of NFL exile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/25/colin-kaepernick-las-vegas-raiders-workout-nfl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/may/25/colin-kaepernick-las-vegas-raiders-workout-nfl","fields":{"headline":"Raiders reportedly offer Colin Kaepernick first workout since start of NFL exile","trailText":"Colin Kaepernick has his best chance of returning to the NFL since his protest against social injustice effectively exiled him from the league, according to ESPN","body":"<p>Colin Kaepernick has his best chance of returning to the NFL since his protest against social injustice effectively exiled him from the league, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33983642/colin-kaepernick-work-las-vegas-raiders-week-sources-say\">according to ESPN</a>.</p> <p>League sources told ESPN that the quarterback will workout for the Las Vegas Raiders this week.

That’s never come out that I’ve been an issue for the people I’ve played with.”</p> <p>Kaepernick has become a popular figure among progressives in American and has fronted several high-profile advertising campaigns. He says he has kept himself in shape and could also boost revenues for the league if he returned.</p> <p>“So if you’re talking about the business side, it shows [it’s] beneficial,” he told the I Am Athlete podcast. “If you’re talking about the playing side, come in, let me compete. You can evaluate me from there. The NFL’s supposed to be a meritocracy. Come in, let me compete. If I’m not good enough, get rid of me. But let me come in and show you.”</p> <p>The Raiders are one of the more progressive franchises in the conservative world of the NFL. They were the first team to hire a Black head coach and a female chief executive. Last month, Raiders owner Mark Davis spoke complimented Kaepernick <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/raiders/colin-kaepernick-deserves-every-chance-be-nfl-qb-mark-davis-believes?cid=Yahoo&amp;partner=ya4nbcs\">during an appearance on NBC Sports Bay Area</a>. </p> <p>“<a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/colin-kaepernick-deserves-every-chance-170000784.html?guccounter=1\">I believe in Colin Kaepernick</a>,” Davis said. “He deserves every chance in the world to become a quarterback in the National Football League. I still stand by it. If our coaches and general manager want to bring him in or want him to be the quarterback on this team, I would welcome him with open arms.”</p> <p>The Raiders made the playoffs last season and have a talented roster but they play in the AFC West, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/wilson-mahomes-herbert-and-carr-is-the-afc-west-now-the-nfls-group-of-death\">the strongest division in the NFL</a>, which includes two of the best quarterbacks in football: the Kansas City Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes and the Los Angeles Chargers’ Justin Herbert.</p> <p>Kaepernick would almost certainly be a back-up if the team do agree a deal with him: the Raiders recently signed starting quarterback Derek Carr to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/13/las-vegas-raiders-sign-qb-derek-carr-to-reported-1215m-three-year-extension\">a $121.5m, three-year extension</a>. Kaepernick has said in the past that he would be willing to act as a back-up if he does return to the league. Former New England Patriot Jarrett Stidham, Chase Garbers and Nick Mullens are the other two quarterbacks currently on the Raiders roster.

Impossible to adequately articulate the fury and frustration that this just keeps on happening; that what happened in Uvalde, Texas, was not a horrific one-off, but just another day in the USA. And it’s impossible to imagine a scenario in which America’s depraved and dysfunctional relationship with firearms is going to change anytime soon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/the-guardian-view-on-us-gun-violence-another-desperate-day\">The Guardian view on US gun violence: another desperate day | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you want to see just how dysfunctional the US obsession with guns is, just take a look at how the right is responding to the horrific shooting. You’d think that 19 dead children might weigh on their conscience a little bit; make them reconsider commonsense gun laws. But, no, they are busy regurgitating all the usual talking points and arguing that guns aren’t actually the problem, everything else is.</p> <p>First, trans people and immigrants were blamed. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the Republican congressman Paul Gosar <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgnbq/texas-school-shooting-far-right-trans-woman\">tweeted</a> that the shooter was a “transsexual leftist illegal alien”. His source for this lie was the rightwing social network 4Chan, which was busy circulating the picture of a transgender artist and wrongly claiming it was the shooter. (He has now deleted the tweet.)</p> <p>Then the Federalist found a way to blame Ukraine for the shooting in Texas. “Sandy Hook proved the need to enhance K-12 security,” one headline blared. “<a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2022/05/25/sandy-hook-proved-the-need-to-enhance-k-12-security-congress-armed-ukraine-instead/\">Congress armed Ukraine instead</a>.” Gold medal for mental gymnastics right there.</p> <p>Then, last night, Fox News tried to shift blame on to the parents. Host Laura Ingraham strategically brought Andrew Pollack, the father of a Parkland victim who has previously argued that “guns didn’t kill my daughter, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/father-of-parkland-shooting-victim-andrew-pollack-blames-dems-guns-didnt-kill-my-daughter-but-democratic-policies-did\">Democratic principles did</a>,” <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/laura-ingraham-agrees-with-guest-who-puts-onus-on-parents-of-murdered-schoolchildren-guest-tells-them-its-your-responsibility/\">on to her show</a>.</p> <p>“It’s the parents,” Pollack told Ingraham. “It’s your responsibility where you’re sending your children to school … You need to check where your kids go to school. You need to go back to school and see. Is there a single point of entry? Do you have guards at the school?”</p> <p>He went on to suggest that it’s better for parents to take their kids out “of public school and put them in a private school because a lot of these private schools, they take security way more serious … Parents it’s your responsibility where you take your children.” Ingraham was very pleased with that analysis. “Andrew is exactly right,” she concluded.</p> <p>Pollack has previously expressed the idea that regulating guns is not the answer to preventing school shootings, and has advocated for schools to put in more “safety” measures like barriers, bulletproof glass and security officers. Ingraham pressed him on that point, stating that “[schools] still don’t have those safety mechanisms in place”.</p> <p>There you go: it’s all the parents fault! If you don’t have the money to send your kids to private school then it’s your fault if they get shot!</p> <p>Schools should not resemble prisons. They shouldn’t have to be fitted with barriers and staffed with armed guards to keep kids safe. Parents shouldn’t have to buy their children increasingly <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/bulletproof-backpacks-wouldn-t-have-saved-anyone-recent-shootings-n1042801\">popular bulletproof backpacks</a>. Kids shouldn’t have to go through active shooter-drills the moment they get into preschool. Not just because these sorts of measures are completely dystopian but because they aren’t actually effective. The vast majority of public schools – 96% in 2015 and 2016 – now conduct some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/us/politics/active-shooter-drills-schools.html\">form of lockdown drill</a>. Rather than preparing kids for a shooting, some experts warn that they are just <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/us/politics/active-shooter-drills-schools.html\">anxiety-inducing security theater</a>.</p> <p>Staffing schools with police officers is not the answer either. Since 1998, the government has invested over $1bn to increase police presence in schools; <a href=\"https://education.uconn.edu/2020/10/27/the-prevalence-and-the-price-of-police-in-schools/\">according to one study</a> only 1% of schools reported having police officers on-site in 1975 but by 2018, about 58% of schools reported having a police presence. There were already armed school district police officers at the school in Uvalde and they did not stop the shooter, who was wearing body armor. A sergeant with the Texas department of public safety <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/sergeant-says-police-engaged-gunman-before-he-entered-texas-elementary-school-to-no-avail/\">told CNN’s Anderson Cooper</a> that “there were several law enforcement that engaged the suspect, but he was able to make entry into the school”.</p> <p>If guns made people safer, then the United States would be the safest place in the world. How many more children have to die before the right accept that the answer to bad guys with guns is not good guys with guns, it’s getting rid of guns.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2022/may/25/primary-election-results-midterms-georgia-texas-alabama-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T20:09:37Z","webTitle":"Georgia primaries deliver blow to Trump’s grip on Republican party – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/25/primary-election-results-midterms-georgia-texas-alabama-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2022/may/25/primary-election-results-midterms-georgia-texas-alabama-latest","fields":{"headline":"Georgia primaries deliver blow to Trump’s grip on Republican party – live","trailText":"Several candidates who supported the ex-president’s big lie of election fraud were defeated but the Maga wing also had successes","body":"<div id=\"block-628e88cc8f084f9a73ca6371\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T20:08:37.334Z\">9.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Closing summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Thanks for following the US politics blog today.</strong> We’re closing down here, but you can keep up with developments in our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/25/texas-school-shooting-news-victims-uvalde-elementary-school-latest-updates\">live blog covering the Texas elementary school massacre here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s grip on the Republican party loosened with defeat for his “big lie” candidates in several key <strong>Georgia </strong>primary races.

He never campaigned alongside the ex-president but also took pains to avoid criticizing him and alienating his base. “Don’t insult Donald Trump but do everything to keep him away,” was how columnist Peggy Noonan put it in the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>Youngkin projected the image of a safe, sane, old school Republican who could win back suburban and independent voters. But he went Maga by pushing hot button issues such as coronavirus mask mandates, transgender bathrooms and “critical race theory” and portraying his opponent as a “woke” liberal. He flirted with, but did not embrace, Trump’s false claims of a stolen election.</p> <p>The formula has been emulated in various ways by candidates facing extreme Trump-backed challengers.

He was, according to some bookmakers, the tournament favourite to win Roland Garros even with Djokovic and Nadal present. He arrived in Paris with expectations higher than they have been for any teenager since Nadal 17 years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/25/emma-raducanu-crashes-out-of-french-open-in-second-round-to-aliaksandra-sasnovich-tennis\">‘A long way to go’: Raducanu out of French Open after defeat to Sasnovich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet in a delirious battle on Court Simonne-Mathieu late into Wednesday evening, sixth seed Alcaraz nearly fell at the second hurdle. Alcaraz stood match point down in the fourth set on Albert Ramos-Viñolas’s serve, then he trailed 0-3 in a fifth set that threatened to fall from his grasp and he simply could not find his form on so many of the 31 break points he generated. No matter, Alcaraz somehow recovered to defeat Ramos-Viñolas 6-1, 6-7 (7), 5-7, 7-6 (2), 6-4 and reach the third round.</p> <p>The challenge before Alcaraz on the third biggest court was one of the ultimate irritants in the game. Although he has no great weapon, Ramos-Viñolas lives for clay courts where he can prod, push and disrupt opponents into madness. He combines his relentless ability to open up the court through angles with strong movement and steadfast consistency, which has taken him into the top 20 and a Roland Garros quarter-final.</p> <p>After being blown away 6-1 in the first set by an on-fire Alcaraz, the 34-year-old Spaniard slowly dug into Alcaraz’s psyche and infuriated him. As Alcaraz’s errors flowed, he took the second and third sets and then he broke to serve for the match at 5-4. In the tight deuce game that followed, Ramos-Viñolas had the match point on his racket as he attacked an inside-out forehand, but it hit the top of the net and fell on his side. By cutting out his own errors, keeping the ball in play and striking one outrageous bounce smash winner, Alcaraz survived before edging out the tie-break.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5627ab9ab587e3e9a7de81021c515f89fdf9401\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5627ab9ab587e3e9a7de81021c515f89fdf9401/0_0_4825_3217/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafael Nadal plays a backhand on his way to straight-sets victory over Corentin Moutet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafael Nadal plays a backhand on his way to straight-sets victory over Corentin Moutet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aurélien Meunier/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout the fifth set, as his groundstrokes and drop shots continued to splutter, Alcaraz tried everything, battering forehands and retrieving for his life. At one point he even chipped and charged, burying a backhand volley at the end. The match was ultimately decided by two supreme pieces of skill and athleticism.</p> <p>He broke serve for 4-3 with a moment of absurdity, a running single-handed backhand passing shot at the edge of his range. When Ramos-Viñolas immediately broke back, Alcaraz responded by retrieving three overheads in a row before forcing a volley error. Both times, he had the audience in shock at what they had just witnessed. Alcaraz recovered in the end, moving to an outrageous 30-3 record in 2022.</p> <p>This could be a moment of friction that releases Alcaraz’s inhibitions and allows him to play at the top of his level in the matches to come, or it could be an indication that despite the hype, he may not quite be ready for grand-slam success. What is clear is that Alcaraz is one of the most thrilling sights in the sport right now and his matches to come will be essential viewing.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Cameron Norrie calmly reached the third round with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 win over Jason Kubler.

And just as Alan Partridge said his favourite Beatles album was The Best of the Beatles, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/15/baz-luhrmann-flamboyant-director-of-moulin-rouge-and-romeo-and-juliet-turns-focus-to-elvis\">Luhrmann has given us a film</a> built around what he imagines is the best of Elvis Presley.</p> <p>It’s not a movie so much as 159-minute trailer for a film called Elvis – a relentless, frantically flashy montage, epic and yet negligible at the same time, with no variation of pace. At the end of it all, you might find yourself pondering the eternal questions: what does Luhrmann think of Elvis’s music? Does he, for example, prefer some Elvis songs to others? Has he listened to any of Elvis’s songs all the way through? Or does he shut down Spotify after 20 seconds once he reckons he’s got the gist?</p> <p>These issues arise because of the weirdly incurious approach here to Presley’s music and his life, featuring a competent but not especially inspired performance from Austin Butler as the pelvis-swivelling, American-youth-deranging King himself. The film really wastes its one potential trump card: a human toad performance from Tom Hanks as his creepy and parasitic manager Colonel Tom Parker, who exploited him ruthlessly and refused to let him tour abroad, finally turning him into a bloated rhinestone parody in an unending cash-cow Vegas residency while the rest of the world moved on. (The soundtrack absolutely hammers the “caught in a trap” line from Suspicious Minds in case we miss the point.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBDLRvjHVOY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wBDLRvjHVOY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But Luhrmann is clearly unwilling or unable to explore the dysfunctional Jekyll-and-Hyde relationship between the Colonel and Elvis in case any sort of dark or sad mood predominates. Colonel Tom is a kind of repeating cameo in Elvis’s life and Luhrmann is even less interested in Parker’s inner self than in Elvis’s – the Colonel’s own wretched post-Elvis life and death are shrugged off in the closing credit titles.</p> <p>We get the basics of Presley’s career: the early days of hardship, the profound influence of black music, the blues and gospel; his days on the hayseed country circuit before signing for Parker, the huge Elvismania success, the shrewd decision to calm moral-majority fears by doing two years military service in Germany, marriage to Priscilla, the bubblegum movies, the televised 1968 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/15/elvis-1968-comeback-special-review-film-concert\">Comeback Special</a> and the long Vegas goodbye.</p> <p>There are some tiny unpredictable touches – such as a hint that Elvis secretly inflamed young gay men in the States as well as straight women. But otherwise it sticks to a defanged version of the script. There is, for example, not really any such thing as Fat Elvis here. He stays sweaty but reasonably svelte until almost the very end, when we see a decorous hint of flab. But we don’t see the yucky burger binges or the adult diapers. Luhrmann is at all times concerned to rescue Elvis from irony and failure and suffering.</p> <p>And how about that legendary encounter with the one US president that Elvis really did admire – Richard Nixon – when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/sep/20/elvis-the-spy-was-the-king-really-spying-on-john-lennon-for-richard-nixon\">King was cordially received in 1970</a> at the White House because he demanded presidential action on the country’s infatuation with degenerate lefties like the Beatles? Nothing. That isn’t shown.</p> <p>This version of Elvis, with retrofitted liberal sensitivities, is always breaking off what he’s doing to look stunned at the TV reporting the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F Kennedy, and to be soulfully devastated at the loss of these American icons. Well … maybe. But the film erases his actual Republican sympathies.

One of the strangest, most unpredictable, most politically charged episodes in the history of English football is finally over. Roman Abramovich has left the building and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/chelsea-sale-completed-after-roman-abramovich-agrees-to-government-terms\" title=\"\">Todd Boehly’s consortium has taken control of Chelsea</a> after the UK government granted permission for the £4.25bn takeover to go through with a week to go before the club’s special operating licence was due to expire.</p> <p>That date, 31 May, had loomed large in the diary. It felt fraught with danger when government sources suggested the deal was in danger of collapsing because of fears that Abramovich wanted to renege on his promise to write off his £1.6bn loan to the club. The wildest scenarios had Chelsea going bust if they missed the sale deadline and, given all the twists and turns over the past three months, it was not always easy to be entirely confident that the story was going to end with Boehly’s group promising to give Thomas Tuchel significant funds to rebuild his squad.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/chelsea-sale-completed-after-roman-abramovich-agrees-to-government-terms\">Chelsea target Koundé and Gvardiol after government clears takeover</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The only way to cope has been to suspend your disbelief ever since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February made Abramovich’s 19-year ownership of Chelsea untenable. Events moved swiftly after the Russian oligarch was named in parliament by the Labour MP Chris Bryant, who said that the 55-year-old was identified by the Home Office in 2019 as having links to the Russian state and to “corrupt activity and practices”. The writing was on the wall. Abramovich, who had instructed the US bank Raine to begin the search for a new owner, knew the game was up.</p> <p>Hansjörg Wyss, an 86-year-old Swiss billionaire, had already said he was interested in buying Chelsea by the time Abramovich confirmed his intention to sell on 2 March. The process was under way. Prospective bidders began to put plans in place, some less plausible, others more credible.</p> <p>Muhsin Bayrak, a Turkish businessman, repeatedly insisted he was making an offer. Nick Candy, the British property tycoon, made a lot of noise after throwing his hat in the ring. A Ghanaian gold mine owner, Bernard Antwi Boasiako, said he was a serious bidder.</p> <p>It was Raine’s job to cut through the noise. It had soon emerged that Wyss had teamed up with Todd Boehly, a part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Boehly’s investors included his fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter, the British property developer Jonathan Goldstein, and the US investment firm Clearlake Capital; the group looked the real deal and felt like the obvious favourites from the start.</p> <p>Yet the process was complicated when the government imposed sanctions on Abramovich on 10 March. Chelsea were placed under a restrictive operating licence that stopped them from selling new tickets for home games, capped their travel costs, forced them to close the club shop and prevented them from handing out new contracts, leaving them powerless to stop Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rüdiger from leaving on free transfers.</p> <p>Suddenly the sale had an extra layer of jeopardy. The government would not allow a single penny to go to Abramovich. Raine, assisted by Chelsea’s chairman, Bruce Buck, and the club’s director Marina Granovskaia, battled against the clock to find a shortlist of four bidders by 25 March. They were Boehly’s group, a consortium led by Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Coe, a bid fronted by the Ricketts family, and Stephen Pagliuca’s consortium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb5a89833815c175fad945518e10a6ba5cc01bbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb5a89833815c175fad945518e10a6ba5cc01bbe/0_40_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Jim Ratcliffe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos made a late bid to buy Chelsea in April but Todd Boehly’s consortium ultimately succeeded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next stage began – and it was no less dizzying. The Ricketts family faced historical accusations of Islamophobia, were opposed by Chelsea fans and eventually pulled out of the running after their consortium failed to decide how to fund a final bid. Broughton’s group, that intriguingly had backing from the Crystal Palace shareholders Josh Harris and David Blitzer, and enlisted the help of Lewis Hamilton and Serena Williams. Pagliuca sought support from John Terry.</p> <p>The race grew bitter. Buck faced accusations of favouritism towards the Ricketts family and there was shock when Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the owner of Ineos, made an offer of £4.25bn just as Raine was preparing to select Boehly’s group as the favoured bidders on 29 April.</p> <p>Ratcliffe had left it too late. Raine had come too far and a purchase agreement was signed with Boehly’s group on 6 May. Boehly and his partners had passed every test. They had met Abramovich’s asking price of £2.5bn and had agreed to invest a further £1.75bn in Chelsea’s infrastructure. Sizeable bonuses were also due to be paid to Granovskaia and Buck as recognition for their roles in the deal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/todd-boehly-chelsea-vision-glossy-spectacle-ruthless-profit\">Todd Boehly’s vision for Chelsea? Glossy spectacle and ruthless profit | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet there were still challenges to overcome. The government needed to approve the sale and there were concerns about the £1.6bn debt owed by Fordstam Ltd, Chelsea’s parent company, to Camberley International Investments, a Jersey-based company that appears to be linked to Abramovich.</p> <p>On it went, fans panicking when government sources raised the prospect of Abramovich letting Chelsea go out of business. Yet the doomsday scenario felt slightly overblown. The talks continued and a solution was found. The initial £2.5bn from the sale will go into an escrow account, where it will stay until the government is satisfied the money will go to a charity for victims of the war in Ukraine, and the final obstacle was out of the way once Abramovich agreed to legally binding guarantees stating that the money from the loan will go into a frozen account under government control.</p> <p>“We’re getting there,” a Westminster source said earlier this week. Mike Penrose, the former Unicef UK executive director, had been asked to head the charitable foundation. There was light at the end of the tunnel. Chelsea had endured a difficult end to the season, pockets of empty seats at Stamford Bridge at several games underlining their plight, but they finally woke to good news on Wednesday morning. The government had finally issued a licence for the sale and Chelsea could start to look forward to life under Boehly.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/may/25/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-season-by-season-appointment-to-champions-league-final-paris","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T19:45:44Z","webTitle":"Seven ages of Klopp: Liverpool’s journey from his appointment to Paris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-season-by-season-appointment-to-champions-league-final-paris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/may/25/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-season-by-season-appointment-to-champions-league-final-paris","fields":{"headline":"Seven ages of Klopp: Liverpool’s journey from his appointment to Paris","trailText":"A season-by-season look at the team’s evolution as they prepare for Saturday’s Champions League final","body":"<h2>2015-16</h2> <p>Jürgen Klopp had worked with Liverpool’s squad for only three days before his first game. As such, he could have been forgiven for sticking with the tactical setup and style used by his predecessor, Brendan Rodgers. Instead he went full-on <em>gegenpressing</em> from the get-go.</p> <p>The team were organised in Klopp’s favoured 4-3-3 and ran themselves into the ground. Tottenham did not know what had hit them, literally at times, as their opponents pressed relentlessly. There was a thirst to win possession quickly and use it even quicker, and the afternoon ended with Liverpool covering more distance than they had in any previous game that season and becoming the first team to run further than Spurs had (116km to 114.8km).</p> <p>The revolution was immediately under way but it was obvious there was work to do: Liverpool’s play was unrefined and out-and-out chaotic at times, and that remained the case for the rest of the season. The weaknesses were exposed in the two finals they reached, against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup and Sevilla in the Europa League, the latter an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/liverpool-sevilla-europa-league-final-match-report\">especially chastening occasion</a> because defeat not only meant missing out on a trophy but on Champions League qualification.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"667b2d6576add62cc2eedd34ad4e67a6edfd1f9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/667b2d6576add62cc2eedd34ad4e67a6edfd1f9b/3_9_1361_939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool starting XI, 2015-16\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starting XI: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/17/tottenham-hotspur-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Tottenham 0-0 Liverpool</a>, 17 October 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2016-17</h2> <p>Liverpool recorded this fourth league victory, and third in succession, early in Klopp’s first full season via a performance that well and truly showed the German was delivering on his promise of bringing heavy-metal football to Anfield.</p> <p>The hosts were scintillating against Mike Phelan’s Hull and key were two changes to the frontline: Roberto Firmino taking up a false 9 position, something introduced in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/21/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">4-1 victory at Manchester City</a> the previous season, and the inclusion of Sadio Mané after his summer arrival from Southampton. Eyebrows were raised when Liverpool <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/28/sadio-mane-signs-liverpool-southampton\">spent £30m on the Senegalese</a> but he injected devastating speed and ruthlessness, and it was a measure of his importance that Liverpool’s pursuit of the title essentially collapsed while he was on Africa Cup of Nations duty.</p> <p>Liverpool also signed Georginio Wijnaldum from Newcastle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/22/football-liverpool-sign-georginio-wijnaldum-newcastle-jurgen-klopp\">for £25m in the summer of 2016</a> and, like Mané, the midfielder played a significant role in the team securing Champions League football via a fourth-place finish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d15575c4b1438038017b2b3a676ca3d0a3ed9324\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d15575c4b1438038017b2b3a676ca3d0a3ed9324/2_10_1362_940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool starting XI, 2016-17\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starting XI: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/liverpool-hull-city-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool 5-1 Hull</a>, 24 September 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2017-18</h2> <p>Ask Liverpool supporters to name their favourite season under Klopp and it’s possible many would go for 2017-18 despite it ending with no trophies and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/26/real-madrid-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\">Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid</a> in Kyiv. That’s because the football was thrilling from a team that signalled the glory to come.</p> <p>Klopp had the high-energy, high-quality full-backs he had wanted since arriving in Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson – the latter an £8m purchase from Hull that highlighted Klopp’s shrewd eye for unheralded talent – and, crucially, a world-class centre-back in Virgil van Dijk, bought in January from Southampton for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/01/virgil-van-dijk-describes-liverpool-as-perfect-match-after-completing-75m-world-record-transfer\">club-record £75m</a>, the deal funded with some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/06/philippe-coutinho-join-barcelona-142m-deal-liverpool\">£142m Barcelona had paid for Philippe Coutinho</a> that month. The Brazilian was a big loss but Liverpool fans got over it because of the manner in which Van Dijk brought calm and order to the backline and allowed the team to play higher up the pitch with his outstanding positioning, awareness and pace. His was a gamechanging arrival.</p> <p>Speaking of which, this was also the season Mohamed Salah <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/22/liverpool-transfer-deal-mohamed-salah-roma\">joined from Roma for £36.9m </a>and scored 44 goals in 52 appearances. The Egyptian completed one of the greatest frontlines in English football history, the trio demonstrating their prowess, individually and collectively, in February’s Champions League last-16 first leg thrashing of Porto. Mané scored a hat-trick while Salah and Firmino got one each.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96f820f524cd9d9ba507aaf47602a22248a55921\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96f820f524cd9d9ba507aaf47602a22248a55921/2_5_1361_943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool starting XI, 2017-18\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starting XI: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/14/porto-liverpool-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report\">Porto 0-5 Liverpool</a>, 14 February 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2018-19</h2> <p>Another season, another Champions League final and this time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\">Liverpool triumphed</a>. Among the most obvious reasons was a change in goalkeeper. Loris Karius had essentially cost Liverpool in Kyiv and Klopp, having been loyal to him and Simon Mignolet for some time, realised he needed a genuine, world-class No 1. Step forward Alisson, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/19/alisson-becker-completes-liverpool-move-world-record-deal-roma\">arrived from Roma in July 2018</a> for £65m – essentially the remainder of the Coutinho money – and capped an excellent season with an excellent display against Tottenham in Madrid, pulling off eight saves.</p> <p>Like Van Dijk, Alisson was a gamechanger, the Brazilian combining supreme technical ability and assurance with speed and positional awareness that meant he fitted seamlessly into a team that played with a high line.</p> <p>Another important signing in the summer of 2018 was another Brazilian: Fabinho. Klopp appeared content with not deploying a specialist defensive midfielder but, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/21/emre-can-to-move-from-liverpool-to-juventus-on-five-year-contract\">Emre Can’s departure for Juventus</a>, he went and got one. Fabinho took time to settle after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/28/liverpool-fabinho-monaco-close-signing\">arrival from Monaco for £40m</a> but was fully established by the turn of the year, his athleticism, aggression and technical quality bringing greater security, in and out of possession, to a Liverpool side that had gone up a level, reflected not only in Europe but also at home where they racked up 97 points, missing out on the title to Manchester City by a point. It was the birth of Klopp’s “mentality monsters”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd721cab99c96e95e68300ad6e413f66e9180220\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd721cab99c96e95e68300ad6e413f66e9180220/2_9_1363_941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool starting XI, 2018-19\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starting XI: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\">Tottenham 0-2 Liverpool</a>, 1 June 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2019-20</h2> <p>The team that captured Liverpool’s first title in 30 years – as well as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/14/liverpool-chelsea-uefa-super-cup-match-report\">Super Cup</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/liverpool-flamengo-club-world-cup-final-match-report\">Club World Cup</a> – was essentially the same as from the previous season. They had momentum and belief and made it count, all but wrapping up the championship before the pandemic forced a break.</p> <p>If there was one change it was in central defence. Joël Matip had been excellent alongside Van Dijk during the 2018-19 season but the following campaign serious knee and ankle injuries restricted him to 13 appearances. In his place came Joe Gomez, Van Dijk’s regular partner in 2018-19 until he sustained a serious ankle injury in December.</p> <p>Gomez returned to full fitness and made 43 appearances in 2019-20, including in the victory against Crystal Palace on a warm evening at a near-empty Anfield that put Liverpool within touching distance of the title.

With Dejan Lovren <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/27/dejan-lovren-leaves-liverpool-zenit-jurgen-klopp-and-mo-salah-pay-tribute\">having also joined Zenit Saint Petersburg</a> in the summer, the manager found himself in a hole at centre-back and tried various solutions, including deploying Jordan Henderson and Fabinho as a partnership. It led to the midfield, and the team, breaking down.</p> <p>Klopp signed two defenders in January – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/feb/01/liverpool-sign-ozan-kabak-and-ben-davies\">Ben Davies from Preston for £1.6m and Ozan Kabak from Schalke on loan</a>. The former never featured and the latter struggled in a side that lost their way, seen starkly with a run of six successive home league losses. A lack of crowds contributed to the slump and whereas there was nothing Klopp could do about that, he could solve the on-pitch deficiencies, turning to two academy graduates. Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams started together in central defence in each of the five end-of-season wins that secured Champions League qualification, among them a 4-2 victory at Old Trafford. The pair, aged 24 and 20 respectively, were raw but displayed maturity in trying circumstances. </p> <p>Other factors contributed to Liverpool’s revival, including the displays of the summer arrivals Thiago Alcântara and Diogo Jota. And then there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/16/west-brom-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Alisson’s header at the Hawthorns</a>, an extraordinary moment that added to the sense of this being a one-off campaign in the Klopp timeline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c537a05efdd0c79358395c4d140240be91390009\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c537a05efdd0c79358395c4d140240be91390009/0_5_2041_1412/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool starting XI, 2020-21\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starting XI: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/13/roberto-firmino-double-helps-liverpool-past-lacklustre-manchester-united\">Manchester United 2-4 Liverpool</a>, 13 May 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2021-22</h2> <p>Klopp’s most recent season has been one in which his senior centre-backs have returned and, in general, he has been able to lean on the players who have served him so well for so long. But it has also seen a notable renewal of his resources.</p> <p>That has been most striking in the frontline. Luis Díaz has been a revelation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/liverpool-luis-diaz-tottenham-kulusevski-bentancur-transfer-news\">since arriving from Porto for £37m in January</a>, his speed, skill, aggression and hard work making him a seamless fit. And such has been the Colombian’s impact that Klopp has moved Mané into a central position to accommodate the pair. Jota has also featured prominently, meaning Firmino increasingly finding himself on the sidelines, albeit in part because of injury.</p> <p>In central defence Ibrahima Konaté has proved a towering presence after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/28/liverpool-seal-36m-deal-for-rb-leipzig-defender-ibrahima-konate\">£36m arrival from RB Leipzig</a>, and in midfield Thiago has established himself as fundamental, his passing range bringing a new and, at times, stunning level of control and incisiveness. He and Fabinho are first-choice picks with Naby Keïta increasingly chosen ahead of Jordan Henderson as the third midfielder after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/07/georginio-wijnaldum-signs-contract-to-join-psg-rather-than-barcelona\">Wijnaldum’s summer move to Paris Saint-Germain</a>.

He said: “I am now unable to give the prime minister the benefit of the doubt and feel it is now in the public interest for him to resign.”</p> \n<p>Sturdy is understood to be one of at least three Tory MPs who submitted letters of no confidence in Johnson on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The prime minister told MPs he took “full responsibility for everything that took place on my watch”. But he insisted it had never occurred to him that any of the eight gatherings he attended were against the rules.</p> \n<p>As Johnson gave a press conference, cabinet ministers sent a coordinated round of tweets, each suggesting it was time to stop focusing on the Partygate scandal.</p> \n<p>The Tory co-chair Oliver Dowden said: “A full and genuine apology has been given and it’s now time to move on.” </p> \n<p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who was fined alongside Johnson for attending the prime minister’s birthday party, repeated his own apology and added: “The prime minister has apologised and lessons have been learned. I hope we can now move forward and continue delivering for the British people.”</p> \n<p>Johnson, explaining his appearance at events including leaving dos, said he saw it as an important part of his role to say goodbye to departing colleagues. He is pictured in the Gray report raising a glass to the departing director of communications, Lee Cain, in November 2020.</p> \n<p>“I believe they were work events, they were part of my job, and that view appears to be substantiated by the fact I wasn’t fined for those events,” Johnson said. “I believe that recognising achievement and preserving morale are essential duties of leadership.”</p> \n<p>He claimed that staff at the parties, some of which continued into the small hours, believed they were working. </p> \n<p>“It’s my strong impression that they genuinely believed that what they were doing was working. I certainly don’t think that they set out to deceive you about that,” Johnson said when challenged about whether No 10 spokespeople had lied when they repeatedly said no parties took place. Several of the events described by Gray were held in the Downing Street press office.</p> \n<p>Johnson will now face an inquiry from the House of Commons privileges committee about whether he misled parliament when he claimed Covid guidance was followed at all times.</p> \n<p>Insiders believe the hundreds of photographs Gray received as part of the inquiry will be handed to the privileges committee as part of a bundle of evidence next week. Gray published seven photos in her report, all taken by Johnson’s official photographer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/weve-been-burned-before-tory-plotters-lie-low-after-gray-report\">‘We’ve been burned before’: Tory plotters lie low after Gray report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, who has repeatedly shifted position on Johnson, said the PM should step down if he is found by the committee to have lied.</p> \n<p>“If they reach a conclusion that the prime minister deliberately and intentionally went to the House of Commons to mislead people, then the ministerial code is actually very clear.

We are losing trust with the public and we will need to make some very tough decision in the coming months. We cannot make [those decisions] with any support or authority without that trust.”</p> <p>Another put it even more bluntly. “If we have Johnson at the next election then my voters will vote Lib Dem. If we don’t, they won’t.”</p> <p>An ex-minister predicted that others would send letters within days, but said there would be no organised coup.</p> <p>The backbench “greybeards” who rarely sought publicity were the ones reaching the end of their tether, the source said. “We are very definitely on the road to 54,” they said – a reference to the number of letters needed to trigger a leadership vote.</p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon, Julian Sturdy, the MP for York Outer, posted a statement on Twitter calling for Johnson to quit. Two others have not gone public.</p> <p>One MP who had spoken to Sturdy over the past two days said they had heard no hint of what he was planning – evidence, they suggested, that most rebels were acting alone, disorganised and disparate.</p> <p>Many have been burned by the experiences of trying to oust May. One MP who went public with a letter against May said they were not prepared to take that personal hit again by revealing their public position on Johnson. “A lot of us have been burned before – but also that means no one is telling anyone what they are thinking.”</p> <p>Another insisted they were working “with every breath in my body, with every fibre of my being” to get Johnson out of Downing Street. This MP has not publicly called for Johnson to go.</p> <p>Others with higher profiles, such as ex-ministers, said they were wary of being categorised only as a “Tory rebel” – a label that would stop them having a meaningful impact on other topics.</p> <p>Johnson’s public persona has been bullish about his survival, but inside No 10 one source admitted there were nerves among senior staff. Gray’s report arrived on the prime minister’s desk two hours late on Wednesday – a printed copy arrived just after 10am.</p> <p>Johnson was holed up in his study with his director of communications, Guto Harri, and chief of staff, Steve Barclay.</p> <p>Those who were present as the prime minister flicked through the pages say he was shaking his head, but particularly when it came to the part describing how staff had insulted a security guard during a booze-filled bash.</p> <p>Still, a plan was crystallising that Johnson could successfully extricate himself from the worst of the behaviour detailed in the report.</p> <p>One “red wall” backbencher who has wavered over Johnson’s future admitted it was “very hard to read the mood” when Johnson finished making his statement to MPs. Departing the chamber, another MP said they believed it would take several days to sink in with colleagues.</p> <p>The intention was to make Wednesday the final show of genuine contrition, but by the end of the day many Conservative MPs said they were vexed yet again by the prime minister’s inability to strike the right tone.</p> <p>Of Johnson’s key critics, several stayed away or decided they had seen enough even before 20 minutes of exchanges were up. Theresa May, the former prime minister, sat poised in her usual seat, but clearly decided it was not the moment for another intervention.</p> <p>Steve Baker, too, who had previously called for the prime minister to go, called it a day at about the same time that May departed. Mark Harper, who has also been public about how much the saga has appalled him, stood upright at the bar of the house, never taking his eyes off Johnson.</p> <p>Only Tobias Ellwood, a former defence minister, was prepared to take on the role of the Cassandra, appealing directly to Conservative MPs’ self interest by warning they were on the road to losing the next election. They heckled him.</p> <p>“Can we continue to govern without distraction given the erosion of the trust with the British people?” he said, turning to the benches beside him. “If we cannot work out what we’re going to do, then the broad church of the Conservative party will lose the next general election.”</p> <p>Johnson’s final outing of the day was to address Conservative MPs in a private meeting of the 1922 Committee. In the privacy of committee room 14, Johnson ribbed the MP Harriett Baldwin who suggested banning booze in No 10 – saying the UK would not have won the second world war without it.</p> <p>“He cannot help but play the after-dinner speaker and it pains me my colleagues just watch it like clapping seals,” one MP said.</p> <p>Few of his public critics showed their faces, though one who lingered in the door said even at the threshold he was questioning himself why he was there. “For old time’s sake?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/25/trump-hang-mike-pence-chant-jan-6","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T19:27:09Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump said maybe mob was right to chant ‘Hang Mike Pence’ – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/trump-hang-mike-pence-chant-jan-6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/25/trump-hang-mike-pence-chant-jan-6","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump said maybe mob was right to chant ‘Hang Mike Pence’ – report","trailText":"New York Times reports witnesses told Capitol attack committee about ex-president’s comment, made on day of January 6 riot","body":"<p>Donald Trump reportedly reacted to chants about hanging his vice-president, Mike Pence, during the US Capitol attack by saying maybe the mob was right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/23/capitol-attack-panel-public-hearings-trump\">Capitol attack panel to hold six public hearings as it aims to show how Trump broke law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/us/politics/trump-pence-jan-6.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">reported</a> the bombshell White House comment on Tuesday.</p> <p>Two witnesses, the paper said, have confirmed to the House committee investigating the events of 6 January 2021 that Mark Meadows, then Trump’s chief of staff, described Trump “saying something to the effect of, maybe Mr Pence should be hung”.</p> <p>The Times said it was not clear if Trump was serious.</p> <p>Pence was at the Capitol to preside over certification of Joe Biden’s victory, the process the mob tried to stop after being told to “fight like hell” by Trump.</p> <p>A makeshift gallows was set up outside.

Here’s Marks &amp; Spencer’s previous chief executive Marc Bolland giving himself a pat on the back when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/07/ms-boss-marc-bolland-to-step-down\">he checked out in 2016</a>: “I have done the heavy lifting that was needed. I am very pleased with what I have done over the last years and think I have built the foundations.”</p> <p>The declaration of a weightlifting triumph wasn’t convincing at the time, and Bolland’s efforts were soon exposed as a light limbering-up exercise at best. Familiar problems – in fashion, logistics and overseas – re-emerged because they never went away. By 2018, Steve Rowe, the successor now departing himself, launched a “facing the facts” strategy that was plainly overdue.</p> <p>In that context, Rowe’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/m-and-s-to-shut-32-more-stores-as-it-shifts-away-from-town-centres\">farewell assessment</a> on Wednesday was infinitely better because it was nuanced. Yes, he also said M&amp;S had “fundamentally changed” on his watch, which is true thanks to store closures, a retreat from France, the online food partnership with Ocado and the axing of tired in-house fashion brands. But Rowe also spelled out the items left undone.</p> <p>His list wasn’t short. Core technology in the clothing and home department needs an upgrade. Both sides of the business need to invest in their supply chains – the food operation was described as “less efficient” than rivals’. Some of the stores are still “out of date and poorly located”. The reduction in floor space dedicated to clothes hasn’t kept pace with shift in demand towards online. Top marks for honesty.</p> <p>Rowe has been unlucky on his last lap because the looming cost of living squeeze has almost halved the M&amp;S share price since January. The two profit upgrades last autumn have almost been forgotten. </p> <p>But M&amp;S is clearly in better shape than in the recent past, not least because cash is flowing again, even if shareholders’ dividends aren’t yet. The point is that credibility is enhanced if you don’t airbrush the blemishes. Others should try the approach.</p> <h2>Fuller account needed after inelegant JD Sport exit</h2> <p>And here’s how not to communicate with shareholders, courtesy of JD Sports: put out a statement 11 minutes before the stock market shuts for the day that says the executive chair, a man in post since 2004, is out “with immediate effect” as a result of an “ongoing review of internal governance and controls”.</p> <p>JD’s share price plunged 10% in the remaining minutes of trading, hardly surprising since the statement raised more questions than it answered. Peter Cowgill had been the architect of JD’s ascent to the FTSE 100 index, a period in which the company has eclipsed Sports Direct and gone global. Now he was being exited inelegantly.</p> <p>One part of the backdrop is the company’s £4.3m fine in February from the Competition and Markets Authority for sharing commercially sensitive information with Footasylum, a business it had bought but was supposed to be running separately in the pre-clearance period. Another part, though, seems to be JD’s slowness in executing a plan, announced last summer, to split Cowgill’s roles.</p> <p>If the man himself was blocking reform, then, yes, an instant departure is one way to solve the problem. And since Stephen Rubin’s Pentland Group owns 52% of shares, it can get its way. </p> <p>Minority shareholders, however, may fairly expect a fuller account of the showdown. For example: what will the well-remunerated Cowgill collect on the way out?</p> <h2>Windfall tax aside, SSE still seems to be in a safe spot</h2> <p>Business secretaries don’t normally inject themselves into companies’ full-year results announcements, so it was odd to see Kwasi Kwarteng pop up at SSE to hail the company’s £24bn UK investment programme for the next decade as “a huge vote of confidence in our energy security plans”.<br><br>What was Kwarteng signalling?

But for the most part it seems like his sway in 2022 may have peaked","body":"<p>On Tuesday, Georgia’s Republicans delivered a beat-down to Donald Trump. Across the board, they rejected his picks for state office. Governor Brian Kemp and attorney general Chris Carr, both incumbents, each grabbed more than 73% of the primary vote. Meanwhile, Brad Raffensperger, Trump’s bete noire and Georgia’s secretary of state, escaped a runoff as he cleared the crucial 50% mark.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the 2020 election, the trio collectively refused to “find” 11,780 votes for Trump. Instead, they defended the verdict of Georgia’s voters, accepted Joe Biden’s win and earned Trump’s wrath. Now, less than two years later, they reminded Trump that he was merely an influential bystander to comings and goings in the Peach state.</p> <p>Their collective humiliation of the 45th president was now complete. Adding insult to injury, a Georgia grand jury continues to weigh whether to indict Trump for his ham-handed alleged effort to influence the election. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1529194725282041862\">betting pools</a> place the chances of Florida’s Ron DeSantis winning the 2024 Republican presidential nominee on par with the former guy.</p> <p>For the record, Tuesday was not a total wipeout for Trump. He could point to wins among a motley crew he could call his very own.</p> <p>Herschel Walker captured the Republican nod for Georgia’s senator. A legendary University of Georgia football star, Walker also possesses a record of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8\">alleged domestic violence and abuse</a>.</p> <p>His friendship with Trump spans decades.

On the campaign trail, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2022/05/24/video-georgia-frontrunner-herschel-walker-claims-never-said-was-stolen_partner/\">Walker claimed</a> he had never heard Trump denounce the 2020 election as stolen.</p> <p>Likewise, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the hyper-performative high-priestess of Maga-hood, sailed to renomination in north-west Georgia. Whatever consternation she may cause nationally, it was not discernible in her home district. She notched nearly 70% of the vote.</p> <p>Over in Texas, Ken Paxton defeated George P Bush in a runoff for attorney general. Paxton, the incumbent attorney general, cruised to a runoff victory over the grandson of one president and the nephew of a second.</p> <p>Of all Republican state attorney generals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/09/republicans-trump-election-democracy\">Paxton was the most slavishly loyal</a> to Trump. In December 2020, Paxton <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-sues-battleground-states-unconstitutional-changes-2020-election-laws\">filed a lawsuit</a> in the US supreme court against Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He accused the four electoral battlegrounds of having “destroyed” the public’s trust and “compromised the security and integrity of the 2020 election”.</p> <p>Some things never change. After Tuesday’s Texas school massacre, Paxton <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1529209566436655104\">suggested arming teachers</a> as a solution. Gun control was not an option. Trump, Texas governor Greg Abbott, and Senator Ted Cruz are set to speak at a National Rifle Association meeting scheduled for later this week in Houston.</p> <p>But the evening’s dominant messages to Trump in contests for state office were clear. Competence and performance still counted, and incumbent officeholders possess a political arsenal of their very own.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Jay Walker, a Kemp adviser, repeatedly told deep-pocketed donors that the governor stood ready to gut his challenger, David Perdue, Trump’s pick and a defeated former US senator.</p> <p>“We’re going to go fucking scorched-earth,” Walker <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/24/georgia-kemp-primary-2022-00034935\">supposedly said</a>. “When you got your foot on someone’s neck, you don’t take it off until the race is over, or they’ve run out of oxygen.”</p> <p>Unlike congressmen and senators, voters expect governors to get things done; Kemp did just that. The Associated Press <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/1529258931771645956\">called his race</a> just 90 minutes after the polls closed.</p> <p>Then again, Perdue offered Republicans little reason to vote for him. He had lost his 2021 insurrection eve runoff to Jon Ossoff, a candidate once graphically derided by the late and toxic Rush Limbaugh.</p> <p>Practically speaking, Perdue should have just stamped a giant “L” on his own forehead. He was damaged goods from the start.</p> <p>On the campaign trail, Perdue repeated the big lie that the 2020 elections were stolen. But as a member of one of Georgia’s pre-eminent political families, his shtick reeked of pandering.</p> <p>His heart wasn’t in it. Beyond that, he had marinated his closing message in unalloyed racial resentment, with <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/perdue-tells-abrams-back-republicans-deflect/story?id=84940530\">remarks</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/us/politics/david-perdue-stacey-abrams-racist-remarks.html\">widely interpreted</a> as lashing out at Stacey Abrams, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, for simply being Black.</p> <p>Significantly, Trump’s defeats in Georgia follow his recent losses in the Idaho and Nebraska gubernatorial Republican primaries. In other words, Kemp’s win fits an emerging pattern.</p> <p>In Idaho, Janice McGeachin, the state’s Trump-endorsed lieutenant governor <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/15/us/idaho-republican-primary-little-mcgeachin.html\">and a favorite of the far right</a>, failed to dislodge the already very conservative governor, Brad Little. Unlike Little, McGeachin delivered a video address to the America First Political Action Conference, an event organized by Nick Fuentes, a prominent white nationalist.</p> <p>Over in Nebraska, Charles Herbster, the Trump-endorsed candidate, went down in defeat after several women accused him of sexual misconduct. Apparently, Trump’s own “luck” on that score was personal, and not readily transferable to Herbster. Instead, Nebraska Republicans went with Jim Pillen, a University of Nebraska regent, who was endorsed by the state’s Republican establishment.</p> <p>To be sure, the spirit of Maga remains very much alive. Marjorie Taylor Greene will return to Congress. Herschel Walker is holding his own <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/\">in hypothetical match-ups</a> against Senator Raphael Warnock. Even Kemp is no never-Trump. Yet Trump’s endorsement can no longer be reflexively equated with a primary victory.</p> <p>Ask Mehmet Oz; he can tell you. Right now, Pennsylvania continues its count of primary ballots. A recount looms. Whether Dr Oz, a Trump endorsee, holds on remains to be seen. Regardless, Trump’s sway in 2022 may have peaked.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York.

Mr Johnson, a practised liar, cannot even fake contrition. The Gray report describes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-report-full-breakdown-findings-no-10-parties\" title=\"\">systemic breaches</a> of Covid regulations in Downing Street, committed knowingly and with contempt for the idea of professional government.</p> <p>There was excessive drinking, beginning early in the day and ending late at night. There was vomiting and fighting. Staff were warned to beware of cameras, to leave by back doors, for fear of their behaviour being revealed. A senior official spoke of “getting away with” one event. Cleaning and security staff were treated with disrespect. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/04/former-uk-government-ethics-chief-issues-apology-after-lockdown-party-fine\" title=\"\">The karaoke machine</a> was supplied by the prime minister’s adviser on ethics.</p> <p>All of it would be unacceptable in any serious workplace. In the seat of government, it is an affront to democracy. But that is not the limit of the offence. The rules being flouted were devised to save lives in a national emergency. Their observance by the general public kept <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/20/boris-johnson-partygate-covid-family-rules\" title=\"\">bereaved families</a> from gathering at funerals and prevented relatives visiting the bedsides of dying loved ones. It is hard to conceive of a more egregious insult to those who suffered through the pandemic than the discovery that their sacrifice was being mocked in the prime minister’s official residence. Only his inability to show genuine remorse matches it for cruelty.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Mr Johnson <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-25-may-2022\" title=\"\">told MPs</a> he took responsibility, but failed to explain how. The assertion was no more convincing than his affectation of humility. Most of his Commons performance was taken up with bogus excuses, cavilling, deflection and dissembling. He could not conceal the self-pity, considering himself to be a victim of excessive, prurient interrogation. He looked more bored than sorry.</p> <p>Even when the object of the exercise was to address public anger, the prime minister could not conceal his impatience at being made to answer for anything to anyone. That combination of arrogance and entitlement is the origin of the whole scandal. Mr Johnson’s defence relies on the assertion that he was unaware of rule-breaking, which is improbable given his proximity to events, and absurd given that his indisciplined and dissolute character gave his staff the permission to do as they pleased.</p> <p>Mr Johnson is wrong if he thinks people are ready to “move on” from questions about parties. He cannot grasp the gravity of his offence, because doing so requires empathy with those who feel their hard work and personal sacrifices during the pandemic have been belittled.</p> <p>There is a line of transmission from the leader’s narcissistic indifference to the interests of anyone but himself to the pattern of chaotic government, unequal to the serious challenges it faces.</p> <p>Conservative MPs who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/tory-mps-boris-johnson-lies-partygate\" title=\"\">continue to support their leader</a>, supposing that the present turbulence is a squall that can be navigated to reach a more competent phase of government, are delusional. They are also degrading themselves and their party through complicity with a prime minister whose toxic unfitness for office is a corrosive substance, eating away at the foundations of British democracy.</p> <p>The Gray report cannot bring an end to the matter because it describes symptoms of an ongoing syndrome – a moral debilitation in politics that spreads outwards from the prime minister. Tory MPs have it in their power to stop the contagion by removing their leader, but they do not. It is a failure of courage and conscience for which they must one day pay a heavy electoral price.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/25/boris-johnson-prime-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T17:48:21Z","webTitle":"Welcome to another episode of the Boris Johnson show: the most tedious box set in history | Aditya Chakrabortty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/boris-johnson-prime-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/boris-johnson-prime-minister","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to another episode of the Boris Johnson show: the most tedious box set in history","trailText":"It’s cliffhanger after cliffhanger with our soap-opera prime minister. And he always gets away with it, says the Guardian columnist Aditya Chakrabortty<br>","body":"<p>If you haven’t ploughed through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/gray-report-paints-damning-portrait-boris-johnson\">Sue Gray report</a> yet, it is easily summarised: numerous parties were held in Downing Street, breaking the Covid rules that bound the rest of us. They were organised, approved and attended by some of the most senior politicians and civil servants who run this country. Some were even commemorated by an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/05/partygate-ministers-refuse-to-disclose-pictures-taken-by-no-10-photographers\">official photographer</a> at the taxpayer’s expense. While elderly and ill people could not see their relatives and mothers underwent the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/10/i-started-shouting-at-the-midwives-the-stress-of-giving-birth-under-lockdown\">rigours of childbirth</a> alone, at the heart of government staffers drank till they threw up, enjoyed punch-ups and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-report-full-breakdown-findings-no-10-parties\">mistreated the security guards and cleaners</a> they saw as beneath them. They laughed at the rest of us and congratulated themselves for having “got away with” it. The squalor of the set-up is inseparable from its outrageous arrogance.</p> <p>What comes next? Judging by past form, not much. Some unlucky minister will be served up for a sacrificial roasting on the BBC. Others will fulminate to friendly journalists, knowing their juiciest quotes will be printed without the incriminating detail of their name. Some liberal columnists will bang their tiny fists and demand the prime minister’s resignation, as they have done each week of this affair, always with the same lack of success.<br><br>All will be turned into The Boris Show, just as everything in Westminster has been since he moved into No 10. Between them, the prime minister’s ego and the political classes clapping like eager seals have combined to turn the affairs of the UK into the longest-running and most grimly predictable box set of all time. Each episode starts with a scandal and ends on the same dreary cliffhanger: how does our antihero get out of this one?</p> <p>Even if SW1 can’t tear itself away, the rest of us should – and observe how the system that has enthroned and enabled Johnson has in the process almost destroyed itself. I am not referring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/12/scottish-tory-leader-calls-for-boris-johnson-to-resign\">Dougie Ross</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/05/partygate-johnsons-removal-is-now-inevitable-warns-loyalist\">Charlie Walker</a> and the other insipid Tory careerists trying to unseat him. I mean the institutions and the ideology that swept him into No 10, and keep him there today. And at what price! Through his full-bellied carelessness, Johnson has clumsily yanked down the entire stage set of the puppet show that passes for British democracy. Our political culture and economic rationales lie before us, drained of credibility and emptied of purpose ­– except to hold in place the hollow man who hasn’t the faintest clue how to govern, save to mouth trite slogans about getting Brexit done and levelling up and building back better.</p> <p>Let us start with the senior <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-failure-to-investigate-alleged-abba-party-in-pm-flat-irks-mps\">civil service</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/25/met-police-facing-legal-action-over-handling-of-partygate\">Metropolitan police</a>, neither of which have held the prime minister fully to account. What about the party held in the flat above No 10, the one where aides blasted Abba and “drank their socks off” to celebrate the departure of Dominic Cummings? That, it is said, is where some of the most egregious rule-breaking happened, with Johnson joining the revelry.</p> <p>Consider, too, the Conservative party, which put at its head a man whose integrity and conduct had triggered so many warnings. From his <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/19858214.boris-johnson-school-letter-eton-teacher-despairs-pms-effortless-superiority/\">teachers at Eton</a> to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/boris-johnson-prime-minister-tory-party-britain\">employers</a> at the Times and the Telegraph, to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/26/boris-johnson-given-cold-shoulder-by-fed-up-cabinet-colleagues\">colleagues in government</a>, nearly every reference for the guy has been a dud. Now, the party’s door-knockers can’t put him on their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/04/election-leaflets-distance-local-conservatives-from-boris-johnson\">election leaflets</a>, his cabinet colleagues can’t bear to defend him – and yet nobody can come up with how to get shot of him, for who else could be sent out to bat for the final few overs of the Tory innings? What a fate for Britain’s supposed party of government.</p> <p>Finally, consider the media. Not just the Daily Mail, enjoyable though it has been to read its furious avowals that the parties held by its man were innocent work affairs, while the takeaway curries eaten by Keir Starmer and his team rivalled Weimar Berlin for debauchery. We must look to the BBC, which for many years treated a professional hard-right politician as little more than a genial host for Friday night gameshows. Also, to the Times, which, in its <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-times-view-on-the-pms-response-to-the-sue-gray-report-moment-of-truth-w65qsfkjm\">leader column</a> on Wednesday, fretted over the haemorrhaging of “public confidence in the integrity of Britain’s political system”. If only the newspaper of record had warned us of such a prospect beforehand! But on the eve of the 2019 election, it <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-times-s-endorsement-for-the-general-election-back-to-the-future-bmtz9gv97\">urged readers</a> to vote for “a big Tory majority” to allow Johnson to maintain “close links with European partners” and helm a “pragmatic, responsible government”. This was the same election during which Johnson and Cummings ran a deliberate campaign of what Prof Ivor Gaber of Sussex University has <a href=\"http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/33165/13/UKElectionAnalysis2019_Jackson-Thorsen-Lilleker-and-Weidhase_v1.pdf\">dubbed</a> “strategic lying”, intended to confuse voters, magnetise journalists and undermine public faith in the political process.</p> <p>The pair ran the same strategy in the Brexit referendum. But they also capitalised on another powerful force: the public’s frustration with a broken economy. It is a wellspring from which Johnson has drawn many times, yet when faced with a genuine economic crisis – the rocketing in global food and fuel prices – he has reverted to Thatcherite type, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1509891580110516244\">chuntering</a> about “making work pay”, even while it is obvious that low-paid workers live in penury. And he and his government have done next to nothing to help those people who are struggling.</p> <p>Johnson’s sometime rival for leader, Rishi Sunak, had the chance to do something to help the poorest people at last October’s budget. Instead, he made the single biggest cut to benefits <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/millions-working-brits-heading-biggest-24595780\">since the second world war</a>. He had another chance to act at his <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-statement-benefits-tax-inflation-b2042410.html\">spring statement</a> in March. Instead, he slashed the real value of benefits again. “What looks good in terms of helping the bottom 10% doesn’t necessarily make good headlines,” one minister told the Times recently. It is the same culture exposed in the Gray dossier, where what those at the top worry about most, amid all the boozing, is not what’s right or wrong, but the “comms risk”.</p> <p>Yesterday, I chaired an event a mile away from Westminster where the heads of a few of the charities working at the eye of this storm revealed what they are seeing right now. At food banks run by the Trussell Trust, its chief executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/31/food-bank-supremo-emma-revie-this-is-the-best-job-in-the-world-and-it-shouldnt-have-to-exist\">Emma Revie</a> said, people now turn up asking for “kettle packs”: food that can be cooked using only an electric kettle. They take away hot-water bottles and blankets, what she called “artefacts of destitution”. Clare Moriarty, the chief executive officer of Citizens Advice, remembered how a woman waiting in one bureau last week burst into tears. What’s wrong?, asked a member of staff. Nothing, replied the lady, but this is the warmest I’ve been in months.</p> <p>This is a world far away from budgeting tips and money-saving tricks – one whose population will swell over the next few months. And, while Johnson and Sunak are ultimately responsible for this suffering, they are not solely to blame.<strong> </strong>In this pile-up of vast economic forces and purposeless leaders, an exhausted regime supervised by run-down institutions, you can see something far bigger than the fate of one prime minister. You can glimpse the end of a political era.</p> <ul> <li><p>Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/25/the-guardian-view-on-us-gun-violence-another-desperate-day","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T17:47:35Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on US gun violence: another desperate day | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/the-guardian-view-on-us-gun-violence-another-desperate-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/the-guardian-view-on-us-gun-violence-another-desperate-day","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on US gun violence: another desperate day","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> Firearm sales and deaths have soared in the last two years.

Firearms are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/22/us-gun-violence-leading-cause-of-death-youth\" title=\"\">leading cause of death for America’s children</a>, claiming the lives of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/us/american-children-gun-deaths.html\" title=\"\">more than 1,500 under-18s</a> last year. Mass shootings account for at most 3% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/25/us-gun-violence-reporters-shootings\" title=\"\">gun violence</a> deaths; many occur in ones or twos, and largely in disadvantaged neighbourhoods of colour. Unlike Tuesday’s tragedy, these victims go mostly unremarked, even when they are school age. Yet they, too, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/28/we-buried-our-sons-the-emotional-and-physical-toll-of-americas-gun-violence\" title=\"\">irreplaceable to those who loved them</a>.</p> <p>Attempts to curb mass shootings, for example through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapons_legislation_in_the_United_States\" title=\"\">banning assault weapons</a>, are therefore both necessary and wholly inadequate.

The passionate efforts of bereaved parents, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/13/sandy-hook-review-an-american-tragedy-elizabeth-williamson-facebook-youtube-alex-jones\" title=\"\">vilified and attacked</a> as they grieved, have led to a gunmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/15/sandy-hook-families-settlement-gun-manufacturer-remington\" title=\"\">being found liable</a> for a mass shooting in the US for the first time. But the most wide-reaching change resulting from school shootings has been that millions of children now go through drills – traumatising those who will, thankfully, never encounter a shooter.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/texas-school-shooting-joe-biden-calls-for-tougher-gun-controls\" title=\"\">asked</a> – as so many have – why the US is “willing to live with this carnage”. Support for tighter gun controls has dropped in recent years, though <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/23/politics/gun-control-gallup-poll/index.html\" title=\"\">most still want them</a>, and backing usually rises after mass shootings. Texan Republican leaders have <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/outrage-texas-gun-laws-follows-deadly-elementary-school-shooting-rcna30410\" title=\"\">prided themselves</a> on expanding gun rights.

The Republican grip on the country’s institutions, skewing the executive, the legislature and the judiciary rightward, is another problem. A conservative, pro-gun supreme court <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/19/supreme-court-gun-case/\" title=\"\">will rule shortly</a> on a New York law restricting who can carry guns in public, potentially imperilling restrictions elsewhere.</p> <p>Local gun violence prevention programmes work: the Biden administration is right to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/15/historic-funding-gun-violence-prevention-smaller-groups\" title=\"\">dramatically increased funding</a>, but more must be done. It is also essential that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/us/mass-shootings-misogyny-dayton.html\" title=\"\">misogyny</a> is addressed: most mass shooters have a history of expressing hatred of women and attacking female family members, and most women shot by their partners have previously been abused by them.</p> <p>It is hard to feel any optimism when persistent campaigning by survivors and bereaved families has failed to shift the nation. The question is not merely what might save children like those at Uvalde, but whether anything will be done to save Americans more broadly if even these deaths do not force the US to address gun violence seriously.

Sadly, it did not change anything.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-victims\">‘He was just a loving little boy’: the victims of the Texas school shooting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, the paper said, “another gunman has bought, apparently legally, two semi-automatic rifles and used them to murder 19 children and two adults shortly after his 18th birthday – three years before he was allowed to drink beer”.</p> <p>It is not just “a coalition of gun enthusiasts, gun sellers and fearful citizens, welded together by the NRA, that stands in the way of regulation”, the paper said.</p> <p>“The real stroke of genius was to reinterpret the second amendment right as the only true badge of constitutional loyalty and a requirement for preserving the American way of life. In America, in 2022, the fact that 19 pupils were murdered by a heavily armed 18-year-old two days before the summer holidays will not change anything.”</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/texas-grundschule-amoklauf-1.5591652?reduced=true\">Suddeutsche Zeitung said</a> it “probably takes numbers to grasp, if only faintly, what nobody will ever be able to actually understand”: this was Americas 215th firearms incident this year in which at least four people were killed or injured. Last year, there were 693. Since 2013, 2,858 children had been killed or injured.</p> <p>Spain’s El País had <a href=\"https://elpais.com/internacional/2022-05-25/el-control-de-armas-un-debate-recurrente-y-frustrante-despues-de-cada-tiroteo-en-ee-uu.html\">an equally weary analysis</a>. “Mass shootings are such an essential part of US life they have their own rules,” wrote its correspondent, Iker Seisdedos. And each one prompts “an artificial reopening of the debate on gun control”.</p> <p>The US has 4% of the world’s population, but almost half the pistols and rifles registered on the planet, he said: “It’s a recurring drama, to which America’s lawmakers seem unwilling to put an end – even though they could.”</p> <p>The most personal response was from <a href=\"https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/udland/analyse-kun-i-usa-gaar-7-aarige-i-skole-og-skal-vaere-bange-blive-skudt\">Steffen Kretz, a US correspondent for Danish public radio DR</a>. Hours after the latest tragedy, he said, he got a letter from the school his seven-year-old daughter attends promising special help for pupils on Wednesday.</p> <p>“Only in the US,” write Kretz, “does a seven-year-old attend school to learn about school shootings. Only in the US do children who only just learned to ride a bike have to practise hiding under school desks in case a bad man with a gun comes.”</p> <p>Every time “a maniac enters a school and spreads death and destruction in a place that should be safe and secure”, he wrote, “the same debate begins. And so far it has led only led to the same result: nothing fundamentally changes.”</p> <p>The sheer number of weapons in the US, and the power of the NRA, mean this will “probably continue. America’s love-hate relationship with firearms has become an example of how money and lobby groups have corrupted the political system.”</p> <p>So when Kretz’s daughter meets her friends on Wednesday, they will have to process the fact that the 19 Texas victims were “children their age, whose only fault was to be at school that day. There will be a debate, with arguments everyone knows. Next week, the focus will be elsewhere. Until it happens again.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sam Jones in Madrid</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/25/why-cant-america-stop-mass-shootings-gun-control","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T17:36:36Z","webTitle":"Why can’t America do anything to stop mass shootings?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/why-cant-america-stop-mass-shootings-gun-control","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/25/why-cant-america-stop-mass-shootings-gun-control","fields":{"headline":"Why can’t America do anything to stop mass shootings?","trailText":"Despite hundreds of mass shootings unfolding in the US every year, Congress has repeatedly failed to pass major gun-control legislation","body":"<p>Joe Biden’s condolences to the community of Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children and two adults were killed in a shooting at Robb elementary school on Tuesday, also came with a demand for action.</p> <p>“Why are we willing to live with this carnage?

The hurdles to enacting stricter gun laws in the US are numerous and significant, but activists say they will not give up until change is made.</p> <h2><strong>How often are mass shootings happening in the US?</strong></h2> <p>This year, 213 mass shootings, defined as incidents in which at least four people were shot or killed, have already occurred in America, according to <a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/\">the Gun Violence Archive</a>. In 2021, 692 mass shootings were recorded, in comparison to 610 over the course of 2020.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2022-05-25-04:28:10/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2022-05-25-04:28:10/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The US has already seen other devastating examples of mass shootings this month. Less than two weeks before the shooting in Uvalde, a gunman opened fire at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York. He fatally shot 10 people, most of them African American.</p> <h2><strong>What policies have been proposed to address mass shootings?</strong></h2> <p>Gun control advocates have outlined an extensive and specific plan to lower the number of deaths caused by firearms in the US. Those policies include mandating background checks for all gun purchases, including those overseen by unlicensed sellers online or at gun shows, and enforcing a waiting period after someone buys a firearm.</p> <p>Advocates have also called for expanding the restrictions on people who can legally acquire guns. They say abusive dating partners, those convicted of hate crimes and people with mental illness who pose a safety risk, among others, should be barred from buying firearms. Some have proposed prohibiting gun purchases by people under 21, which may have prevented the 18-year-old shooter in Uvalde from acquiring his weapons.</p> <p>Some states have already enacted stricter gun laws, but federal legislation would strengthen restrictions nationwide.</p> <h2><strong>Do Americans support stricter gun laws?</strong></h2> <p>There is broad support in the US for certain policies championed by gun-control advocates. According to <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2021/03/10/house-gun-legislation-background-checks-polling/\">a Morning Consult/Politico survey</a> taken last year, 84% of American voters support universal background checks for gun purchases.</p> <p>But opinions are more varied when Americans are asked about their thoughts on stricter gun laws in general. A <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/357317/stricter-gun-laws-less-popular.aspx\">November poll</a> conducted by Gallup found that 52% of Americans support stricter gun control, which marked the lowest rating on the question since 2014. Support for a ban on handguns also hit a new low in 2021, with just 19% of Americans telling Gallup that they would be in favor of such a policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/gun_law_attitudes/giv-6562amYuxdF2aYyk/\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/gun_law_attitudes/giv-6562amYuxdF2aYyk/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Some of that hesitation may stem from the fact that tens of millions of Americans own guns themselves. Four in 10 Americans live in a household with a gun, while 30% say they personally own one, according to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/\">a 2021 survey</a> by Pew Research Center.</p> <h2><strong>Has Congress tried to enact stricter gun laws before?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, Democrats in Congress have repeatedly pushed to strengthen gun laws that could help lower the number of mass shootings in America. Most notably, Congress tried to pass a compromise bill to expand background checks in 2013, months after the devastating shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. That bill failed to overcome a Senate filibuster, as most Republicans and a handful of Democrats opposed the legislation.</p> <p>After the bill was defeated, then President Barack Obama delivered a fiery speech blaming the failure on the National Rifle Association, which vehemently opposed the legislation and vowed to campaign against any senator supporting it.</p> <p>“Instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill,” Obama said at the time. “But we can do more if Congress gets its act together.”</p> <h2><strong>What is the path forward for enacting gun-control legislation?</strong></h2> <p>The Democratic-controlled House has already passed bills to expand background checks to all firearm sales or transfers and close the so-called “Charleston loophole”. That loophole, which would increase the amount of time that licensed gun sellers must wait to receive a completed background check before transferring a gun to an unlicensed buyer, allowed a white shooter to target a historically Black church in Charleston in 2015.</p> <p>But those House-passed bills currently have very little chance of passing in the evenly divided Senate. Republican senators are likely to filibuster any proposed gun-control legislation, and Democrats do not have the 60 votes necessary to advance those bills. The Democratic senator Joe Manchin also <a href=\"https://thehill.com/news/senate/3500416-manchin-calls-for-common-sense-gun-limits-resists-filibuster-reform/\">made it clear on Tuesday</a> that he would not support amending the filibuster to pass a gun-control bill, meaning Democrats do not have the votes to create a carveout to the rule.</p> <p>Acknowledging this reality, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said on Wednesday that it was unlikely the upper chamber would soon vote on the House-passed bills. “I believe that accountability votes are important,” Schumer said, “But sadly, this isn’t a case of the American people not knowing where their senators stand. They know.”</p> <p>That doesn’t mean Democrats are giving up on their efforts to strengthen gun laws. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who represents the Sandy Hook community and has fiercely criticized congressional inaction on gun control, said voters have a chance in November to oust Republicans who oppose reform.</p> <p>“I’m going to try all day today to try to find some compromise, but this is ultimately up to voters,” Murphy told CNN on Wednesday. “If [candidates] support the current law, if they don’t support reform [instead], then don’t send them back to Congress.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/may/26/isabella-nichols-i-was-bawling-my-eyes-out-i-was-going-to-quit-surfing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T17:30:44Z","webTitle":"Isabella Nichols: ‘I was bawling my eyes out, I was going to quit surfing’ | Kate Allman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/26/isabella-nichols-i-was-bawling-my-eyes-out-i-was-going-to-quit-surfing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/may/26/isabella-nichols-i-was-bawling-my-eyes-out-i-was-going-to-quit-surfing","fields":{"headline":"Isabella Nichols: ‘I was bawling my eyes out, I was going to quit surfing’","trailText":"Australia’s latest surf star on her Viking heritage, bouncing back from disappointment and why her role models are not ‘supermodel skinny’","body":"<p>Isabella Nichols wears a tiny bit of her heart on her sleeve. Sketched in tattoo ink on her right forearm is the outline of a mini Viking ship. It’s a salute to her <em>mormor</em> – her Danish grandmother – her birthplace of Denmark and Viking heritage. But it is also a reminder of the warrior spirit that keeps her afloat as she seeks to establish herself among the world’s elite surfers.</p> <p>“My grandma was part of a Viking club,” Nichols says. “Every morning – rain, hail or shine – all the women of the club would go down to the beach, strip naked and go for skinny dips in the ocean. Even if the ocean was frozen over, they’d use ice chisels to poke holes in the ice. She did this up until she was about 85.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/brutal-mid-season-cut-has-increased-interest-in-competition-says-world-surf-league\">Brutal mid-season cut has increased interest in competition, says World Surf League</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The same stoic Viking blood appears to run in Nichols’ veins. She made that clear to the world in 2021 when, as a rookie in her first year on the World Surf League’s Championship Tour, she coolly defeated seven-time world champion Stephanie Gilmore by exploiting tactical wave priority rules at the Newcastle Cup.</p> <p>Nichols had priority in the semi-final’s closing minutes, and Gilmore needed a wave to win. Footage of the stony-faced rookie sitting in the water just inches from a veteran of the sport, ready to pounce on any wave that might offer Gilmore an opportunity, showcased a ruthless edge.</p> <p>“It’s a professional sport, if you can get the edge over someone by all means do it. Someone’s going to do it to you if you don’t do it to them,” Nichols says.</p> <p>The 24-year-old Australian from Coolum on the Sunshine Coast has otherwise remained something of a mystery character; a Billabong rider not seen “in” with social media cliques formed in other teams like Rip Curl and Roxy . It’s partly why, when Nichols was catapulted into the mainstream by winning the Margaret River Pro in May, the world was stunned by the raw, uncut emotion unleashed. It was her first win at a Championship Tour event, and the sacrifice that had gone into achieving a childhood dream spilled out in tears onto the West Australian beach.</p> <p>“How did I feel? It’s hard to put into words. In surfing, you lose way more than you win,” she says. “After everything I’d been through, to win is the most surreal feeling.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"688580782129830a4b3fceef7c55bd2062f4f76e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/688580782129830a4b3fceef7c55bd2062f4f76e/0_0_7726_5153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nichols celebrates after winning the final of the Margaret River Pro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nichols celebrates after winning the final of the Margaret River Pro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunbar/World Surf League</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just a week prior, Nichols had been eliminated in the second round of heats at Bells Beach.

I felt this complete devastation. I was in the portable shower bawling my eyes out, crying that I was going to quit surfing,” she says.</p> <p>But even Viking blood is human. Nichols and her twin sister Helena know this more than most – as children they were hospitalised when doctors discovered they live with a rare blood disorder called spherocytosis. It classifies them as immunocompromised – a scary label to carry when you qualify for the WSL Championship Tour during a global pandemic.</p> <p>“I didn’t want to be the first one to get Covid, to get it and be the test case,” Nichols says, adding that she caught Covid-19 early in 2022 and had a relatively mild case.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s definitely a hard area to grow up in. Being a female athlete, and having your body scrutinised</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nichols’ expat Australian parents moved the family from Denmark to wave-saturated Coolum when she was two. When she was nine, her dad convinced Nichols to give surfing a go by promising bacon and egg McMuffins as a reward for keeping him company in the water.</p> <p>The hungry grommet quickly became a star – winning the Australasia junior title in 2015, then claiming the World Junior Championships without dropping a heat in 2016. When she was 18, she graduated to the WSL qualifying series, a gruelling schedule of events pitting the world’s top surfers against each other to earn a place on the Championship Tour. Most athletes are only partially sponsored – if at all – and pay their own way.</p> <p>“Mum would take out five interest-free credit cards and pay them off over about four years,” says Nichols. “It’s rough, there are a lot of people living penny to penny. You rely on your results and prize money to pay for the next trip.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"36ca948229f29e99a5e7c89bb7183587eddb6e47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36ca948229f29e99a5e7c89bb7183587eddb6e47/0_0_4549_3033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nichols in action at the Margaret River Pro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nichols in action at the Margaret River Pro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunbar/World Surf League/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In case surfing didn’t pan out, Nichols managed to juggle travelling and competing with studying a mechanical engineering degree at Deakin University.

Being a female athlete, and having your body scrutinised,” she says. “Fortunately, I had amazing role models. I watched Carissa [Moore], Johanne [Defay], Tyler [Wright] – they’re not supermodel skinny; they’re fit, athletic humans.</p> <p>“I was a little skinny 57-kilo grommet, and I realised I was too skinny to perform at that athletic level – I went out and intentionally put on weight, which is backwards to what most girls are doing. I wanted quads like Carissa.”</p> <p>Nichols heads into the next event of the tour – the Roxy Pro at G-land in Indonesia – ranked fourth in the world. Whether or not she has achieved her goal of thick quadricep muscles, the aggressive, driving turns she carved into wave walls at the Margaret River certainly sent surfing’s old guard a message.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/26/meta-asks-to-be-spared-tighter-rules-in-australia-saying-iphones-tracking-blocker-is-hurting-business","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T17:30:43Z","webTitle":"Meta asks to be spared tighter rules in Australia, saying iPhone’s tracking blocker is hurting business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/meta-asks-to-be-spared-tighter-rules-in-australia-saying-iphones-tracking-blocker-is-hurting-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/meta-asks-to-be-spared-tighter-rules-in-australia-saying-iphones-tracking-blocker-is-hurting-business","fields":{"headline":"Meta asks to be spared tighter rules in Australia, saying iPhone’s tracking blocker is hurting business","trailText":"Company tells consumer watchdog it is set to lose $10bn this year in wake of Apple iOS feature hampering ability to collect user data","body":"<p>Meta says Apple’s decision to allow users to stop apps tracking them on their phones has diminished Facebook’s advertising market power, and therefore the social media giant should not face further regulation in Australia.</p> <p>In mid-2021 Apple rolled out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/27/apple-ios-145-update-includes-app-tracking-transparency-feature\">a new feature in iOS 14.5</a> called “app tracking transparency” which asks for users’ consent before an app can track their activity across websites and apps, and allows users to opt out of the tracking at any time.</p> <p>This tracking had been used to collect data on what users were shopping for online or looking up in search engines, in order to target them for advertising specific to them.</p> <p>The change has had a significant impact on the revenue of a number of companies that were reliant on this data – most notably Facebook’s parent company, Meta.</p> <p>It is estimated that Meta, YouTube, Snap and Twitter lost nearly $10bn in the second half of last year, and will lose $16bn in 2022.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/26/reining-in-the-digital-giants-rod-sims-on-the-trials-and-triumphs-of-a-decade-as-head-of-the-consumer-watchdog\">Reining in the digital giants: Rod Sims on the trials and triumphs of a decade as head of the consumer watchdog </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meta alone expected to lose $10bn in 2022, the company said in a submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s digital platforms services inquiry.</p> <p>The ACCC said in a discussion paper released in February that Meta had significant market power in online advertising through “unrivalled access to consumers on social media”.</p> <p>However, Meta has argued it should not be subject to more competition regulation because the ACCC’s view of its market power is inaccurate and outdated, in part in light of the changes made by Apple.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Meta.pdf\">a submission published this week</a>, Meta said the opt-out advertising tracker made it harder for advertisers to reach people on iOS devices.</p> <p>“Following Apple’s implementation of these changes, some advertisers cut their spending on Facebook ads targeting iPhone users by about 90% to less than $100 per day,” Meta said.</p> <p>But it argued the change had helped Apple expand its advertising business, meaning the ACCC’s claim of Meta’s market dominance was based on “misrepresentative and outdated” estimates of Meta’s share of advertising.</p> <p>“This fails to take into account the large number of ad venues that we compete with each day, and the wide and increasing range of choices available to advertisers at all levels of the marketing funnel.</p> <p>“Meta is only one option that is available to advertisers – and not even the largest.”</p> <p>Apple, in its own submission published earlier this month, said it was puzzled that the competition regulator would consider forcing the company to loosen its grip over the app store and the information it holds, and share it with developers looking to compete against Apple’s own apps.

deaths per 100,000 people.</p> \n<p>Peacock said while drug-induced deaths due to amphetamines could be caused by a range of stimulants such as methamphetamine, MDMA and dexamphetamine, the Australian drug market and previous analysis “gave confidence” most cases related to methamphetamine use.</p> \n<p>“These findings reinforce the importance of substantial investment to develop more effective treatment options and maximise treatment access and coverage for methamphetamine dependence,” she said.</p> \n<p>Opioids, including heroin, were the most common substances that caused fatalities,

deaths were most common in urban areas, the highest rate of drug-related fatalities was in the Australian Capital Territory, where 12 people per 100,000 died.</p> \n<p>“There is something that can be done to prevent unintentional overdose deaths,” Peacock said.</p> \n<p>“Given the rise in stimulant deaths … our main response is treatment and harm reduction [but] for amphetamines in particular we don’t have really strong treatment options.</p> \n<p>“Investing in, exploring and identifying options for methamphetamine is a key priority going forward.

That rise increased monthly repayments by around $411.</p> <p>Currently the average mortgage in NSW is around $785,000, and so the same increase of 1.75% would see payments go up $860 a month.</p> <p>That makes for a tricky proposition when increasing rates – small moves will have big impacts, and also increase the risk of the RBA lifting them too much.</p> <h2>Wages</h2> <p>If cost of living was the big economic issue of the campaign, wages were not far behind. This government faces a massive problem because the recent hit to real wages is such that we have gone backwards by nearly a decade.</p> <p>It means even if this government was able to oversee real wages rising at the speed they did during the mining boom, we won’t get back to pre-pandemic levels until 2027. Conversely if the speed is more like that since 2013, we won’t get back there until next decade:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Real wages will take a long time to recover\">  <iframe title=\"Real wages will take a long time to recover\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-lw3vP\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lw3vP/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.datawrapper.de/_/lw3vP/\">If the graph does not display please click here</a></p> <p>All up this makes for a very tough time ahead.</p> <p>It will require high-level economic management from both the government and the RBA, and strong communication to explain to the public what is happening.</p> <p>Throw into the mix the usual concerns such as poverty, housing and rental affordability, and the government is in for a tough time, with little opportunity to pause and take a breath.</p> <p>• Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/26/refugee-children-handed-anti-illegal-migration-playing-cards-australian-charity-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T17:30:43Z","webTitle":"Refugee children handed anti-‘illegal migration’ playing cards, Australian charity says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/refugee-children-handed-anti-illegal-migration-playing-cards-australian-charity-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/refugee-children-handed-anti-illegal-migration-playing-cards-australian-charity-says","fields":{"headline":"Refugee children handed anti-‘illegal migration’ playing cards, Australian charity says","trailText":"Cards branded with Australian government’s Zero Chance logo and QR code to border force website distributed in Indonesia","body":"<p>Playing cards adorned with the Australian government’s Zero Chance campaign against “illegal migration” were distributed to refugee children in Indonesia by people trespassing on school grounds, the charity running the school alleges.</p> <p>The playing cards were allegedly given to children during break time at the Cisarua refugee learning centre in West Java.</p> <p>The town of Cisarua has hosted several thousand refugees for years, most of whom are Afghan Hazaras who fled the Taliban and have been stranded in Indonesia since Australia implemented Operation Sovereign Borders and stopped accepting refugees resettled by the UN from Indonesia.</p> <p>Muzafar Ali, an Afghan refugee and co-founder of Cisarua Learning, said a group of people – who appeared to be local Indonesians – had arrived in a car and handed the cards to children through the door at the front entrance of the school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/election-day-press-release-about-asylum-seeker-boats-a-disgrace-richard-marles-says\">Election day press release about asylum seeker boats ‘a disgrace’, Richard Marles says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“They asked children to open the door and when they opened [it] they were taking pictures of our students and trying to encourage them to take more cards,” he said.</p> <p>“One of the managers went to stop them, so they backed off and they left the scene.”</p> <p>On the back of the playing cards was an illustration of a boat at sea, along with the Zero Chance logo and a QR code linked to the associated Australian government website. The site said “Australia’s borders are closed to illegal migration” and that the government is committed to “protecting Australia’s borders, combating people smuggling in our region, and preventing people from risking their lives at sea”.</p> <p>A manager at the learning centre said staff there were “shocked” and “disappointed” by what they described as a “low” act targeting refugee children. Cisarua Learning, an Australian registered charity that operates six separate refugee-led learning centres in the town, said the cards had also been distributed to refugee children at football grounds and in surrounding streets, and that other children had been photographed.</p> <p>Australian Border Force said “offshore deterrence messaging” was a “critical component” in its efforts to stop illegal migration.</p> <p>“This type of engagement helps ensure people smugglers who manipulate vulnerable men, women and children are defeated, and importantly, prevents loss of life at sea,” an ABF spokesperson said.</p> <p>“The continued delivery of information on bipartisan policies during caretaker period is accepted under caretaker conventions.”</p> <p>As part of the campaign, service providers conduct the engagement activities and require approvals from local authorities to hand out any material.</p> <p>The playing cards were distributed a week before the Liberal party sent out text messages en masse on election day saying that the ABF had intercepted “an illegal boat” trying to reach Australia.</p> <p>The controversial text message, which will be <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/labor-to-investigate-asylum-seeker-boat-arrival-as-frontbench-takes-shape-20220523-p5ansx.html\">investigated by the new Labor government</a>, told voters to “keep our borders secure by voting Liberal today”.</p> <p>Ali said the centre did not want to publicise the distribution of the playing cards before the election for fears it would spark a media circus.</p> <p>“We just didn’t want this to become a political issue or debate because we just want refugees away from any political issue,” they said.</p> <p>Cisarua Learning is now urging Australian authorities to investigate. “This act is a clear violation of the rights of children, particularly vulnerable refugee children, with limited legal and education access rights,” it said.</p> <p>“Refugee children are living in a protracted limbo, many for a decade now. Many of the targeted refugee children were born in Indonesia.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a

The payments were made up of dividends due to him as a shareholder, payments of premiums for insurance to one of his Vanuatu companies and, after he sold the business to new operators in late 2018, money he continued to receive as instalments on the purchase price.</p> \n<p>Pattenden has amassed significant personal wealth over the years, including a luxury yacht and properties in New Zealand and Vanuatu.</p> \n<p>The former liquidator of one of Youpla’s funds, Roland Robson, raised concerns in a late 2021 report to creditors filed with the corporate regulator that Pattenden may have misappropriated money from it.</p> \n<p>“My enquiries with the current directors of the company revealed that the former director of the company [Pattenden] may have misappropriated a large amount of the company’s funds by the way of the dividend payment to himself or related entities over a number of years,” Robson said in a report into the affairs of Youpla’s Fund No 2, which collapsed in December. The allegation is in a section of the report examining whether certain payments made by the company can be clawed back to pay creditors.</p> \n<p>Pattenden did not respond to detailed questions about the issues raised in this report, and it is not known if he disputes the allegation.</p> \n<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission declined to respond in detail to Guardian Australia’s report.</p> \n<p>“Asic is indeed investigating the performance and conduct of past and current directors of ACBF/Youpla,” a spokesperson said.</p> \n<p>“And as such, in accordance with Asic’s general policy, we would prefer not to comment further.”</p> \n<p>The Greens have called for the new government to immediately commit to underwriting all funerals – particularly those of families who are now having to crowdfund to raise money for funeral services.</p> \n<p>The Save Sorry Business coalition, which represents more than 100 community and legal organisations supporting the thousands of affected families, said a compensation scheme is urgently required so that funerals of loved ones can go ahead.</p> \n<p>“This has been happening for such a long time,” said Samantha Rudolph, the Aboriginal policy officer at the Consumer Action Law Centre, which is part of the coalition.</p> \n<p> “We’re kind of just at the point where we just need urgent compensation for people.”</p> \n<p>She said Asic should continue its investigation of Youpla’s former directors because members of the community want justice.</p> \n<p>“They’ve heard about the directors having a lot of money now, coming out tax free,” she said.</p> \n<p>“They are also very, very angry because they’re the ones who paid all this money and are now sitting in morgues, unfortunately.”</p> \n<p>The coalition is also calling on Asic to go ahead with legal action against Youpla, which is due back in court on 16 June, despite the company’s collapse.</p> \n<p>“We’re going based on what the community wants and so not only do they want compensation, but they really want justice, for what’s happening,” she said.</p> \n<p>Asic launched the federal court lawsuit in October 2020, accusing Youpla of engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct towards potential customers.</p> \n<p>The company’s marketing material was misleading and deceptive because it said the group was run by Aboriginal people, approved by the Aboriginal community, better than other funeral insurance products on sale and told plan holders they would get a lump sum payout when they would actually only get reimbursed for funeral expenses.</p> \n<p>Youpla denied the allegations and the case was moving towards a trial, but progress stalled after the group collapsed into administration on 11 March.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/26/queensland-to-roll-out-simultaneous-flu-and-covid-testing-in-line-with-nsw-hospitals","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T17:30:42Z","webTitle":"Queensland to roll out simultaneous flu and Covid testing in line with NSW hospitals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/queensland-to-roll-out-simultaneous-flu-and-covid-testing-in-line-with-nsw-hospitals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/queensland-to-roll-out-simultaneous-flu-and-covid-testing-in-line-with-nsw-hospitals","fields":{"headline":"Queensland to roll out simultaneous flu and Covid testing in line with NSW hospitals","trailText":"<strong>Exclusive: </strong>Move comes two days after state announced free flu vaccines for the next month as cases rise","body":"<p>Sick people will soon be tested for Covid and the flu simultaneously at state-run fever clinics and hospitals across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland\">Queensland</a>, as authorities scramble to get a hold on rising cases.</p> <p>Simultaneous testing for Covid, influenza and other respiratory illnesses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is also now in place in hospitals across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales\">New South Wales</a>.</p> <p>Queensland Health confirmed its plan to roll out simultaneous testing to the Guardian on Wednesday, two days after it announced flu vaccines would be free for the next month in a move <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/nsw-considers-making-flu-vaccine-free-as-ambulance-demand-reaches-unprecedented-levels\">NSW and Victoria flagged they would follow</a>.</p> <p>Private pathology providers in every state and territory are also understood to be testing for viruses other than Covid, including influenza, when taking samples.

I didn’t know who I was without my grandmother.”</p> <p>Miiesha had lost her “rock” – “the person who gave me that nurturing and love growing up” – at the end of 2019. That year also saw the first shoots of a music career that the “young Black woman from the mission” in Woorabinda, Queensland, had never dared dream possible. Her first two singles, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzIcDrF7tPA\">Black Privilege</a> and Drowning, were picked up by Triple J’s Unearthed, then her performance at Brisbane’s Bigsound festival clinched her a record deal with EMI. “For [my nan] to witness that was very important for me because I didn’t know I had it in me – but she always knew,” she says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LrXv9hOAHo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1LrXv9hOAHo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The subsequent album, Nyaaringu (meaning “what happened” in Pitjantjatjara), was a chance for Miiesha to celebrate the “strength and beauty” of her grandmother, who was a member of the stolen generations. Woven through the album are spoken-word interludes of her grandmother imparting wisdom, which Miiesha recorded when she was 19.</p> <p>Musically, Nyaaringu is the kind of slinky, glitchy R&amp;B that has seen Miiesha compared to the likes of Solange, FKA twigs and Ella Mai, her sultry, breathy vocals sitting incongruously alongside charged lyrics such as: “Survival ain’t that beautiful / I’ve just made it look this good for you,” and a 2015 soundbite of Tony Abbott <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/10/remote-communities-are-lifestyle-choices-says-tony-abbott\">dismissing remote communities as “lifestyle choices”</a>.

But behind the scenes, the wheels were coming off for Miiesha. Covid lockdowns derailed her tour plans. She left Melbourne, where she had been based, to ride out the pandemic in Rockhampton, two hours north-east of her home town, a tiny Aboriginal community with a <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2016/SSC33186#employment\">population less than 1,000</a> that had shut its doors to keep out the virus.</p> <p>Into the stasis crept insecurities about her talent, as did the reality of life without her grandmother, who had acted as a buffer for her “rollercoaster” relationship with her mother. Any hopes Miiesha had of her mother filling the maternal void soon vanished. “I was like, ‘Mum, you need to be there for me,’” she recalls. “I couldn’t understand her pain because I was clouded, because I had lost somebody so important to me that all my emotions kind of balled up inside me. I was very self-destructive … It is that intergenerational trauma, and I had to understand that it’s like a chain.”</p> <p>In times of turmoil, Miiesha had always turned to writing poetry – the starting point for her songs – but even that proved too painful. When she was finally able to process her emotions, they came rushing out in the swirl of songs on Smoke, the first part of her EP that was released in November. Its singles – the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/14/the-kid-laroi-named-artist-of-the-year-at-2021-national-indigenous-music-awards#:~:text=The%20Aria%2Dwinning%20A%E1%B9%89angu%20and,fractured%20relationship%20with%20her%20mother.\">Nima-winning Damaged</a>, the funky Queensland Music award-winning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjTi2Stjoj0\">Made for Silence</a> and the sublime <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7PJS3cVok4\">Price I Paid</a> – wrestle with love and forgiveness amid a “broken” mother-daughter relationship. “[Mum has] heard the songs, and she gets frustrated, she gets angry, she gets sad about it,” Miiesha says. “She rings me up crying about it but I believe that’s healing for her too.”</p> <p> Mirrors, by contrast, is “the calm after the storm”. “Smoke &amp; Mirrors represent two chapters of my life and the growth between those chapters,” Miiesha explains. “I don’t feel so much hate or resentment because I understand where my pain is coming from.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQEufFp_KY8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WQEufFp_KY8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Miiesha describes Mirrors’ opening track, Everything, as a “fight song” with a singular message: “Just don’t give up.”</p> <p>“I had to see for myself that I am worth something, that I do have it in me to keep going. I don’t need somebody there with me the whole time. I had to find the light myself without somebody handing me the candle.” </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn’t realise how beautiful and how old and how deep my blood runs</p> <footer> <cite> </cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Everything, she sings: “My mind floods like / I’ve been drowning this whole time / Too late to learn to swim.” Water and emotional undercurrents appear in much of Miiesha’s music, having spent much of her childhood in Woorabinda, where the parched Mimosa Creek would only run when it flooded. The community’s history as a relocated, government-controlled Aboriginal reserve, made up of <a href=\"https://www.woorabinda.qld.gov.au/about-woorabinda/visiting-woorabinda\">52 different clans</a> sent there from across Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory, meant Miiesha “felt lost growing up”, disconnected from her ancestral country and culture.</p> <p>She was first exposed to music through her mum’s love of gospel and 90s R&amp;B. She recalls feeling awestruck, aged five, after hearing a singer at her church in Rockhampton, and vowed to “sing like her one day”. When she was 13, Stephen Collins, a 22-year-old youth worker from Sydney, visited Woorabinda for a month with a laptop and microphone to set up a sustainable music program. Miiesha’s grandmother signed her up and a song she penned earned her an invite to perform at a Naidoc event in Sydney.</p> <p>Collins ended up staying in Woorabinda for six years, becoming like a brother to Miiesha. When she turned 18, he encouraged her to join him in NSW for a two-week recording stint. A songwriting partnership flourished, leading to three years bouncing between Sydney, Melbourne and Collins’ family farm near Goulburn.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjTi2Stjoj0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cjTi2Stjoj0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In 2018 Miiesha had an experience that would prove transformative: accompanying her grandmother on a two-week trip to Amata, a red-dirt desert community on her grandfather’s country in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands.</p> <p>“All the brothers went hunting and the women prepared food,” she says. “It was a beautiful experience.

I didn’t know I had this empty space in my heart and I didn’t know what was missing.</p> <p>“Seeing my grandmother go back to this familiar place, seeing these old girls that she hadn’t seen for 20-plus years, watching them huddle together and cry, and watching my grandmother speak Pitjantjatjara … I didn’t realise how beautiful and how old and how deep my blood runs.”</p> <p>Miiesha hopes to use her platform to “open doors” for other young artists in Woorabinda, a community she says is brimming with creativity.</p> <p>“I never wanted the spotlight because I didn’t want to have to be brave; I didn’t want to have to be strong,” she says. “I thought I was the worst person to be a role model.

help” the process of ratifying the deal through the European parliament.</p> <p>Both ambassadors spoke to Guardian Australia after they attended an Indo-Pacific forum at the Australian National University in Canberra on Wednesday – an event designed to showcase the EU’s interest in closer cooperation in the region.</p> <p>Thébault said the new Australian government’s position on climate change – including a 43% cut in emissions by 2030 against 2005 levels – was “truly a gamechanger”, and took aim at the previous government’s refusal to increase the target.</p> <p>“It is something on which Australia was widely seen, not only by EU but also by Pacific countries, as not fulfilling its potential and refusing to take responsibility,” said the French ambassador, who was recalled to Paris at the height of the tensions last year.</p> <p>“Today, we have a complete change of footing, which has been widely applauded.”</p> <p>Thébault said France welcomed the new stance, which opened avenues for pragmatic cooperation “not only bilaterally, also internationally, and especially in this region, that we both have a strong interest for”.</p> <p>He said he hoped for “a substantial, very positive, constructive reconnection [and] relaunch”.</p> <p>“I’ve received a lot of messages from Australians – the quiet Australians – who have been loudly saying we hope, especially on climate change, on these common threats, that we can act together,” Thébault said, using a phrase coined by Scott Morrison.</p> <p>“We will work on this, but also many other aspects – but this remains to be discussed among the leaders and among the responsible persons to make it possible and to make it stronger than ever.”</p> <p>France’s outgoing foreign affairs minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, <a

noting that the long-serving foreign minister had also been the defence minister before that.</p> <p>“He also was personally very involved in the building of this confident relationship [with

Being a season that also tends to bring less sun exposure, <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/vitamin-d\">winter is associated with lower vitamin D levels</a>, which our bodies derive mainly from the sun. And while this is known to impact bone health, there is growing evidence that vitamin D’s functions could be more extensive, with deficiencies linked to greater risk from respiratory infections.</p> <p>“When our vitamin D levels are extremely low, they can cause muscle aches and pains of the body and can impact the immune response to infections,” says Vicki Kotsirilos, associate professor at Western Sydney University. “So as we head into winter, it’s an important consideration.”</p> <h2>What is vitamin D?</h2> <p>Despite its common name, the fat-soluble vitamin D is now regarded as a hormone. It is made by the body <a href=\"https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/\">through a series of steps</a>. When exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from the sun, cholesterol in the skin is converted to cholecalciferol (D3) and ergocalciferol (D2), which travel in the bloodstream to the liver where they are metabolised to form calcidiol. These then head to the kidneys and are converted to the active hormone, calcitriol.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/10/does-vitamin-d-combat-covid\">Does vitamin D combat Covid?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Around 90% of our vitamin D intake comes from the sun. “Vitamin D deficiency is a sunlight deficiency,” says Ian Brighthope, professor of nutritional and environmental medicine and director of the National Institute of Integrative Medicine.</p> <p>We can derive smaller amounts from the diet as vitamin D3 or D2. <a href=\"https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/foods-high-in-vitamin-d\">Food sources</a> include fatty fish such as salmon and tuna, eggs, mushrooms, beef liver and full-cream milk. Supplements are also a source of vitamin D3.</p> <h2>Vitamin D and the immune system</h2> <p>Vitamin D helps bones take up calcium and other important minerals and has long been known to help prevent rickets in children and bone problems such as osteoporosis in adults. But it became apparent that vitamin D’s impact went well beyond bone health after vitamin D receptors were discovered in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5031366/\">most cells in the body</a> – including immune cells – signalling other functions.</p> <p>“Vitamin D has a very broad spectrum of activity,” says Brighthope. “Probably, its most important activity is on the immune system, because we now know that people who have high levels of vitamin D in their system are less likely to get acute, severe respiratory infections and end up in hospital and dying in intensive care.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were meant to live in daylight. We weren’t meant to live in caves</p> <footer> <cite>Ian Brighthope</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is general agreement on the importance of sun exposure, but Professor Prue Hart, principal research fellow at the Telethon Kids Institute, suggests the benefits are not due to vitamin D but rather other molecules produced by the skin. Hart says although blood levels of vitamin D levels are associated with immunity, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32668607/\">clinical supplementation trials have not shown any benefit</a>.</p> <p>While some studies have <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121423/\">shown no benefit</a>, a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583\">meta-analysis</a> of 25 randomised controlled trials with more than 11,000 participants reported that vitamin D supplements helped ward off acute respiratory infection. </p> <p>As these different studies suggest, nothing is simple, because several factors could be at play with respiratory infections. Vitamin D supplements are most likely to benefit someone with a deficiency.</p> <p>“Vitamin D is only one member of an orchestra of nutrients and it doesn’t work very well if you abuse your kidneys and your liver with alcohol or eat high levels of salt, fat and sugar in particular,” says Brighthope. “All of these things suppress your immunity.” Vitamin D supplements may not always work in people with comorbidities such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, he adds.</p> <p>Brighthope says a medical practitioner with postgraduate nutrition qualifications is best equipped to address these complexities. </p> <h2>How do you know if you’re deficient?</h2> <p>Rickets or osteoporosis could be an alarm bell for vitamin D deficiency, as could muscle aches and pains as Kotsirilos noted. Other than that, it’s hard to tell.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/20/slip-slop-what-why-putting-on-sunscreen-suddenly-seems-complicated\">Slip, slop, what? Why putting on sunscreen suddenly seems complicated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Vitamin D deficiency doesn’t carry with it too many symptoms,” says Brighthope. People may notice neuropsychiatric or neurophysiological changes, he notes. “For example, it can be tiredness, poor sleep, poor appetite, depression or depression mixed with anxiety.” But these could all be attributed to other factors as well.</p> <p>Therefore, a blood test is the best way to measure vitamin D status.</p> <h2>Who is at risk?</h2> <p>People who live in the lower latitudes of Victoria, the ACT, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania are generally at greater risk of deficiency than those in the northern regions.</p> <p>“There are also what we call subpopulations within those groups that have a high risk of vitamin D deficiency,” says Kotsirilos. “For example, people who are more house bound, community-dwelling, older and/or disabled people, dark-skinned people and people who are overdressed and avoid the sun or work indoors.” Sunscreen can also block UVB rays.</p> <h2>How do I boost my vitamin D levels?</h2> <p>Getting outdoors is the best way to get vitamin D levels up. “The easiest way is safe sun exposure,” says Kotsirilos. But with our modern lifestyles this can be tricky.</p> <p>“We were meant to live in daylight,” says Brighthope. “We weren’t meant to live in caves, but I’m sure you are sitting in your cave right now, like I am. So you should really be out there foraging for nuts, seeds, berries and perhaps doing a little bit of fishing.” <a href=\"https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/vitamin-d\">Physical activity</a> is also thought to help the body produce vitamin D.</p> <p>Failing that, supplementation can help to lift low vitamin D levels. Recommended intakes vary considerably, and it is best to consult a medical practitioner about appropriate supplement dosage and monitoring.</p> <h2>What about skin cancer risk?</h2> <p>Australians have a relatively high <a href=\"https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/skin-cancer-and-melanomas\">incidence of skin cancer</a>, usually from excessive UV exposure, so common sense should prevail when going out in the sun.</p> <p>“Going out in the full midday sun in summer is crazy, and going into ultraviolet tanks for tanning is crazy,” says Brighthope. Basically, Hart says we should avoid getting sunburnt – but this is not generally as big an issue in winter.</p> <p>“Over summer it’s important to cover up and be safe between the hours of say 11am to 5pm,” says Kotsirilos. Balancing this with vitamin D requirements, sun protection is recommended if the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org.au/media-releases/2016/how-much-sun-is-enough\">UV index</a> is above 3.</p> <p>Brighthope suggests exposing your skin to moderate amounts of sunlight for 20 minutes a day, or for up to 30-60 minutes before 11am and after 3pm. “Providing you’re not fair-skinned,” he adds. For very pale people, Kotsirilos proposes 15 minutes of exposure per day. “It’s a matter of knowing thyself and everything in moderation.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/26/new-coalition-mp-was-founding-member-of-club-promoting-climate-science-denial","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T17:30:41Z","webTitle":"New Coalition MP was founding member of club promoting climate science denial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/new-coalition-mp-was-founding-member-of-club-promoting-climate-science-denial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/26/new-coalition-mp-was-founding-member-of-club-promoting-climate-science-denial","fields":{"headline":"New Coalition MP was founding member of club promoting climate science denial","trailText":"LNP member for Flynn, Colin Boyce, signed international statement rejecting climate crisis and criticised science in state parliament","body":"<p>The new federal MP for the Queensland seat of Flynn was a founding member of a club formed to promote climate science denial, and was a signatory to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/26/co2-is-plant-food-australian-group-signs-international-declaration-denying-climate-science\">international statement claiming “there is no climate emergency”</a>.</p> <p>Colin Boyce did not respond to questions as to whether he is still a member of the Saltbush Club, a group which published commentary during the election campaign that said the climate crisis is “a fraud”.</p> <p>He would not say whether he still supported the “world climate declaration”, which he signed in 2019 alongside figures such as Ian Plimer.

That doesn’t work. It’s not effective. It doesn’t prevent crime.”</p> <p>His remarks were <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156646497466336&amp;id=15704546335&amp;_rdr\">almost identical</a> in the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting in Florida back in 2018, which claimed the lives of 17 students and teachers. Despite a grassroots protest movement, in which hundreds of thousands of school children descended on Washington in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/parkland-student-takeover\">a March for Our Lives</a>, no federal legislation was passed. Jury selection in the death penalty trial of the Parkland shooter <a href=\"https://www.local10.com/news/local/2022/05/24/more-delays-during-jury-selection-for-nikolas-cruzs-death-penalty-trial/\">continues this week</a>, a further marker of the trauma these mass shootings leave behind.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Cruz is <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/trump-cruz-abbott-nra-meeting-17196580.php\">set to speak</a> at the National Rifle Association leadership summit on Friday, in Houston, just 280 miles from Uvalde, alongside Donald Trump and Texas governor Greg Abbott.</p> <p>Other senior Texas Republicans, who have presided over a series of measures aimed at loosening restrictions on firearm ownership in the state, reiterated calls to arm teachers, despite the fact the shooter engaged a number of armed officers as he successfully stormed the school building.</p> <p>“We can’t stop bad people from doing bad things,” Texas attorney general Ken Paxton <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2022/05/24/uvalde-school-shooting-renews-gun-laws-debate-in-texas/\">told Fox News</a> on Tuesday. “We can potentially arm and prepare and train teachers and other administrators to respond quickly. That, in my opinion, is the best answer.”</p> <p>Among other US Republican senators, perceived as more open to bipartisan agreement, the sentiment remained largely the same. North Carolina senator Thom Tillis <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/24/wake-uvalde-furious-democrats-assail-republicans-over-resistance-tightening-gun-laws/\">told reporters on Tuesday</a> he had not seen any indication in initial reports that suggested the shooter’s record “​​was in any way affected by Congress’s actions or inaction”.</p> <p>Tillis continued to express skepticism over so-called “red flag laws” <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2019/09/04/red-flag-laws-spur-debate-over-due-process\">adopted by a handful of US states in the wake of Parkland</a>, which aim to allow authorities to restrict gun ownership from individuals deemed a threat to public safety. In 2019 <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-statement-on-president-trumps-remarks-on-recent-shootings\">bipartisan efforts</a> in the US Senate to support such laws failed and on Tuesday Tillis reiterated his concern that such laws were “overreach”.</p> <p>While Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, passed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/us/politics/biden-gun-control-bill.html\">two House gun control bills last year</a>, which aimed to expand and strengthen background checks, there remains little to no hope of their passage through the split US Senate where 60 votes are required to pass legislation. On Tuesday, the conservative Democrat Joe Manchin <a href=\"https://thehill.com/news/senate/3500416-manchin-calls-for-common-sense-gun-limits-resists-filibuster-reform/\">also reiterated he did not support calls from within the party to reform senate filibuster rules</a>, which could allow the passage of legislation with a simple majority.</p> <p>There was no sign either that a new generation of Republican senators might offer any hope for bipartisan gun reform measures. At a victory party on Tuesday night in Georgia, the newly nominated, Trump-endorsed Senate candidate Herschel Walker evaded questions over the massacre.</p> <p>Asked if he supported any new gun control measures in the aftermath, Walker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1529281988158541825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1529281988158541825%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fpolitics%2Fwhat-id-like-to-do-is-see-it-and-everything-and-stuff-herschel-walker-asked-about-gun-laws-after-texas-school-shooting%2F\">responded</a>: “What I like to … what I like to do, is see it and everything and stuff,” before being ushered away.</p> <p>Supporters at the event <a href=\"https://twitter.com/morgan_rimmer/status/1529262259708518402\">reportedly booed</a> as president Joe Biden’s address to the nation was broadcast, during which he asked: “When in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?

This has to change.”</p> <p>They said that “persistent stories of abuse and denigration of standards in parliament” had left them “ashamed” and that improvements to the system of reporting harassment were not enough.</p> <p>“Making abuse easier to report does nothing to change the root cause: a culture of indifference and fear,” they wrote.</p> <p>“In any other workplace, things would never have been allowed to get this bad. It is shocking that those most involved in the governance of our country have overseen such a denigration of standards.</p> <p>“We understand that the power to make change often lies outside of parliament, with the government and political parties themselves.</p> <p>“However, all it takes for evil to prosper is for good people to stand by and do nothing.

It had been heavily briefed that Boris Johnson would be the model of remorse for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-law-breaking-no-10-parties-published-boris-johnson\">statement to the Commons on the Sue Gray report</a>. But that Boris lasted barely 30 seconds and what we got thereafter was the classic narcissist’s non-apology. A tawdry torrent of self-pity. A man more sinned against than sinner. A good man cast adrift in a world he barely understood.</p> <p>The Convict began by saying he was grateful to Gray. I bet he was. There was little doubt she had pulled her punches. She was a career civil servant, after all, who had spent a lifetime covering up other people’s messes. Yes, there were some telling details in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-law-breaking-no-10-parties-published-boris-johnson\">her report</a> – the wine stains, the puke, the brawling, the dodging out of sight of CCTV cameras at 4am, the altered invitations – all of which suggested that everyone knew they were acting against the law. But there was no smoking gun. Or not one that could flush out a prime minister devoid of shame.</p> <p>“I don’t say this to absolve myself,” Johnson said repeatedly. Except he did. And time and again he found himself worthy of total absolution. The fixed-penalty notice he had received? That was for something that was never a party. But he accepted his martyrdom. Not. He would go to his grave believing he had done nothing wrong. Not least because as the police hadn’t busted him for any further crimes, then he couldn’t have committed any.</p> <p>Nor did people understand quite how large No 10 was, so it was impossible to keep tabs on everyone. Which was weird because other prime ministers have complained how small the building is. And he had just been showing good leadership by turning up to the illegal leaving parties. It had never occurred to him that some of the parties might go on for hours. The Convict had always wondered why there was so much noise and the cleaners were complaining about having to clear up so many empties.</p> <p>Johnson ended by saying the bad old days were over. The entire senior management team had changed – it hadn’t occurred to him that he might be in any way responsible for the chaos and law-breaking in No 10 – and from now on he was going to be extra nice to the little people. He might even speak to them.</p> <p>“We are humbled,” he said with a dismissive, regal wave of his arm. Except he wasn’t at all. You need empathy and a state of grace to feel humbled. He didn’t even feel humiliated. Which any normal person would have been.</p> <p>There was no hint of repentance or sincere apology. Just delusional ramblings. A man far more dangerous than a serial liar. An amoral sociopath capable of believing any falsehood to be true if it fits his solipsistic worldview. Nothing will shake his belief that he never lied to parliament or anyone else. The truth is just a matter of perception.</p> <p>Keir Starmer tried to prise open the gaping cracks in the Convict’s logic. That’s how the light gets in. The report was a monument to hubris. Even though it appeared to have been heavily edited in parts, it still had enough in it for any reasonable person to expect the prime minister to go.</p> <p>Did Johnson never wonder why everyone was permanently pissed and it was impossible to find anyone doing any real work after 4pm? How come he never looked at tables weighed down with booze and wondered what the fuck was going on? And the idea of the government’s ethics adviser bringing her own karaoke machine into work was straight out of The Thick of It.</p> <p>By now, though, the Convict could no longer maintain even the facade of giving a shit. He tugged at his toddler haircut and smirked. Couldn’t Starmer just let go of his “sanctimonious obsession”? He was fed up with everyone droning on about party this and party that. No one was going to take him down. Top of the world, Ma. And Sue – Johnson lapsed into the familiar – had investigated the party in the Downing Street flat exhaustively. As in not at all. Labour clearly believed she had been nobbled. But Johnson just wanted everyone to move on. To a place where no one could eat or pay their fuel bills.</p> <p>The Tory response was muted. There were a few of the usual quarterwits – step forward Peter Bone, Michael Fabricant and Craig Mackinlay – to say the prime minister was a paragon of virtue and that no one could expect anyone to have obeyed the rules as they were all so complicated – but only Tobias Ellwood called out the Convict as a liar who was destroying the image of the Tory party.</p> <p>“We will lose the next election,” he said, as several of his own side heckled him. They are as truth-averse as their leader. The rest of the Tory backbenchers made their excuses and left. Anything to escape the scene of the crime. Within 40 minutes of the statement starting, the benches were less than a quarter full. Though the stony-faced cabinet had to stay and take their punishment beating. The question is what happens next. Do the Tories feel lucky enough to put their letters in to the 1922 Committee? Or do they stick with the man who will drag them ever further into the dirt?</p> <p>A couple of hours later, the Convict was giving a press conference in Downing Street. If anything, he was now even more deconstructed. Just phoning it in and openly laughing in journalists’ faces as he brazenly made no attempt to answer their questions. As if he believed he had got away scot-free on a technicality. His answer to allegations of lying to parliament and the country was yet more lies. It was somehow a fitting symmetry. He can’t help himself.</p> <p>The closest he got to coming unstuck was when the Guardian’s Jessica Elgot asked him if he was not bothered that his press officers had openly lied to the media about parties they themselves had been at. It was like this. His media team were like him. They genuinely believed their own lies. The vomit in their waste bins was work vomit.</p> <p>“My job is to serve the country,” Johnson said. In which case, why doesn’t he do us all a favour and bugger off. “I’ve got to love you and leave you.” Something he’s said to every wife and lover. He looked at his watch. Past four. Past wine o’clock. Time for a drink. There was going to be one hell of a party in the Downing Street flat tonight.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/may/25/french-open-2022-emma-raducanu-norrie-djokovic-nadal-alcaraz-day-four-tennis","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T17:07:11Z","webTitle":"French Open 2022: Raducanu beaten, Zverev wins, Djokovic through on day four – as it happened!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/may/25/french-open-2022-emma-raducanu-norrie-djokovic-nadal-alcaraz-day-four-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/may/25/french-open-2022-emma-raducanu-norrie-djokovic-nadal-alcaraz-day-four-tennis","fields":{"headline":"French Open 2022: Raducanu beaten, Zverev wins, Djokovic through on day four – as it happened!","trailText":"Emma Raducanu lost in three sets to Aliaksandra Sasnovich, Alex Zverev came from two sets down to beat Sebastian Baez and Novak Djokovic won easily against Alex Molcan","body":"<div id=\"block-628e61e68f08b48a6e744125\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T17:07:11.249Z\">6.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Righto people, my watch is over. </strong>To do a quick around the courts before I depart, it’s Bencic 5-2 Andreescu, Korda 1-0 Gasquet (with a break), Dimitrov 6-0 4-3 Coric and Munar 6-2 7-6(3) 2-6 2-6 2-5 Schwartzman.
