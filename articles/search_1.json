In 1940, her father, Willem Rubinstein, an outerwear designer and garment-maker, was taken by the Nazis to the concentration camp at Auschwitz, where he died.</p> <p>Since her mother, Hanne (nee Hamm), who was her husband’s PA and then a partner in his firm, was not Jewish, and their three children had been christened, they survived the second world war and the privations of the 1944 Dutch Hunger Winter. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Gerda always had a tremendously positive outlook on life.</p> <p>Much later, she wrote on her <a href=\"http://www.gerdarubinstein.com/\">website</a> that “the sense of freedom and hope that I experienced as a teenager in Holland, after five years of occupation, has never really left me and still colours my work”.</p> <p>After the war, Gerda attended the Rijksacademie in Amsterdam and was awarded a grant to study in Paris, under Ossip Zadkine. Returning to the Netherlands, Gerda’s first major commission was for a carving in stone, unveiled in IJmuiden in 1956, followed by <a href=\"http://www.gerdarubinstein.com/commissions/\">Children Playing</a>, a sculpture in bronze for the Oosterpark in Amsterdam, which is still much loved today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"407947041d7ab2d1aad85d9cbc8d971538e99bbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/407947041d7ab2d1aad85d9cbc8d971538e99bbe/0_64_1536_1920/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gerda Rubinstein working on City, a 1970 commission for Harlow new town\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gerda Rubinstein working on City, a 1970 commission for Harlow new town</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1958, on a visit to London, she met Christopher Stevens, an architect. They married in 1959 and moved to Blackheath, where Gerda quickly became involved in the Blackheath Art Society, making many friends. </p> <p>An introduction to Sir Frederick Gibberd, the architect and landscape designer, led to commissions for several pieces for Harlow new town, in Essex, and the <a href=\"https://www.thegibberdgarden.co.uk/sculpture-in-the-gibberd-garden-1/\">Gibberd Garden</a>. Gerda exhibited regularly throughout her career, finding inspiration all around her. Her work can be found in many private collections, with further public commissions in Utrecht, Dudley, London, Watford and Bielefeld, Germany.</p> <p>From 1967 until her retirement in 1996 at the age of 65, Gerda taught sculpture at the Inner London Education Authority’s adult education institutes in Lewisham and Greenwich. She was an inspiring teacher, and her classes, as she said, were open to students from 18 to 80; many became close friends and several went on to become professional artists, thanks to her generosity of her time and expertise. She didn’t want to retire but it was mandatory as an Ilea employee.</p> <p>After moving to Reigate, Surrey, in 2008, she continued to work in her garden studio well into her 80s. In recent years, she had become less mobile and her memory deteriorated. But she never lost her positivity.</p> <p>Gerda is survived by Christopher, me and her grandson, JJ. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2022/may/25/david-brailsford-recruited-andrew-strauss-high-performance-review-english-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T17:04:16Z","webTitle":"Dave Brailsford recruited to Andrew Strauss’s review of English cricket","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/25/david-brailsford-recruited-andrew-strauss-high-performance-review-english-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/may/25/david-brailsford-recruited-andrew-strauss-high-performance-review-english-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Dave Brailsford recruited to Andrew Strauss’s review of English cricket","trailText":"Andrew Strauss has recruited Sir Dave Brailsford, the former performance director of British Cycling and current director of sport at Ineos, to his high performance review of English cricket","body":"<p>Andrew Strauss has recruited Sir Dave Brailsford, the former performance director of British Cycling and director of sport at Ineos, to his high-performance review of English cricket.

On 20 June he was found dead in his office by two of his adult children.

It’s just shocking. There’s a real lack of humanity.”</p> <p>Cassie, an art teacher who lives in York, had felt unable to visit her brother more than 100 miles away because of the restrictions at the time. “It never entered my head to go to his house.

And then to think my brother was spiralling on that night of the 19th when they were having birthday celebrations … it’s sickening and immoral and just hugely unfair.</p> <p>“It never entered my head to break the rules. You’d hope someone [in No 10] would be thinking of doing the right thing. I think at no point it was thought about what others were going through and the dark places that people were visiting in their mind.”</p> <p>She is disappointed that there have not been more consequences for Boris Johnson. “I find it quite scary that someone with this much power can pretty much do what he wants. He can make the law and break the law and then nothing happens about it.”</p> <p>Mike Handley, 54, was planning his father Ian’s funeral over Zoom on 13 November, when Johnson attended a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-failure-to-investigate-alleged-abba-party-in-pm-flat-irks-mps\">“gathering” </a>at his flat.

He had pre-chosen the hymns for his funeral, imagining his family singing along to Will Your Anchor Hold and Abide With Me.</p> <p>But restrictions in churches meant they had to stand in silence instead. Hearing that there was a karaoke machine at one of No 10’s parties has infuriated Mike.</p> <p>“All the music was piped through from a recording and we couldn’t sing. We just had to stand there and listen,” he said.</p> <p>Lindsay Jackson, 64, a retired civil servant from Bakewell in Derbyshire, was unable to see her mother, Sylvia, in the weeks before she died of Covid in a nursing home on 17 April 2020.</p> <p>She said: “It’s very upsetting and devastating to know that the people who set the laws weren’t actually following them in the way that the rest of us were.</p> <p>“It makes me feel like a fool for not having broken the rules myself and been with my mum when she died. She was alone.

Today, thanks to an overnight sortie and some very long brushes, the Osborne bull on the outskirts of the small Galician town of Xinzo de Limia is a fetching shade of azure – and a reflection on the impossibility of doing justice to the ever-changing heavens.</p> <p>The idea for the taurine makeover came after the artist – who wishes to remain anonymous – began to ponder the silhouettes’ <em>trompe l’oeil</em> gap, which is meant to show the sky between the animal’s back legs and tail.</p> <p>“That bit’s not a cut-out hole, it’s just painted blue,” the artist told the Guardian. “Everyone associates that blue with the blue of the Spanish sky. I thought it would be good to turn all that on its head by painting the ‘hole’ black and the rest of the Osborne bull Spanish-sky blue.

In 2005, a young artist in Extremadura was <a href=\"https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/53368/0/entrevista/vaca/osborne/\">fined and placed under house arrest</a> for two days for transforming an Osborne bull in Cáceres province into a Swiss cow in an apparent attempt to put the area on the cultural map.</p> <p>The author of the latest bovine beautification, which swiftly attracted the attention of Guardia Civil officers, is keen to stress they are a big fan of the Osborne bulls. “I read one article that said we were trying to make the bull disappear. Not at all. I love the bulls.”</p> <p>They also gave short shrift to any suggestion of some lurking political or social message, arguing the work is a purely poetic and artistic act. Sometimes, they added, an enormous blue bull is just an enormous blue bull.</p> <p>“Design-wise, I think they’re one of the best examples in the world because they’re so simple – and that’s why they’ve endured,” the artist said. “But like everything in this country, they’ve been politicised and used by one group against another. Anything you do involving one of these bulls is going to make people think something because they carry such meaning.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/25/kate-moss-johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T17:01:43Z","webTitle":"Kate Moss testifies that Johnny Depp did not push her down stairs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/kate-moss-johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/25/kate-moss-johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial","fields":{"headline":"Kate Moss testifies that Johnny Depp did not push her down stairs","trailText":"Supermodel, 48, tells court in three-minute appearance that she and Depp had been in romantic relationship between 1994 and 1998","body":"<p>Kate Moss testified by video for just three minutes on Wednesday in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial, dispelling a rumor that Depp had pushed her down a flight of steps when he was her boyfriend in the 1990s.</p> \n<p>The 48-year-old supermodel, speaking from her English home in Gloucestershire, told the court in Virginia that she and Depp had been in a romantic relationship from 1994 to 1998. <br><br>Depp’s attorney Benjamin Chew asked Moss if anything had happened while they were on holiday at the GoldenEye resort in Jamaica.</p> \n<p>“We were leaving the room, and Johnny left the room before I did, and there had been a rainstorm. As I left the room, I slid down the stairs and I hurt my back,” Moss told the court via the video feed.</p> \n<p>“I screamed because I didn’t know what had happened to me and I was in pain. He came running back to help me and carried me to my room and got me medical attention,” she added.</p> \n<p>Moss said Depp had not pushed her down the stairs. Asked if, at any point in their relationship, he had pushed her in that way, Moss said: “No.”</p> \n<p>“He never pushed me, kicked me or threw me down any stairs, no,” Moss told the court.</p> \n<p>Heard’s attorneys declined to cross-examine Moss, and she was told she was free to go.</p> \n<p>Moss was called by Depp’s legal team, who appeared to celebrate when her name was mentioned by Heard during her testimony, when she revived the rumor that Depp had pushed her down a flight of stairs.</p> \n<p>Depp himself later took the stand to reject aspects of Heard’s testimony earlier in the trial. Among those were Heard’s claim that Depp had taken a handful of ecstasy pills during a trip to Australia in 2015.</p> \n<p>Depp testified he had taken the drug, also known as MDMA, six or seven times in his life. His attorney asked him directly if he had ever taken eight to 10 pills at once, as Heard testified.</p> \n<p>“No. I’m pretty sure I’d be dead. I think one would die rather quickly,” he said.</p> \n<p>Depp’s attorneys asked him how it had been to listen to Heard’s accusations against him during the trial.</p> \n<p>“Insane,” Depp replied. “It’s insane to hear heinous accusations of violence, sexual violence, that she’s attributed to me and accused me of. I don’t think anyone enjoys having to split themselves open and tell the truth, but there are times when one simply has to, because it’s gotten out of control,” Depp said.</p> \n<p>The accusations against him, he added, were “ridiculous, humiliating, ludicrous, painful, savage and unimaginably brutal, cruel and all false. All false.”</p> \n<p>The actor also disputed a claim made by Heard that he had nothing to do with getting her a role in the superhero blockbuster Aquaman.</p> \n<p>Depp said that after Heard auditioned for the role, he talked to the studio on her behalf. He was barred from discussing the details of his conversations when Heard’s lawyers objected, but said that “ultimately she did get the job, so hopefully, I suppose, I had curbed their worries to some degree.”</p> \n<p>But Depp rejected a claim by Heard’s attorneys that he had reached out to Warner Bros executives to have her removed from the franchise after their marriage collapsed. “I had given my word to them, and I felt responsible that I had to tell them exactly what was going on and that it was going to end up ugly,” Depp said.</p> \n<p>Throughout Depp’s testimony on Wednesday, he appeared more argumentative, rather than maintaining the movie star veneer he had displayed earlier in the trial.

Colin failed his 11-plus and left Balfour Road secondary modern boys’ school at 16, going on to Runcorn College of Further Education to study shorthand and typing, which helped him in his first job as a junior reporter on the Cheshire Observer.</p> <p>After moving on to the Sheffield Star, in 1968 he started his broadcasting career by joining the newly opened BBC Radio Sheffield. This launched his life with the BBC, in which he crisscrossed the country as a producer, editor and executive.</p> <p>In 1970 he became news editor at Radio Humberside, and was then lured to London to work first as deputy editor of Radio 1’s Newsbeat programme, and then deputy editor of Today on Radio 4. His career continued on an upward trajectory, leading him to Manchester in 1978 as editor of File on 4 (radio’s equivalent of Panorama) and subsequently as editor of BBC television features.</p> <p>Managerial roles then took him to Birmingham as head of network television, and in 1992 back to Manchester with the splendid title of head of broadcasting in the north. After four years in that post, Colin went to London to become controller of production and then, to the surprise of most people (including himself), controller of drama.</p> <p>In that role he had to sort out what had become an unwieldy and almost unmanageable empire. One of his first tasks was to evict an impecunious dramatist who was using one of the drama department offices as his home.</p> <p>In 2000 Colin left the BBC. He had always been sensitive about his lack of a university education in the graduate-heavy corporation, and immediately signed up for a history BA at the University of East Anglia. His first-class degree surprised none of his friends, and provided him with proof of the divisiveness of the 11-plus. He went on to gain an MA with distinction and thoroughly enjoyed his later years of academic achievement, also spending time travelling extensively around the world.</p> <p>Colin married Mags Sailes in 1968. She survives him, as do their daughters, Julie, Jeni and Kate, his grandchildren, Ellie and Lily, and his siblings Ian and Judith.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/may/25/peter-campbell-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T16:48:57Z","webTitle":"Peter Campbell obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/25/peter-campbell-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/may/25/peter-campbell-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Peter Campbell obituary","trailText":"Activist and campaigner who worked to help people with mental health difficulties organise and advocate for change<br />","body":"<p>For those who have come of age in a country where the crisis of mental health often tops the headlines, it can seem inconceivable that within living memory people who experienced mental health difficulties were often ignored and locked away.</p> <p>Describing himself as a mental health system survivor, the activist Peter Campbell, who has died aged 73, experienced the old psyschiatric asylums as well as the newer systems of care in the community that replaced them. He worked for more than 40 years to end the marginalisation of those subject to the powers of the mental health system, and to help people who live with mental health difficulties find a collective and credible voice to advocate for change.</p> <p>Peter was instrumental to the mid-1980s flowering of activist groups led by people who had experienced the harmful realities of psychiatric practices such as restraint, seclusion, over-medication and detention without representation.</p> <p>In 1986, he co-founded Survivors Speak Out, the first network organisation, enabling people to work together to share information and campaign for rights and better conditions in hospitals and in the community.</p> <p>Peter played a leading part until 1996, writing newsletters, advising groups and undertaking research. The organisation set a course for user/survivor-led groups – still visible in the work of UK charities such as the <a href=\"https://www.nsun.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Survivor User Network</a>. </p> <p>Peter was a gifted communicator, who could hold a room rapt via poetry, in speech-making, in a meeting or through teaching. Throughout the 90s he was a lecturer and trainer, working with psychiatrists, nurses, housing officers and other health professionals to give the user view. Mental health services in England and Wales are now regularly developed with the views and opinions of those that will use them included, and Peter’s work, and those of his colleagues, helped challenge the stereotyping of mental health service users as people whose experiences could be ignored.</p> <p>In 1986 Peter appeared in We’re Not Mad... We’re Angry, probably the first network television programme made under full editorial control of those with lived experience of mental health difficulty. Broadcast by Channel 4, the film mixed dramatised sequences scripted by Peter with testimony from people who had been detained in mental health hospitals.</p> <p>Appearing in the documentary himself, Peter explained. “If I’m angry, the degree to which I am angry about my treatment is not because I want to tear the system down. It’s not because I want to seek vengeance. It’s because I see thousands of people like me whose positive contribution to society is being rinsed down the drain.”</p> <p>Peter spent eight years as a council member of Mental Health Media in the 1990s, during a period where the charity began to make its own educational films. A firm believer in the need to preserve the history of those deemed “mad”, he helped instigate the <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/oral-histories-of-personal-and-mental-health-and-disability\" title=\"\">Testimony project</a>, a series of 50 life story videos recording the experiences of m ental health survivors including those detained in the old asylums – now held in the British Library oral history collections.</p> <p>Born in the village of Strathtay in Perthshire into a well-to-do family, Peter grew up on a farm with his brothers, Lennox and John, the son of James Campbell, a doctor turned ornithologist, and Mary (nee Gray), a nurse during the second world war. He was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond (now Glenalmond College) near Perth, and went to Jesus College, Cambridge, to study history.</p> <p>At university he began to experience mental health difficulties. His father died when Peter was 21, and he went into mental health services for the first time in 1967. In his own words, “for the next 15 years I was in and out of hospital, adrift... isolated, alienated from myself, from other people... Silenced. I had no voice at all.”</p> <p>Peter joined Mind in Camden, north London, as a volunteer in the early 80s, helping to set up the Camden Mental Health Consortium. In 1991, he co-founded Survivors’ Poetry to promote poetry by survivors of mental distress. Published in 2006, his poetry book <a href=\"https://hearingeye.org/publications/brown-linoleum-green-lawns/\" title=\"\">Brown Linoleum Green Lawns</a> drew praise for its intense, humorous exploration of life on mental health wards. A prolific writer, Peter was working on a new book of poems at the time of his death. </p> <p>In 1999 he experienced a sudden, major hearing loss and became deaf. He continued to teach and was awarded honorary doctorates by Anglia Ruskin College and the Open University.</p> <p>In 2005 he co-founded the <a href=\"http://studymore.org.uk/MPU.HTM\" title=\"\">Survivors History Group</a>, a project to record and archive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/03/mentalhealth\" title=\"\">the history of self-advocacy</a> and organisation. Writing in 2020, Peter concluded that, while society and mental health services listen to people who live with mental ill-health more than ever, services remain custodial rather than caring and hospitals still leave people disempowered, much as they did 50 years ago.</p> <p>In 2006, the mental health charity Mind presented Peter with its Diamond Champion award, acknowledging how he had done more than anyone for users of mental health services in England and Wales over the course of its first 60 years. “Peter’s contribution to the service user movement is vast,” said Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind. “It’s hard to imagine the movement today without Peter’s constant activism and his advocacy for a better deal for people with mental health problems. His radical work has both influenced services and inspired others to speak out.”</p> <p>Friends and colleagues remember him as someone who would visit you in hospital, put you up at his flat, offer you support and encouragement; a warm, gentle and funny man adept at diplomacy. </p> <p>He is survived by his brother Lennox, a niece, Anna, and three nephews, James, Angus and Colin.</p> <p><em>•</em> Peter Campbell, mental health activist, educator and poet, born 3 January 1949; died 24 April 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/25/biden-reaction-uvalde-school-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T16:45:23Z","webTitle":"US reels after massacre in fourth-grade classroom leaves 21 dead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/biden-reaction-uvalde-school-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/25/biden-reaction-uvalde-school-shooting","fields":{"headline":"US reels after massacre in fourth-grade classroom leaves 21 dead","trailText":"America tries to absorb attack on elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, the worst school shooting since Sandy Hook a decade ago","body":"<p>America is absorbing the shock of another bloody mass shooting, a day after an 18-year-old man wearing body armour and carrying assault rifles entered an elementary school in Texas and gunned to death at least 19 children and two adults.</p> \n<p>The attack on Robb elementary school in Uvalde, 85 miles west of San Antonio, was the deadliest gun rampage in an American school in almost a decade. It prompted passionate calls for tougher gun controls led by Joe Biden but matched by equally stringent demands for more armed guards in schools from the gun lobby and Republicans.</p> \n<p>The shooting began to unfold at 11.32am on Tuesday when the shooter, who is believed to have posted photographs of what he called “my guns” on Instagram four days previously, opened fire in a classroom of nine- and 10-year-olds.

She was in critical condition. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said at a press conference on Wednesday that she had called the police before being shot.</p> \n<p>He then crashed his car near the elementary school, and headed for a door carrying an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle, according to officials.

He said the shooter barricaded himself into a classroom where he opened fire on children and two teachers.</p> \n<p>All the victims were reported to be from the same classroom, Olivarez said. A Swat-like border patrol team eventually broke into the room, shooting the gunman dead.</p> \n<p>Steve McCraw, the director of the department of public safety, said there were “40 minutes or so” between the shooter opening fire on the school security officer and when the gunman was killed.</p> \n<p>More than 200 rounds of ammunition were discovered with the shooter’s body, in 30-round magazines. It emerged on Wednesday that the gunman obtained his weapons legally over a three-day period this month, shortly after his 18th birthday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/25/texas-school-shooting-news-victims-uvalde-elementary-school-latest-updates\">Texas school shooting: all victims were in the same classroom, official says – latest updates</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He bought two semi-automatic AR-15 style rifles at a federally registered gun dealership on 17 and 20 May, and 375 rounds of ammunition on 18 May.</p> \n<p>Abbott said the shooter posted on Facebook three times before his attack. In the first, posted 30 minutes before going to the school, he said he would shoot his grandmother. The second said, “I shot my grandmother.” And the third, posted about 15 minutes before the attack, said: “I’m going to shoot an elementary school.”</p> \n<p>Uvalde is a small town of about 16,000, overwhelmingly Hispanic.</p> \n<p>Among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-victims\">confirmed victims</a> were two adults: Eva Mireles, 44, a bilingual special education teacher who was reportedly killed as she tried to shield her pupils, and the co-teacher Irma Garcia, who had taught at the school for 23 years and had four children of her own. Among the children publicly identified, the youngest was eight. Several were 10.</p> \n<p>They included eight-year-old Uziyah Garcia, described by his grandfather as “the sweetest little boy that I’ve ever known”; Xavier Lopez, 10, who his cousin said was “very bubbly, loved to dance”; and Amerie Jo Garza, who celebrated her 10th birthday two weeks ago.</p> \n<p>The shooting left more people dead than any US school shooting since Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut in December 2012. The impact was compounded by its timing, just 10 days after another 18-year-old gunman opened fire on grocery shoppers, most of them Black, in a supermarket in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/buffalo-shooting\">Buffalo, New York,</a> killing 10.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, a visibly shaken Biden urged Americans to resist the powerful gun lobby, which he blamed for blocking tougher firearms laws. Flags will be flown at half-mast until sunset on Saturday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5217fcf8-e013-4000-b4d1-a99db7639c41\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ctjG1KiLq9k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“As a nation, we have to ask, ‘When in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?’” Biden said. “When in God’s name are we going to do what has to be done? Why are we willing to live with this carnage?” He was “sick and tired of it”, he said, adding: “We have to act.”</p> \n<p>But Republican leaders – not least in Texas itself – were just as robust in their calls for more guns in schools. Ted Cruz, the US senator, said just a few hours after the attack the best way to keep kids safe was to have armed officers on campus.</p> \n<p>Ken Paxton, Texas’s attorney general, told the rightwing news outlet Newsmax the way to save lives was to have “teachers and other administrators who have gone through training and who are armed”.</p> \n<p>Their arguments were belied, however, by the facts of the Uvalde massacre. As the shooter entered the school, two local officers and a school guard opened fire but failed to stop him.</p> \n<p>Texas has led the US with a steady stream of initiatives loosening restrictions on firearms ownership. Last year its Republican governor, Abbott, <a href=\"https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=87R&amp;Bill=HB1927\">enacted a law</a> that removed almost all restraints on carrying handguns in public – despite the fact Texas has been the scene of several of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/el-paso-shooting\">most horrifying mass shootings</a> in US history.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday Abbott said other than the shooter posting on Facebook three times roughly 30 minutes before his attack, “there was no meaningful forewarning of this crime”. He said he asked the sheriff and mayor, “What is the problem here? And they were straightforward and emphatic. They said we have a mental, we have a problem with mental health illness in this community.”</p> \n<p>As Abbott’s press conference concluded, Beto O’Rourke approached the stage and told Abbott “you are doing nothing”. O’Rourke, the former presidential candidate who is running against Abbott in November for the gubernatorial seat, could be heard telling Abbott that the shooting was “predictable” because of his inaction and mentioned the 2019 shooting in El Paso where 23 people were killed in a Walmart store.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b8f63aa5-280c-48df-950d-149edcb8f410\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WwQAvbCWo2o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“This is on you until you choose to do something,” O’Rourke said.</p> \n<p>“Sir, you are out of line,” the mayor of Uvalde, Don McLaughlin, shouted at O’Rourke in an attempt to get him to leave the auditorium.

The pandemic has seen a dramatic uptick in gun sales, and with it a surge in gun deaths.</p> \n<p>In the last decade there have been at least 3,500 mass shootings, defined as incidents killing or injuring four or more people, according to the <a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/\">Gun Violence Archive</a>.

Hours after the attack, distraught families were still awaiting word on whether their children had survived, the silence broken repeatedly by screams and wailing.</p> \n<p>“My heart is broken today,” said Hal Harrell, the school district superintendent. “We’re a small community, and we’re going to need your prayers to get through this.”</p> \n<p>The school was preparing for its final day on Thursday. Themed days had been organised, with children asked to come on Tuesday dressed as “Footloose and Fancy”.</p> \n<p>Adolfo Cruz, 69, said he drove to the school after receiving a terrifying call from his daughter. He was waiting for news of his 10-year-old great-granddaughter, Eliajha Cruz Torres, and it was the heaviest moment of his life, he said.</p> \n<p>In strong international reactions to the shooting, Pope Francis said he was “heartbroken”, adding: “It is time to say ‘enough’ to the indiscriminate trafficking of weapons.” Emmanuel Macron said the French people shared Americans’ shock and grief at the “cowardly” shooting.</p> \n<p>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was “deeply saddened by the news of the murder of innocent children”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/may/25/labour-pushes-government-to-come-clean-over-newcastle-involvement","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T16:36:58Z","webTitle":"Labour pushes government to ‘come clean’ over involvement in Newcastle takeover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/labour-pushes-government-to-come-clean-over-newcastle-involvement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/may/25/labour-pushes-government-to-come-clean-over-newcastle-involvement","fields":{"headline":"Labour pushes government to ‘come clean’ over involvement in Newcastle takeover","trailText":"The minister for investment made contact with the Premier League over the Saudi Arabian bid for the club despite Boris Johnson’s statement saying the government ‘was not involved’","body":"<p>The Labour party has challenged the government to “come clean” over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/24/government-did-encourage-premier-league-to-approve-saudi-newcastle-takeover\">its involvement</a> in the Saudi Arabian-led takeover of Newcastle United.</p> <p>Ministers should be honest about the extent of any lobbying of the Premier League, and correct the record in parliament if they have previously not told the truth, the opposition has said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/24/government-did-encourage-premier-league-to-approve-saudi-newcastle-takeover\">Revealed: government did encourage Premier League to approve Newcastle takeover</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The news follows revelations in the Guardian that the minister for investment, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/gerry-grimstone\">Lord Gerry Grimstone</a>, made contact with the Premier League during the takeover process. This was contrary to public claims by Boris Johnson that the government had had no involvement at all.</p> <p>“Our football clubs are at the heart of communities,” said the shadow sports minister, Jeff Smith. “They should not be levered by ministers to pursue foreign policy goals.</p> <p>“The government must urgently come clean about the extent of their lobbying of the Premier League, and correct the record if they were telling fibs in the House of Commons.”</p> <p>Part of Lord Grimstone’s brief is to secure inward investment for the UK from foreign governments and he is understood by the Guardian to have approached the then-chairman of the Premier League, Gary Hoffman, over the takeover. Furthermore, he went so far as to offer to broker a solution between the league and Saudi authorities over piracy concerns which were threatening any deal.</p> <p>An initial offer for Newcastle from the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) stalled in 2020 over concerns the Saudi state would take direct control of the club. In 2021, after a resolution over the piracy of Premier League matches in the gulf region, a takeover was approved with the league saying it had received legally binding guarantees that the Saudi state would not be in charge. Hoffman told a meeting of the Premier League’s 20 clubs that the government had put pressure on the league to complete the takeover, but denied that the pressure had been successful.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade (DIT) confirmed that Grimstone did speak to Hoffman “as part of the countless conversations he has in his ministerial role”, and that it was his role “amongst other things, to keep abreast of large investments potentially coming into the UK”. But Grimstone had “never tried to influence Mr Hoffman and the Premier League to approve the Newcastle takeover”, the spokesperson said.</p> <p>In April 2021 the prime minister denied any government involvement in the process. Responding in parliament to a question from the Newcastle Central MP, Chi Onwurah, Johnson said: “The government was not involved at any point in the takeover talks on the sale of Newcastle.”</p> <p>This year the government announced plans to create an independent regulator for English football, with one of its roles being to administer a reformed owners’ and directors’ test. Although this test is expected to include a new component designed to assess a prospective owner’s integrity, the government said that the scope of any such test would be limited.</p> <p>“While it is important for the regulator to undertake enhanced due diligence,” it said, “there is a danger that the regulator could be drawn into issues that are geopolitical.

Three further cases with similar travel history arrived in 2021.</p> <p>“It could hypothetically be that the virus transmission amplified from this low level of transmission when by chance it entered the population that is at present amplifying transmission,” Heymann said. He stressed it was one of many hypotheses that needed further study before any conclusions could be drawn.</p> <p>Genetic studies on monkeypox viruses taken from people in the ongoing outbreak show a close resemblance to the virus that reached the UK, Israel and Singapore from Africa in 2018 and 2019. They also carry mutations that may have arisen as the virus then circulated at low levels.</p> <p>While the UK’s first official case of 2022 arrived from Nigeria on 4 May, the virus was already in the country.</p> <p>On 14 May the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) released images of monkeypox, and doctors in sexual health clinics realised some of their patients could have the disease. The patients had tested negative for common infections and doctors suspected a condition called disseminated gonococcal infection, before the patients tested positive for monkeypox.</p> <p>“This may be a virus that’s been circulating undetected for quite a while,” said Prof Marc Van Ranst, a virologist at the University of Leuven in Belgium. “They all have a common ancestor and that common ancestor probably dates back to 2019, though it’s too early to date with any kind of accuracy.”</p> <p>It is unclear whether mutations seen in the virus make the strain more transmissible in humans, but scientists point to the virus having evolved while infecting humans.</p> <p>“We know that chronic infection is not a plausible scenario, and that means there has been a chain of transmission events that apparently went unnoticed,” Van Ranst said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"&lt;iframe id=&quot;morning-briefing&quot; name=&quot;morning-briefing&quot; src=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; seamless=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe&quot; height=&quot;52px&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; data-component=&quot;email-embed--morning-briefing&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Covid pandemic may have played a role, as people had less contact with GPs and other health services during the crisis. Asked if the outbreak might not have come to light if sexual health clinics had not been alerted by the first UK case, Van Ranst said: “It’s entirely possible.”</p> <p>Prof Oyewale Tomori, a virologist and adviser to the Nigerian government, said more studies were needed to understand what is happening.</p> <p>“Perhaps it was spreading silently within the community until we had this flare-up following some of the changes in behaviour we’ve seen,” he said.</p> <p>“Between 2019 and 2020 if anybody came up with a rash in any part of Europe, you’re not going to think of monkeypox, your thought would be other diseases that cause a rash.</p> <p>“And if the system misses that one case, then of course that’s an opportunity for it to spread from one person to another.

Some people also experience disturbances in their sense of smell – a condition known as parosmia – but the biological basis for this has remained a mystery.</p> <p>Now scientists have identified a highly potent odour molecule that appears to be a trigger for the sense of disgust experienced by many of those with parosmia. The molecule, called 2-furanmethanethiol, found in coffee, was described by those with a normal sense of smell as being coffee- or popcorn-like, but those with parosmia typically described its scent as disgusting, repulsive or dirty.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/30/like-sewage-and-rotting-flesh-covids-lasting-impact-on-taste-and-smell\">‘Like sewage and rotting flesh’: Covid’s lasting impact on taste and smell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dr Jane Parker, the director of the Flavour Centre at the University of Reading and co-author of the research, said: “This is solid evidence that it’s not ‘all in the head’, and that the sense of disgust can be related to the compounds in the distorted foods. The central nervous system is certainly involved as well in interpreting the signals that it receives from the nose.”</p> <p>According to one <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.28.21262763v2.full.pdf\">recent international survey</a>, about 10% of those with Covid-related smell loss experienced parosmia in the immediate aftermath of the disease, and this rose to 47% when the respondents were interviewed again six or seven months later.</p> <p>Some of the most common triggers for parosmia include coffee, chocolate, meat, onion and toothpaste. The latest study investigated whether there were particular compounds within these substances that were to blame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>By trapping the aroma of coffee, the team were able to test individual coffee compounds on volunteers who had parosmia and compare their reaction with those who didn’t. From the hundred or so aroma compounds present in coffee, people with parosmia could point to those responsible for the sense of disgust. Among the 29 volunteers, scientists found 15 commonly identified compounds that triggered parosmia, with the prime culprit being a chemical called 2-furanmethanethiol, which 20 of the volunteers said had a horrible smell.</p> <p>The nose has more than 400 different types of olfactory receptor in the nose, each sensitive to different aromas. The chemical 2-furanmethanethiol has an exceptionally low threshold for being detected and so is possibly one of the first chemicals to come back on a person’s radar after losing their sense of smell. Parker said that the brain appeared to be mis-categorising the smell, but that more work was needed to understand this element of the condition. The paper noted that those with parosmia could also experience the most objectionable smells differently, for instance describing the smell of faeces as “less unpleasant or biscuity”.</p> <p>Simon Gane, one of the researchers, from the Royal National Ear, Nose and Throat and Eastman Dental hospital, said: “We still have a long way to go in understanding this condition, but this research is the first to zoom in on the mechanism in the nose. We now know this has to be something to do with the nerves and their receptors because that’s how these molecules are detected.”</p> <p>The findings are published in the journal <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43856-022-00112-9\">Communications Medicine</a>.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/may/25/leilas-brothers-review-one-woman-five-misogynistic-parasites-in-fierce-iranian-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T16:20:03Z","webTitle":"Leila’s Brothers review – one woman, five misogynistic parasites in fierce Iranian drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/25/leilas-brothers-review-one-woman-five-misogynistic-parasites-in-fierce-iranian-drama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/may/25/leilas-brothers-review-one-woman-five-misogynistic-parasites-in-fierce-iranian-drama","fields":{"headline":"Leila’s Brothers review – one woman, five misogynistic parasites in fierce Iranian drama","trailText":"Iran’s Saeed Roustayi puts the spotlight on a woman driven to distraction by the indolent, incompetent patriarchy","body":"<p>Iranian film-maker Saeed Roustayi delivers a big, absorbing, character-driven family drama in the Italian-American style with fierce performances, a huge set-piece wedding scene and touches of Visconti’s Rocco and His Brothers and Coppola’s The Godfather.

The cousin’s son Bayram (Mehdi Hosseinina) tells him the patriarch’s metaphorical crown could be his – as long as he pays 40 gold coins as a marriage present “tribute” at Bayram’s son’s forthcoming wedding.

That is factually correct. But as Gray’s report makes clear, virtually all the 15 events she chronicles took place in a surprisingly compact suite of offices through which Johnson regularly passes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2022/may/25/pictures-of-downing-street-gatherings-from-sue-grays-report\">New pictures of Downing Street gatherings from Sue Gray’s report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As such, the prime minister’s appeal to MPs that he “had no knowledge of subsequent proceedings because I simply wasn’t there, and I have been as surprised and disappointed as anyone”, resembles the father of a teenager telling police he did not realise a noisy party was disrupting the street because he was in an upstairs bedroom.</p> <p>As with so many things about the saga, this sense of almost irrelevance in Johnson’s role will be interpreted in markedly different ways by opposing sides of the argument.</p> <p>But even for allies, the sheer extent of detail in the report makes this notably more difficult to defend. Wine was spilled, a staffer was so drunk they were sick, a near-fight took place, karaoke music played. Emails and WhatsApp messages were passed between staff about “wine time Friday”, a warning that social noise should not drown out a press conference, and about having “got away with” holding a drinks party.</p> <p>This ultimately leaves two choices for those in Johnson’s camp. One is that he misled the country when he said he had no knowledge about parties. The other implies Johnson is so detached, dissociated and peripheral that the office he supposedly leads became the most Covid-rule-breaking address in England while he remained oblivious.</p> <p>Neither is the ideal place in which a national leader should find themselves.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/25/mps-inquiry-uk-semiconductor-industry-global-shortages","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T15:42:30Z","webTitle":"Kwasi Kwarteng launches inquiry into proposed takeover of Newport Wafer Fab","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/mps-inquiry-uk-semiconductor-industry-global-shortages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/25/mps-inquiry-uk-semiconductor-industry-global-shortages","fields":{"headline":"Kwasi Kwarteng launches inquiry into proposed takeover of Newport Wafer Fab","trailText":"The business secretary says deal will be scrutinised under new National Security and Investment Act","body":"<p>The business secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/kwasi-kwarteng\">Kwasi Kwarteng</a>, has launched an inquiry into the proposed takeover of the UK’s largest microchip manufacturer Newport Wafer Fab by Chinese-backed Nexperia.</p> <p>Kwarteng said on Wednesday that the deal will be scrutinised under the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/uk-government-extends-powers-to-intervene-in-foreign-takeovers\">National Security and Investment Act</a>, which was introduced at the start of the year.</p> <p>Any deal for Newport Wafer Fab, which is located in south Wales, is particularly sensitive as the company has multiple contracts with the UK government, including defence-related projects.</p> <p>Nexperia, which is looking to acquire Newport Wafer Fab in a £63m deal, is based in the Netherlands but is a subsidiary of China’s partially state-backed Wingtech.</p> <p>Kwarteng tweeted: “We welcome overseas investment, but it must not threaten Britain’s national security.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KwasiKwarteng/status/1529484796870680581\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, I called-in the acquisition of Newport Wafer Fab by Nexperia, a subsidiary of a Chinese company.<br><br>There will now be a full assessment under the new National Security and Investment Act.<br><br>We welcome overseas investment, but it must not threaten Britain&#39;s national security.</p>&mdash; Kwasi Kwarteng (@KwasiKwarteng) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KwasiKwarteng/status/1529484796870680581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 25, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The business secretary now has 30 working days to make a decision, with the option to extend the time for a further 45 working days.

It is a historical promise that we will keep, and you will continue to have English-speaking hospitals, schools … and universities,” he said, dismissing fears that those seeking healthcare in English would face new barriers.</p> <p>Thousands protested against the bill in recent weeks amid fears many public services would be curtailed.</p> <p>“Bill 96 is the most significant derogation of human rights in the history of Quebec and Canada,” Marlene Jennings, head of the Quebec Community Groups Network, which promotes the rights of English-speakers in the province, said in a statement.</p> <p>“This legislation revokes the right to access services in English for some 300,000 to 500,000 English-speaking Quebecers,” she said.</p> <p>Julius Grey, a lawyer leading the fight against the bill, called its passage one of the “most gratuitous uses of power I’ve ever seen” in an interview with CTV News.

I was born in Birmingham and I’ve lived here most of my life. I’ve travelled for work, but I’m a Brummie through and through and love celebrating where I’m from. Taking portraits allows me to connect with people, amplify their voices and challenge the narrative.</p> <p>I first photographed Mav, who runs the Women’s Boxing Club in Digbeth, in 2018 for my project <a href=\"https://www.jaskirtboora.com/people-place-and-sport\">People, Place and Sport</a>. When I returned in 2021, she’d had a baby and we talked about juggling motherhood and our passions for sport and photography. Then there’s her day job. She studied law at university, specialising in human rights, and previously worked as a police officer.</p> <p>She has such an aura – from sheer strength of character. It comes through in the picture. She was very comfortable in front of the camera. As a south Asian Muslim woman, she is passionate about getting women into boxing, not just for the physical elements, but also mental health. Boxing is a tactical sport: it’s not all about getting hit. It can give you a sense of community.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Most coaches are volunteers: they don’t get paid yet they’re training athletes who might reach elite levels</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet the only images we see of sportswomen in the mainstream media are of elite athletes. At the grassroots level, there are people of all shapes and sizes. You can be 70 or 80 and still participate, or a south Asian woman or a young Black guy. This grassroots involvement wouldn’t happen without people giving their time for nothing. Most coaches are volunteers: they don’t get paid yet they’re training athletes who might reach elite levels.</p> <p>I grew up doing sport – you name it, I played it. When I was about 16, and playing football for West Bromwich Albion girls, the anterior cruciate ligament in my knee snapped. I had surgery but it snapped again, putting paid to any sporting ambitions. I went on to do a mixed-media degree, which included photography, and it became a natural way for me to continue exploring my passion for sport.</p> <p>I always shoot on film. Something magical happens between hitting the shutter and developing the prints – something I’m not part of. Much of the work happens before you start taking pictures, though. I involve the people I photograph, whether by including interviews with them, or making collaborative portraits and asking how they would like to share their story. People respond positively, and start to relax. Often they’re people who aren’t used to being in the spotlight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/28/womens-boxing-madison-square-garden-katie-taylor-amanda-serrano\">‘I’m so glad this day has come’: women’s boxing’s journey to headlining Madison Square Garden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I take pictures, I’m very quiet. I want people to get comfortable. If they are still anxious, I get them to think about what the image is about. For this project, that was: what does this sport mean to you? We’ll be talking about those things in between shots, but in the quiet moments when I’m shooting, having them reflect on it helps.</p> <p>Some of the exhibitions of my work are in leisure centres and one is outside in a park, because accessibility – and who sees art – is important to me. We’re putting the pictures back into the public spaces where I took the photographs. The feedback I get is often about feeling valued and represented: we don’t tend to see 20 portraits of people in public spaces.

Hotter weather tends to correlate with moments of greater activity among ecosystems –– many species give birth in spring, for example –– while dusk and dawn represent a sort of underwater “rush hour” between diurnal and nocturnal creatures, said Freeman.</p> <p>Unhealthy coral communities sound less vibrant and also emit more high-frequency sounds, the researchers found.

However, within minutes the state department began walking back the comments, and Biden himself clarified on Tuesday that there was no change to US policy.</p> <p>In Taiwan, the comments were warmly received but confusion was evident, with varied interpretations over whether they signalled a change in policy, were a tricky bit of diplomatic speak, or a gaffe.</p> <p>Beijing considers Taiwan to be a province of China, and while its leader, Xi Jinping, has said he hopes to “unify” the island peacefully, he has not ruled out taking it by force. Taiwan’s current leader says it is already a sovereign nation and it has no desire for conflict.</p> <p>The US formally recognises Beijing, but has strong informal relations with Taiwan and legislated obligations to provide it with the means to defend itself. However, the US has also for decades operated a policy of “strategic ambiguity” where it refuses to detail if it would come to Taiwan’s aid, in order to deter both sides from provocative action. It was this policy that some believed Biden was moving away from.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>This week was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/biden-taiwan-china-us-defence\">not the first time</a> that off-the-cuff remarks from a US president have prompted speculation about major changes to Taiwan-related policies, and Biden has now done so at least three times.</p> <p>In Taiwan, the foreign ministry thanked Biden for “reaffirming their rock-hard commitment to Taiwan” and publicly affirmed the White House stance that policies were unchanged. Perhaps signalling the concern with which the comments were seen, Taiwan’s usually deeply divided legislators spoke cautiously on the topic, although some from both sides of the aisle believed the comments did signal Biden was moving towards clarity.</p> <p>Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund, said Taiwan’s government “focuses on the president’s declaration that he will defend Taiwan, which they welcome because it provides reassurance to their public and boosts support for the ruling party. They ignore the rest”.</p> <p>Local headlines praised the president’s remarks, with many taking the angle as either a commitment to use force in defence of Taiwan, or that the president was signalling a move towards clearer commitments.</p> <p>“It is impossible that he said the wrong thing again,” said Akio Yaita, a Japanese journalist and frequent commentator in Taiwanese media. Yaitia described the White House’s clarifications as a tactic to “save some face for China”, and concluded the US had adjusted its policy on assisting Taiwan.</p> <p>Wen-ti Sung, an expert on Taiwan issues at the Australian National University, told the Taiwanese outlet UDN that Biden was trying to “have both fish and bear paws”, with a public “slip of the tongue” and clarifications that “still give the impression that the United States has strengthened its determination to have a clear strategic goal without incurring the cost of [strategic] clarity”.</p> <p>Apple Daily was among outlets to characterise his comments as a gaffe, describing the White House as repeatedly having to “put out fires” after Biden mentions Taiwan. Chao Shao-kang, a Taiwanese media personality and Kuomintang member, suggested that Taiwan should ask the US state department to write down Biden’s promise on a piece of paper so he couldn’t change his mind.</p> <p>On the streets, reactions among the public were equally varied.</p> <p>Ryan Lee, a 26-year-old sales worker in Taiwan’s vital semiconductor industry, believed Biden was deliberately testing China’s response.</p> <p>“As a Taiwanese male who is trained for the armed forces, I’m not worried that such a statement will affect the situation in the Taiwan Strait,” he said. “What is really likely to cause war is an affirmative and extreme declaration or guarantee, not by exploring the Chinese government’s response through media Q&amp;A.”</p> <p>Ms Chu, a Taiwanese student at Yale University, said Taiwan was treated as a “bargaining chip” between the US and China. “I’m not sure if his swaying statement is a tactic in itself or just because he loves to give unscripted speeches. And I tend to be more worried because China is very easy to get irritated.”</p> <p>Mrs Lai, a 34-year-old housewife, believed it was diplomatic strategy. “Saying the so-called policy has not changed may be just sales talk. But I still don’t think that when Taiwan is attacked, we can definitely count on the help of the United States.”</p> <p>Kwei-bo Huang, a professor of diplomacy at the National Chengchi University and a former deputy secretary general of the modern KMT, said he feared the confusion could escalate hostilities with China, including among Chinese people.</p> <p>“Patriotism and nationalism in China is aroused every time Biden [either] misspeaks or says something on purpose that irritates the Chinese authorities,” he said.</p> <p>Huang hoped the post-remarks clarification would at least discourage Chinese officials from issuing more inflammatory statements, but on Tuesday, the foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin again spoke at length against the US and Taiwan.</p> <p>“No forces, the US included, can hold back the Chinese people’s endeavour to reunify the nation,” said Wang. “I’d like to advise the US to listen to a well-known Chinese song with these lyrics: ‘For our friends, we have fine wine. For jackals or wolves, we welcome with shotguns.’”</p> <p>On Tuesday Russian and Chinese military also held joint exercises near Japanese and South Korea air defence zones, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/russian-chinese-jets-conducted-joint-patrol-moscow-says-2022-05-24/\">interpreted by some as a provocation</a> on the last day of Biden’s Asia trip.</p> <p>Echoing Glaser’s calls for greater clarity and less confusion, Huang said the US often saw cross-strait tensions through a US-centric prism, and that Taipei needed to make it clear to the US that Taiwan was in a difficult position.</p> <p>“We like to maintain a robust relationship with the US and keep peace with Beijing, but we don’t want to get involved in any major conflict. This needs to be made clear to US officials,” he said. “You have to put yourself in Taiwan’s shoes, we’re right in front of mainland China, we have to deal with it.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin</em><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/25/walmart-juneteenth-ice-cream","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T15:31:33Z","webTitle":"Walmart apologizes for selling Juneteenth-themed ice cream","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/walmart-juneteenth-ice-cream","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/25/walmart-juneteenth-ice-cream","fields":{"headline":"Walmart apologizes for selling Juneteenth-themed ice cream","trailText":"Company drew outrage with its ice cream, which was part of an assortment of other Juneteenth-themed items including shirts and decorations","body":"<p>Walmart has apologized for selling Juneteenth-themed ice cream.</p> <p>The multinational company offered an apology on Tuesday amid <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roywoodjr/status/1528811912271695876\">outrage</a> over its Celebration Edition: Juneteenth Ice Cream, a red velvet and cheesecake-flavored dessert sold under its Great Value label,<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/24/business-food/walmart-juneteenth-ice-cream/index.html\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.foxla.com/news/walmart-pulls-juneteenth-ice-cream-after-backlash-we-sincerely-apologize\">media outlets reported</a>.</p> <p>A label on the ice cream pint read: “Share and celebrate African American culture, emancipation and enduring hope.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/19/us-juneteenth-mark-celebrations-federal-holiday\">Juneteenth</a>, celebrated on 19 June, commemorates the emancipation of enslaved people.

The defeat against the world No 47 means that after five months of the season, Raducanu moves on to the grass court swing with just two wins against top-50 players this year, an indication that higher-ranked opponents are slowly beginning to target the weaknesses in her game.

In the early exchanges, Sasnovich fed Raducanu’s backhand too frequently and she paid a significant price. Raducanu broke serve first with a spectacular return game at 2-2, which included a series of angled backhand cross-court winners, before serving well under pressure to take the set.</p> <p>In four of her losses this year, Raducanu won the first set and she has dropped the second set in another three of her wins. Throughout the year, she has continually lost intensity after a struggle with her serve, and a similar scenario played out on Wednesday. As Raducanu dipped, Sasnovich, a former top-30 player enjoying a positive year, took control of the baseline. By the end of the second set, she was teeing off on all returns and burying winners at will.</p> <p>As Sasnovich struck an absurd 19 winners to just four unforced errors in the second set, the remaining question was whether Raducanu could push her out of her comfort zone. Raducanu had one chance at 1-1 as she generated five break points but as they evaded her, the window closed. Raducanu’s forehand haemorrhaged errors throughout the set while often resorting to loopy, weak topspin that Sasnovich ate up. In the end, Raducanu’s positive clay-court season ended abruptly with two feeble sets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0b126467ebea51423973a2f9843df67c0de14b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0b126467ebea51423973a2f9843df67c0de14b6/0_91_4225_2535/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Raducanu: “Certain things I’m working on on the practice court that are paying off, they don’t show immediately”\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Raducanu: “Certain things I’m working on on the practice court that are paying off, they don’t show immediately”</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TPN/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Raducanu’s obvious disappointment was lined with positivity later on. After a year filled with injury niggles, including a back injury at the Italian Open two weeks ago that left her not entirely sure of her presence in Paris, perhaps the most positive outcome is that Raducanu felt physically good after two three set matches.</p> <p>“I’m quite happy with the progress that I’m making. I do feel like I’m playing some pretty good tennis and on the practice court I’m definitely working,” she said. “Certain things I’m working on on the practice court that are paying off, they don’t show immediately. There is a little time lag between when they will actually produce results on a live situation. I’m definitely getting there.”</p> <p>Raducanu said at the beginning of the tournament that, as she had not played a professional match on clay before this season, her expectations about how her game would adapt to the surface were low. After reaching a quarter-final in Stuttgart and winning a couple of matches in Madrid, she finishes her first clay season confident that she can be a good player on the surface in the future.</p> <p>“I think that I definitely got stronger as the clay season went on,” Raducanu said. “It just takes a lot more to win the point on this surface, and you hit a ball flat, [it] doesn’t really do that much. I definitely learnt when to use the shape [top spin]. I still got quite a long way to go on this surface, but overall, I would say I definitely had a good first experience on the clay.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\">  <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shortly after Raducanu’s defeat, she was joined by last year’s semi-finalist Maria Sakkari, the fourth seed, who was defeated 7-6 (5), 7-6 (4) by the unseeded Karolina Muchova.</p> <p>Although it is an upset by ranking, Muchova is returning from injury after reaching the 2021 Australian Open semi-final and she was ranked in the top 20 last year.

I’ve worked in four state secondary schools in England over the last decade, and in each one the waiting list for students to see an in-school mental health nurse – if there is one at all – has been months’ long. Students simply don’t bother turning to in-school services for help.</p> <p>Students often turn to teachers and support staff in their hour of need. Of course, we do our very best, but with staff shortages, funding cuts and teacher burnout, there simply aren’t the bodies required to support students in the way they need and deserve. I, like so many colleagues, never resent being the person that students turn to, but teachers are not mental health professionals.

This is something we’ve long campaigned for. Many children and young people are in distress, but aren’t always able to access timely support from local NHS services. Funded school counselling is vital now to ease the strain on those services, to support our children and young people before they reach crisis point, and to help the many more who may be suffering in silence.</p> <p>We recently surveyed school staff about the impact of school counselling, with 86% saying it’s helped improve attendance, 73% saying it’s helped improve students’ behaviour, and 72% saying it’s helped improve students’ academic attainment.</p> <p>School counselling is a non-stigmatising and effective form of early intervention for reducing psychological distress. It has a positive effect on confidence, resilience, sense of self-worth, family relationships, friendships, school attendance and academic achievement.

Originally conceived with a view to giving clubs from lesser-ranked leagues around the continent a chance to play in Europe, Tin Pot has done exactly that, even if the somewhat anomalous presence of numerous comparative heavyweights from Europe’s Big Five top flights somewhat kiboshed the chances of anyone from one of those lesser leagues winning the trophy.</p> <p>Having made the inaugural final, Roma more or less sum up everything that is right and wrong about the tournament, what with José Mourinho’s side suffering the acute embarrassment of losing not just once, but twice to Bodø/Glimt from the Arctic Circle, but still surviving to make it to Wednesday’s decider, where they will play Feyenoord, who have just finished third in the Eredivisie.

It’s the team’s moment, not the moment of an individual.” While he was once fabled for a magic touch that appeared to have deserted him during recent spells at Manchester United, Tottenham and Roma, victory would present Mourinho with an opportunity to flick Vs in the direction of his many critics, even if it does come in a tournament he would almost certainly treat with outright disdain if any other big-name manager won it. “I don’t believe in magical potions, I don’t believe in magical spells,” he said, revealing a hitherto unseen anti-Dumbledore stance. “There’s nothing special to be done, just us to be us as a team. For me, no matter how the final ends, this is a positive season for us.”</p> <p>A comparatively unsuccessful novice, opposite number Arne Slot is all too familiar with Mourinho’s various successes going into the final, but says his Feyenoord players must worry about Roma, rather than their manager’s reputation. “His CV makes you wary of his team,” he tooted. “He is known for winning many finals. But we mainly have to focus on his team, the tactics and the different ways they play. We shouldn’t pay too much attention to the fact that he has such an impressive track record in finals.” They shouldn’t, but if that record improves in Albania with the acquisition of Tin Pot, we can be sure a certain somebody else will turn it into an extremely big deal.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“This is agony, absolute agony.

A new era at Stamford Bridge can officially begin after Roman Abramovich agreed to the terms for the sale to a consortium led by Todd Boehly, part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team.</p> \n<p>Boehly’s group is determined to hit the ground running and intends to show Tuchel its ambition is to help Chelsea catch Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the Premier League.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/todd-boehly-chelsea-vision-glossy-spectacle-ruthless-profit\">Todd Boehly’s vision for Chelsea? Glossy spectacle and ruthless profit | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Chelsea, who will prioritise signings in defence before addressing other areas, have been in limbo for three months. They were plunged into uncertainty when Abramovich was hit with sanctions after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Tuchel has warned that Chelsea, who have been operating under a restrictive licence, will be behind their rivals when the transfer window opens.</p> \n<p>But the club can now start to plan their business after the government announced it would issue a licence for the sale and said it was satisfied none of the proceeds would go to Abramovich or any other sanctioned individuals. The takeover was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/24/premier-league-approves-chelsea-takeover-by-todd-boehly-consortium-roman-abramovich\" title=\"\">approved by the Premier League</a> on Tuesday and the final step is for Portugal and the European Commission to give approval because Abramovich, the 55-year-old Israeli-Russian oligarch, also has a Portuguese passport.</p> \n<p>Chelsea experienced unprecedented success during Abramovich’s 19-year ownership and the approach is likely to be different under Boehly’s leadership. Tuchel has warned they must act decisively and needs to repair his defence after losing Antonio Rüdiger to Real Madrid and Andreas Christensen to Barcelona, who also want Marcos Alonso and César Azpilicueta. The first signing is expected to be the Sevilla centre-back Jules Koundé, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jul/29/chelsea-sevilla-pay-more-jules-kounde-west-ham-kurt-zouma\" title=\"\">missed out on a move</a> to Stamford Bridge last summer, and they are also interested in RB Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol.</p> \n<p>Koundé, a 23-year-old France international, can play as a right centre-back and could be available for £50m. Gvardiol, a highly rated 20-year-old Croat, would be a replacement for Rüdiger because he can play on the left of a back three. Other names on Chelsea’s shortlist include Villarreal’s Pau Torres and Atlético Madrid’s José María Giménez. They are also huge admirers of Torino’s Gleison Bremer, though Internazionale are favourites to sign the 25-year-old Brazilian. Tottenham are another possible destination for Bremer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/chelsea-todd-boehly-takeover-425bn-roman-abramovich-russia-ukraine\">Twists, turns and tight deadlines: how Boehly’s Chelsea deal was done | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tuchel will also look at strengthening his midfield. Conor Gallagher will be given a chance to impress after a successful loan at Crystal Palace but there are doubts over N’Golo Kanté and Jorginho, both of whom are out of contract next year. Jorginho is a target for Juventus.</p> \n<p>Chelsea are unlikely to be able to afford West Ham’s £150m asking price for Declan Rice, who is a target for Tuchel, and are set to miss out on Monaco’s Aurélien Tchouaméni to Real Madrid.</p> \n<p>Much will depend on how much Chelsea can raise through sales. Kepa Arrizabalaga, the No 2 goalkeeper, is available for the right price and Tuchel’s hopes of upgrading his attack could rest on whether buyers are found for Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic, who has two years on his deal. Talks will also be held with Romelu Lukaku over the £97.5m forward’s future.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b167bb7ff60286a6e9cb428deb303340149692cc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b167bb7ff60286a6e9cb428deb303340149692cc/609_46_3388_2033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling is among the attacking players being monitored by Chelsea.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chelsea’s attack has lacked consistency and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/21/thomas-tuchel-considering-signing-new-forwards-for-chelsea-this-summer\" title=\"\">Tuchel wants new forwards</a>. He is monitoring Raheem Sterling, who has a year remaining on his deal at City and could seek a new challenge. There is interest too in Christopher Nkunku, although it will be hard to convince RB Leipzig to sell the prolific 24-year-old this summer. Lille’s Jonathan David, Benfica’s Darwin Núñez and Barcelona’s Ousmane Dembélé, who is out of contract, are other targets. Tuchel would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/chelsea-have-robert-lewandowski-on-radar-despite-favoured-barcelona-move\" title=\"\">love to sign Robert Lewandowski</a> but the Bayern Munich striker wants to join Barcelona.</p> \n<p>Chelsea could end up needing to raise money by selling their 20-year-old forward Armando Broja, a key target for West Ham. The owners will look to hand improved contracts to Mason Mount, Reece James and Édouard Mendy.</p> \n<p>It remains to be seen whether Bruce Buck, the chairman, and the director Marina Granovskaia remain at the club. They are close to Abramovich and played a key role in the sale, won by Boehly’s group after a fraught process.</p> \n<p>The American’s fellow investors include fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter, the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, the British property developer Jonathan Goldstein and the US investment firm Clearlake Capital. Boehly will be the controlling owner but Clearlake is taking a majority stake. The Tory peer and Times columnist Daniel Finkelstein and celebrity publicist Barbara Charone will become non-executive directors.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Another task for Boehly will be to upgrade Stamford Bridge. Chelsea’s ground has a 42,000 capacity and could stop them from competing financially with their rivals.</p> \n<p>The club’s sale will follow a two-step process that will see the initial £2.5bn held in an escrow account until the government is satisfied the funds will go to a charity for victims of the war in Ukraine. Boehly’s group has committed to invest a further £1.75bn in the club’s infrastructure.</p> \n<p>Crucially Abramovich agreed to legally binding guarantees allowing his £1.6bn loans to Chelsea to go into a frozen account under government control.

I’ve spoken to several of the CEOs and they want to be part of it. So medicines will be available I hope but it’s not going to be enough.

The prime minister’s refusal to resign following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-law-breaking-no-10-parties-published-boris-johnson\">excoriating Sue Gray report</a> was evidence, he said, that the Conservative leadership was “rotten to the core”.</p> <p>Pat Spawforth, who has voted Tory in most elections since she was 18, said she would not back the party in the forthcoming Wakefield byelection, which was triggered by the resignation of Imran Ahmad Khan after he was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Peter, who has always voted Conservative, said he was undecided.</p> <p>“Boris was in charge; he should have stopped it. He should go,” said Pat. “He consistently seems to twist the truth, shall we say. That’s not how we’ve been brought up and it’s not what I approve of.”</p> <p>The Conservatives are doomed if the views of these two party loyalists are reflected across Wakefield on 23 June.

He’s a full-class berk.”</p> <p>Several voters said they were sick of hearing about the lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. Some also expressed fatigue with the early days of the byelection campaign.</p> <p>Tidying up at Karpaty bakery, Anna Zach said it was obvious the prime minister should step down. “I’m disappointed.

Boris Johnson should have just admitted what had been going on. Instead it’s been all obfuscation and prevarication. His relationship with the truth is tenuous, to say to the least.”</p> <p>But Page, a former farmer and now a self-employed countryside contractor in his 60s, said he could not see who could take over from Johnson. “He’s surrounded by useless yes men. I don’t know who’d be better.”</p> <p>Nneka, 18, a college student, said she was disgusted by the Partygate scandal. “While the rest of us were following the rules, they were having a good time. They should be role models. They have failed and Johnson should resign.”</p> <p>One of the elements of the Gray report that hit home for Nneka was the poor treatment of cleaners and security staff. “That’s terrible.

Hannah Kitching, a Lib Dem councillor from South Yorkshire who was spending her holiday on the campaign trail, said she had knocked on more than 200 doors.</p> <p>“We’re finding a lot of discontent, disappointment, anger. People are really angry and hurt that Boris Johnson was breaking lockdown rules while they were doing everything they could to follow them.”</p> <p>At the Independent Coffee Trader cafe, the owner, Leigh Parker, said she usually voted Tory but wasn’t sure who she would opt for in next month’s byelection. “I’m on the fence at the moment,” she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, she added that she was fed up with hearing about Partygate. “I’m ready to move on,” she said.

So much so, that at times it felt as if the meeting was taking place not in May 2022 but in July 1914 or August 1939, times past when the world has stood on the brink of the precipice.</p> <p>The historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/10/shutdown-by-adam-tooze-review-how-covid-shook-the-world-economy\">Adam Tooze</a> said: “The war dominates everything. The nuclear escalation risk is not being priced in. This doesn’t feel like cold war. It’s hard to think of a time during the cold war when the US openly announced its policy was to eliminate the capacity of Russia to take independent military action.”</p> <p>Similar sentiments were expressed by a senior policymaker who pointed out that a global pandemic had been unthinkable in early 2020, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/28/6-january-capitol-attack-trump-neofascism-coup-republicans\">near-coup</a> in Washington incited by Donald Trump had been unthinkable in January 2021 and a war between Russia and Ukraine had been unthinkable at the start of 2022. “Why should we think the unthinkable ended with the start of the war?”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/may/24/davos-day-2-world-food-crisis-imf-ec-nato-ukraine-pandemic-live-update?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with:block-628ca7328f08b48a6e742f56\">Jens Stoltenberg</a>, the secretary general of Nato, said the west’s military build-up in eastern Europe was designed to deter Vladimir Putin rather than provoke him, but even if Russia resists the temptation to push the nuclear button it has other ways to escalate the conflict.</p> <p>Solidarity with Ukraine was total. In previous years, one of the hottest ticket at Davos was an invite to the champagne and caviar bashes thrown at the Russia House on the Promenade. This year, no Russians were invited and the party premises became the “Russia War Crimes House”, where Ukraine displayed evidence of atrocities committed since the start of the invasion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"523cd4ca6b6c4b7dc1406635dec2f59ed688e082\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/523cd4ca6b6c4b7dc1406635dec2f59ed688e082/0_164_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This year no Russians were invited, with Russia House becoming the ‘Russia War Crimes House’.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No Russians were invited this year, with Russia House becoming the ‘Russia War Crimes House’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But solidarity with Ukraine comes at a cost, as was clear from many of the sessions. It was taken as read that the war would be bad for the global economy, with the only dispute about exactly how bad.

But the study shows the counterintuitive nature of these creatures, and has implications for other organisms that may not look cool but have special abilities.</p> <p>“This is a five-gram salamander that climbs the world’s highest trees and isn’t afraid to take a leap of faith,” said Brown.</p> <p>Scientists knew before that wandering salamanders lived in redwoods, and in dense numbers – sometimes 30 or 40 individuals in the crown of one tree.</p> <p>The amphibians are lungless: they breathe through their skin and the tissue surrounding their mouth. The forest’s damp fern mats in the canopy helped prevent them from drying out, and offer a safe haven.</p> <p>In 2020, Brown and colleagues had published a detailed description of how the salamanders jump. Unlike other species, they used two feet instead of one. They don’t take off as quickly in a horizontal way, hinting at something: jumping with less power might be contributing to stability after the jump, said Brown. “It’s better to be in control after the jump than to jump really powerfully.”</p> <p>After all, if you’re going to jump from the world’s tallest trees, you’ll need to parachute and glide.</p> <p>To test their skydiving abilities, Brown put the five-inch-long salamanders into tiny wind tunnels – the same type you might see at an indoor skydiving park, just in a salamander’s size. And just like human skydivers, the salamanders moved their bodies and limbs to slow their descent, successfully slowing their velocity by 10%, the researchers found.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36e6bdf4733cc597fb6f1e3e8420524770e82c15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36e6bdf4733cc597fb6f1e3e8420524770e82c15/0_32_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘This is a five-gram salamander that climbs the world’s highest trees and isn’t afraid to take a leap of faith.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘This is a five-gram salamander that climbs the world’s highest trees and isn’t afraid to take a leap of faith.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John P Clare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They dropped three other species of salamanders into the wind tunnels. The wandering salamanders, Brown says, “slowed themselves down the best”. They also pumped their tails and moved their limbs to change direction horizontally.</p> <p>Why did the species evolve this special trick, since salamanders don’t seem to be very aerodynamic or prone to fly? Because salamanders can’t answer that question themselves, scientists have to use what we know about the ecosystem and come up with hypotheses to test, Brown said.</p> <p>One idea is that they use jumping and dropping to quickly escape predation. In the lab, just tickling a wandering salamander’s tail will cause it to jump.</p> <p>Another idea is that the salamanders’ moves are a form of locomotion – an elevator up and down the forest canopy. Brown thinks most of the jumps take place from tree to tree 40 to 80 feet above the ground – far enough where a fall might not be fatal, but it would put a salamander in danger during a long trek home. Another study showed it would take the salamanders hours to days to get back up to the crown from the ground. Pacific giant salamanders stalk the forest floor and prey on the wanderers, while all their resources – food, dampness, mates – would be far up in the labyrinth of mats and ferns. So jumping would be an easy way to get around. “It’s more efficient and minimizes the risks,” said Brown. “Ultimately we think the jumps are a prevention for falling all the way to the forest floor.”</p> <p>The researchers now want to assess in more detail how the salamanders sail through the air in their natural environment, at the tops of trees. They are using ladders to drop them a few meters outdoors paired with onsite observations from up to 200 feet high to test this behavior in the field. They are also taking the glide patterns observed in the lab and overlaying them with maps of redwood crowns and salamander locations to better visualize the effectiveness of gliding at steep angles in their habitat.</p> <p>The study has shown that salamanders can move their bodies in completely unexpected ways – turning, parachuting, gliding to the next branch. “The level of control is kind of exceptional, so that’s exciting,” he said. “This is an animal that can leap around with dexterity to navigate its habitat … and they just might surprise you.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/25/only-one-bathing-river-spot-around-oxford-has-bacteria-within-safe-levels-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T14:29:02Z","webTitle":"Only one bathing river spot around Oxford has bacteria within safe levels, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/25/only-one-bathing-river-spot-around-oxford-has-bacteria-within-safe-levels-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/25/only-one-bathing-river-spot-around-oxford-has-bacteria-within-safe-levels-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Only one bathing river spot around Oxford has bacteria within safe levels, study finds","trailText":"Other seven locations popular with locals have high concentrations of harmful bacteria due to sewage and livestock","body":"<p>Only one popular river spot for bathing and water sports in and around Oxford has bacteria within safe levels, a survey by a campaign group has found.</p> <p>The other seven locations in rivers which are regularly used by swimmers, punters, rowers and kayakers, were found to have concentrations of harmful bacteria one and a half to three times above recommended safe levels, a study by the Oxford Rivers Project funded by Thames Water has found.</p> <p>The study concluded that at most of these locations the pollution was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/13/sewage-dumps-into-english-rivers-widespread-criminal-inquiry-suspects\">from sewage</a>, although some locations were also affected by livestock.</p> <p>Claire Robertson, Thames21’s Oxford rivers project officer, said: “These results confirm what we expected to find: that levels of bacteria at our river recreation sites are higher than they should be.

Experts said the move could be a “gamechanger” for the nascent industry.</p> <p>The US company Good Meat said the bioreactors would grow more than 13,000 tonnes of chicken and beef a year. It will use cells taken from cell banks or eggs, so the meat will not require the slaughter of any livestock.</p> <p>There are about 170 companies around the world working on cultured meat, but Good Meat is the only company to have gained regulatory approval to sell its product to the public. It began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/02/no-kill-lab-grown-meat-to-go-on-sale-for-first-time\">serving cultivated chicken in Singapore</a> in December 2020.</p> <p>Cattle, chicken and other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">livestock have a huge environmental impact</a> due to methane emissions, the destruction of forests and water use.

Proponents of cultivated meat say it can provide the same taste and feel as conventional meat but with a far smaller environmental impact.</p> <p>The creation of Good Meat’s 10 new bioreactors is under way, the company says, each of which has a capacity of 250,000 litres and will stand four storeys tall, far bigger than any constructed to date. The US site for the facility is due to be finalised within three months and operational in late 2024, reaching 11,800 tonnes a year by 2026 and 13,700 tonnes by 2030.</p> <p>The bioreactors are being manufactured as part of an agreement with ABEC, a leading bioprocess equipment manufacturer, which is also making a 6,000-litre bioreactor for Good Meat’s Singapore site – this is scheduled to begin production in early 2023 and will itself be the biggest cultured meat bioreactor installed to date.</p> <p>“I think our grandchildren are going to ask us about why we ate meat from slaughtered animals back in 2022,” said Josh Tetrick, the chief executive of Good Meat’s parent company, Eat Just.</p> <p>“Cultivated meat matters because it will enable us to eat meat without all the harm, without bulldozing forests, without the need to slaughter an animal, without the need to use antibiotics, without accelerating zoonotic diseases.</p> <p>“The bioreactors will be far and away the largest, not only in the cultivated meat industry, but in the biopharma industry too. So the design and engineering challenges are significant, the capital investments are significant and the potential to take another step toward shifting society away from slaughtered meat is significant.”</p> <p>One issue will be to ensure that the meat cells grow as well in large reactors as they do in the smaller ones used so far.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/worlds-first-lab-grown-beef-steak-revealed-but-the-taste-needs-work\">World’s first lab-grown steak revealed – but the taste needs work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cultivated meat has not yet been approved for sale by the US Food and Drug Administration. “We’ve submitted our application,” said Tetrick. “We’ve found the agency to be fully engaged, asking all the questions you’d expect, from cell identification to final product. We’d prefer not to try to predict if and when [approval] will occur.” Tetrick also said the company had produced a cell growth serum that does not require the use of bovine foetuses, which were previously widely used.</p> <p>Another cultivated meat company, <a href=\"https://upsidefoods.com/upside-series-c-fundraising-round/\">Upside Foods, raised $400m</a> in April, in part to fund a commercial-scale facility to produce thousands of tonnes of meat a year. It has not yet chosen the size of the bioreactors. “We honestly don’t even know what the limits are,” <a href=\"https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2022/04/21/cultivated-meat-upside-foods-closes-400m-series-c-round-to-support-commercial-scale-plant-with-production-capacity-of-tens-of-millions-of-pounds\">said Amy Chen</a>, the chief operating officer at Upside Foods. “But we will make some final decisions around the size of the cultivators as it gets closer to the construction date.”</p> <p>The taste of the cultivated meat has been key in raising investment, Chen said. “Before I agreed to come on, I had to try the meat. I had that first bite and realised that it was simultaneously one of the most unremarkable things and one of the most remarkable things I’ve ever eaten. It’s just meat.”</p> <p>Other companies with facilities for cultivated meat include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/04/no-kill-lab-grown-chicken-burger-restaurant-israel\">SuperMeat</a>, <a href=\"https://mosameat.com/\">Mosa Meat</a>, <a href=\"https://future-meat.com/\">Future Meat Technologies</a> and the seafood producers <a href=\"https://www.wildtypefoods.com/\">Wildtype</a> and <a href=\"https://shiokmeats.com/\">Shiok Meats</a>.

I realise this is a peculiar boast, but in case you’re wondering – hypochondria, a legitimate anxiety disorder in itself – isn’t among my diagnoses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7345be46b31260bf1b64e4182bc5b0fc08d1a348\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7345be46b31260bf1b64e4182bc5b0fc08d1a348/407_418_2237_2251/994.jpg\" alt=\"Robyn Wilder\" width=\"994\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My first was agoraphobia with panic disorder, which came for me unexpectedly when I was 20, fresh out of university, and enjoying life as a guitar-wielding, purple-haired party girl (the home counties Courtney Love, only browner and more Sloaney). Suddenly, being in any enclosed public space – pubs, cinemas, train stations – would plunge me into visceral, suffocating episodes of vertigo. My stomach would spin, my vision turn dark at the edges, and I’d hurry for the safety of home. Soon I was experiencing these “episodes”, which I later learned were panic attacks, in even familiar locations. My local pub. My best friend’s living room.</p> <p>By the time I was diagnosed, I was already helplessly housebound, couldn’t sleep, and had lost a third of my body weight.</p> <p>Becoming a shut-in took a matter of weeks. My recovery, however, would take four years, one springer spaniel, a career change, some not-very-helpful analytical psychotherapy, and the gruelling but effective daily practice of pushing my boundaries with desensitisation therapy, in order to move around freely in the world again.</p> <p>When I was able, I moved to London to restart my life. Though the agoraphobia subsided, anxiety remained an issue. Subsequent diagnoses included generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety, both perinatal and postnatal anxiety, plus two lots of PTSD as a result of two emergency C-sections.</p> <p>Finally, I was coping with work, parenting and the creeping dread of 2020’s first lockdown until my mother died of Covid, triggering my agoraphobia to return after 20 years in remission, and I developed a compulsive skin-picking disorder to boot.</p> <p>So what works for me? I have learned that the wrong therapy can harm you. I’ve never got on with therapist-ordained CBT or mindfulness exercises, which it transpires can actively harm people with ADHD and PTSD. Now I ask for proof that new therapists are informed about all my conditions. I can’t believe it took a pandemic to show me that accessing therapy from home via Zoom is more helpful for agoraphobics.</p> <p>Chronic anxiety and agoraphobia recovery means I’ve been living at Defcon 1 for ever, but I know that it is essential to establish my baseline comfort level. Rest, reading, favourite bands – these are all foreign concepts. Instead, I’m starting with macro-level pleasures, noting down the smallest things that give me joy, and building on them. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/03/empty-promises-marie-kondo-craze-for-minimalism\" title=\"\">Marie Kondo is not</a> among them.</p> <p><em>• Reasons to be Fearful by Robyn Wilder will be published by Ebury Books.</em></p> <h2>Mara Wilson</h2> <p>I’ve experienced all kinds of anxiety, from heart-pounding, nauseating panic attacks, to the incapacitating self-doubt of OCD, to low-level, background nervousness. Some of my earliest childhood memories involve me feeling nervous or frightened for no reason. My anxiety is a part of me, one that I’ve had to learn to deal with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1c55d5ecb84a429e07ee83d622e478c30650635d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c55d5ecb84a429e07ee83d622e478c30650635d/0_0_1610_2163/744.jpg\" alt=\"Mara Wilson\" width=\"744\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I found that medication helped with my OCD, while talking therapy and mindfulness have helped with panic attacks and generalised anxiety. I’d also recommend anxiety workbooks. <a href=\"https://www.anxietycoach.com/panic-attacks-help.html\" title=\"\">The Panic Attacks Workbook</a> by Dr David Carbonell is a great resource – it taught me breathing exercises, such as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vF4H7i-XQiA\" title=\"\">the “belly breathing” exercise</a>, which I use to manage my anxiety.</p> <p>I also try to ground myself by taking stock of my surroundings: I will look around and name three things I can see, then three things I can hear, and then three things I can feel. It’s useful for taking me out of my own head and bringing me back into the present moment.</p> <p>I’m not sure who I’d be if I weren’t anxious – and it is important to remember that almost everyone deals with anxiety at some point in their life. There’s no shame in getting professional help, just as you wouldn’t feel ashamed about getting treatment for asthma or a broken arm. Different treatments work better for different people; so I would advise anyone struggling with anxiety not to be discouraged if one doesn’t take straight away.</p> <p>Go easy on yourself: setting boundaries and providing structure are often important, but so is treating yourself with compassion, forgiveness and understanding.</p> <p><em>• <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/17/being-cute-mara-wilson-growing-up-hollywood\" title=\"\">Mara Wilson</a> is an actor and mental health advocate.</em> <em>As told to Leah Harper.</em></p> <h2>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett</h2> <p>I’m not claiming that lavender oil is by any means a cure, but when it felt that the world was conspiring in a thousand different ways to kill me and everyone I loved, grounding techniques really helped bring me back to reality. PTSD – which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/20/feel-might-die-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd\" title=\"\">I developed</a> after I was assaulted as a student and which returned in 2015 when I was in Paris during the Bataclan attack – is like a form of time travel. So a smell like lavender can help restore you to the present. As can sitting on the floor, which gets you some funny looks, though in the midst of a panic attack it’s the least of your worries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8ea1dff5a01358800205857549d69ca92221ef49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ea1dff5a01358800205857549d69ca92221ef49/1029_0_3361_3840/875.jpg\" alt=\"Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett\" width=\"875\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The usual recommendations – sleep, yoga, meditation, CBT, affirmations – help, of course, but so does a cold martini, Bruce Springsteen played loud, costume dramas, an absorbing book. Getting a cat has been a gamechanger. She has been very magnanimous about allowing me to cry into her fur on occasion.</p> <p>When things are really, really bad, I read lots of poetry. The Staying Alive anthologies have given me so much comfort over the years. I also love the work of Ada Limón, particularly the poem Instructions on Not Giving Up<em>. </em>It reminds me that spring is always just around the corner: “A return / to the strange idea of continuous living despite / the mess of us, the hurt, the empty.”</p> <p>I try to switch off from the news and social media. Tricky but worth the effort. I am not brave enough for true cold water swimming, but a fair-weather dip on Hampstead Heath does work wonders. My mother’s philosophy of buying yourself a small present – a lipstick if you’re feeling flush, a chocolate bar if you’re not – has got me through some of the bluest of days.</p> <p>Of course, all of these tricks mean nothing without the therapy and medication that has mostly cured me. Twice. NHS trauma-focused CBT provided me with tools that I still use now, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/04/have-a-child-or-not-is-a-huge-decision-so-why-is-there-so-little-discussion-of-it\" title=\"\">I embark upon parenthood</a> and confront all the anxiety that that brings. It allows me to take a step back when my fears for the baby seem to be drowning me.</p> <p>Owing to a postcode lottery I was seen quickly, by two brilliant psychologists, and I’m now receiving some postnatal support – despite my fears, I’m doing well. It saddens me that not everyone is so lucky. Lavender oil can only get you so far – access to treatment and medication is what matters most of all.</p> <p><em>• The Tyranny of Lost Things by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is published by Sandstone Press (£8.99).</em></p> <h2>David Adam</h2> <p>I manage my anxiety with a combination of drugs, therapy, and decades of bitter experience. </p> <p>For 30 years I have suffered from OCD, which brings with it regular acute bouts of saturated terror. Not about whether my LPs are correctly filed in alphabetical order or if my jars of food are lined up neatly on their shelves, as some wildly wrong stereotypes of OCD would have it, but of ways that I may have contracted HIV. Blame the 1980s and the public information campaigns that harnessed fear as the best route to get people to change their behaviour to avoid what was then portrayed as a one-way street to a futile life and early death.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a64fa4c5e0e95b53c3ca55f75bfc08abd7660ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a64fa4c5e0e95b53c3ca55f75bfc08abd7660ac/0_550_4000_4678/855.jpg\" alt=\"David Adam\" width=\"855\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Adam</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wrote a book about the experience<em>, </em>The Man Who Couldn’t Stop, and get weekly emails from strangers around the world who are either amazed that someone else has the same irrational thoughts and fears about HIV as they do, or amazed that I managed to find and receive effective treatment.</p> <p>The treatment is where the drugs and therapy come in. The standard NHS treatment for OCD is a high dose of an antidepressant and a course of CBT. I started to take 200mg a day of sertraline (similar to Prozac) almost a decade ago, and I have just picked up my latest prescription. It’s not clear how the drugs work, but I think they do. They seem to make the thoughts less sticky, easier to slip away to be replaced by something less worrying. How long will I take the pills for? I don’t know. What gets you well keeps you well, my psychiatrist says.</p> <p>The CBT was almost a decade ago as well, but I still draw on its lessons every day. The problem with OCD is that we have our own way to deal with the anxiety prompted by the thoughts – we carry out compulsive behaviours, in my case to reassure and convince, which give us a short-term benefit, but only seeds future obsessions. Managing my anxiety means not taking that short-cut, resisting the pull of the compulsion and – paradoxically – letting the anxiety build and then decay naturally.</p> <p>It works, but I’m not sure it’s got any easier over the years.</p> <p><em>• The Man Who Couldn’t Stop by David Adam is published by Picador (£9.99).</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"travel/2022/may/25/dervla-murphy-an-appreciation-of-the-great-irish-travel-writer-who-has-died-aged-90","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T13:56:09Z","webTitle":"Dervla Murphy: an appreciation of the great Irish travel writer who has died aged 90","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/may/25/dervla-murphy-an-appreciation-of-the-great-irish-travel-writer-who-has-died-aged-90","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/may/25/dervla-murphy-an-appreciation-of-the-great-irish-travel-writer-who-has-died-aged-90","fields":{"headline":"Dervla Murphy: an appreciation of the great Irish travel writer who has died aged 90","trailText":"A personal tribute to the late author, who revelled in anti-authoritarian and mischievous attitudes, and whose mantra was ‘you should never want your travelling to be easy’","body":"<p><br>The last time I saw Dervla was a few years ago, before lockdown, when she invited me for lunch at her home in Lismore, County Waterford. The meal was an agreeably liquid affair. One of Dervla’s great passions was beer. If Thesiger could cross the Empty Quarter just for a glass of water, Dervla was happy to cross Rwanda just for the pleasure of a glass of African stout.</p> <p>Bottle in hand and holding court on a sofa with that familiar, determined gleam in her eye, she complained vigorously about how difficult it was to visit friends or travel with her now increasing age – although I did point out how much of her 80s had been spent roughing it in difficult areas of Palestine, which produced a final – and fine – pair of books.</p> <p>I was struck by the sheer extent of her library, which spread from room to room. Most travel writers end up with a shelf or two on their specialist areas, be it South America or India. But over 20 books in a globetrotting career of more than half a century, Dervla had covered the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Desperate to travel abroad, she catapulted off to India on a bicycle when she was finally able to leave Ireland in 1963</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet she had a relatively late start as a writer. Born to a staunchly republican family in Lismore, she cared for her ageing parents until she was 30. Desperate to travel abroad, “like an elastic stretched to breaking point”, she catapulted off to India on a bicycle when she was finally able to leave Ireland in 1963. Before going, she practised firing an automatic pistol in the County Waterford hills; then she stripped the gears off her trusty bike, Rocinante, so there was less to go wrong – although it can’t have made the Afghan passes any easier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3995586fb17ec6f3a059aa1e5936433c4521f1b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3995586fb17ec6f3a059aa1e5936433c4521f1b6/0_0_960_1500/640.jpg\" alt=\"Dervla Murphy, with bike, in India around 1965.\" width=\"640\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dervla Murphy, with bike, in India around 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout from publishers?</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But then – as she once admonished me when I complained about some journey – her mantra was you should “never want your travelling to be easy, Hugh”. Even by her own arduous standards, that first journey was quite extraordinary. With just a change of underwear and her pistol, she set off to Istanbul and beyond. The mountain passes were frozen. In Bulgaria she was attacked by wolves and had to shoot them. The gun came in handy again later for a warning shot when a Kurd tried to assault her.</p> <p>Letters detailing her adventures were posted back to Irish friends in instalments, but she never expected her words to be published. When she reached Delhi, she was spotted cycling in the street by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope_Chetwode\">Penelope Betjeman</a>, who was intrigued by this Irishwoman who had just travelled overland solo for thousands of miles. “Penelope invited me back to her hotel room to eat tinned peaches straight out of the can, as she had no plates.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>She said it was the duty of the writer to enter into the lives of those they portray: ‘to sleep on their floors’, as she put it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The poet’s wife introduced her to British publishing firm John Murray, and the result was her first book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/24/dervla-murphy-travel-writer-interview-full-tilt\">Full Tilt: Ireland to India with a Bicycle</a>. It was the start of a professional relationship that lasted for decades. Murray’s published many more books about her travels to Africa, Laos and just about every point of the compass.</p> <p>She once told me it was the duty of the writer to enter into the lives of those they portray: “to sleep on their floors”, as she put it. She felt her upbringing in rural Ireland helped her to accept considerable deprivations when abroad. The entire six-month journey to India cost just £64 7s 10d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09da016764a838ceba33eb56044031ff273e07c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09da016764a838ceba33eb56044031ff273e07c7/0_216_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dervla Murphy with her bike in Ireland, 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dervla Murphy with her bike in Ireland, 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On that first journey through Afghanistan on her bike, Dervla was appalled to meet foreigners who never talked to an Afghan, let alone entered their homes: “All they had done was photograph them.” In Full Tilt, she describes meeting a 25-year-old American boy, typical of those she met on the trip: “For them, travel is more a <em>going away from</em> rather than <em>going towards</em>, and they seem empty and unhappy and bewildered and pathetically anxious for companionship, yet are afraid to commit themselves to any ideal or cause or other individual.”</p> <p>As a single mother after her daughter Rachel was born in 1968 – no easy matter in 1960s Ireland – she defied convention by insisting on taking the girl wherever she went. “People would say to me, ‘what do you think you’re doing, taking a defenceless girl to the wilds of the Andes?’”</p> <p>The visit to Peru with Rachel – related in Eight Feet in the Andes: Travels with a Mule in Unknown Peru<em> </em>(1983)<strong> – </strong>was, in her words, a turning point. Until then, she’d enjoyed the sheer liberation and excitement of travel, but the miseries endured by Indigenous people brought home to her how tough conditions were in places like the slums of Lima, with its rampant cholera and tuberculosis.</p> <p>In later years she was strongly drawn to countries that were at odds with the rest of the world: to Russia, where she rode the Siberian railways at 70 (she had originally planned to bicycle, but damaged her ankle in a fall); to Cuba with not only her daughter but three granddaughters; and in her final books about Palestine for Eland Books, which picked up the baton when she left Murray’s in 2008 (“I got too political”) and was superbly supportive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6356359d38e50181785b00ff70230fe86fc22a3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6356359d38e50181785b00ff70230fe86fc22a3b/0_0_4578_2887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enjoying a glass of Guinness with Hugh Thomson in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enjoying a glass of Guinness with Hugh Thomson in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugh Thomson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I reread the books, after the sadness of her death, the best still seem, like her first, letters home. What comes across most strongly is her consistent honesty: she was the most reliable of narrators and a master of straight reportage. She also had that rare ability to get under the skin of a country, and to listen well. In Russia, she gained confidences as a grandmotherly <em>babushka</em> that others might not have – “so there are at least a few advantages to getting old!”, she assured me.</p> <p>Unusually among travel writers, she never accepted a commission for a book before making a journey, preferring to wait to see if she found anything interesting to say – an example that others could usefully follow.</p> <p>She certainly liked reporting inconvenient truths. She argued that women enjoyed far greater freedom under the Soviets in Afghanistan or under Saddam in Iraq than they did at other times in those countries.</p> <p>Despite the many tributes that have poured out in recent days, it’s important to remember that in her lifetime Dervla was often seen as anti-establishment and given a rough ride. Her book on Northern Ireland in the 1970s, A Place Apart, was necessarily polemic and far from the sugar-coated version shown in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/belfast-review-kenneth-branagh-jamie-dornan-judi-dench-ciaran-hinds-feelgood-memoir\">Kenneth Branagh’s recent Belfast</a>. When, some years ago, I tried to persuade the BBC to do a lifetime legacy film about Dervla’s achievements, I met with resistance and, to my sadness, they never made it. She revelled in a certain anti-authoritarian and mischievous attitude, and her books reflect that.</p> <p>I once asked Dervla if she felt elegiac for the planet. “Well let’s face it, it’s hard to feel optimistic.” And she raised a glass.</p> <p>In return, I raise a glass back to her: to a wonderfully iconoclastic and bold traveller, and loyal friend, who wrote it as she saw it and maintained her adventurous spirit to the very end. Perhaps a glass of home-fermented Ethiopian <em>talla</em>, poured from a cool earthenware jar.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/25/whitewash-sue-gray-report-nhs-workers-no-10-prosecco","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T13:52:57Z","webTitle":"A bucketload of whitewash: Sue Gray’s report shows consequences are for the little people  | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/whitewash-sue-gray-report-nhs-workers-no-10-prosecco","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/whitewash-sue-gray-report-nhs-workers-no-10-prosecco","fields":{"headline":"A bucketload of whitewash: Sue Gray’s report shows consequences are for the little people","trailText":"While NHS workers cared for dying patients, No 10 officials drank prosecco, did karaoke and boasted they had “got away” with it, says Guardian columnist Owen Jones","body":"<p>Actions have consequences, goes the cliche, but in England this maxim applies to the powerless, not the powerful.

Here is a man who lies with as much ease as he breathes. His studied commitment to consistently doing wrong reveals the psychology of someone who thinks they can get away with anything, because, well, they can. After all, Johnson presided over a disastrously high pandemic death toll, a far greater crime than being ambushed by birthday cake. He cares as much for the unnecessarily bereaved as he does for the rules designed to protect their loved ones. As Lobby Akinnola, spokesperson for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/sue-gray-report-bereaved-covid-27061792\">put it today</a>: “He has treated us like they treated their cleaning staff and security who challenged their law breaking at the time: like we’re an inconvenience, like we’re dirt.”</p> <p>In his <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-25-may-2022\">turgid non-apology</a> to the Commons, Johnson offered the pitiful excuse that his team “were working extremely long hours” fighting the pandemic, excusing his attendance of objectively illegal leaving drinks as an “exemption” which was “one of the most essential duties of leadership”. Let us put this gently: PPE-clad nurses and doctors tending to the bodies of the dying and holding their hands because their loved ones were banned by law from doing so were also “working extremely long hours”, but hospitals were not full of NHS staff downing prosecco around karaoke machines.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police’s repeated refusal to investigate these parties is a microcosm of a justice system which all too readily fined children and charged homeless people for breaking lockdown rules. While junior officials were fined for attending certain illicit events, the prime minister was not fined for his attendance at these same events. This makes no sense, until you consider that in the 19th century, England hanged the poor for pickpocketing while its rulers plundered the globe. Our establishment has a long tradition of imposing punishment unequally – and protecting itself.</p> <p>The full story has not still emerged, and nor is it likely to – not when it matters, anyway. Neither the Met nor Sue Gray have investigated the so-called <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/partygate-abba-party-boris-johnson-job-interview-b2067432.html\">“Abba” party</a> to celebrate Dominic Cummings’ departure. This isn’t just a dash of whitewash: it’s a bucketload. Will Johnson survive? While Gray declares that “the senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture”, the blame will be spread about too far to stick. This is not a country in which power tends to be met with accountability. Perhaps history will damn our current leaders. Yet that provides little comfort when you consider the rehabilitation of deporter-in-chief Theresa May. Impunity is the culture that defines our establishment, because the consequences never arrive.</p> <p>The opposition bet the house that Partygate would be the nemesis of Johnsonian hubris, partly because it has abandoned any semblance of a coherent alternative vision that might inspire people instead. Amid the justifiable rage from a country that sacrificed so much – the needless deaths, and the millions of people left to struggle as prices surge – Partygate was never our leadership’s greatest crime. If we are ever to be rid of these cartoonish crooks, indignation at their spiteful misdemeanours isn’t enough: it’s a sense of hope that the world really can be better that remains the most compelling antidote of all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/25/families-desolation-texas-school-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T13:48:41Z","webTitle":"First child victims of Texas school shooting named","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/families-desolation-texas-school-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/25/families-desolation-texas-school-shooting","fields":{"headline":"First child victims of Texas school shooting named","trailText":"Parents pay tribute as names of 21 victims of Robb elementary school mass shooting begin to emerge","body":"<p>As desperate families continued to wait for news of their children, the names of the first victims of the mass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/texas-school-shooting-uvalde-robb-elementary?ref=upstract.com&amp;curator=upstract.com\">shooting at Robb elementary school</a> in Uvalde, near the Texas border with Mexico, have begun to emerge.</p> <p>State officials and police said the 18-year-old suspect, identified as Salvador Ramos, opened fire at 11.30am local time on Tuesday, shooting dead 19 pupils and two adults, both teachers.

This has just taken a toll on all of us.” Garza told local ABC News affiliate that her cousin’s mother had been with him during an awards ceremony at the school hours before the shooting.</p> <p>The father of Amerie Jo Garza, who celebrated her 10th birthday just over a fortnight ago, identified his daughter as another of the children killed. “Thank you everyone for the prayers and help trying to find my baby,” Angel Garza told ABC News.</p> <p>“She’s been found.

She is definitely going to be very missed,” said a relative, Amber Ybarra.</p> <p>Mireles’ aunt, Lydia Martinez Delgado, told the New York Times her niece had been a teacher for 17 years and was shot and killed while trying to protect her pupils. Delgado said she was married with one child and took pride in her teaching.</p> <p>“She was the fun of the party,” she said, adding in a statement reported by ABC: “I’m furious that these shootings continue. These children are innocent. Rifles should not be easily available to all.”</p> <p>Several US media outlets named Irma Garcia as the second adult victim. According to her school profile, Garcia, who was Mireles’ co-teacher, had taught at the school for 23 years and was married with four children. NBC reported that her son had been told by a friend in law enforcement that she too had been shielding her pupils.</p> <p>Other families posted pictures of smiling children on social media, begging for information.

When Scotland Yard’s inquiry ended, Gray said she considered continuing to look into the event “but concluded it was not appropriate or proportionate to do so”.</p> \n<p>Gray also said she was told about “multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff”, which she described as “unacceptable”.</p> \n<p>The report includes details of a drinks event in the No 10 garden on 20 May 2020, organised by Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, who urged anyone working in Downing Street that day to “bring your own booze!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d52b15cd1306ed5b6b3e1aa863b72fde90210c28\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d52b15cd1306ed5b6b3e1aa863b72fde90210c28/0_0_2226_1468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A picture published in Sue Gray’s report shows Boris Johnson at No 10 raising a glass on his birthday in June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A picture published in Sue Gray’s report shows Boris Johnson at No 10 raising a glass on his birthday in June 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sue Gray report/Gov.UK/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>An unnamed special adviser sent Reynolds a WhatsApp message praising his “lovely idea” but pointing out a Covid press conference would just be finishing, so those attending should avoid “walking around waving bottles of wine”.</p> \n<p>After the party, Reynolds messaged one adviser saying: “Best of luck – a complete non-story but better than them focusing on our drinks (which we seem to have got away with).”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09e4cf127e9d1e8f15e2436744ba456e454a7e71\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09e4cf127e9d1e8f15e2436744ba456e454a7e71/0_73_2220_1331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refreshments on a table at No 10 on Boris Johnson’s birthday on 19 June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refreshments on a table at No 10 on Boris Johnson’s birthday on 19 June 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sue Gray report/Gov.uk/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The prime minister attended eight of the events <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-report-full-breakdown-findings-no-10-parties\">described in detail by Gray</a>.</p> \n<p>Johnson was expected on Wednesday to meet Conservative backbenchers and give a public press conference.</p> \n<p>Many Conservative MPs had said they were waiting for Gray’s full report to be published before deciding whether the prime minister should face a vote of no confidence in his leadership.

Now crocuses, tulips and daisies are my portal to her, writes Chitra Ramaswamy","body":"<p>It was springtime, two years ago, and my mum was dying. The crocuses bordering the paths of my local park were in full bloom and every day the plucky sprays of purple, yellow and white seemed to inch further skywards. How thoughtless their ascent looked. How perilously close spring suddenly seemed to winter.</p> <p>I had just rushed back to Edinburgh as the country was going into lockdown, and by country I mean the nation, not its leaders. In London, my mum lay in the hospital where she once worked as a cytology screener, assisted by machines and some mighty inner force that for a few hallucinatory weeks seemed to rise up in her. My mum, who in my childhood memories was usually found hitching up her sari to snip a cutting from a stranger’s garden. My mum, who was finally dying of the breast cancer she had been so valiantly facing for years.</p> <p>The timing was off. Not just the springing up of a global pandemic, but the arrival of spring. A season particularly counterintuitive to the withering darkness of grief. There is something inappropriate, wrong even, about the lengthening of days and opening of buds when the person who first tended you is leaving this earth. And the country is in lockdown. And you cannot be with her. And a week after her tiny, heartbreaking, socially distanced funeral, the prime minister is holding up a cake at his birthday party. But, as with gardening, let’s stick to what we can cope with.</p> <p>Every day of those last maddening weeks of her life, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/21/losing-my-mum-in-lockdown-was-a-brutal-lesson-in-the-abject-loneliness-of-grief\">I willed the world to reflect my anguish</a>. Prayed for dark skies. Thunder and lightning. At least some April showers. I shook my fists at the weather, King Lear style, while in my own Shakespearean tragedy the skies were blue and London’s magnolia blossomed. My mum once told me that a champaca tree, which is a species of magnolia, grew in the garden of the house in which she was born – her grandmother’s house, in one of Bangalore’s oldest areas. There were also daffodils in that garden, the only ones she ever saw in India. My mum was born in 1943, when India was under British rule, and it occurs to me now that those daffodils, which are native to northern Europe, will have a colonial backstory as dense and hidden as the innards of an ancient hedgerow.</p> <p>These are revelations sown by grief. They come too late, and I had no idea they would flourish after my mum’s death. Nor that trees, plants, and especially flowers would become a kind of portal to her. I look at flowers now through her eyes rather my own, trying to squeeze every last drop of enjoyment out of each tulip and daisy on her behalf. I find myself learning the names of plants and trees as I never bothered to do when she was alive. As I walked in a National Trust for Scotland garden with my dad recently, he pointed out a camellia. When I told him I was impressed he replied: “Your mother always told me off for forgetting. ‘I’ve told you a hundred bloody times!’ she would say. ‘It’s a CAMELLIA.’” We laughed. Ah, I thought. So you’re doing it, too.</p> <p>These grief portals are everywhere, as abundant as cow parsley. One of the biggest is the Chelsea flower show, currently felling me at 8pm every evening. TV, the one thing my mum may have loved more than flowers, is a portal all its own. I never watch Gardener’s World without the ghost of my mum beside me saying: ‘Oh, Chitra, just look at that dahlia!’ When she was in intensive care, altered, sage-like, talking nonstop, she urged me to write to Alan Titchmarsh and James Wong. Why, I could not say. Now, when I want to summon her voice instantly, I just imagine her saying “Charlie Dimmock” in the 2000s, slightly fruitily.</p> <p>By the time my mum died it was midsummer. The world around me, dark as it was, was perfumed with the mellow honey of elderflower. I’ve seen two springs since then and am heading into my second summer in this strange motherless world. Life has gone on, cruelly at times, blessedly at others, and the ambrosial scent of elderflower is about to floor me once again. But it’s also true that when the crocuses came up this year and pierced my heart, I was glad of it.</p> <p><em>Homelands: The History of a Friendship by Chitra Ramaswamy is out now, published by Canongate</em> </p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

On the east coast of the US on Tuesday night, where I live, the after-school clubs were letting out just as news of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/texas-school-shooting-uvalde-robb-elementary\">mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas</a>, was unfolding. At that point, 14 children were confirmed dead, a number that has since risen to 21 children, and two teachers. Before the obscenity of it began to sink in, the shock: another massacre foretold, its sheer inevitability somehow deepening the horror. Other parents arrived, phones in hand, rattled and fighting off mental images. “This fucking country.”</p> <p>Over the next 24 hours, the same questions, with the same answers, would roll around again: “What has to happen?” In the 10 years since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/sandy-hook-families-speak-out-after-uvalde-school-shooting\">Sandy Hook</a> massacre, when 20 children and six educators were murdered in an elementary school in Connecticut – during which there have been, in the United States, hundreds of further school shootings, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/05/24/1101050970/2022-school-shootings-so-far\">27 this year alone</a> – this question has attained a rhetorical force divorced from its actual utility. That the US is a country in which decisive political action to curb gun ownership will never follow a mass shooting requires, at this point, no further evidence.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the question remains necessary; a howl of pain that, on Tuesday night, was heard in various forms across the country. “What are we doing? What are we doing?” asked Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, his <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2022/05/24/texas-school-shooting-sen-chris-murphy/9915591002/\">voice breaking</a> on the floor of the Senate. In a <a href=\"https://www.statesman.com/videos/news/2022/05/25/steve-kerr-press-conference-urvalde-shooting-golden-state-warriors-coach-gun-vioilence/9918719002/\">much-viewed clip</a>, Steve Kerr, an NBA basketball coach speaking at a pre-game press conference, reeled off a list of recent shootings in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/22/buffalo-racist-attack-black-residents-unbowed-by-terror\">Buffalo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/california-shooting-taiwanese-americans\">southern California</a>, before slamming the desk and shouting, “When are we going to do something?”</p> <p>On Tuesday night, President Biden <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/05/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-school-shooting-in-uvalde-texas/\">addressed the nation</a>. It was a combination of unnerving – the president seems increasingly frail, always on the cusp of losing the next word. But it was also one of those moments in which one is reminded of Biden’s gift for unscripted humanity. The president spoke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/31/beau-biden-dies-of-brain-cancer\">from experience</a> of losing a child, the sense of “having a piece of your soul ripped away”. His voice, loaded with pain, was startling in its authenticity. “There’s a hollowness in your chest,” he said, “and you feel like you’re being sucked into it and [are] never going to be able to get out.”</p> <p>And he let his anger show. “When in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?” he said. “Where in God’s name is our backbone?” Several times he repeated it: “for God’s sake”. If this was cathartic for those watching, it was also bizarre; that a man with the most powerful position on Earth could be reduced to this state of frustration. It never gets less insane, the power of the National Rifle Association and the relationship of millions of Americans to their guns, alongside the consequence of that irrational force. Late Tuesday night, local ABC news anchors in Uvalde were still reporting the sounds of screams issuing from the civic centre, as families were notified that their children were among the dead. On Wednesday morning, Americans woke to social media timelines filling with the photos of dead teachers and children.</p> <p>“What has to happen?” Everything that has to happen has happened already, if what we mean by that question is how many people have to die. Huge networks of gun-law reformers are working, and fundraising, and lobbying local and national government to effect a shift in consciousness at the legislative and electoral level. If we’re waiting for <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/news/ted-cruz-more-guns-texas\">Ted Cruz</a>, the senator for Texas – who in the wake of the Uvalde shooting, doubled down on his position to put armed law enforcement in schools; if we’re waiting for <a href=\"https://www.tpr.org/government-public-policy/2015-10-29/gov-abbott-embarrassed-california-leads-texas-in-gun-sales\">Greg Abbott</a>, the governor of Texas, who once chastised the people of his state for falling behind California in gun purchases; if we’re waiting for the congressman for Uvalde, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-who-represents-uvalde-ripped-twitter-response-gun-support-1709755\">Tony Gonzales</a>, a “proud supporter of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/second-amendment-right-to-bear-arms-meaning-history\">second amendment</a>”, to have a Damascene moment, then hopelessness is indeed justified. Given the history and psychology of the United States, it seems unlikely there will ever be a <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-1996-dunblane-massacre-pushed-uk-enact-stricter-gun-laws-180977221/\">Dunblane moment</a>, in which the mass murder of children triggers an overnight change in gun laws. These people – Cruz, Abbott, Gonzales and their ilk – can never be shamed into doing the right thing.</p> <p>And yet, the work continues. After every mass shooting, someone like Fred Guttenberg emerges. The 56-year-old father of Jaime Guttenberg, a 14-year-old who was murdered in 2018 during the Parkland school shooting in Florida and in possession of a mental toughness that is hard to compute, was on the news shows last thing Tuesday night and first thing Wednesday morning. Putting the Uvalde shooting in terms the president couldn’t use, he said: “They fucking failed our kids again.” There is nothing to be gained from saying things will never change. Guttenberg works on the assumption things can, and will. If he can do it, the rest of us surely can.</p> <p>We walked down the hill after school, our second-graders bounding ahead of us. I thought of their teachers, the horror of them turning up to work on Wednesday, imagining their peers in Uvalde. Self-soothingly, we said to one another, “Statistically, you’re more likely to get run over on the way to school.” We said school shootings were a largely suburban phenomenon. In New York City, we said, you’re more likely to be shot on the subway.</p> <p>And, while the most pressing project for parents in the wake of these massacres might seem to be to keep their children from harm, protecting them from fear is the greater requirement. I recently asked one of my seven-year-olds what happens during their frequent lockdown drills at school. Oh, she said, their teacher puts a piece of paper over the glass in the door and turns the lock. Then they practise sitting very, very quietly. “Why do you do that?” I asked. “In case of a burglar,” she said, cheerfully.</p> <ul> <li><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In another, a former patient who was reportedly <a href=\"https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/jury-selection-begins-in-trial-of-buffalo-clinic-shooter-gregory-ulrich\">angry at the medical treatment he had received</a> opened fire inside a health clinic, which he also targeted with IEDs.</p> <p>Research has suggested that there is a “copycat effect”, in which coverage of one high-profile shooting is likely to inspire similar attacks, but trends in the number of active shooter incidents do not necessarily mirror overall increases or decreases in gun violence.</p> <p>In 2020, which saw 35% increase in total firearm homicides during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/24/us-murders-extra-4000-everyday-gun-violence\">few high-profile public shootings.</a> The FBI counted 40 active-shooter attacks in 19 states that killed 38 people and wounded 126 in 2020, a much lower death toll than in 2021.</p> <p>Active shooter incidents are the most high-profile form of American gun violence, but the casualties from these incidents represent only a tiny fraction of the nation’s overall firearm deaths. In 2020, more than 19,000 people were killed in firearm homicides, and 24,000 people in firearm suicides, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2022-05-25-12:03:43/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Non-suicide gun violence deaths in the US. \"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2022-05-25-12:03:43/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Although active shooter incidents occur in a wide range of settings, including wealthy schools and neighborhoods, overall rates of gun homicide are higher in neighborhoods with <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7119e1.htm\">larger percentages of residents whose incomes are below the poverty line</a>, according to a recently published CDC study.</p> <p>Comparisons of active shooter deaths over recent years are heavily skewed by data from 2017, the year a gunman opened fire on an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas from a high-rise hotel window, killing 56 people and wounding hundreds more in a single incident.</p> <p>The Las Vegas attack alone helped push 2017’s annual casualty toll – 143 killed and 591 wounded – to record highs even though there were only 31 active shooting incidents that year, about half the number in 2021.</p> <p>As high as last year’s death toll was, it ranks as only the seventh deadliest year in active shooting incidents dating back to 2000, the first year for which FBI figures are available. Still, it marks the biggest number of such attacks on record, exceeding only the 40 recorded in 2020.</p> <p>California, despite having some of the nation’s toughest gun laws, accounted for more active shooter incidents than any other state last year, six out of 61, followed by Texas and Georgia with five each, according to the report.</p> <p>California does have lower rates of overall gun homicide and suicide than many states with more permissive gun laws.</p> <p>The single deadliest incident of 2021 was the mass shooting at the King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, in which 10 victims perished. Eight were killed and seven wounded at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis.</p> <p>The FBI noted that its active shooter report does not encompass all gun violence or even all mass shootings, which the government defines as at least three deaths in a single incident.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/25/headteacher-wanted-for-remote-shetland-island-school-foula","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T13:13:50Z","webTitle":"Headteacher wanted for remote Shetland island’s four-pupil school","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/25/headteacher-wanted-for-remote-shetland-island-school-foula","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/25/headteacher-wanted-for-remote-shetland-island-school-foula","fields":{"headline":"Headteacher wanted for remote Shetland island’s four-pupil school","trailText":"Can-do attitude and self-discipline essential for role at primary school on Foula, inhabited by 28 people","body":"<p>Islanders on Foula, one of the UK’s most remote inhabited islands, are looking for a new headteacher to run their tiny primary school, with a register of just four pupils and another child in its nursery.</p> <p>Foula, an island of 4.9 sq miles with a permanent population of 28 people, lies 16 miles to the west of Shetland and vies with Fair Isle, which is 44 miles to the south, as the most isolated and exposed inhabited place in Britain.</p> <p>Its popular headteacher, Beverley McPherson, described by one islander on Facebook as “truly fantastic”, has retired after four years running the island’s single-room school.</p> <p>Sitting on the eastern side of the island, protected from the Atlantic weather by Foula’s highest hill, the school house also features a nursery, kitchen, community hall and solar array – part of Foula’s off-grid renewables supply.</p> <p>The job specification promises a salary of £61,374, relocation expenses and a three-bedroom house. The advertisement placed by Shetland Islands council reads: “Are you a headteacher or aspiring headteacher looking for an exciting new challenge? Do you dream of being part of a friendly, dynamic island community with a slower pace of life?</p> <p>“Qualities we are looking for in the successful candidate are: a can-do attitude, vision, energy, initiative, good communication skills and self-discipline.”</p> <p>Other islanders work part-time at the school covering early years, art and information technology. On Foula, as on many other Scottish islands, residents take on a multitude of jobs, while teenage children live off the island during term-time, staying in a hostel in Lerwick to attend Shetland’s main secondary school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/foula_island_locator/giv-6562jnHlJbGVlFIL/\" data-alt=\"Foula map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/foula_island_locator/giv-6562jnHlJbGVlFIL/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Ken Gear, father to two of the children at the primary school, is an engineer for a Dutch company, but also serves as an auxiliary firefighter for the island’s airport, a peripatetic repairman for the island’s water and electricity supply, as well as farming 50 sheep and running a self-catering holiday let.</p> <p>Life on Foula is not for everyone, Gear said, “but for the kind of people who like this kind of thing, it can be idyllic”.</p> <p>“You need to be quite independent to live in a place like Foula. You need to be a self-starter. We have quite a strong community and certainly help each other when needed, but at the same time, part of the success of the Foula community is that people are able to look after themselves. There is that duality.”</p> <p>Famous among birdwatchers for its great skua, puffins, razorbills and guillemots, the name Foula derives from the Old Norse for “bird island”: Fugley. On its western edge, high and precipitous cliffs guard the island against intense Atlantic storms. They include the Kame, which at 365 metres is the second tallest sea cliff in the UK.</p> <p>It has one particular quirk: by tradition, Foula operates to the old Julian calendar and celebrates Christmas Day – when all the islanders gather together – on 6&nbsp;January. New Year’s Day falls on 13 January each year.</p> <p>There are downsides compared with living in more populated places, Gear said, “but living here we think the wonderful freedoms and closeness to nature that you can experience growing up on Foula far outweigh those downsides”.</p> <p>The island is served by daily flights from Tingwall airport near Lerwick on Shetland’s mainland during the summer, at a return cost of £46 for adult islanders, and three ferries a week during the summer. “We look quite isolated, but actually we’re reasonably well-connected, certainly more so that you would expect looking at the map,” Gear said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/25/severn-trent-to-help-100000-more-water-customers-with-30m-package","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T13:12:14Z","webTitle":"Ofwat

asks water firms to do more for people struggling to pay bills","trailText":"Regulator publishes guidelines as Severn Trent launches £30m support package amid cost of living crisis","body":"<p>The regulator Ofwat has urged water companies to do more to help people across England and Wales who are struggling to pay their utility bills as the cost of living squeeze tightens.</p> <p>Ofwat has published a new set of guidelines for water companies designed to make it easier for households to get help with paying their bills or repaying debts.</p> <p>Seven in 10 households with children that pay water bills believe they will have difficulties finding funds to pay a utility bill over the coming year, according to research carried out by the regulator earlier this spring.</p> <p>Meanwhile, just over half of all water bill payers told Ofwat they believed they may struggle to pay a bill.</p> <p>The regulator is calling on water companies to use their customer data to do more to contact any households that may be struggling, in a variety of different ways, so people know what kind of support is on offer.</p> <p>Its guidelines will also require companies to offer flexible payment options for customers who have irregular incomes and are on zero-hours contracts, as well as working to resolve any repayment problems without beginning action to recover debts.</p> <p>Emma Kelso, a senior director at Ofwat, said: “Many customers were struggling before the pandemic, and the current cost of living pressures are squeezing household incomes even further.</p> <p>“We were pleased to see water companies step up their support during the height of the pandemic, and now that many more households are likely to experience financial difficulty in the coming months, we want companies to continue to go above and beyond for customers.”</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/may/26/water-poverty-ministers-urged-to-end-postcode-lottery-in-england-and-wales\">review of water affordability</a>, which was carried out a year ago by the industry’s consumer watchdog, found that 1.5m households across England and Wales were in water poverty, with a further 3m on the edge of it, meaning they were paying more than 5% of their income after housing costs on water bills.</p> <p>The Consumer Council for Water has previously called for a social water tariff for struggling households, and criticised the patchwork nature of financial support available across the country, which varies between regional water suppliers.</p> <p>Emma Clancy, the chief executive of the CCW, welcomed Ofwat’s guidelines: “The revised guidance will help to ensure debt support more closely reflects a customer’s individual circumstances, as well as encouraging greater consistency over the way people are assessed and treated.”</p> <p>She added: “Putting more onus on companies to reach out to customers to see if they need support is also a vital step towards overcoming the barriers to existing help, including low awareness and a lack of trust.”</p> <p>The guidelines came as the water company Severn Trent launched a £30m financial support package to help a further 100,000 of its customers, after warning that more of them were struggling to pay their water bill amid soaring food and energy costs.</p> <p>The Coventry-headquartered company, which supplies more than 8 million customers across a region stretching from the Bristol Channel to the Humber and from mid-Wales to Rutland in the east Midlands, said it had the second-lowest water bills in England at £389 a year.</p> <p>The company already supported about 215,000 of its customers with their water bill through a social tariff, allowing them to reduce it by up to 90%.</p> <p>The new funding will result in Severn Trent offering help to 315,000 people, representing about 6% of their total customers. It said this figure represented the number of customers who were assessed as living in water poverty in the region it covered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“As cost of living pressures continue, we’re acting now to support people struggling to pay their bills,” said Liv Garfield, the chief executive.</p> <p>“Our customers have the second-lowest combined bill in the UK at around £1 per day but we know that for some, paying their bill is a challenge.”</p> <p>Severn Trent’s offer of increased support came as it reported a pre-tax profit of £274m for the year to 31 March, a 2.6% increase on a year earlier.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/25/it-seems-this-heat-will-take-our-lives-pakistan-city-fearful-jacobabad-after-hitting-51c","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T13:10:03Z","webTitle":"‘It seems this heat will take our lives’: Pakistan city fearful after hitting 51C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/25/it-seems-this-heat-will-take-our-lives-pakistan-city-fearful-jacobabad-after-hitting-51c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/25/it-seems-this-heat-will-take-our-lives-pakistan-city-fearful-jacobabad-after-hitting-51c","fields":{"headline":"‘It seems this heat will take our lives’: Pakistan city fearful after hitting 51C","trailText":"Residents of Jacobabad say loss of trees and water facilities makes record-breaking temperatures unbearable","body":"<p>Muhammad Akbar, 40, sells dried chickpeas on a wheelbarrow in Jacobabad, and has suffered heatstroke three times in his life.</p> <p>But now, he says, the heat is getting worse. “In those days there were many trees in the whole city and there was no shortage of water and we had other facilities so we could easily beat the heat. But now there are no trees or other facilities including water, due to which the heat is becoming unbearable. I’m scared that this heat will take our lives in the coming years.”</p> <p>As Pakistan and India sweltered during the recent heatwave, the city of Jacobabad, where Akbar lives, hit a record-breaking 51C. Normally the summer heat starts from the last week of May, but this year, for the first time according to the people here, the heat began in March. Now it will continue till August.</p> <p>According to the ecologist Nasir Ali Panhwar, author of several books on the environment, the city is particularly badly affected by global heating. This is partly because the city is located in a place where the winter sun comes directly and warms more. Others point out that most of the trees that used to shade the city and the surrounding fields have been cut down and sold, or burned in cooking stoves.</p> <p>Sardar Sarfaraz, a chief meteorologist of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, told the media that the temperature had already reached 49C in April, a record. He pointed out that Jacobabad “is one of the hottest places in the world” and warned that if the heat began to arrive so early, it was a matter of serious concern.</p> <p>Akbar says he is worried about the temperature this year. “The heat is increasing every year but the government, including the district administration, is not paying any attention to this serious issue.” Like most of his community, Akbar goes to work early in the morning and works for 12 to 14 hours, earning about 500 rupees (£1.98) a day. He has no choice but to face the heatwave. <br><br>Mashooq Ali, the president of the rice mill workers’ union, said that despite the temperatures, “still we have to work because if we do not work, the stove of the house will not work”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6c732ffece86bfce26128aeb0faa0486069500e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6c732ffece86bfce26128aeb0faa0486069500e/0_158_6036_3622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People drink water being distributed by volunteers along a street during a heatwave in Jacobabad on 12 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People drink water being distributed by volunteers along a street during a heatwave in Jacobabad on 12 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most workers take two hours off in the afternoon, according to Ali, and then go back to work. “When it gets too hot, we used to sit under the water handpump and use ice water. In the evening when we return home we get extremely tired and want to rest but because of the heat, we do not get enough sleep. Then we go out and sit in an open space so that some air can be felt, but when there is no air, it seems that this heat will take our lives.”</p> <p>The inhabitants of Jacobabad use hand fans and take frequent baths with cold water from hand pumps. Free cold-water camps have reportedly been set up at four places in the city, and are drawing huge crowds.</p> <p>Some residents with enough resources move to other parts of the country during these months to escape the heat. According to Huzoor Bakhsh, a journalist who has been reporting in Jacobabad for 20 years, many working-class people move to Quetta in Balochistan, where they work as labourers. He said that because of the deforestation, the intensity of heat had also increased. “Now the people have no way to escape the heatwave and the district administration is inactive in this regard.”</p> <p>Dr Irshad Ali Sarki, at Jacobabad MS civil hospital, told the Guardian that heatwave wards had been set up to prevent heatstroke, with four or five heatstroke patients admitted and treated daily. Dr Ammad Ullah, another doctor at the hospital, estimates that 50 to 60 people are getting heatstroke every day in this hot season, and said the hospital did not have the capacity to cope. “Some seek treatment from private clinics but the working class do not have the money to get their treatment,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5eaeeba92d8491248f9458e54ddf6113265b491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5eaeeba92d8491248f9458e54ddf6113265b491/0_137_4822_2894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labourers working at a brick kiln factory in the heat on 12 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labourers working at a brick kiln factory in the heat on 12 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Citizens complain that, despite the heatwave, the government is not providing drinking water.

Sometimes it’s like playing with a four-year-old. “I want you to pull me backwards by my feet,” says one. “Put all your weight on me” becomes a reminder of how easily we forget the land of complete sensation young children live in.</p> <p>More often it’s a delve into memories: of bodies gathered in protest, of intimate bodies full and satisfied, of dancing bodies moved by vibrations from a speaker, of awkward hand-holding and unwanted touch. All the while, the dancers’ present bodies feel their way through those fragments of history (with backup from Alberto Ruiz Soler’s sympathetic soundtrack).

Where both she and Witherspoon were classic white blonds, Bowman’s blond-braided Elle is entirely different. There are few cookie-cutter blonds here in fact, and in a show that seems squarely aimed at teenagers, Elle captures a Gen-Z spirit of girl power. She spells her moral messages out loud and clear (“I believe in sisterhood”), but this heavy-handedness can’t be faulted in a musical that trades on its lack of subtlety.</p> <p>Bowman gives an incredibly strong performance, although Nadine Higgin, as the salon worker, Paulette, nearly steals her thunder with her raunchy magnetism and powerful voice.</p> <p>This is a tongue-in-cheek production that comes with a megawattage of kitsch and to some degree sends up the genre of the high-school musical. Characters are pancake flat, reaching beyond stereotype into cartoonishness: the Harvard clique is dressed in muted shades of browns and greens while Elle’s world is a blinding pink mono shimmer.

But they won’t. In his time as prime minister, Boris Johnson and his allies have intensified an already-existing boys’ club culture in the halls of power, to the point of it being Bullingdon-esque. Those at the top are Teflon-coated. Instead, junior officials have borne <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/partygate-dozens-junior-staff-getting-fines-parties-boris-johnson-1648154\">the brunt </a>of police fines, for attending events that were “condoned” by their bosses.</p> <p>It’s a different story for the rest of the country, however. Thousands of fines and convictions have been handed out over the past few years, in a policing effort that was disproportionate, arbitrary and discriminatory. There were no special “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/19/boris-johnson-partygate-hands-in-police-questionnaire-met-covid-rules-downing-street\">questionnaires</a>” for ordinary people to complete at their leisure, just on-the-spot fines and maybe a day in court if they dissented.

Her inquiry into Partygate has been so long in the making – after its publication was delayed for the police investigation – that the rumour mill had gone into overdrive over what it might say.</p> <p>In the end, it still makes for grim reading in No 10. Gray takes aim at both the political and official leadership for presiding over a culture that led to mass rule-breaking. There are plenty of embarrassing details that will make MPs squirm if asked to defend them on-air, from aides leaving Downing Street after 4am (and not because they were working late), abuse of cleaning staff, and a No 10 adviser saying ahead of the infamous BYOB party in the garden that a press conference was finishing so it was best to avoid “waving bottles of wine etc”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/may/25/partygate-live-sue-gray-report-published-boris-johnson-downing-street-no-10-drinking\">Partygate live: Boris Johnson tells MPs he is ‘appalled’ by behaviour at lockdown parties but defends attending others</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What does it mean for Johnson? Had this report come out in January or February, it could have been the final nail in the coffin for the prime minister. But since then, the situation has improved for him, as he has used that time to shake up No 10 and woo his MPs. It follows that, for the time being, it appears more MPs than not are willing to stick with him – pointing to the double June byelections as the next crunch point.</p> <p>The reason Johnson’s allies believe he is more likely than not to survive this goes beyond the report’s contents. The biggest reason he is still in Downing Street is the lack of an obvious replacement. This means many MPs are backing him reluctantly. So while today’s report may not change his position, it will add to concerns about the miserable situation the Tory party is now in.</p> <p>• Katy Balls is deputy political editor of the Spectator</p> <h2><strong>Devi Sridhar: Our leaders took advantage of people’s goodwill</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6eb80c39dfa7a2fa9f1586fe099b723877d1a7cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eb80c39dfa7a2fa9f1586fe099b723877d1a7cc/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Devi Sridhar\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In an extraordinary time for humanity, a once-in-a-century event, people were asked to make sacrifices to limit the spread of a new, dangerous virus and to take care of others in their community – especially elderly people and those with health issues. “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives” we were told on a daily basis by Boris Johnson and his ministers. People were not allowed to attend the funerals of loved ones, women gave birth alone, and thousands of people died of Covid-19 in hospital with no one other than healthcare workers in PPE. It was a traumatic and sad time for the country.</p> <p>This is the context in which to read Sue Gray’s report, which outlines how many social gatherings took place at No 10 (with approval of the leadership) that were not in line with current Covid guidance. The text and photos make for difficult reading because of the contrast between parties and celebrations in No 10, and the trauma and tragedy going on in hospitals and communities around the country.</p> <p>We choose who leads us.

The only question left is how much longer he will be allowed to insult the British people by continuing as prime minister.</p> <p>Politicians will argue over facts and fines, but the truth speaks to common sense: the prime minister and his aides broke the rules they created, and lied about it. They believed that as long as the majority of people followed the rules, they wouldn’t need to. They were wrong. It took one person to give Covid to my dad, and it took only one person to die for my whole world to be eclipsed.

She stops short of taking a view on whether individual events did or didn’t breach the rules. Nevertheless, its findings are damning. Event after event is juxtaposed against the prevailing rules at the time to devastating effect. All-night parties, drunken behaviour, mistreatment of junior staff, the list goes on.

This is what it says:</p> \n<h2>Summary of the events</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Gray looked into 15 events on 12 dates between May 2020 and April 2021, all of which involved people gathering during Covid lockdowns. Boris Johnson attended eight of these.</p></li> \n <li><p>Several of the events appeared notably drunken and rowdy. At a leaving do on 18 June 2020 there was karaoke, “excessive alcohol consumption” in which someone was sick and “a minor altercation between two other individuals”, with staff staying beyond 3am. Two leaving events on 14 April 2021, which merged in the No 10 garden, involved drunkenness and people leaving after 4am. At a Christmas party in December 2020 red wine was spilled on a wall and on stationery supplies.</p></li> \n <li><p>Emails and messages uncovered by Gray found regular planning of socialising, but also some officials trying to warn that the events were a bad idea.</p></li> \n <li><p>As well as Johnson, a handful of senior officials are named, among them Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, and Martin Reynolds, Johnson’s former principal private secretary.</p></li> \n <li><p>Reynolds appeared particularly involved in planning events. After one gathering, Reynolds sent a message saying No 10 “seem to have got away with” holding it.</p></li> \n <li><p>The report runs to 60 pages and features eight photos from two events – Johnson’s birthday gathering in June 2020 and a leaving event in November that year.</p></li> \n <li><p>Gray opted to not investigate claims of a party inside Johnson’s Downing Street flat on 13 November 2020. While Gray confirms this involved food and alcohol, she “concluded it was not appropriate or proportionate” to look into it – a decision likely to be controversial.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Gray’s overall findings</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Whatever “the initial intent”, many of the gatherings breached Covid rules, and whatever the pressures of the time, this should not have happened.</p></li> \n <li><p>There were “failures of leadership and judgment in No 10 and the Cabinet Office”. Gray wrote: “The events that I investigated were attended by leaders in government. Many of these events should not have been allowed to happen.”</p></li> \n <li><p>Security and junior staff were often treated in an “unacceptable” way, Gray found: “I was made aware of multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff.”</p></li> \n <li><p>Her overall conclusion: “Many will be dismayed that behaviour of this kind took place on this scale at the heart of government. The public have a right to expect the very highest standards of behaviour in such places and clearly what happened fell well short of this.”</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<h2>The events uncovered</h2> \n<p><strong>15 May 2020: cheese and wine in the No 10 garden<br></strong>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/19/boris-johnson-and-staff-pictured-with-wine-in-downing-street-garden-in-may-2020\">pictured in the Guardian</a>, Johnson, his wife, Carrie, his then aide Dominic Cummings, Reynolds and the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, all attended, with wine and cheese laid out, but Gray concluded this involved gatherings for work.</p> \n<p><strong>20 May 2020: </strong><strong>‘bring your own booze</strong><strong>’ No 10 garden event<br></strong>The report relates lengthy messages in which Reynolds planned the event and invited staff, but also ones in which Lee Cain, then Johnson’s communication chief, called the idea of the mass gathering “somewhat of a comms risk in the current environment”. Another official warned that given the Covid press conference taking place in Downing Street, “just be courteous with sound from 4-6pm”. In the end, 30 to 40 people attended, including Johnson for about 30 minutes. The morning after, Reynolds sent a message saying “we seem to have got away with” holding it.</p> \n<p><strong>18 June 2020: leaving event in the Cabinet Office for a No 10 private secretary<br></strong>Also organised by Reynolds, messages obtained by Gray show Cain again warning it appeared a bad idea. After the formal event with speeches attended by more than 25 people, No 10 officials, among them Reynolds, drank prosecco and ate pizza, and used a karaoke machine. This was the event that included someone being sick and the altercation. The last person to leave did so at 3.13am.</p> \n<p><strong>19 June 2020: Johnson’s birthday<br></strong>This was the brief party for Johnson in the cabinet room for which he, his wife, Carrie, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were fined. It lasted about 20 minutes, Gray found, and Johnson was present throughout. This is the only event for which the prime minister received a fine.</p> \n<p><strong>13 November 2020: Lee Cain leaving party<br></strong>One of the two events for which photos are appended – the same ones <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2022-05-23/exclusive-pm-pictured-drinking-at-downing-street-party-during-lockdown\">leaked to ITV News on Monday</a>. Johnson was among those who attended, and drank wine, and also gave a speech.</p> \n<p><strong>27 November 2020: leaving party for a special adviser<br></strong>Gray does not name the adviser, but this was Cleo Watson. About 15 to 20 people attended, some drinking alcohol. Johnson was there briefly, and said some words.</p> \n<p><strong>10 December 2020: Department for Education drinks<br></strong>Organised by the then education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and attended by about 20 to 30 staff. Lasting about an hour, alcohol was served.</p> \n<p><strong>15 December 2020: No 10 Christmas quiz<br></strong>This was mainly online, though some were there in person, among them Johnson. Comprising a quiz and prize-giving, it lasted approximately three and a half hours.</p> \n<p><strong>17 December 202: online quiz in Simon Case’s office<br></strong>Mainly virtual, with some staff taking part in person. It involved alcohol and food and lasted about 90 minutes.</p> \n<p><strong>17 December 2020: leaving party for two No 10 officials<br></strong>Alcohol was drunk, Johnson spoke and attended briefly. A small number of staff stayed drinking until about 1am.</p> \n<p><strong>17 December 2020: leaving party in the Cabinet Office<br></strong>This was for Kate Josephs, the outgoing head of the Covid taskforce. It was meant to be socially distanced, but this did not happen. Alcohol was drunk and pizzas ordered, and some staff moved into No 10 to join the leaving party taking place on the same evening.</p> \n<p><strong>18 December 2020: No 10 Christmas event<br></strong>Billed as a “wine time Friday” event, this was pre-planned and involved a mock awards ceremony and secret Santa gift exchange. At one point an alarm was accidentally triggered and security staff “observed a large number of people in the area”. Some people drank to excess and wine was spilled on a wall and on “a number of boxes of photocopier paper”.</p> \n<p><strong>14 January 2021: leaving event for two No 10 officials<br></strong>Alcohol was drunk, with Johnson attending briefly to give a leaving speech.</p> \n<p><strong>16 April 2021: two leaving parties </strong><strong>that merged<br></strong>One was for James Slack, Johnson’s then head of communications, and the other for a “private office official”, believed to be one of Johnson’s personal photographers. The latter event, held in the No 10 basement, was especially rowdy, with music played and a number of people drinking excessively. The two parties later merged in the No 10 garden. Gray notes the last person to leave did so at 4.20am.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"adb102cc-107e-45f2-8704-60d6e5e65a5d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nq13JBDOqNA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/may/25/psycho-review-hitchcock-uncut-restored-horror-cinema","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T12:00:35Z","webTitle":"Psycho review – well worth getting scared in the shower all over again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/25/psycho-review-hitchcock-uncut-restored-horror-cinema","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/may/25/psycho-review-hitchcock-uncut-restored-horror-cinema","fields":{"headline":"Psycho review – well worth getting scared in the shower all over again","trailText":"The rereleased, uncut version highlights the calculation and skill that went into making a genre-defining horror classic","body":"<p>After the sensational release of Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho in 1960, some minor but telling cuts were made for the TV transmission and this became the standard text for home entertainment and cinema rereleases from that moment on. Alongside the film’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/23/my-favourite-hitchcock-psycho\">growing legendary status</a> were rumours about what Hitchcock had had to cut in the first place to get it past the censors, and the perhaps apocryphal story about how those censors swore they had glimpsed one of Janet Leigh’s breasts in the shower scene. Cunning Hitchcock was supposed to have solemnly promised to take it away and cut it – then after a plausible interval, resubmitted it uncut – and the censors pronounced themselves satisfied.</p> <p>Well, the recent 60th anniversary home entertainment Blu-ray of Psycho offered the uncut and cut versions of 1960 as parallel texts, and we are now able to inspect the former on the big screen, in a newly restored cinema print. It turns out it wasn’t simply a case of footage being trimmed: there is an alternate shot that subtly tilts the audience’s reaction. On paper, the restored moments do not appear to amount to much. There is a new shot in the pre-shower undressing scene after we see the peeping-tom eye in profile: Janet Leigh is removing her bra and for a moment it does look as if the audience are going to see her breasts. (Of course, they don’t.) Afterwards, there is a lingering shot of bloody hands and a different, darker shot of the assailant’s grimly frowning face. Later, when the private detective Arbogast is killed, we see more grisly stabs of the knife.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D90QhegiVvo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D90QhegiVvo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Do these few seconds change the movie? Not radically. But it shows with what a fine art these representations of sexual transgression and violent assault were calibrated, with what care Hitchcock thought about timings, especially considering his original stipulation that no one was allowed into the theatre after the film had started. It was not simply a publicity stunt: for the shower sequence, Hitchcock had calculated that for all that Psycho as a whole appeared to trade on explicitness, the shocking images were glimpsed fleetingly and almost subliminally. The flashes of flesh, the flashes of the knife … the camera does not linger on them. So to add more shots of this kind, more stabs, a longer moment of intrusion as Leigh slips her bra strap over her shoulder, is to turn up the dial fractionally on the mood and what people in the auditorium remember or think they remember.</p> <p>The tipping point, the point at which the shock coagulates into nausea, is not easy to gauge, and of course there is also the tipping point of censorship: just how much can be offered up to the authorities in exchange for being allowed to show it in the first place? Assessing the difference is as good an excuse as any to sit down to Psycho again.</p> <p>• Psycho is released in cinemas on 27 May.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2022/may/25/to-survive-i-must-appear-fearless-the-former-nun-helping-indias-garment-workers-fight-sexual-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T12:00:35Z","webTitle":"‘To survive, I must appear fearless’: the former nun helping India’s garment workers fight sexual violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/25/to-survive-i-must-appear-fearless-the-former-nun-helping-indias-garment-workers-fight-sexual-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/may/25/to-survive-i-must-appear-fearless-the-former-nun-helping-indias-garment-workers-fight-sexual-violence","fields":{"headline":"‘To survive, I must appear fearless’: the former nun helping India’s garment workers fight sexual violence","trailText":"Sexual harassment and assault are rife in the factories that supply some of the world’s leading fashion brands. In Tamil Nadu, union leader Thiyva Rakini is trying to change that","body":"<p>Many years ago, when Thivya Rakini was working as a domestic violence activist helping women to escape abusive husbands across the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, she took a pair of scissors and cut her long black hair back to the nape of her neck.</p> <p>“Without my hair, I suddenly looked very frightening to a lot of people who couldn’t believe a woman would cut away her femininity like that,” she says. “I was sending a signal that that those men shouldn’t try to mess with me. Inside, I am really a very tender-hearted person but to survive I have learned that I must appear fearless.”</p> <p>Rakini – a former nun, divorcee, domestic violence survivor and now union leader – has done a lot with her 42 years. She smashed cultural taboos and became a social pariah for choosing to leave her marriage and bring up her son as a single mother in a remote part of a deeply traditional and caste-bound state.</p> <p>Now, in her role as president of the Tamil Nadu Textile and Common Labour Union (TTCU), Tamil Nadu’s only female-led garment workers union, she has turned her attention to the multibillion-pound global fashion industry.</p> <p>Such is her reputation locally that, despite her hair growing long again, her appearance is often enough to strike fear into the hearts of garment factory owners across the Dindigul district of Tamil Nadu where the TTCU is based. “When they see me, they turn pale and run inside,” she laughs. “They tell their workers: ‘Don’t you be talking to her – she’s trouble.’ They try to shut their gates against me but I’ll always find a way in if there are women inside that need our help.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"abd81bec218bc0089d89fe3b5adc608ad1058211\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abd81bec218bc0089d89fe3b5adc608ad1058211/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rakini talks to textile workers in Thennapatty village, Dindigul city.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rakini talks to textile workers in Thennapatty village, Dindigul city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sivaram V/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since 2015, Rakini and the TTCU have been fighting what she describes as a “plague” of rape, harassment and sexual violence that has infested global garment supply chains and is being perpetrated on poor women making clothing destined for high streets across the UK.</p> <p>“As a woman, everything I have done with my life is a source of shame to someone,” she says. “But it has given me freedom to fight on issues such as gender-based violence that are still covered in silence and stigma. I am not afraid to take it out of the shadows and say: ‘This is wrong.’”</p> <p>Tamil Nadu, a major centre of Indian textile production, is one of the country’s economic powerhouses and home to tens of thousands of garment factories and cotton mills. It is also notorious for the poor wages and bleak conditions imposed on its largely female workforce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbdb4987c1eb439ad8429ca7105b988ac936e40b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbdb4987c1eb439ad8429ca7105b988ac936e40b/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rakini (centre) with colleagues at the TTCU’s offices.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rakini (centre) with colleagues at the TTCU’s offices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sivaram V/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Rakini joined the TTCU in 2014, it was a nascent organisation with just a few union leaders trying to help women organise and call for better conditions in their factories. She came on board to help deal with the huge levels of domestic violence that workers were facing. The union office soon become a makeshift shelter for women and their children who had nowhere else to go.</p> <p>“At that time, we were blocked from most workplaces because many factories didn’t allow workers to join unions and the unions that were active were all run by men,” says Rakini. “Yet women suffering from domestic violence were also telling us about the terrible things they were experiencing in the workplace at the hands of their supervisors and male employees. So it became our mission to try and put a stop to this.”</p> <p>In her seven years at the TTCU, Rakini has seen enough to pour scorn on the insistence of many global fashion brands that they do everything in their power to protect the millions of poor black and brown women working in garment supply chains. “The truth is that sexual harassment, rape, even murder has become part and parcel of the lives of women working in garment factories in my district,” she says. “International brands who buy from Tamil Nadu know very well that women in their supply chains are exploited to the core, they know the impact that their production targets and their poverty wages have on the workers’ lives. Their auditors know their inspections are meaningless. Their whole system is a lie.”</p> <p>The TTCU began taking on cases of sexual harassment and abuse that none of the larger unions would touch. “In those factories, the women have no power. They are often the main breadwinners for their family and although their pay is meagre, they must keep their jobs at all costs. They feel they have to do whatever their bosses demand of them,” Rakini explains. “When we first started going to the factories to complain, the management would just kick us out. They didn’t care.”</p> <p>Just over a year ago, in February 2021, Rakini got a phone call from the family of a young garment worker called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/01/worker-at-hm-supply-factory-was-killed-after-months-of-harassment-claims-family\">Jeyasre Kathiravel, who had failed to come home from her shift at Natchi Apparels</a>, a local clothes factory supplying brands including H&amp;M. Rakini says that she had already approached Natchi Apparels in 2019 after women complained about being sexually harassed, but had been told not to get involved in factory business.</p> <p>After Kathiravel’s disappearance, Rakini and the TTCU say they once again tried to approach Natchi Apparels, this time about Kathiravel’s disappearance but were rebuffed. Four days later, her body was found in farmland close to her village.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fabbdc5817c30acfcdfe6d71ffbdfe9da7c31fc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fabbdc5817c30acfcdfe6d71ffbdfe9da7c31fc1/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rakini outside the home of murdered textile worker Jeyasre Kathiravel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rakini outside the home of murdered textile worker Jeyasre Kathiravel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her supervisor at Natchi Apparels was arrested shortly afterwards and her grieving family claimed that he had been inflicting relentless sexual harassment and abuse on their daughter in the months leading up to her death, but that she had felt unable to stop what was happening. He has since confessed to her murder and is in jail awaiting trial.</p> <p>In the weeks after the murder, despite threats and intimidation from the factory management, Rakini and the TTCU leaders spent weeks travelling between garment worker villages, taking testimonies from dozens of other women who said that they had been raped, coerced and intimidated into sexual relationships with their managers at Natchi Apparels.</p> <p>At the time, the management at Natchi Apparels denied that there was any violence against female workers at its factory. It has since said that while it still disputes some of the claims, it has taken all the allegations seriously and as a result has “created systems, processes, and procedures to protect and promote the rights of female workers”.</p> <p>“It was a very painful time because the workers said that they were coming under a lot of pressure from the factory over Jeysare’s death and they were scared of losing their jobs, yet they wanted to speak out about what they were experiencing as they were all terrified they would end up like her,” says Rakini. “Asking women to tell their stories of gender-based violence is a big responsibility and we understood the risks that they were taking and the trust that they were putting in us.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4b575c9e7188508443debffbbb0afd3a33ada451\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b575c9e7188508443debffbbb0afd3a33ada451/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rakini with textile workers at Thennapatty village.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rakini with textile workers at Thennapatty village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sivaram V/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sad truth, Rakini says, is that there is nothing particularly unusual about the levels or severity of sexual violence that were found at Natchi Apparels. She says that over the past five years, the TTCU has received dozens of<strong> </strong>reports of deaths, rape, physical assault and sexual harassment from workers at garment factories across the district. Yet the impact of the statements collected by Rakini and her TTCU colleagues in the weeks after Kathiravel’s death has been immense.</p> <p>As a result of those testimonies and an independent investigation into sexual violence at the factory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/01/hm-pledges-to-end-shopfloor-sexual-violence-in-india-after-worker-killed-jeyasre-kathiravel\">its client H&amp;M agreed to enter into negotiations</a> with the TTCU and international labour groups. The TTCU helped negotiate a series of agreements at Natchi Apparels with both H&amp;M and Eastman Exports, the company that owns Natchi. Last month, a year after Kathiravel’s death, a series of legally binding agreements that aim to eliminate all gender-based violence and harassment from the factory floor were signed. </p> <p>“This is the first agreement of its kind in India and has the power to save women’s lives,”<strong> </strong>says Rakini. TTCU members will sit on the internal complaints committee and act as monitors on the factory floor, to supervise the supervisors and to help ensure a zero-tolerance approach to violence in the workplace.</p> <p>Since the news of the agreement that has been reached at Natchi, the TTCU has been inundated with requests from women at other factories begging it to come to their aid. “This is just the start,” she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Rakini has faced death threats and harassment. She was nearly driven off the road when investigating the disappearance of two workers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rakini’s fearlessness in taking on the might of Tamil Nadu’s garment industry is extraordinary considering the mafia-like hold that textile companies exert over garment-worker communities. She and her TTCU colleagues have faced death threats and harassment and she says that she was nearly driven off the road while riding her scooter, when investigating the disappearance of two workers from a cotton-spinning mill.</p> <p>Yet she is undaunted. “In my own life, all my struggles I’ve faced alone,” she says. “Now, at TTCU, for these women, I want to be the person I needed when I had nobody to turn to.”</p> <p>Rakini was born in a small rural village in Dindigul, in the south of Tamil Nadu. Her father was a brick kiln worker turned local entrepreneur who ran a biscuit factory out of their home. One of five daughters, she was the only one to get an education after she waged a campaign of attrition against her parents to be allowed to go to the local convent school.</p> <p>“I greatly admired my father but we were all afraid of him,” she says. “He was very strict and it was very unusual for daughters to be educated. All my sisters had left school by the time they were 10 so it was a struggle to convince him.”</p> <p>Rakini persevered, even going on hunger strike. When her father finally relented, he went around the community asking people to help raise money to pay her fees. She loved the routine and discipline of the convent school, as well as the faith and serenity of the nuns. When she was 18, she decided to join the religious order and spent seven years training to become a nun at the convent. Yet, one year before her training ended, she grew disillusioned with the order after witnessing her abbess turn away a desperate woman and her baby who came begging for help.</p> <p>“I realised that I couldn’t stay in a place where they would turn away the most vulnerable,” she says. “I felt a duty to God and to my family, but a greater duty to that woman who came in desperation but was turned away.”</p> <p>When she left the order and tried to return home, her family turned against her. “My father said to my mother: ‘I’ll cut her into pieces,’ because I had brought great shame on them,” she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc73b62c18ceb3790e1eed89f25f635ee62a4f59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc73b62c18ceb3790e1eed89f25f635ee62a4f59/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rakini with Jayasre Kathiravel’s parents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rakini with Jayasre Kathiravel’s parents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sivaram V/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rakini further enraged her community when she decided to marry a man without her family’s permission. “It was unheard of for a woman to do such a thing. It was seen as a great insult to my family,” she says. “After that, I wasn’t a daughter to them any more.”</p> <p>She had a child but, soon after, she says her husband and his family started brutally beating her. “I hadn’t brought a dowry so my mother-in-law said I was worthless,” she says. She claims they poured boiling food over her and kicked her on the ground as her baby son lay beside her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I have struggled to support us both as a single mother, but I have never once regretted my decision to leave my husband</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“One day, I just thought: ‘They’ll kill me and I have so much more living to do,’” she says. “I left the house and the next day I went to my son’s creche and picked him up and we ran away.

For this I thank him.”</p> <p>Iranian negotiators had made clear that the lifting of the terrorist status was a precondition for returning to the talks and it is hard to see in the short term how the talks can now be revived.</p> <p>The Iranian nuclear deal was negotiated in 2015, but after the Trump administration quit it in 2018, Biden pledged to negotiate terms for an American return. More than a year’s worth of talks in Vienna had seen America, negotiating indirectly, agree the terms for a return, and the steps Iran would have to take to come back into compliance. Most of the sanctions imposed on Iran would have been lifted.</p> <p>The issue of the IRGC’s status, and sanctions on the organisation, was one of the last outstanding issues.</p> <p>US officials argue that the IRGC’s terrorist designation was technically never part of the nuclear deal itself, and the designation relates to the IRGC’s wider behaviour in the region, and not to the nuclear deal. But supporters of a return to the deal argue that the terror label was among a host of non-nuclear penalties Trump had imposed on Tehran, and if it was lifted it might be possible to persuade Iran to change its stance towards Saudi Arabia and in Yemen. In recent weeks, Qatar has taken a leading role in the backdoor negotiations, and has been privately urging Biden to go further.</p> <p>In the view of some diplomats, Biden felt he could not lift the terrorist designation so close to the November midterm elections.</p> <p>Washington has not confirmed it has made a decision on the IRGC.</p> <p>The state department spokesperson Ned Price was asked at a daily briefing on Monday whether he would confirm Biden had decided not to remove the IRGC from the designation list.</p> <p>He said he would not comment on the issue, but that the subject could not be seen as part of the talks in Vienna. “The discussions in Vienna have been solely focused on the nuclear issue,” Price said. “If Iran were to seek to discuss issues that are extraneous to the nuclear agreement itself, that is a discussion we are prepared to have, but, of course, Iran would have to make concessions of its own.” Iran has repeatedly said the designation issue has to be part of the talks.<br></p> <p>A top IRGC colonel was shot dead on Sunday, leading Iran to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/iran-vows-to-avenge-killing-as-it-buries-revolutionary-guard-colonel\">promise revenge</a>.

According to the complaint, “Philbrick fraudulently obtained more than $86m as a result of the scheme … Philbrick made material misrepresentations and omissions to art collectors, investors, and lenders to access valuable art and obtain sales proceeds, funding, and loans.”</p> <p>When Judge Stein asked him why he committed the crime, Philbrick replied: “For the money, your honour.” He was no doubt being honest then. Prosecutors believe that his fraudulent scheme was operating between 2016 and 2019 and that contemporary artworks caught up in his complex web include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/basquiat\">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>’s 1982 painting <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/jean-michel-basquiat/humidity-a-nvD9AONthx3dSJdiXo3alw2\">Humidity</a> and Rudolf Stingel’s 2012 <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6205157\">photorealist-style portrait</a> of artist Pablo Picasso .</p> <p>His victims include Kenny Schachter, an American artist, academic and writer, who lost more than $1.5m to Philbrick. “He misappropriated my funds, my art, like he did with many people,” he says. What makes it all the more painful is that they were once friends, close enough to have holidayed together, and he remembers Philbrick as a “very talented art dealer” who was “sharp, fun and funny”. He likens him to America’s most notorious Ponzi conman, Bernie Madoff, who died in prison, having robbed thousands of victims worldwide of billions of dollars, describing Philbrick as a “mini Madoff”, who was brought down “mainly” by “a toxic mix of arrogance and alcohol”.</p> <p>Several civil lawsuits are being pursued to determine legal title to artworks that Philbrick allegedly oversold or used as collateral on loans.</p> <p>Judd Grossman, a New York lawyer, is representing several victims, including Satfinance and financial adviser Aleksandar Pesko, who has two separate lawsuits over two paintings – Basquiat’s Humidity and Stingel’s Picasso portrait: “Everyone’s litigating right now – not really against Philbrick. He doesn’t have anything. They’re litigating against the artworks that have been located.” The Basquiat and Stingel are both in New York, subject to injunctions, meaning they will stay put until the respective cases are resolved.</p> <p>Grossman says: “Philbrick was selling interests without disclosing the fact of that transfer and, in some instances, selling more than 100 per cent of the work … he lied not only about the purchase price, but ultimately stole the work and tried to pledge it as collateral on a loan.”</p> <p>A letter submitted to Judge Stein by Philbrick’s lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, ahead of sentencing this month, acknowledges as much. It states that Philbrick’s use of alcohol and drugs began at school and “intensified as he entered London’s art world”, adding that this was “how art deals are done”. Schachter adds: “He’s made mistakes and he’s sabotaged his entire life for short-term greed. It’s just stupidity.”</p> <p>In his submission, Lichtman admits that his client claimed to Pesko that he had purchased the Basquiat work for $18.4m “before selling a 50% stake to Pesko based on his inflated purchase price for $9.2m and also receiving a $3m loan from him”. “Philbrick then sold another 12.5% stake in the work to a third individual, Damien Delahunty [a London art dealer], for $2.75m, claiming that he had actually purchased the work for the even greater inflated price of $22m, lying that he and Delahunty would together own 25% of the work, with an undisclosed third party holding the remaining 75%. Thereafter, this work and others were utilised as collateral by Philbrick, without disclosing other ownership interests, to receive a $13.5m loan from Athena Art Finance Corp.”</p> <p>Grossman describes Philbrick’s fraud as “sophisticated”: “Among other things, he forged documents, including a Christie’s consignment agreement, a purchase and sale agreement and bill of sale, and a Christie’s invoice.”</p> <p>Philbrick’s fraud was exposed in 2019, following rumours of shady dealings and investors demanding the return of investments or artworks. Facing multiple lawsuits, he fled to the Pacific island of Vanuatu, where he was arrested by US law enforcement agents. FBI assistant director William F Sweeney Jr said then: “Philbrick allegedly sought out high-dollar art investors, sold pieces he didn’t own, and played games with millions of dollars in other people’s money. The game ended when investors began wondering where their money went.”</p> <p>Philbrick, whose boyish good looks have been likened to the pop star Justin Timberlake, was born in England 34 years ago. He grew up in Connecticut, the son of a respected former museum director and a Harvard-educated writer and artist, who divorced when he was a teenager, devastating the family financially and emotionally, according to court papers.</p> <p>He studied at Goldsmiths, University of London, entering the art world in 2010 as an intern at the White Cube gallery in London, where he soon became head of secondary market sales. In 2013, he established his own contemporary art gallery, in Mayfair and, after a reported turnover of about $130m in 2017, he opened a branch in Miami, Florida.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[Orange] is really not his colour. He was in a sort of khaki jumpsuit</p> <footer> <cite>Victoria Baker-Harber</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His business was said to have been backed by Jay Jopling, founder of the White Cube, who said in a statement: “It has hurt and saddened me that Mr Philbrick, whom I respected and whose early career I supported, has not only betrayed my trust, but, it appears, that of many others.” Jopling’s spokesperson said that he “has suffered substantial financial loss as a result of Mr Philbrick’s frauds”, adding: “As there are legal proceedings still ongoing in relation to these losses, we cannot comment further.”</p> <p>The British artists Gilbert and George even gave the court a character reference, remembering Philbrick as “a very talented, extraordinary, charming, honest and decent young person”.</p> <p>His relationship with the Made in Chelsea star, Victoria Baker-Harber, led to the birth of their daughter, Gaia-Grace, in November 2020. She even discussed Philbrick in a recent episode of the show, describing him as “the kindest person” and joking that he looked good in his prison uniform. “[Orange] is really not his colour. He was in a sort of khaki jumpsuit. It has a collar at least.” Approached by the Guardian, she declined to comment.</p> <p>The art world is certainly no stranger to fraud and scandal. Recent cases, which include forgeries sold by the once-respected, now defunct Knoedler Gallery, reflect the greed and excess of a market that is poorly regulated, enabling buyers and sellers of multimillion-pound artworks to conceal their identities.</p> <p>Sharon Flescher, executive director of the International Foundation for Art Research (Ifar), says: “Fortunately, scams like the Inigo Philbrick case don’t happen that often. But when they do, they expose the soft underbelly of an art world where large sums of money are transferred, often with little transparency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/31/uk-art-dealer-jailed-us-defrauding-clients-timothy-sammons\">UK art dealer jailed in US for defrauding clients of up to $30m</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This case shows what happens when trust is misplaced and people of seemingly good background turn out to be dishonest. This was a massive fraud scheme involving millions of dollars, lies, deceit, fraudulent documents, and exaggeration. While the selling of more than 100% of ownership shares in an artwork was hilariously funny in Mel Brooks’s The Producers, it is not a laughing matter.”</p> <p>Grossman believes that Philbrick was brought down by “a combination of greed, opportunity and the desire to be the art world’s next big thing”. “Once he got a taste of that success, and the lifestyle that his clients were leading – he’d made some money but he was not at the level of wealth of his clients – he wanted more. <br><br>“He abused his personal and professional relationship with his clients in order to perpetrate the fraud. All of these transactions involved a level of trust and, in these cases, were built on a good track record. He was making money and by all accounts there was no reason to believe that these were anything but legitimate transactions as far as my clients were concerned. During the course of these business relationships, some of these clients developed personal relationships, which only enhanced that trust. Ultimately, he perpetrated the fraud by abusing that trust and confidence.”<br><br>He adds that, while the victims “have lost real money, equally important, they feel that they’ve been taken advantage of in a real way … Any time you get defrauded and someone steals from you – especially when it’s someone who has developed this level of trust – it’s a devastating, life-altering event.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/25/met-police-facing-legal-action-over-handling-of-partygate","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T11:30:22Z","webTitle":"Met police faces legal action over ‘irrational’ handling of Partygate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/25/met-police-facing-legal-action-over-handling-of-partygate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/25/met-police-facing-legal-action-over-handling-of-partygate","fields":{"headline":"Met police faces legal action over ‘irrational’ handling of Partygate","trailText":"Former Met chief part of group arguing force failed 'to adequately investigate’ PM’s participation in No 10 gatherings","body":"<p>The Metropolitan police is facing legal action over the way it handled allegations of the prime minister breaking lockdown rules by attending parties in Downing Street, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The former Met police chief Brian Paddick is part of a group arguing the Met blundered and acted “irrationally” in its investigation.</p> <p>Johnson was fined for one event but not for others, despite claims he was an active participant in these gatherings – with one photo showing his attendance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/sue-gray-law-breaking-no-10-parties-published-boris-johnson\">Vomiting and partying until 4am: Sue Gray delivers damning verdict on Boris Johnson’s No 10</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a letter ahead of expected legal action, lawyers for Paddick say they wish to judicially review the “apparent failure of the Metropolitan police service to adequately investigate or investigate at all the prime minister Boris Johnson’s participation in three unlawful gatherings held at 10 Downing Street …”</p> <p>They are three leaving dos, including one on 13 November 2020 at which the PM is pictured with others, glass in hand in an apparent toast, with bottles of alcohol on a table.</p> <p>The other two events the Met is being asked to justify in the legal letter were leaving events on 17 December 2020, and also 14 January 2021.</p> <p>The Met is being sent a letter before action, and will be given 14 days to reply.</p> <p>The letter say Johnson is believed not even to have been sent a questionnaire by police, asking for him to account for his presence at the three leaving dos cited in the letter. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The letter says: “We do not understand the decision to investigate some attendees but not the prime minister.” </p> <p>It adds: “The MPS can not reasonably have reached any conclusion as to reasonable excuse without first having investigated the prime minister’s conduct by way of a questionnaire or interview.”</p> <p>Fines have been issued to those who attended events where Johnson was present but not fined himself.</p> <p>Among the legal team behind the judicial review are Adam Wagner, seen as a leading authority on Covid laws, and the Good Law Project.</p> <p>The legal letter asks the Met to either reopen its investigation, or justify in writing its decision-making, or face court action.</p> <p>Johnson was fined for one event, a birthday party held for him in Downing Street in June 2020, as was his wife, Carrie Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.</p> <p>The legal action signals a new chapter of pain for the Met over Partygate, which the force would have hoped to put behind it when it completed its investigation last week.</p> <p>Paddick, now a Liberal Democrat peer, told the Guardian: “If the Met is to avoid further deterioration in public trust and confidence, they must explain why they failed to even question the prime minister about his attendance at these events.

They were effectively abandoned by the school and care systems but wrote reams of intensely imaginative poems and stories, with June even self-publishing a novel. It gained them a reputation as authentic outsider artists when, in 1981, the twins were committed to Broadmoor hospital for arson and theft. Their case was taken by investigative journalist and mental health campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jul/13/health.lifeandhealth\">Marjorie Wallace</a>.<br><br>Their story has had a number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/10/classicalmusicandopera1\">stage</a> and screen treatments, and now screenwriter Andrea Seigel has adapted Wallace’s book about the case and Polish film-maker Agnieszka Smoczyńska directs in this UK-Polish co-production. Letitia Wright and Tamara Lawrance are excellent as the grownup June and Jennifer, two young women who withdraw into a vivid world of their own – to the profound dismay of their parents and intense irritation of their siblings, for whom June and Jennifer suck all the oxygen out of their young lives. When they speak it is with odd inflections, a lisp or slur that makes them sound almost Dutch. Jodhi May has a cameo as Wallace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b995b21076ac3511f101ec9f72911c797e0adc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b995b21076ac3511f101ec9f72911c797e0adc7/0_0_4448_2668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leah Mondesir Simmons and Eva-Arianna Baxter as young versions of the girls in The Silent Twins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leah Mondesir Simmons and Eva-Arianna Baxter as young versions of the girls in The Silent Twins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jakub Kijowski/Focus Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seigel and Smoczyńska show that the twins had a need for love, for people who understood and respected their shared jokes and private existence-system. But they could be extremely annoying and difficult and scary, and their frustration ended in strange criminal adventures which were possibly existential acts, or quasi-artistic acts of transgression and desperate self-expression; the acts of people who have the ambitions and obsessiveness of artists and even the potential talent of artists, but not the social background that would encourage artistry. I loved and sympathised with the twins’ ecstatic excitement on buying their very own typewriter – that intricate, clatteringly percussive thing of beauty which is more exotic than any laptop and creates dizzyingly perfect typescript – the first step to a writer’s self-belief.<br><br>The film looks (subtly) at the role of race and gender in the way the Gibbons sisters were written off by the system and the courts that condemned them to an open-ended incarceration in grisly Broadmoor. And Smoczyńska illustrates their fantasy world with stop-motion puppet animation sequences that manage to convey the strangeness and loneliness of their imaginings without resorting to horror.<br><br>It is tempting to compare this movie to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavenly_Creatures\">Peter Jackson’s 1994 drama Heavenly Creatures</a>, about the true story of Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme, best friends who withdrew into a fantasy world and committed murder. But the Gibbons twins were not violent and their fantasy world is actually more advanced and evolved. June did, after all, have the chutzpah to get published, albeit with her own money. (It was good enough for Jane Austen.) This is an engrossing, well-acted story – disturbing but also tender and sad.</p> <p>• The Silent Twins screened at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/cannesfilmfestival\">Cannes film festival</a>.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2022/may/25/more-than-one-in-10-young-women-now-identify-lesbian-gay-bisexual-or-other","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T11:11:56Z","webTitle":"More than one in 10 young women in UK identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or other","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/25/more-than-one-in-10-young-women-now-identify-lesbian-gay-bisexual-or-other","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/may/25/more-than-one-in-10-young-women-now-identify-lesbian-gay-bisexual-or-other","fields":{"headline":"More than one in 10 young women in UK identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or other","trailText":"Of females aged 16-24, 11.4% said they were lesbian, gay, bisexual or other in annual ONS population survey","body":"<p>More than one in 10 young women in the UK identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or other, according to official figures that suggest more than 2 million people define themselves that way.</p> <p>Of females aged 16-24, 11.4% said they were lesbian, gay, bisexual or other based on an annual population survey by the Office for National Statistics that relates to 2020.

And Bach would presumably have been surprised to find a sizeable audience gathered in a concert hall – another future innovation – to listen to his 300-year-old set of technical exercises.

The gentle rubato softening the sharp edges of the weird nooks and crannies that characterise the F minor fugue.

In the introduction to <a href=\"https://food52.com/recipes/84109-best-gado-gado-recipe\">her recipe in the New York Times</a>, the food writer Hetty McKinnon notes that, in the capital, gado-gado tends to be quite carb-heavy, with both potatoes and <em>lontong</em> (rice cakes), while in West Java, <em>lotek atah</em> or <em>karedok</em> tends to go big on the raw vegetables. Some areas use coconut milk, some people save time with ready-made peanut butter. In fact, there are as many opinions about the best way to make this dish as there are ingredients. Here is my two rupiah’s worth.</p> <h2>The sauce</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.goodfood.com.au/recipes/news/nasi-goreng-gado-gado-and-roast-chicken-indonesian-recipes-to-make-at-home-20190627-h1fr24\">As Eleanor Ford admits</a> in her book Fire Islands, “it is the peanut dressing that makes this salad. So compelling is [it] that folk songs have been penned to its name in Jakarta.” The other ingredients can, to some extent, be considered a movable feast, adjusted to suit what you have available locally and enjoy eating; it’s the <em>sambal kacang</em> that pulls them all together into gado-gado.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c842f18ed3f002219d0a2f3582a94961ba4b8a67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c842f18ed3f002219d0a2f3582a94961ba4b8a67/0_126_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Gordon’s gado-gado.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Gordon’s gado-gado features a slightly gloopy sauce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For this sambal, you need peanuts: if you’re short on time, you can skip the roasting and grinding part by using crunchy peanut butter, but, much as I love that stuff, when I try it in <a href=\"https://app.ckbk.com/recipe/vege05147c06s001r007/balinese-gado-gado-with-saffron-rice\">chef Peter Gordon’s recipe</a>, it makes the sauce a bit gloopy. If convenience wins out, look for a dark roasted variety, preferably with no added sugar, but for proper texture and flavour, I’d recommend starting from scratch – it’s the work of minutes, after all.</p> <p>Garlic is a common seasoning for sambal kacang, and the <a href=\"https://app.ckbk.com/recipe/ther22601c03s001ss010r011\">legendary Indonesian cookery writer Sri Owen</a> also includes shallots, which give a more savoury depth to the sambal from the author of the groundbreaking 1976 Home Book of Indonesian Cookery (reissued more recently as Sri Owen’s Indonesian Food), though I much prefer the fruity heat of fresh red chillies to her chilli powder. The umami element generally comes from <em>terasi</em> (fermented shrimp paste), which is readily available in blocks from south-east Asian food specialists, though vegetarians could, as in Chinese-Indonesian Australian food writer <a href=\"https://food52.com/recipes/84109-best-gado-gado-recipe\">Lara Lee’s version</a>, up the soy sauce content instead. She calls for <em>kecap manis</em>, an Indonesian sweet soy sauce, which negates the need for extra sugar; if you can’t find it, substitute Owen’s dark soy and brown sugar combination (or indeed the coconut or palm sugar used in other recipes, some of which are so sweet, they bring to mind a garlicky <em>dulce de leche</em>). Tamarind water usually supplies the sour note (though I rather like the fresher flavour of Ford’s lime juice), but, as ever, the key is to make it, then adjust the flavours to your own taste – tamarind water, of course, varies in strength, depending on dilution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0c1dc0cbec92c08f67bbdf4f1a564422fbcc20fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c1dc0cbec92c08f67bbdf4f1a564422fbcc20fd/0_82_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sri Owen’s gado-gado.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sri Owen puts shallots in her sambal, which give it extra depth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gordon and Nasution both add coconut milk to their sauces; the rich creaminess dilutes the flavour of the peanuts for me, but if the idea tickles your fancy, the latter’s recipe is <a href=\"https://indonesiaeats.com/gado-gado-surabaya-recipe-indonesia-eats-rasa-malaysia/\">here</a>.</p> <h2>The vegetables</h2> <p>As suggested above, as long as you get the sauce right, the rest is more or less up to you. For inspiration, I try recipes with Chinese and white cabbage, water spinach (AKA morning glory), Chinese spinach, spinach, beansprouts, Tenderstem broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, long beans, carrots and <a href=\"https://www.finecooking.com/ingredient/chayote\">chayote</a> (a crunchy gourd often sold in south Asian or Caribbean specialists as <em>choko</em>), all briefly cooked before use, as well as lettuce, radish, tomato and cucumber. Gordon, who has fond memories of the gado-gado eaten on his first visit to Bah in the mid-1980s, believes the hard work here is in selecting really fresh vegetables, then deciding whether to serve them raw or blanched, “although a mix of both works best”.</p> <p>I agree – the important thing seems to be incorporating a variety of textures and flavours, which means choosing something leafy (cabbage, soft lettuce or spinach), something crunchy (beans, cauliflower, chayote, long-stemmed broccoli and cucumber) and perhaps also something sweet (carrots or tomatoes). If visuals are important to you, aim for a mixture of colours, too. Blanch as necessary in salted water, and drain well before putting on the plate, or they’ll dilute that all-important dressing.</p> <h2>The carbs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"63be4f9e70aa7efc542fe507bd3a2709c587d59a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63be4f9e70aa7efc542fe507bd3a2709c587d59a/0_165_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mariska Lindungan recommends serving gado-gado with steamed rice.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mariska Lindungan recommends serving gado-gado with steamed rice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nasution, West Sumatra-born Owen and Lee’s book Coconut &amp; Sambal all call for potatoes, and Naustion <em>lontong</em> (compressed rice cakes) as well. Gordon serves his gado-gado with a saffron-spiked rice, while Jakarta native Mariska Lindungan, who shared <a href=\"https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/gado-gado\">her recipe </a>with the Korean <a href=\"https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/gado-gado\">cook and social media sensation Maangchi</a>, recommends serving it with steamed rice. For me, fragrant rice pairs better with the sauce than earthy potatoes; I love the bounciness of the lontong, which are new to me (and can be bought ready-made), but ordinary rice would work well, too.</p> <p>Crunchy prawn crackers, or <em>krupuk,</em> are also a popular accompaniment (so popular, in fact, that one disgruntled commenter underneath McKinnon’s cracker-free recipe calls them “one of the most essential parts of much Indonesian cooking”), but the side that really blows me away are Lee’s <em>rempeyek</em> crackers flavoured with peanut, makrut lime leaf and candlenuts. They’re almost too good to crumble on top of this salad, though – I ate most of them on their own.</p> <h2>The protein</h2> <p>Vegans will be delighted to learn that, optional hard-boiled egg apart, fried tofu and <em>tempeh</em> (fermented soya bean cakes) are also common in gado-gado – tempeh, in particular, makes the dish feel more substantial – though, depending on how hungry you are, you may wish to choose just one or two, rather than including all three.</p> <h2>The garnishes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"abe6f016aa4de9f88f9a66829924082aee820ca7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abe6f016aa4de9f88f9a66829924082aee820ca7/0_126_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lara Lee’s gado-gado.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lara Lee garnishes her gado-gado with incredibly moreish <em>rempeyek</em> crackers flavoured with more peanuts, lime leaves and candlenuts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nasution also serves her gado-gado with a chilli sambal made from pounded boiled chillies, sugar and salt, to be served on the side, “as people have different tastebuds to handle the spiciness”, though, she concedes, “you can omit the sambal if you don’t like the spicy sauce”. I’ve made the sambal kacang itself moderately spicy, but if you crave yet more chilli, her recipe is simplicity itself.</p> <p>A garnish of fried shallots add sweetness; you can make them yourself, but I find peeling large quantities of the things puts me in a very bad temper, so I’d recommend letting someone else do the hard work for you and buying them in. This is a dish that should be pure pleasure.</p> <h2>Perfect gado-gado</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5262f289a3fd79c412ae77b96352169007b3ae50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5262f289a3fd79c412ae77b96352169007b3ae50/891_880_2533_3167/800.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake’s perfect Indonesian gado gado salad 02a\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>2</strong>, and easily scaled up or down</p> <p>For the sambal kacang<br><strong>50ml oil</strong>, for frying<br><strong>100g raw peanuts</strong>, preferably skin on<br><strong>2 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and roughly chopped<br><strong>2 shallots</strong>, peeled and roughly chopped <br><strong>2-4 red bird’s eye chillies</strong>, roughly chopped (or to taste; pith and seeds removed if you prefer less heat)<br><strong>1 tsp terasi</strong> (fermented shrimp paste, optional)<br><strong>1 tbsp kecap manis</strong> <br><strong>1 tbsp tamarind water</strong>, or the juice of ½ lime <br><strong>Salt</strong></p> <p>For the blanched and raw vegetables (or to taste)<br><strong>¼ white cabbage</strong>, shredded<br><strong>100g long-stemmed broccoli</strong> <br><strong>100g green beans</strong>, topped<br><strong>1 carrot</strong>, trimmed and julienned<br><strong>½ cucumber</strong>, cut into chunky slices<br><strong>6 pink radish<br>1 handful lontong rice cakes</strong> (optional)<br><strong>1 slice tempeh<br>4 cubes ready-fried tofu</strong> (or fry your own)<br><strong>1 egg</strong>, hard-boiled (optional)<br><strong>Prawn crackers</strong>, to serve<br><strong>Fried shallots</strong> (shop-bought or homemade), to serve</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bea81318862fd915534d092555f3fee20611fd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bea81318862fd915534d092555f3fee20611fd9/88_607_3510_4387/800.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake’s perfect Indonesian gado gado salad 01a First make the sambal.

The faster the jokes come about unruly pupils and unrulier staff, the more the anger builds at an education system custom-built to sell young people short.</p> <p>Godber, who has just had the adjacent studio theatre named after him, began his career with a string of stripped-back physical comedies that put the focus on the actor.

Guacci is technical director of the Argentinian women’s under-17s and under-15 girls’ national teams, a Fifa instructor for women’s football and a Fifa technical expert and mentor.</p> \n<p>A Fifpro statement said: “The players were extremely brave to challenge the coach’s conduct and contribute towards making football a safer and more inclusive environment for their peers… The decision by the Fifa ethics committee raises questions about how much evidence is needed for disciplinary action and will deter other players from standing up against the perpetrators of harassment and abuse.”</p> \n<p>The union has also raised concerns about the lack of gender diversity in the adjudicatory chamber and of the length of the investigation, which began in 2020. It criticised the decision to publish the decision before the players or their representatives at Fifpro had been provided with a copy, despite this being raised by the union as “critical in any procedure which involves victims and whistle-blowers”. Not providing warning “made it impossible for Fifpro to properly prepare the players for this deeply distressing decision that may significantly impact their wellbeing and careers”, it said.</p> \n<p>Fifa’s investigatory chamber concluded in its final report that Guacci had violated a number of Fifa code of ethics articles, including “failing to protect, respect and safeguard the integrity and personal dignity of others”, “making use of offensive gestures and language in order to insult, isolate, ostracise players generally and individually”, “having engaged in acts leading to mental abuse, as well as for making use of hostile acts intended to isolate, ostracise players generally and individually” and having “sexually harassed [a player] by presenting her with unwanted and unsolicited images with pornographic content and by requesting her pictures of her intimate parts”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the adjudicatory chamber concluded that “the evidence on file is insufficient to corroborate, to its comfortable satisfaction, the players’ account of the events” and said that “conducts have not been supported by any material evidence apart from the players’ testimonies”.</p> \n<p>Guacci has consistently denied wrongdoing and when approached by the Guardian he said he was unable to comment because he was bound by confidentiality.</p> \n<p>Fifpro said it hoped the chief of the Fifa ethics committee’s investigatory chamber would appeal against the decision given it had “rightly advised that the coach had violated safeguarding and sexual harassment regulations”. It said: “This is particularly important since neither the players nor Fifpro have – according to the rules and jurisprudence currently in place – a right to appeal the decision.</p> \n<p>“Fifpro will continue to support all football players who courageously speak out against abuse, harassment and discrimination.”</p> \n<p>Fifa said in a statement: “Fifa’s position is clear: anyone found guilty of misconduct and abuse in football shall be brought to justice, sanctioned and removed from the game.

Foreign media has been banned from accompanying the tour.</p> <p>“I have been committed to undertaking this visit – the first visit by a UN human rights high commissioner to China in 17 years – because for me, it is a priority to engage with the government of China directly, on human rights issues, domestic, regional and global,” Bachelet told Xi, according to the UN transcript.</p> <p>“For development, peace and security to be sustainable – locally and across borders – human rights have to be at their core. China has a crucial rule to play within multilateral institutions in confronting many of the challenges currently facing the world, including threats to international peace and security, instability in the global economic system, inequality, climate change and more. I look forward to deepening our discussions on these and other issues, and hope my office can accompany efforts to strengthen the promotion and protection of human rights, justice and the rule of law for all without exception.”</p> <p>The transcript covered Bachelet’s comments at the beginning of the meeting but not the whole conversation with Xi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/heldavidson/status/1529363991775961088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Chinese state media readout of what Bachelet told Xi vs OHCHR transcript of what Bachelet told Xi <a href=\"https://t.co/87CAQHuSM7\">pic.twitter.com/87CAQHuSM7</a></p>&mdash; Helen Davidson (@heldavidson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heldavidson/status/1529363991775961088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 25, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Foreign officials have raised questions over what Bachelet’s visit can realistically achieve, and there is concern that the Chinese government will use the trip to whitewash its human rights record. So far the visit has included Bachelet receiving a gift of the book Xi Jinping on Respecting and Protecting Human Rights, and she has been photographed bumping elbows with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi. The US has called the visit a mistake.</p> <p>Xi’s comments to Bachelet on Wednesday underscored the deep sensitivity in China’s government to criticism of its human rights record. It has long denied claims and evidence of its abuses against Uyghurs, saying it is conducting anti-terrorism and poverty-eradication programmes in Xinjiang. At first, Beijing denied the existence of detention camps, before describing them as vocational training centres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Documents called the Xinjiang Police Files, released on Tuesday, were obtained by the researcher Adrian Zenz from unidentified hackers and published by a consortium of media outlets including the BBC.

It also detailed policies on extreme use of restraints to transfer “trainees” between facilities, and on permission for officers to shoot and kill attempted escapees.</p> <p>China’s state media and officials have reacted with fury to the release, repeating long-held claims that evidence of abuses in Xinjiang are “the lies of the century” and accusing “anti-China forces” of fabricating smears.

On Monday, the UK’s data protection regulator issued its third largest fine ever, against facial recognition provider Clearview AI. From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/23/uk-data-watchdog-fines-facial-recognition-firm-clearview-ai-image-collection\">our story</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The UK’s data watchdog has fined a facial recognition company £7.5m for collecting images of people from social media platforms and the web to add to a global database.</em></p> <p><em>US-based Clearview AI has also been ordered to delete the data of UK residents from its systems by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

But it’s rare for a company to be as belligerent about that approach as Clearview.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for our weekly technology newsletter, TechScape.\">  <iframe id=\"tech-scape\" name=\"tech-scape\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/tech-scape\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--tech-scape\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for our weekly technology newsletter, TechScape.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company burst into public awareness in early 2020, after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html\">a New York Times exposé</a> described it as “the secretive company that might end privacy as we know it”. Clearview’s product was simple: facial recognition technology, marketed to law enforcement in particular, that could take a picture of a suspect and return a solid guess as to their name.</p> <p>As technology, it wasn’t actually hugely novel. Similar tech was, of course, already built in to Facebook, and Russian company FindFace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/17/findface-face-recognition-app-end-public-anonymity-vkontakte\">offered a similar service domestically since 2016</a>. The impressive part of Clearview’s work was, instead, in building up the database required to make the system functional.</p> <p>Any facial recognition system like that needs at its heart a massive collection of people’s faces, linked with their names. And Clearview gathered that in the most brazen manner possible: it just took it all from social media. As the New York Times’ Kashmir Hill wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The system — whose backbone is a database of more than three billion images that Clearview claims to have scraped from Facebook, YouTube, Venmo and millions of other websites — goes far beyond anything ever constructed by the United States government or Silicon Valley giants.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>It would have been impossible to get that information with Facebook’s permission, even pre-Cambridge Analytica, and so Clearview just didn’t bother. Instead, it took the gamble that even if it did get caught, it was unlikely to be forced to delete data it had already collected.</p> <p>The gamble paid off. In the furore following the NYT’s publication, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and LinkedIn all demanded the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126063/facebook-clearview-ai-image-scraping-facial-recognition-database-terms-of-service-twitter-youtube\">stop collecting images from their sites</a>. But their ability to do so is limited: scraping data from public sites <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/linkedin-scraping-data-legal-court-case-1848811335\">is legal under US law</a>, and American data protection regulations are slim, and mostly bound up in contract law – by which Clearview is unencumbered, because it didn’t make any agreements with the people whose data it processed. A few state regulators have taken action against Clearview, and Illinois, which has the strongest biometric privacy law in the country, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/9/23063952/clearview-ai-aclu-settlement-illinois-bipa-injunction-private-companies\">secured a ban this month</a> on the company working with the private sector in the state (it had already voluntarily ceased such deals in 2020, Clearview says). But, other than that, the company continues to operate more or less unchallenged in the US.</p> <p>That’s not the case, thankfully, in the UK – as the ICO’s fine demonstrates. You have rights over the use of your data that remain relevant even if it gets scraped, passed around, reformed and deanonymised.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that might not help that much. Clearview’s response has been vituperative. A spokesperson for its lawyers suggested that the company simply will not comply. “While we appreciate the ICO’s desire to reduce their monetary penalty on Clearview AI, we nevertheless stand by our position that the decision to impose any fine is incorrect as a matter of law. Clearview AI is not subject to the ICO’s jurisdiction, and Clearview AI does no business in the UK at this time.”</p> <p>The ICO’s position is that any company handling the data of UK citizens is bound by UK law; Clearview disagrees. The company isn’t the only one to raise such questions. Take the Chinese dataset <a href=\"https://www.face-benchmark.org\">released as WebFace260M</a>, built for training facial recognition AI using faces and names scraped from IMDb and Google Images. The dataset is governed – or, not – by Chinese law, but the faces in it certainly aren’t exclusively Chinese citizens.</p> <p>This precedent matters far beyond the narrow question of facial recognition. Large public datasets scraped from the internet are the fuel powering the latest burst of progress in the AI sector. Text generator GPT3 is built on posts and links harvested from Reddit; Dall-E 2, the groundbreaking visual AI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/04/techscape-openai-dall-e-2\">that we discussed here a few weeks ago</a>, is built on images scraped from the web.

And along the 5,525-mile border, Roxham Road is by far the most popular irregular crossing point. In the first three months of 2022, Royal Canadian Mounted Police intercepted more than 7,000 asylum seekers crossing into Quebec, primarily at Roxham Road.</p> <p>This influx is causing growing friction between provincial and federal authorities, prompting Quebec’s premier, François Legault, this month to ask Canada’s government to shut down Roxham Road, arguing that the province doesn’t have the funds or housing to handle the number of asylum seekers seen in recent months.</p> <p>Refugee advocates disagree with those claims. “The refugee organizations in Montreal have said very clearly that they do have capacity,” said Wendy Ayotte, founder of the Quebec-based group Bridges Not Borders, who argued that without the reliable route of Roxham Road, asylum seekers would resort to more dangerous options. “A definitive closure will be a major driver for smuggling,” said Ayotte.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5dc7ac09abfdc53e062be7be807b70af43d74fcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dc7ac09abfdc53e062be7be807b70af43d74fcc/0_0_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asylum seekers cross into Canada from the US border near a checkpoint on Roxham Road near Hemmingford, Quebec, last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asylum seekers cross into Canada from the US border near a checkpoint on Roxham Road near Hemmingford, Quebec, last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christinne Muschi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although it is not an official port of entry, the crossing at Roxham Road is overseen by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and adheres to a clearly established system.</p> <p>Day and night, taxis drop off asylum seekers.

The US should tread with care","trailText":"Remarks like this feed China’s anxiety that US commitment to its One China policy is slipping","body":"<p>Joe Biden made a potentially dangerous statement on Monday. In Tokyo, he gave a flat “yes” to a reporter’s question of whether he was willing to “get involved militarily to defend Taiwan”. “That’s the commitment we made,” the president <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/05/23/remarks-by-president-biden-and-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-of-japan-in-joint-press-conference/\">claimed</a>. In fact, the United States scrapped its formal commitment to defend Taiwan in 1979, replacing a treaty of alliance with the Taiwan Relations Act, which obligates the United States to help equip Taiwan to defend itself.</p> <p>This is the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-transcript-abc-news-george-stephanopoulos-interview-president/story?id=79535643\">third</a> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/10/22/remarks-by-president-biden-in-a-cnn-town-hall-with-anderson-cooper-2/\">time</a> in less than a year that Biden has publicly declared that the United States would use force to keep Beijing from seizing the island. Once again, the White House <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-clarifying-biden-remark-says-taiwan-policy-hasnt-changed-11634933685\">scrambled to clarify</a> that the US position has not actually changed: the United States continues to adhere to a One China policy and maintain “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/world/asia/biden-taiwan-china.html\">strategic ambiguity</a>” rather than clarity as to whether it would defend Taiwan. This approach is a wise one that, as many administration officials recognize, has served the United States well. But repeated gaffes risk being interpreted as changes in policy. They increase the chance of damaging peace and stability between the world’s two leading powers.</p> <p>For decades, China has refrained from attempting to conquer Taiwan by force but has retained the threat to do so. Many analysts believe that Beijing would prefer to use gradual pressures toward “<a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-08-09/strait-emergency\">reunification</a>” than to mount a costly and risky campaign of sudden conquest. The possibility of full-scale Chinese aggression can never be discounted, especially in light of the country’s growing military capabilities and international ambitions. One reason Beijing’s calculus could change, however, lies in Washington. If the United States appears to regard Taiwan as an irrevocable strategic asset that could never join with the mainland, then China may resort to plan B: launch an invasion out of fear that it must act now or accept that Taiwan is lost forever.</p> <p>No single presidential utterance is likely to cause President Xi Jinping of China to make a policy decision of enormous consequence. Xi and Biden know each other from direct and continuing conversations. The People’s Liberation Army already <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2021/Nov/03/2002885874/-1/-1/0/2021-CMPR-FINAL.PDF\">takes seriously</a> the possibility that the United States would intervene militarily in defense of Taiwan. So Biden’s comment, in and of itself, may have little effect.</p> <p>More troubling, however, is the larger policy drift in Washington to which the gaffe contributes. Over the past few years, members of Congress have increasingly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/11/elaine-luria-congress-biden-taiwan/\">called</a> for strategic clarity about using force to defend Taiwan and have promoted other steps to restore the <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/america%E2%80%99s-shifting-taiwan-policy-making-anyone-safer-202492\">appearance of diplomatic relations</a> between Washington and Taipei. Under Donald Trump’s administration, the United States loosened restrictions on high-level contacts with Taiwanese officials, and the Biden administration has issued <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/new-guidelines-for-u-s-government-interactions-with-taiwan-counterparts/\">new guidelines</a> to reflect “our deepening unofficial relationship”. Most important, these measures have accompanied the growing hostility across US-China relations, as the world’s two leading countries engage in intensifying economic, technological and security competition.</p> <p>At a minimum, then, Biden’s vow to defend Taiwan risks conveying that the United States is degrading the longstanding policies that have underpinned the bilateral relationship and preserved peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Even if Chinese officials were to accept the White House’s clarification that US policy remains unchanged, they may conclude that the United States will grow only more determined to defend Taiwan as time goes on and that China’s existing threats no longer suffice to keep Taipei from drifting toward independence. In that case, China could move up its timeline for “reunification” and become more willing to risk military and economic conflict with the United States.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The war in Ukraine demonstrates that it can be difficult to discern just where red lines lie</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Indeed, several influential senators sent exactly that destabilizing message to Beijing by cheering on Biden’s ostensible misstatement. Senator Bob Menendez, the Democratic chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SFRCdems/status/1528778181423026181?s=20&amp;t=ED1f_3Usa7yUtg9RsKcfag\">tweeted</a>, “President Biden is right. Credible deterrence requires both courage and clarity – and Taiwan’s vibrant democracy deserves our full support.” The Republican senator Lindsey Graham <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1528792949940789249?s=20&amp;t=4ygwNnK24sPfLJ-fMptyeA\">made the sentiment</a> bipartisan: “President Biden’s statement that if push came to shove the US would defend Taiwan against communist China was the right thing to say and the right thing to do.” Likewise, the Republican senator Tom Cotton seized the moment to <a href=\"https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-statement-on-bidens-shift-in-taiwan-policy\">urge Biden</a> to “restate our new policy of strategic clarity in clear, deliberate remarks from a prepared text.” Whatever effect the gaffe may have in Beijing, it is opening space to attack the status quo in Washington.</p> <p>The war in Ukraine demonstrates that it can be difficult to discern just where red lines lie. Russia had long drawn a clear red line over Ukraine joining Nato, but President Vladimir Putin ended up launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, citing mounting cooperation between Kyiv and Nato, among other grievances, even though the alliance was nowhere near admitting Ukraine as a member. The United States did not know in advance what would cause Russia to go to war – and neither did many Moscow elites who were stunned by Putin’s decision to invade. The circumstances across the Taiwan Strait are very different, but it is worth considering that no one knows how much liberty the United States can take with its One China policy before Beijing will decide its red line has been crossed. Even Xi may not know himself. For all involved, it would be better not to find out. The stakes are too high.</p> <ul> <li><p>Stephen Wertheim is a senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/25/penny-wong-set-to-travel-to-fiji-on-thursday-coinciding-with-chinese-ministers-pacific-tour","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T10:06:05Z","webTitle":"China’s Pacific plan is ‘clear’ but so is Australia’s intention to be regional partner of choice, Penny Wong says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/25/penny-wong-set-to-travel-to-fiji-on-thursday-coinciding-with-chinese-ministers-pacific-tour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/25/penny-wong-set-to-travel-to-fiji-on-thursday-coinciding-with-chinese-ministers-pacific-tour","fields":{"headline":"China’s Pacific plan is ‘clear’ but so is Australia’s intention to be regional partner of choice, Penny Wong says","trailText":"As China pursues Pacific-wide security pact, foreign minister says ‘after a lost decade we’ve got a lot of work to do to regain Australia’s position’","body":"<p>Australia has responded to reports that China is pursuing a Pacific-wide security pact with almost a dozen nations, stating that while Beijing’s intentions were clear “so too are the intentions of the new Australian government” to be the partner of choice in the region.</p> <p>China will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/china-is-pursuing-a-pacific-wide-pact-with-10-island-nations-on-security-policing-and-data-report\">seek a regional deal with 10 Pacific island nations</a> covering policing, security and data communications cooperation when the foreign minister, Wang Yi, hosts a meeting in Fiji next week, Reuters reported on Wednesday.</p> <p>Australia’s new foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, will travel to Fiji on Thursday in an early sign of her determination to deepen the relationship with Pacific countries.</p> <p>“China has made its intentions clear [but] so too are the intentions of the new Australian government,” Wong said in a statement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/china-is-pursuing-a-pacific-wide-pact-with-10-island-nations-on-security-policing-and-data-report\">China is pursuing a Pacific-wide pact with 10 island nations on security, policing and data – report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We want to help build a stronger Pacific family.

However, as someone who has covered these kinds of tragedies – from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/18/freddie-gray-death-highest-ranking-officer\">Freddie Gray</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/us-police-killing-people-high-rates\">George Floyd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/07/charleston-shooting-dylann-roof-trial-death-penalty\">Charleston</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/13/charlottesville-white-supremacists-far-right-donald-trump-confederate-statue\">Charlottesville</a> – I can assure you that this noticeable lack of white presence in the aftermath of Black tragedy is not unique.</p> <p>So, on Sunday, when carloads of white mourners descended upon the makeshift community memorial with hymnals to sing from and to pay their respects, the Black residents of Buffalo’s East Side stood shoulder to shoulder with the visitors from the place where well-stocked grocery stores are not a luxury and listened to the prayers and plaintive testimonies about “healing”. They were grateful for the solidarity because they had no idea what was actually happening.</p> <p>This is how the forgetting begins.</p> <p>This week marks the second anniversary of George Floyd’s murder. I remember the outpouring of grief, the promises of change and the performative display of solidarity after the white people showed up. Two years later, we are still waiting for police reform and a much-anticipated “racial reckoning”. When it comes to Black lives, apparently “healing” is synonymous with forgetting.</p> <p>Whenever the loss of Black life is tragic enough to be deemed newsworthy, there is an all-too predictable order of operations that comes before the forgetting. Whether the death dealer is a law enforcement officer, a mentally ill “loner” or a far-right extremist, the path to cleansing our national palate is always the same. The process usually begins with the perfunctory offering of their condolences. After announcing their sorrow “for your loss”, there comes the customary moment of silence. The final step of the healing process cannot begin until the white people show up.</p> <p>When the white people showed up, Grady Lewis had not slept for more than two hours at a time since the terrorist attack. The day before the massacre, Lewis confronted the shooter and asked why he was suspiciously lurking around the Tops grocery store. “When I saw him going out of the exit, the ancestors said to me: ‘He’s not supposed to be here; get him out of here”, Lewis told the Guardian. “So when I asked him what he was doing there, he didn’t really have any answers so I …”</p> <p>Lewis was interrupted by the sound of a car backfiring, causing a reaction indicative of the stress that accompanies traumatic experiences. But Lewis is a practitioner of African spirituality. Lewis is a Black man in a poor Black neighborhood. So, when the white people showed up to offer their solidarity and solemn prayers, instead of counseling services and therapy, he and his residual trauma were left alone to forget.</p> <p>Asked why he thought it was necessary to question a stranger, Lewis looked puzzled. “But this is my community,” he said. “I don’t know what you mean.”</p> <p>While the constant refrain of “… but what about Black on Black crime?” may seem counterproductive to some, it is totally reasonable to anyone who covers incidents of white supremacy. The sororities, fraternities, church groups and community organizations who fight the violence and poverty in Black communities had been helping this community for days by the time white people showed up with their thoughts and prayers.</p> <p>“My people are not processing; we’re numbing out,” said therapist Ashley Watson, who was surrounded by members of her teen organization, Real Talk. “We are disconnected. I have to do my decompressing, my screaming, my raging, my meditating, and my praying later because, right now, we don’t have time. By the end of this weekend, this could all die out. They know this is a food desert. They know there is a lack of a mental health infrastructure. But by the end of this weekend, they could return to not caring any more. I hope they won’t, but this is a unique situation.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By the end of this weekend, they could return to not caring any more</p> <footer> <cite>Ashley Watson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Donald King was comforted by the overwhelming sense of compassion. A former resident of the now-demolished Ellicott Mall housing development, he said he hoped it finally would create the opportunity to address white supremacy. Eleanore, another former Ellicott Mall resident, believed it might offer the chance for economic empowerment in the community. They both nodded in agreement as the neighborhood visitors prayed for unity, prosperity, equality and the courage to come together and have “the tough conversations in the wake of this unique tragedy”.</p> <p>To be fair, when the white people showed up, Donald, Eleanore and I were already having a conversation about race. The two had already talked about the Buffalo of the 1970s, before their neighbors were displaced by private developers. When asked what they thought of the white people who were finally coming to pay respects, Donald said that he didn’t really know what it means.</p> <p>“I actually hope they keep coming,” Eleanore said. “It’s time for everybody in Buffalo – the suburbs, the politicians, the people in the suburbs … all of them – to stop acting like this place doesn’t exist.”</p> <p>Miss Trisha, a sharply dressed septuagenarian whose finest church hat stood out among the white parishioners, was elated when the white people showed up. Miss Trisha and I walked to the corner store across the street from the now-closed supermarket, next to the barbershop feeding the hungry, to buy some food. </p> <p>Asked if she thought her fellow white parishioners would change her neighborhood for the better, Miss Trisha laughed. “I don’t know them people. They’d probably follow me around the store if I was over on the West Side. But we can’t treat them the way they treat us if we want things to change. Everybody is welcome here.”</p> <p>When we emerged from the store, the area had quickly grown empty. Lewis sat alone under the tree where he’d witnessed the massacre. The DJ at Chilly Waters was playing KRS-One’s Love’s Gonna Get Ya. I pointed out to Miss Trisha that all white people were now gone.</p> <p>“Well … I’m always gonna have faith,” Miss Trisha replied. “The bible says faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. You know what I mean, young man?”</p> <p>I do not know what she means.</p> <p>I have witnessed this phenomenon after too many “unique tragedies”. The anger and grief aftershock that follows funeral processions through Black communities is often tempered by a curious mix of hope, faith and patriotism. Maybe this is what is required to survive the constant barrage of death and discrimination that this country flings at Black human beings. It is possible that our collective sanity necessitates the hope that there is a sense of humanity buried somewhere deep in this nation’s soul – or that America even has a soul. Black people are hopeful enough to believe that the things that keep happening to us will stop happening to us. One day, the people who have always witnessed these things will suddenly have a change of hearts and minds. Perhaps this, our willingness to forgive this country’s trespasses against us, is our most endearing quality and our most tragic flaw.</p> <p>Or maybe I’m just jaded because I’ve seen too many of these “unique tragedies”. It’s totally possible that this country will not forget about Buffalo the way it forgot about the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/08/30/140058680/race-violence-justice-looking-back-at-jena-6\">Jena Six</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/22/st-louis-missouri-ferguson-protests-black-lives-matter\">Ferguson</a> or Charlottesville or the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/16thstreetbaptist.htm\">16th Street Baptist Church </a>or the Lorraine Motel or Mother Emanuel or all the places still stained with Black people’s blood long after this nation has “healed”.</p> <p>Two years ago, George Floyd was still alive. Perhaps he and the 10 people who became ancestors at Tops Market are all trying to speak to us.</p> <p>Ask Grady Lewis.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Michael Harriot is a writer and author of the upcoming book Black AF History: The Unwhitewashed Story of America</em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2022/may/24/texas-elementary-school-shooting-uvalde-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T09:44:02Z","webTitle":"Biden calls for action on gun laws after Texas school shooting – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/24/texas-elementary-school-shooting-uvalde-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2022/may/24/texas-elementary-school-shooting-uvalde-latest","fields":{"headline":"Biden calls for action on gun laws after 21 killed in Texas school shooting – as it happened","trailText":"Three children, aged eight and 10, have been named; US president Joe Biden called for ‘common sense’ legislation after school massacre","body":"<div id=\"block-628df6448f084f9a73ca5b9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T09:44:02.892Z\">10.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thank you for following our coverage of the mass shooting at the Robb elementary school in Uvalde.

Here is a round-up of what we know so far about the shooting at the Robb elementary school shooting, which has left at least 19 young students and two adults dead:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>An 18-year-old suspect, identified by police as Salvador Ramos, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/texas-school-shooting-uvalde-robb-elementary\">opened fire</a> in the elementary school, </strong>Texas state senator Roland Gutierrez, who was briefed by state police, told reporters.</li> \n   <li><strong>The shooting occurred at Robb elementary school in Uvalde</strong>, a mostly Latino community about 85 miles west of San Antonio near the Mexico border, around 11.30am on Tuesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>F</strong><strong>ourth-grade teacher Eva Mireles has been confirmed as one of the adults killed in the attack.</strong> “I’m furious that these shootings continue,” her aunt said in a statement reported by ABC News. “These children are innocent. Rifles should not be easily available to all.”</li> \n   <li><strong>Names of the first student victims are also beginning to emerge.</strong> Eight-year-old <strong>Uziyah Garcia</strong> and <strong>Xavier Javier Lopez</strong>, 10, were confirmed by the Associated Press to have been killed after speaking with members of their families. <strong>Amerie Jo Garza</strong>, also 10, was identified by family as one of the children killed, according to ABC news. <strong>Jose Flores</strong>, aged 10, has also been named as a victim by his uncle.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Police said the suspect, Ramos, was killed, apparently shot by arriving officers</strong>, after he fled that scene. He had crashed his car near the school. The motive was not immediately clear and it is believed he acted alone. Gutierrez said the suspect shot his grandmother at her home in the morning. She is believed to be in critical condition in hospital, Sgt Erick Estrada told CNN’s Don Lemon.</li> \n   <li><strong>The suspected gunman bought two rifles on his 18th birthday, </strong>Gutierrez told reporters after he was briefed by Texas Rangers. Two assault-style rifles were reportedly purchased from a store in Uvalde County on his birthday. “That was the first thing he did on his 18th birthday,” Gutierrez said, adding that Ramos had hinted on social media that an attack could be coming. “He suggested the kids should watch out,” he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Joe Biden </strong><strong>addressed the nation on Tuesday night</strong> shortly after returning to the White House from a five-day trip to Asia. The president delivered an emotional speech, calling for “common sense” gun laws and said: “As a nation we have to ask, when in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby? When in God’s name will we do what we all know in our gut needs to be done?”</li> \n   <li><strong>Parents of schoolchildren have had to wait for hours in a parking lot to receive the news that their children are dead </strong>after being swabbed for DNA, according to New York Times reporter, Jazmine Ulloa.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5217fcf8-e013-4000-b4d1-a99db7639c41\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ctjG1KiLq9k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T08:22:25.470Z\">at 9.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-628de2698f08b48a6e743a3a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T08:05:36.625Z\">9.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Washington Post has reported <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/25/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-gunman/\">more on the background</a> of the 18-year-old suspect in the Robb elementary school shooting in Uvalde, identified by police as Salvador Ramos.

Zaltzman’s comedic brain and sense of timing mean that in his hands statistics are often fun, sometimes frivolous, while also at times serving a semi-serious purpose – to give background or reasoning as to why something might or might not be happening on the field.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/29/its-my-dream-job-andy-zaltzman-on-being-crickets-funniest-statistician\">The Spin | ‘It’s my dream job’: Andy Zaltzman on being cricket’s funniest statistician</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It is about the overall narrative rather than just plucking out quirky numbers that aren’t that relevant. The best stats are ones that provoke a discussion and give an insight into performance or show trends of the game. I’m there to spark a bit of a chat, that’s a real joy,”<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/29/its-my-dream-job-andy-zaltzman-on-being-crickets-funniest-statistician\">, the man himself told The Spin last year</a>.</p> <p>The game itself is increasingly pored over in new ways. Every delivery, stroke and dismissal is logged, filed away in an ever-bulging spreadsheet document to be exhumed and interpreted at a later date. Teams employ analysts to drill into the minutiae, create dossiers on opponents and to inform, challenge and improve the work of their own players. Modern cricket is increasingly headed down a Moneyball route trodden by baseball to become a game of marginal gains and match-ups.</p> <p>A few years ago Nathan Leamon, the official analyst of the England men’s side, showed a flagrant disregard for printer ink by stacking up a series of, to the unlearned eye, seemingly random numbers and letters on clipboards in size 700 font on the team balcony in order to pass information to the captain Eoin Morgan on the field. Leamon had done similar previously with Shan Masood at Multan Sultans in the Pakistan Super League. The idea being that the captain on the field can give or take the information being cryptically imparted. <em>4E? 2C?</em> Jos Buttler joked after one particular T20 against South Africa that Leamon was actually calling out the Euromillions numbers – “the lads were checking their tickets!” The ECB commented that Leamon’s signals, a sort of play-your-cards-right style semaphore, were “intended as a live informational resource that the captain may choose to use or ignore as he wishes” adding pointedly that they are “not commands or instructions and all decision-making takes place on the field”.</p> <p>A lot of cricket writing and surrounding conversation these days is heavily influenced by statistics. Long gone are the days when a correspondent could ring in their copy or match report and be safe in the knowledge that they, being the eyes on the ground, would have the definitive take on the action. No questions asked. Now there are armies of fans who know, watch and think more about the game even than those who are paid to cover it and who are ready, willing and able via the medium of social media or below-the-line comments to counteract, critique or disregard with a wave of a well-researched stat. This back and forth is all part of the fun, for want of a better word, as a wiser man than me once said, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=110qxGYMnfQ\">“s’all in the game, yo”.</a></p> <p>Each to their own of course. This Spin contributor is as guilty as the next when it comes to trying to find a juicy stat or quirky fact to hang 800 words off. I’ve tapped up Zaltzman himself on numerous occasions to get some numerical meat on the bones of a piece or add mathematical heft to an idea. </p> <p>It does sometimes feel as if this shift in focus, the statistical lens through which the game is increasingly perceived, detracts from the physical happenings on the pitch. The sweat, skill and effort swallowed in the sea of stats. Numbers can never truly reflect the drama, a scoresheet never lies they say, unless, well, it sort of does. Some players defy stats just as some moments cannot be defined by them. As a crude example, take a look at the below figures.</p> <p><strong>22-3-79-4</strong></p> <p><strong>23-8-56-1</strong></p> <p><strong>1* (17)</strong></p> <p>None seem particularly special, no five-fers and no huge score, yet they are the numbers behind some of the most memorable passages of Test cricket in the last 25 years. Andrew Flintoff’s second-innings bowling figures at Edgbaston in 2005 that included <em>that </em>over to dismiss Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting. Allan Donald’s furious duel with Michael Atherton at Trent Bridge in 1998 – one of the most electric passages of play in the history of the game – and Jack Leach’s spectacle-wiping, Ben Stokes-sidekicking-solitary run that helped pull off an unthinkable Ashes Test heist.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4lWyOk6wj0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P4lWyOk6wj0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Sometimes the numbers don’t stack up, the black and white scrawls on the page don’t reflect the colour of the moments on the field. Sometimes cricket, those that play and follow it, can be slaves to numbers. “Lies, damn lies and statistics,” the saying goes, it’s worth remembering when it comes to cricket. Don’t just take my word for it, take Zaltzman’s.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2022/may/25/anek-review-gunfights-boxing-and-what-it-means-to-be-indian","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T09:30:32Z","webTitle":"Anek review – gunfights, boxing and what it means to be Indian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/25/anek-review-gunfights-boxing-and-what-it-means-to-be-indian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/may/25/anek-review-gunfights-boxing-and-what-it-means-to-be-indian","fields":{"headline":"Anek review – gunfights, boxing and what it means to be Indian","trailText":"Anubhav Sinha’s action thriller asks pertinent questions about political conflict and cultural identity","body":"<p>“Peace is a subjective hypothesis,” says one character in Anubhav Sinha’s new action thriller, which examines the political conflicts that have plagued <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India\">Northeast India</a> for generations. This casual aphorism – and the film itself – is riddled with ambivalence, a welcome departure from the nationalistic jingoism that has ruled Hindi cinema and its box office in recent years.</p> <p>Anek asks the difficult question of what it means to be Indian, a loaded riddle in a period where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva\">Hindutva</a> rhetoric has fostered brutal discrimination all across the country. For Aido, a Northeastern Indian boxer played by newcomer Andrea Kevichüsa, her dream of earning a spot on the national team is enough to prove her belonging in a land where her people endure racial abuse on a daily basis. For her father Wangnao (Mipham Otsal), a school teacher who covertly leads a rebel group against government forces, assimilation is associated with the stripping of cultural identity. In between stands Joshua (Ayushmann Khurrana), an undercover agent who finds his loyalty put to the test. In a nicely understated performance, Khurrana delivers his lines with a stoicism that recalls the suave charisma of 1970s Amitabh Bachchan even if, in this contemporary age, the angry young man no longer exists; he is weathered down, caged in a system that incites bloody unrest while simultaneously punishing those who fight for political autonomy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhldo272vO8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vhldo272vO8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Anek is a rare commercial film that spotlights Northeastern Indian stories, and goes out of its way to refuse to condemn guerrilla fighters as terrorists.

Four years later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/23/unprecedented-win-for-women-in-top-global-environment-awards-goldman-prize\">Márquez was awarded the prestigious Goldman environmental prize.</a></p> <p>“What sums her up best is her humility,” said Beatriz Cocino, 49, who has marched alongside Márquez in campaigns against goldminers. “Out in the countryside, it is us working the fields to feed the cities, but we’re totally forgotten.”</p> <p>Cocino had travelled an hour from her village to Santander de Quilichao to hear the candidate speak at a recent campaign event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d2dc77bb2a2bb207064046dd1a2cc922bcdd1b55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2dc77bb2a2bb207064046dd1a2cc922bcdd1b55/876_0_2419_3024/800.jpg\" alt=\"Beatriz Cocino.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beatriz Cocino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Parkin Daniels/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I’m so proud that Francia is here, representing us, because I’m proud to be a Black woman,” said Cocino. “Today it’s Francia, but tomorrow it could be any of us.”</p> <p>Márquez was chosen as Petro’s running mate after winning more than 750,000 votes in a primary in March, beating a number of established career politicians. Both candidates belong to the leftist Historic Pact coalition, which features many anti-establishment politicians and political newcomers. Colombia has never had a leftwing president.</p> <p>Petro, who as a youth was a member of the now defunct M-19 guerrilla group, has served as mayor of Bogotá, and came second in the last presidential election in 2018.</p> <p>His main rival for the presidency is Federico Gutiérrez, the former mayor of Medellín, Colombia’s second city, who is widely viewed as a continuation of the rightwing status quo. If neither candidate takes more than 50% of votes on Sunday, the race will go to a runoff in June.</p> <p>Also on the ballot will be Colombia’s fragile peace process with the leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), who demobilised after a peace deal was signed in 2016, ending decades of vicious civil war against state forces and their paramilitary allies that killed over 260,000 people and displaced 7 million. </p> <p>Petro and Márquez are viewed as fervent supporters of the deal, while Gutiérrez is thought to be a skeptic.</p> <p>“Their vision of peace and commitment to it is consistent with the vision of a large part of the population that has been a victim of the armed conflict in Colombia,” Mejía said.</p> <p>But political violence continues to dog the campaign – a particular worry in a country where four presidential candidates have been murdered since the 1980s. Hours after Márquez’s trip to Santander de Quilichao, a prominent local community leader and land rights activist, Édgar Quintero, was murdered by four gunmen.

The rapper Snoop Dogg has shared her story on social media.</p> <p>But while her campaign has inspired rapturous pride and joy in her supporters, it has also brought implicit racism to the surface of public discourse.</p> <p>Márquez has been mocked as “King Kong” on social media – even by a senator from her coalition. One rightwing commentator accused her of sowing “ignorance, hate and resentment” in what was widely seen as a racist dogwhistle. And at a recent campaign in Bogotá, a laser-pen was shone on her chest in what many saw as a thinly veiled threat of violence.</p> <p>“Colombia is known as one of the most racist countries in Latin America for a reason,” Mejía said, her diction tinged with anger. “In Colombia they speak about Black women as being ‘pretty little black things’ and who do Colombia’s legislatures give priority to?

No wonder he’s charmed audiences the world over","body":"<p>By and large, the key to a successful food and travel show is its host. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/27/stanley-tucci-searching-for-italy-review-a-sweet-light-delight-of-a-documentary\">Stanley Tucci’s Italian series</a>, for example, is like being led around a city by someone charming enough to get you seats at all the best spots. Anthony Bourdain’s, meanwhile, could show you all the backstreet hole-in-the-wall places where local people actually eat.</p> <p>And then there’s Somebody Feed Phil, on Netflix. For four years – or more if you count its PBS precursor, I’ll Have What Phil’s Having – the show has operated on a simple premise: dropping the world’s most delighted man into some of the best food towns on earth, and watching as he struggles to comprehend that he actually gets to do this for a living. It’s deliberately lightweight and mainstream and, thanks to its host, Philip Rosenthal, incredibly popular. Not for nothing is his production company called Lucky Bastards.</p> <p>But then Rosenthal knows a lot about the power of the mainstream. Before his second career as a host took off, he was the creator and showrunner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/may/09/everybody-loves-raymond-lee-mack\">Everybody Loves Raymond</a>, a sitcom that may have occasionally baffled critics, but drew viewers in their tens of millions. Speaking over Zoom from a colossal spare room in his Los Angeles home – a teddy bear here, a guitar there – Rosenthal, 62, gives every impression of being exactly as delighted doing press interviews as he is wolfing down gambas al ajillo on a Madrid backstreet.</p> <p>“I’m impressed a lot,” he says with a wide grin that almost never leaves his face. “People have even said to me: ‘It looks like you love everything.’ And the truth is, I do love everything, or at least everything I put in the show.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbe65a977a5510961481b94a4722ddedf1d59dd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbe65a977a5510961481b94a4722ddedf1d59dd0/868_63_2550_1530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Rosenthal is spoon-fed ice-cream while wearing a lei in Hawaii\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sundae best … Rosenthal in Hawaii for Somebody Feed Phil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Somebody Feed Phil’s upcoming fifth season, Rosenthal very gently stretches the parameters of what he’s willing to put in the show. When he originally pitched it, his tagline was essentially: “Imagine if Bourdain was frightened of everything.” But now, in one episode, you can see him happily munching his way through a pile of bugs.</p> <p>“I never want to be rude,” he says. “I never want to insult anybody’s culture or even their personal feelings. So generally, if it’s served to me, I’m going to taste it at the very least.”</p> <p>I’ve interviewed people from food shows before and, without naming any names, the constant consumption that their job requires has a way of souring them a little. In person they’re often bloated and ungrateful and impossible to impress. But Rosenthal appears to be the precise opposite: trim, happy, almost vibrating with enthusiasm. Does he ever have to fake it on camera, I wonder.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You know how they do dog food commercials? They don’t feed the dog until the camera rolls. So, I’m the dog</p> <footer> <cite>Phil Rosenthal</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Apparently not. “I want to be excited when I eat,” he says, explaining that on shooting days he’ll usually eat nothing but what he’s given for the show. “You know how they do dog food commercials? They don’t feed the dog until the camera rolls. So, I’m the dog.”</p> <p>There’s a refreshing lack of edge to Rosenthal, and this has been his professional calling card for years. When he ran Everybody Loves Raymond, the series became renowned for being a genuinely nice place to work, which is completely at odds with the sea-of-sharks ambience of the wider television industry.</p> <p>“We learned what <em>not</em> to do from working on other things,” he says. “I had been a little abused in the workplace. Niceties were done away with. We got a note once, when I was working on a popular show. It read: ‘We noticed some of you are coming in in the morning and putting milk on your cereal. The milk is for coffee. The cereal is for snacks. We do not provide breakfast for you.’ And I thought: ‘Wow, the mind it took to think of that memo and then write it and then distribute it to everyone in the company. Is that what you want to tell the people that work for you?’ And I thought there and then: if I’m ever lucky enough to have my own show, we’re gonna have milk on our cereal.”</p> <p>It’s a decent life lesson, if nothing else. The way Rosenthal tells it, his niceness has a rigidity to it, a way of keeping things the way you want them to be. “There are always power plays, people who try to get your job, people who try to get you fired,” he says. “But once you know who you are and how you want it to be, it gets easy. Everything’s a choice. It doesn’t mean that I don’t get angry and frustrated, because it can be maddening. But as long as you put out ‘nice’, I find that you get ‘nice’ back most of the time.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de0f3cc794c686017d158d4e0c5e440edd37aa83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de0f3cc794c686017d158d4e0c5e440edd37aa83/335_58_3503_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Rosenthal holds up his hand coloured with dye or paint, before a table laden with food\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hands on … Somebody Feed Phil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps my favourite Rosenthal project ever is Exporting Raymond, a 2010 documentary about his visit to Russia, which had just bought the rights to Everybody Loves Raymond. Throughout the film, we see his capacity for niceness get tested to its limits. He gives notes to the Russian producers, and he is blanked. The costume designer wants everyone dressed in couture. At one point – and this might qualify as the darkest Rosenthal has ever been on camera – he stands, forlorn, in a mouldy, dimly lit studio corridor. “Listen,” he sighs, motioning to a flickering fluorescent light. “You can actually hear the cancer.”</p> <p>“That’s my family’s favourite film, because of how much I suffered,” he says with a smile when I bring it up. “I don’t know why the Russians invited me. The comedy of the film transcends that specific situation and becomes about how hard it is to get your ideas across to anyone else. I have that in my house.”</p> <p>But, in a very Rosenthal way, the Russian series eventually attained wild success. “We’re in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most successful adaptation of a show in another country in history,” he tells me. “And I take no credit for this, because they didn’t listen to me at all. They did exactly what they wanted. I once saw a clip of the show on YouTube and, all of a sudden, the door opens and a nurse walks in. A cartoon of a nurse with big breasts and her blouse cut down to here, and big hips swivelling, like ‘whoo, whoo, whoo’. I called the company and I said, ‘What is this? We never had this in the show.’ And they said: ‘We like nurses.’ That’s it. You can’t fight it. And it worked. Good for them.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I do write sitcoms, but nobody wants them. I don’t know what it is. I’m gonna guess that it’s me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With his front-of-camera career going better than ever, I ask if he still thinks about returning to writing sitcoms. And, just for a flicker, the Rosenthal smile drops. “I do write sitcoms, but nobody wants them,” he says. “Every year I write one or two scripts, usually with other people. I don’t have the time to run a show any more, but what I would do is supervise another younger person. I’m happy to co-create, I’m happy to mentor, I’m happy to help and fix. I know how to do that. But nobody wants them. I don’t know what it is. I’m gonna guess that it’s me. Maybe I don’t have it any more.”</p> <p>Happily, at least, he still has his travel shows, and a new food podcast and book, to keep him going. And he is a passionate advocate of travel as a way to broaden minds. His eyes were first opened to travel in his early 20s, when he took a courier flight to Europe. “I was 23, and back then DHL would send their cargo as a passenger’s excess baggage. So they would buy you a coach ticket to one of their cities, and give you all the luggage tags for their cargo. And when you got off the plane in Frankfurt, there’s a man standing in the terminal with a DHL sign. You hand him the luggage tags, and you are free to go. You now have two weeks on your own to do whatever you want, and then come back and do the same thing on the return flight. I did that three times, and it changed my life.</p> <p>“Here’s what I’ve learned in my travels,” he continues. “Most people are so much better than their governments. You meet sweet people everywhere, even in these countries that we’re supposed to hate. It’s not the people, it’s who’s in charge. And they’re the ones who are in the news. So we make these crazy generalisations about the people. It’s never the people. It’s these jerks.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/05/forget-friends-the-25-greatest-overlooked-sitcoms-from-lovesick-to-younger-comedy-tv-shows-lockdown\">Forget Friends!

It is something that you can never take for granted again. I never want to lose this feeling. So my message to people is very easy: go.”</p> <p>• Somebody Feed Phil returns to Netflix on 25 May.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/may/25/therapy-v-medication-how-to-choose-the-best-treatment-for-anxiety","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T09:00:31Z","webTitle":"Therapy v medication?

Here’s how to work out what is best for you","body":"<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a soaring demand for mental health services, with an estimated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/21/england-second-pandemic-mental-health-issues-nhs-covid\" title=\"\">1.6 million people in England waiting for specialised support</a>, and another 8 million who would benefit but whose deterioration in mental health is not considered serious enough to even get on the waiting list. Anxiety rates have been recorded as rising significantly between 2008 (the year of the financial crash) and 2018, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/14/uk-has-experienced-explosion-in-anxiety-since-2008-study-finds\" title=\"\">increases in all age groups</a> under 55, but trebling in young adults.</p> <p>The number of prescriptions issued for anti-anxiety medication has also been rising. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/22/women-and-young-adults-propel-huge-rise-in-use-of-anti-anxiety-drugs\" title=\"\">research was published</a> showing that between 2003 and 2008 the use of drugs to treat anxiety was steady, but by 2018 it had risen considerably. During that earlier period, new anti-anxiety prescriptions rose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/22/women-and-young-adults-propel-huge-rise-in-use-of-anti-anxiety-drugs\">from 25 or 26 per 1,000 person years at risk – a measure of the prevalence of anxiety – to 43.6 in 2018</a>. Nearly twice the number of women are being prescribed medication as men.</p> <p>This rise could be due to a number of things. “I think GPs are getting much better at detecting anxiety,” says Charlotte Archer, senior research associate in primary care mental health at the University of Bristol, who led the study. Before, she says, there were concerns “it would go undiagnosed. I think that’s starting to change. And that is going to have an impact on prescribing rates.” She also thinks patients are more aware, not just of anxiety but how it can be treated. “They know that they want a prescription. I don’t think that’s always been the case.”</p> <p>When people see their GP, says Dr Trudi Seneviratne, consultant psychiatrist and Registrar of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, treatment is “very much led by what individuals want. ‘How severe is it and how would you best like to manage it?’ is often the conversation. If it is more mild to moderate, would you like to go down the route of talking therapies? Would you like a combination of psychological therapies plus a medication? What are the other lifestyle changes that you can make to manage this anxiety?”</p> <p>Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as sertraline and citalopram, are most commonly used. “Anxiety and depression can go together,” says Seneviratne. “You don’t necessarily get somebody just with anxiety, although you can.” Antidepressants, such as the SNRI group, can be used if an SSRI hasn’t worked. “The other group we use are benzodiazepines, which are sedative drugs – things like lorazepam or diazepam – but they should only really be used in the short term because they can be addictive.” Others include beta blockers, medication used for epilepsy and anti-psychotic drugs. Depending on the drug, side-effects can range from headaches and nausea to a reduced sex drive and even increased anxiety. The latest thinking on medication suggests that it is not to be generally considered “lifelong” as Seneviratne puts it, and it should be monitored and reviewed about every three months.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With milder forms of anxiety, people should initially be offered psychological therapy such as counselling or CBT</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Medication tends to be prescribed, says Seneviratne, “when anxiety is becoming debilitating … when it’s having a severe impact on quality of life – not being able to sleep, to function, to work, struggling to even do simple things like go out of the house, or maintain self-care.” By that point, someone experiencing anxiety may not be able to effectively engage in therapy.</p> <p>With milder forms of anxiety, she says, people should initially be offered psychological therapy such as counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The latest <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> (Nice) guidelines for depression <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/23/nhs-to-give-therapy-for-depression-before-medication-under-new-guidelines\" title=\"\">recommend other treatments</a> such as therapy, mindfulness and exercise are offered to patients before medication. </p> <p>For some people, it can simply involve making their own lifestyle changes, improving diet, sleep and exercise. If that doesn’t work, “then from mild to moderate, and for more severe anxiety, talking therapy should always be offered”. However, Seneviratne adds, “access to talking therapies is really patchy and there’s huge waiting times depending on where you are”. What isn’t clear is whether medication is being prescribed where there are long waiting lists for talking therapies. For people who need more urgent help and don’t want to take medication, private therapy can cost upwards of £40 per hour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a98473290608987b50849340b777bf95b5418f3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a98473290608987b50849340b777bf95b5418f3c/2000_0_4000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pills\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>“There’s a dizzying array of therapies, which can be confusing for the sufferer,” says Dr Stephen Blumenthal, a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst. “Broadly speaking, they’re grouped into two types – one, which is more exploratory, which treats the anxiety as a symptom of something underlying, which needs to be understood. And on the other side of the spectrum, are [therapies] more aimed at relieving symptoms.” The latter tend to be behavioural therapies such as CBT and DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy, which is based on cognitive therapy but incorporates an element of acceptance at the same time) which are, he says, “basically strategies to deal with the fear. It’s not mutually exclusive with a more psychodynamic approach, which would be to try and explore what it means.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For many people, medications cover up symptoms for the time that the person is in a state of anxiety, and can undermine natural coping mechanisms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He adds: “Of course there are times when it is necessary to take medication.” But he is wary of it being seen as a quick fix. “Suffering from anxiety can be so utterly crippling that you want to resolve it as quickly as possible,” he says. And our mental health service, “under severe strain as it is, it’s extremely action-orientated. When somebody presents to a GP, you’re going to have seven minutes, and the poor GP is under a deluge of people, about <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/news/40-per-cent-of-all-gp-appointments-about-mental-health/\" title=\"\">40%</a> of whom involve mental health problems of one kind or another.” He believes that, for many people, anti-anxiety medications “don’t resolve anything, they just cover up the symptoms for the time that the person is in a state of anxiety, and they can actually undermine our natural coping mechanisms”. Coping strategies, he says, “need to be supported with psychological therapies”.</p> <p>In July last year, Hannah Duran’s depression and anxiety – which had been recurring for years – began to worsen. “I felt that I needed a little more help,” she says. She referred herself to the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service (IAPT), which runs in England, but heard nothing. By February, unable to cope, she was signed off work. “Coincidentally, the day after I went off sick I got a call from a local talking therapies to offer me an appointment,” she says. Then that appointment was cancelled, and so was the rearranged date. Nine months on from her initial contact, she says she still hasn’t been offered treatment. The NHS recently reported that almost 90% of IAPT referrals for talking therapies in England were on average seen within six weeks but it varies by area and people have reported long waits.</p> <p>Paying for private therapy isn’t possible for Duran, but she did access counselling that she started in March, through the mental health charity <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mind</a>. “They’ve been fantastic,” she says, but she is frustrated that the IAPT service wasn’t available. “I think there’s every possibility that I wouldn’t have gone off sick if I’d had access to therapy sooner. Things just got worse and worse until I reached breaking point.”</p> <p>Talking therapy can work for some people but not others, and it’s the same with medication. For Duran, a combination of both has been effective. For others, medication has not been effective. Freya Jenkins has suffered anxiety for most of her life, and was recently hospitalised for a week after her mental health rapidly declined last January. She has been on beta blockers, a short course of diazepam and, for the last two months, venlafaxine, an SNRI. “I haven’t noticed any difference,” she says. She would prefer to have therapy but needs longer-term and specialised treatment, under the care of a psychologist, and now faces a wait, even though she’s clearly struggling. “I’ve had someone tell me [it could be] up to a year,” she says. “It’s not the NHS’s fault. There’s not enough funding and it needs an overhaul.”</p> <p>• <em>Some names have been changed.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"money/2022/may/25/im-begging-the-government-to-listen-martin-lewis-on-getting-political-mental-health-and-the-cost-of-living-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T09:00:31Z","webTitle":"‘I’m begging the government to listen’: Martin Lewis on getting political, mental health and the cost of living crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/25/im-begging-the-government-to-listen-martin-lewis-on-getting-political-mental-health-and-the-cost-of-living-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/may/25/im-begging-the-government-to-listen-martin-lewis-on-getting-political-mental-health-and-the-cost-of-living-crisis","fields":{"headline":"‘I’m begging the government to listen’: Martin Lewis on getting political, mental health and the cost of living crisis","trailText":"The broadcaster and financial expert started out searching for cut-price credit card deals. But with ‘shocking’ levels of poverty he has become a champion for the vulnerable - and he wants those in power to act","body":"<p>Martin Lewis is in his happy place. The keen walker is sitting in an outdoor cafe in a London park he loves, and, a couple of days shy of his 50th birthday, is a contented family man who assiduously expunges any swearing from the record in case his nine-year-old daughter happens to read this piece.</p> <p>When he left a postgraduate journalism degree in Cardiff more than 20 years ago, he had a seemingly simple idea: “I always wanted to be the person on This Morning talking about money. When you watch something like that,” he says, “you see the stylists and you see the hairdressers and you see the cooks and you see the psychiatrists, you see all of these people and they talk about changing people’s lives. Well, you can’t do any of that without money.” It’s an idea that has gained him great wealth – the Sunday Times rich list puts it at £123m, mainly due to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jun/01/martin-lewis-sells-moneysavingexpert\">sale of his website</a> MoneySavingExpert, which he built in the early 00s for £100, to the price comparison company MoneySuperMarket. But also household-name status and, more recently, adulation.</p> <p>The admiration didn’t come overnight. It was first noticed during the tortuous Brexit debate, when he was voted, in a general poll, the most trusted voice on the issue. When I suggest that he’s now a new-wave Marcus Rashford – in that he is offering a forceful critique of the status quo, from a place you weren’t expecting – he says: “Well, I’ve been around a lot longer.”</p> <p>Yet despite his success, his manner is anything but carefree. And while that has many causes, the immediate one is the cost of living crisis. On this he has emerged from a sea of wilful political obliviousness as one of the most trenchant and steadfast voices. Two weeks ago, he says, “I made a deliberate, nuanced and specific comment, which is that <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/cost-of-living-crisis-money-saving-expert-martin-lewis-says-hes-out-of-tools-to-help-people-save-money-1528323\">I’m virtually out of tools when it comes to helping people on energy</a>, especially the poorest.” It was a shocking statement from anyone, but more so from Lewis, thanks to his uncontroversial persona.</p> <p>He wrestled with saying this, “because it was an obvious, political (small-p) comment”. And there was criticism ranging from, he says, “tweets like: ‘You’re the problem because you put a sticking plaster over the system and you basically should never have helped anybody because all you’ve done is inure them to the dangers of capitalism’ [I sense he is paraphrasing a bit] to: ‘Come on mate, say it as it is. Call them [the government] out.’ Well, even if I wanted to, that’s not who I am.”</p> <p>Plainly, though, what makes this situation “shocking and scary and anxiety-driving” – he says this with feeling – is not his own standing but the situation itself. This is very much the end of the road, and even while he describes that in very neutral, almost bank-manager-y language – “micro-money management is no longer a suitable tool for many on the very lowest incomes to get through this” – he’s on the side of the consumer. In other words, while he sounds and dresses a bit like the Man, he’s on our side, a sheep in wolf’s clothing. I think that’s partly why people like him so much.</p> <p>As an indication of how serious things have got, he describes a section on <a href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/\">his website, MoneySavingExpert</a>. It’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/martin-lewiss-cost-of-living-guide-offers-advice-to-desperate-households\">called Heat the Human, Not the Home</a> and is a granular look at ways to layer your clothing, the best power-heated gloves and heated insoles – all so that you’re spending 40p not £40 on keeping warm. The fact this could be so essential is depressing. “None of this is good. I regret having to produce this guide. But I have to provide options for people who tell me they cannot heat their home. I think it’s absolutely legitimate, but slightly tragic for my site to be doing that.”</p> <p>It also puts him in a delicate balance; if he comes out against the government, he loses his impartiality, which is partly why he is so trusted. “If you’re asked to be independent as you give a view, you’re not independent any more.” But he has a strong sense of justice, around energy bills in particular: “Unless you’re in a super big house, most people’s energy bills are roughly similar, whether rich or poor. So it’s a poll tax. That’s why it’s so visceral, even if people don’t define it as that in their heads.” Besides, he says: “If politicians had my mailbag, you would understand the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/10/civil-unrest-due-to-rising-energy-bills-isnt-far-away-says-martin-lewis\">genuine, real problems that are happening out there</a>. And therefore we’d have to solve them.”</p> <p>His pronouns slide all over the place, from “they” to “you” to “we”, in his anxiety not to sound as if he’s hectoring a “them”. “I want the government to listen. I want them to fix this. I am not saying these things to try and make the government lose the election. I’m saying these things to try and make the government help people. It’s about praying, convincing, you know, desperately crossing my fingers. Please, please … begging them to listen.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/may/25/from-the-archive-the-money-saving-expert-how-martin-lewis-became-the-most-trusted-man-in-britain-podcast\">From the archive: The Money Saving Expert: how Martin Lewis became the most trusted man in Britain – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is, as he’s the first to point out, “an enormous distance” from the Martin Lewis of 2002, doing Deal of the Day on the satellite channel Simply Money. Then, he was a young man, “thinking: ‘Look at me, I’m being so clever and I’m playing the system, and nobody has done this before.’” He still takes a lot of delight in his devilment, reminiscing about the time he showed anyone who was listening how they could use a cashback offer on a credit card balance transfer twice in one week to walk away with £500, and he’s still laughing now as he concludes “the whole marketing of finance has changed because of what we did. They would never put that stuff out there now because they know I’ll tell 8 million people in a minute, and it’s gonna cost a lot of money.”</p> <p>But over time, his focus changed – first, towards customer rip-offs, and then two massive campaigns. “We got people £1bn back on bank charges and then £12bn on PPI, right?” he says casually, as if he found £12bn down the back of a sofa. Later, he sounds more sombre: “Boy, could we do that with that now.”</p> <p>Gradually, he became more preoccupied with people who were going under, either being deliberately ripped off or just not equipped to deal with the complexity of the system, particularly, but not exclusively around social security. This led him, among other things, to devise a financial literacy element to the school curriculum, and launch the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute in 2016, the work of which is essentially bug-fixing for society.</p> <p>Take bailiffs, for example. “There are special requirements on how they deal with vulnerable customers, which is as it should be. Currently we assume that you don’t have a mental health problem. But – we’re still working on this, so I’m going to leave it as a grey stat – 50% of people who have a bailiff visit have a mental health problem. If you can be hospitalised for anxiety and meet a bailiff the day you came out, that is not a civilised society.”</p> <p>This led to the creation of Breathing Space, a debt-respite scheme launched by the government last year. It’s refreshing how he brings exactly the same tenacity to everything, whether it’s saving you 50p in Pret or making sure you don’t get sanctioned by the benefits office. He doesn’t have a special tone of voice he deploys to talk about the “vulnerable”, the way so many do. “My work is to help people be better with money. I don’t differentiate.” And yet, because a lot of life has happened to him during his career, it has changed the way he thinks. “When you navel gaze, and you do it for so long,” he says, “you do end up developing a philosophy.”</p> <p>He hit a hump in the road about 15 years ago, when he was 35. “I realised my own fallibility. My mental health wasn’t as robust as I thought it was.” Before then, he had thought he was invincible. He’d had an uneventful, rural childhood. “I didn’t grow up with money, but nor did I grow up poor”. But when he was 12, his mother was killed in a car accident. The rest of his school years were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/07/money-saving-expert-martin-lewis-tells-of-childhood-trauma\">capsized by appalling grief and anxiety</a>; he was almost housebound with it at times. When he got to the London School of Economics for his undergraduate degree, it was only the third time he had been to the capital. “Then I just exploded with life and confidence. I thought: ‘Wow, life is here, and I can do things.’ Coming out of years of grief and trauma. Which can be very annoying,” he reflects.</p> <p>“I was very in your face. I was nice; I wasn’t horrible. But I was just OTT.” This buoyancy carried him all the way through his 20s, working for Brunswick, the financial and corporate PR company, then doing journalism at Cardiff, and bursting into consumer finance like a dog with a really good-value bone. He always had a new idea. And he thought he would probably go into politics eventually. But then he had what he describes as one of his “dark times. When I find life difficult to deal with. I remember the first time that really hit me hard, thinking: ‘Thank goodness I can take time off work, and I don’t have to worry about paying the bills.’ This interlinking of money and mental health is so profound. I vowed to myself that, when I was in a position to do something about that for others, I would.”</p> <p>Once he started talking to charities – he mentions the Citizens Advice (CA) and National Energy Action, but mental illness charities speak incredibly highly of the relationships they have had with him, too – his compassion met his inner terrier. During the campaign against unfair bank charges, he produced a template letter, and someone from CA told him 15% of people weren’t taking “Your name” out before they wrote their name, while 5% weren’t writing their own details in at all, they were just sending the template in blank.</p> <p>“That was one of my epiphany moments. One in 20 people who’d had money taken off them unfairly couldn’t understand that you need to put your own name and address in the template letter. They’ve been ripped off, and they’ve got so desperate that they tried, but they can’t do it. I still find that quite a moving statistic now.”</p> <p>He rattles off all these grotesquely complicated modern bureaucracies – how the form for universal credit is too complicated for some people to fill out, yet the paperwork you have to do to assign someone else to do it for you is more complicated still. And he’s in no doubt about the gravity of the situation: “These stats are a couple of years out of date, but debt is an absolute monster. It’s debilitating. Four hundred thousand people consider <a href=\"https://www.moneyandmentalhealth.org/financial-difficulties-suicide/\">taking their own lives each year because of financial issues</a>, and 100,000 attempt it.”</p> <p>Now his mission has crept again, because a person who spreadsheets in his sleep cannot <em>not </em>join dots, so he’s looking down the line to the energy hikes in the autumn and says the figures for household bills are looking “amazing, awful, awesome in the worst sense. What I’m trying to get across to politicians is: ‘You have to do something or people’s lives are gonna be destroyed.’”</p> <p>In the days that follow this interview, the picture unfurls as Lewis said it would: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/energy-bills-likely-to-rise-by-800-in-october-says-ofgem-chief\">new forecast for October’s energy cap is £2,800</a>, an unthinkable amount for millions of people. He takes no pleasure in being right on this stuff: in an ideal world, he would be helping people make a sound decision between a VW Golf and a Ford Focus. But his combination of pragmatism and empathy has landed him on the frontline, where he’ll stay and fight.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 25 May 2022.

Basu writes: “This is an indictment of our senior leadership post-Macpherson report, not the vast majority of our frontline staff, who don’t deserve this stigma created by a minority in their ranks and the failure of their leadership to promote diversity. I am as guilty as any.</p> <p>“We may be better than we were, but we are complacent. Society has moved faster and further than we have.”</p> <p>Citing research showing policing will take six decades to have the same proportion of minority ethnic officers in its ranks as in the population, Basu calls for the law to be changed to allow positive discrimination. A form of it was tried as part of wholesale sweeping reforms to policing in Northern Ireland and was seen as helping to reduce Catholic mistrust.</p> <p>Basu writes: “No one I know with protected characteristics wants positive discrimination – I didn’t 30 years ago – but I am an assistant commissioner now, not a PC struggling to be recognised.

Basu reached the final two, Hogan-Howe did not.

Basu says the blueprint for solving policing’s race crisis can help bridge gaps with other communities: “The black community is not the only part of society that is losing trust and confidence in us. The actions we take in this plan are transferable.</p> <p>“We can and must reconnect with the public, as Robert Peel wanted when he first said that the public were the police and the police were the public.

His pick ’n’ mix collection of performers arrived for rehearsals in 2020 only to return home the following day because of rising Covid cases. Now, he hopes the piece will chime with pandemic-weary audiences who want to let go a little – although the single-room setting is bound to prompt flashbacks to lockdown. “Those bloody walls!” he groans, remembering his spell of isolation.</p> <p>In the absence of plot, he likes to give the audience a tempo. “We can follow a beat,” he says, explaining that we are not just creatures of intellect but of “rhythm and unconscious yearnings”. If there is a philosophy to the show, he says, it is to “embrace chaos”. Did he give his performers similar advice for the creation process? “I try to tell them it should be about their head, too. If all I do is direct my dream, it’s kind of a lonely process. I need their madness.” The production has become a cultural exchange of sorts: the musicians roam around the stage, guided by Thierrée, while he is singing on stage for the first time.</p> <p>“Usually I’m just a guy moving,” he says, somewhat underselling his incredible dexterity. But the rehearsals raised a question: “How about this movement produces a voice too?” Before long he was adding dialogue in various languages and rapping. But none of this should be a surprise, he says. “When you come from circus you try stuff – trapeze, acrobatics, juggling … You just put your hands on something and you shake it and see what happens.”</p> <p>This attitude is one inheritance from his illustrious family tree. Thierrée is the great-grandson of Eugene O’Neill, the grandson of Charlie Chaplin and the son of Jean-Baptiste Thiérrée and Victoria Chaplin, with whose travelling circus he and his sister <a href=\"http://aureliathierree.com/\">Aurélia</a> performed from a young age. He glows as he recalls a world where “the act is just the act – a proposal and a response”. In music hall, “anyone with an idea could be a star. That used to fascinate me. Someone could do some funny stuff with a cigar and do that act for 20 years.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fea3d6b5ca10139628c770e7b105cd68eb5fe847\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fea3d6b5ca10139628c770e7b105cd68eb5fe847/0_0_4961_3309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Upended … Thierrée’s Room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Haughton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chocolat, the 2016 film directed by Roschdy Zem and starring Thierrée, explored the durability of those traditions amid changing tastes and new technologies. In it he plays George Foottit, who teams up with Rafael “Chocolat” Padilla (Lupin’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/30/omar-sy-star-of-lupin-on-hollywood-racism-and-his-big-break\">Omar Sy</a>), for a clowning act in belle époque Paris. Both give superb performances – Thierrée is brooding and inscrutable, bottled up for almost the entire movie until he bursts into a smile in its bittersweet climax. The film closes with archive footage of the real-life Foottit and Chocolat performing their act. How much of Thierrée’s own work has been recorded? “I’ve been really bad at it,” he grimaces. Archive recordings serve a purpose but he is sceptical about the artistic merits of filmed theatre – “the beauty of it is that it is ephemeral”, he suggests. “That’s our lot: we need to be very bright and then fade with our absence from stage.”</p> <p>Playwrights and choreographers leave a legacy in the scripts and steps they create that are handed on to future interpreters. Thierrée’s productions are perhaps trickier to preserve. “Do we need to leave a trace?” he asks. “My grandfather left a trace that is ongoing. From our perspective, it’s fantastic. From his perspective, I don’t know – he’s gone. He can’t enjoy it any more.”</p> <p>Chaplin managed the transition from vaudeville to silver screen with spectacular success; the music-hall acts in Chocolat fear their artform will be eclipsed by cinema. A century on, it’s the streaming giants who pose a threat but Thierrée still champions the unrivalled mystery of the stage as its USP. “You have to get inside that theatre and take a risk.” His productions become love letters to theatre itself. “It’s a temple and it’s also extremely simple,” he marvels. “The rules of the game in the theatre have always stayed the same, technically. You don’t need many years of training to understand how theatre works: sound, light, set. And yet it keeps renewing. It’s a beautiful subject.” If he ever writes a novel, he says, it will have a stage setting. “Maybe an Agatha Christie inside the theatre,” he cackles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c8007286608685c3a98377c4ba4be6fb821050c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c8007286608685c3a98377c4ba4be6fb821050c/0_290_3850_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tabac Rouge at Sadler’s Wells in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It’s almost overwhelming how free I am’ … Tabac Rouge at Sadler’s Wells in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the meantime he is finishing a screenplay, entitled Grog, that he will direct. It’s an attempt to find a cinematic language that corresponds to the stage work he has created with Compagnie du Hanneton, the outfit he formed in 1998. “Ninety per cent of what I do in theatre I can’t take into cinema,” he reflects. As an actor, his films have ranged from the blockbuster The Emperor of Paris, starring Vincent Cassel, to quirky indies such as Bartleby, Andreas Honneth’s 2010 adaptation of Herman Melville’s story. The latter had a handmade quality, blending silent film techniques, stage trickery and eccentric <a href=\"https://thedramateacher.com/object-theatre/\">object theatre</a> in a manner not dissimilar to Thierrée’s shows. His role as Melville’s scrivener, who adopts the line “I would prefer not to” as a menacing mantra, brilliantly matched his beatific yet brooding countenance.</p> <p>Moonlighting in the movies has, he says, “nourished” his work in theatre. “Being an instrument for the director is interesting – being at the service of someone else’s vision. In my company it’s almost overwhelming how free I am. I don’t even have a play to be faithful to.” He describes the film roles as little missions, whereas he has inhabited the world of Room for more than two years now – and will do for several months yet on the road.</p> <p>For Thierrée, the apartment in the show is a character with its own agenda – “more than just your own needs” – and, like any room, evokes memories of past occupiers. Much like theatre buildings themselves, then, providing a space for companies to move in, make their mark and move on? He smiles. “<em>Oui, c’est ça</em>.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Room is <a href=\"https://compagnieduhanneton.com/en/creation/ROOM\">touring Europe</a> and is at the <a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/events/room\">King’s theatre, Edinburgh</a>, from 13 to 17 August as part of the Edinburgh international festival.

If you guessed that we’re about to discuss college football, you are correct. Last week, Alabama’s Nick Saban and Texas A&amp;M’s Jimbo Fisher traded insults, suggesting that nobody is quite sure how the new era of college football, in which players can now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jul/01/ncaa-pay-players-endorsements-college-football-basketball-ncaa-new-rules\">make money from sponsorship deals</a>, is supposed to operate.</p> <p>Saban shot first. After Texas A&amp;M were named as having this year’s No 1 recruiting class, Saban went on the offensive. “We were second in recruiting last year,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/19/alabamas-nick-saban-says-texas-am-bought-every-player-on-their-team\">he said</a>, “A&amp;M was first. A&amp;M bought every player on their team. Made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jul/01/ncaa-pay-players-endorsements-college-football-basketball-ncaa-new-rules\">a deal for name, image and likeness</a> [NIL]. We didn’t buy one player.”</p> <p>To be more specific, Saban was accusing Fisher of luring players by promising them NIL perks. Before last year’s rule change, the NCAA didn’t allow players to capitalize on their fame through endorsements or paid public appearances. It’s still uncertain how these changes will be monitored by the NCAA, but Saban seemed convinced that the Aggies head coach was doing something unethical while amplifying rumors that boosters connected to the program had directly or indirectly promised <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/college-football-sports-alabama-texas-aandm-aggies-football-jimbo-fisher-5f0839a1d35bfda32e58b1c6f71eda36\">upwards of $30m</a> to this year’s recruits.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/07/race-money-and-exploitation-why-college-sport-is-still-the-new-plantation\">Race, money and exploitation: why college sport is still the ‘new plantation’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During a very lengthy public response, Fisher first defended his players (and, of course, himself). “We never bought anybody,” the coach <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/college-football-sports-alabama-texas-aandm-aggies-football-jimbo-fisher-5f0839a1d35bfda32e58b1c6f71eda36\">said last Thursday</a>. “No rules are broken. Nothing was done wrong. It’s a shame that you’ve got to sit here and defend 17-year-old kids and families and Texas A&amp;M.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3-DXTj1QoY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y3-DXTj1QoY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>All of that was well and good. Fisher, who happened to be Saban’s offensive coordinator at LSU for a spell, deserved the right to respond to serious accusations. However, where he went next took this from a petty squabble to all out war.</p> <p>After labeling Saban a “narcissist,” Fisher painted his former boss as a near Satanic force in the sport. “We build him up to be the czar of football. Go dig into his past, or anybody’s that’s ever coached with him. You can find out anything you want to find out, what he does and how he does it. It’s despicable,” said Fisher.</p> <p>Fisher has one thing on his side: Saban <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espnmag/story?section=magazine&amp;id=3683575\">is uniquely hated</a> among college football fans, in a similar way to New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick’s standing with NFL fans. The antipathy directed at both men is due to a combination of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban#Head_coaching_record\">their ridiculous levels of success</a>, blunt personalities and the impression that their teams benefit from borderline illegal practices. Fisher is almost assuredly correct when he says that others around football feel the same way, especially opponents who have watched Saban win seven national championships, six with Alabama.</p> <p>However, Fisher both <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/jimbo-fisher-didnt-start-a-feud-with-nick-saban-but-he-sure-did-escalate-it-was-that-wise-011948590.html\">responded too harshly</a> and left himself vulnerable to counterattacks. After Fisher left Florida State University, plenty of stories emerged that depicted him establishing <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2841875-the-mess-jimbo-left-inside-fsus-fall-and-willie-taggarts-plan-to-rise-again\">a culture of entitlement</a>, particularly with star quarterback Jameis Winston. While fans may enjoy him tearing into the wildly despised Saban, this feels like an Alien v Predator situation: whoever wins, we lose.</p> <p>The public potshots may be the result of veteran coaches adjusting to a shift in the power dynamics of college sports. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/30/ncaa-student-athlete-compensation-nil-case\">NIL deals </a>allow so-called “student-athletes” to make money from their fame and on-field success (which are typically, but not always, connected).</p> <p>NIL wasn’t a move that the NCAA made willingly: it took a Supreme Court decision to force the organization’s hand. It’s a decision that has threatened the sport’s old guard, which is not used to players <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/07/race-money-and-exploitation-why-college-sport-is-still-the-new-plantation\">having any economic leverage whatsoever</a>. And players with economic leverage are less willing to do everything their coach tells them, particularly if they feel they can find a better deal at another college.</p> <p>Saban, after all, did not limit his attacks to Fisher’s program. Indeed he also called out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/17/deion-sanders-jackson-state-coach-hbcus-college-football\">Jackson State</a> and the University of Miami, clearly concerned that the old way of doing things is on its way out. After claiming that his program didn’t “buy” a single player, Saban railed against how things have changed, “I don’t know if we’re going to be able to sustain that in the future, because more and more people are doing it. It’s tough.” He also conceded that his own players are making money – $3m total was his estimate – but that they are “doing it the right way.”</p> <p>This is all an attempt to establish a moral high ground in an industry – and college football <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/07/race-money-and-exploitation-why-college-sport-is-still-the-new-plantation\">is very much an industry</a> – where ethics are often sorely lacking. In practice, college football the “law” usually means whatever you can get away with. If Saban sounds unusually rattled, it’s because he’s no longer exactly sure what the rules are.</p> <p>Saban has long had the advantage of selling recruits on what playing for Alabama mreans: they have a realistic shot at winning a championship every year and possibly even of making it to the NFL. It’s an advantage that programs like Texas A&amp;M don’t have, so it’s easy to understand why the Aggies would seek out alternate ways to entice players – and it’s also easy to understand why Saban would feel threatened.</p> <p>What schools can get away with is now changing in real time and, with <a href=\"https://www.foxsports.com.au/nfl/college-football-news-2022-nick-saban-vs-jimbo-fisher-nil-payments-recruiting-alabama-texas-am-paying-players/news-story/a5a8d7845dff731c769266d481435607\">different states having different rules</a> governing NIL rights, the waters are more muddied than ever. It’s also possible that even elite head coaches are worried that power is starting to shift towards the players.</p> <p>They need not worry on that front. No matter how much players’ newfound revenue changes the dynamics in college sports, the industry remains centered around the coaches that run teams like their own private kingdoms. After all, unlike in professional sports, players can only remain in college for so long and even star quarterbacks like Winston remain cogs – albeit crucial ones – in much larger systems. Maybe that will change one day, but chances are that it will be long after Saban and Fisher have moved on.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/25/egypt-climate-finance-top-of-agenda-cop27-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T08:39:30Z","webTitle":"Egypt says climate finance must be top of agenda at Cop27 talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/25/egypt-climate-finance-top-of-agenda-cop27-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/25/egypt-climate-finance-top-of-agenda-cop27-talks","fields":{"headline":"Egypt says climate finance must be top of agenda at Cop27 talks","trailText":"Host of November’s summit wants focus to be on ‘moving from pledges to implementation’","body":"<p>Financial assistance for developing countries must be at the top of the agenda for UN climate talks this year, the host country, Egypt, has made clear, as governments will be required to follow through on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/15/ratchets-phase-downs-and-a-fragile-agreement-how-cop26-played-out\">promises made at the Cop26 summit last year</a>.</p> <p>Egypt will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/21/cop27-is-in-egypt-next-year-but-will-anyone-be-allowed-to-protest\">host Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh</a> in November.

And we want to highlight what are the practical policies and practices, the processes that can actually push the pledges [into action], to bridge that gap.”</p> <p>She added: “We want this Cop to be about the practicalities: what is it that we need to do to operationalise the pledges into implementation?”</p> <p>Some countries have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/analysis-shows-climate-finance-not-reaching-most-vulnerable\">difficulty gaining access to finance</a>, she noted, and that must be addressed with new ways of “de-risking” finance, to attract private sector investors. This could be done through governments providing guarantees or other assurances to private lenders, or co-investing with them.</p> <p>“One of the successes from Glasgow which will always be remembered is how the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/14/cash-coal-cars-and-trees-what-progress-has-been-made-since-cop26\">private sector was mobilised</a> in a very important way,” Mashat told the Guardian. “So instead of just billions, the word trillions started coming up. </p> <p>“However, these trillions from the private sector commitments or pledges can never make their way to the countries that need them most, unless we have more synergy between [public sector] development finance and private capital to create de-risking tools.”</p> <p>Mohamed Maait, the Egyptian finance minister, also spoke of the need to address bigger finance issues, such as the “huge burden” of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/27/poorer-countries-spend-five-times-more-on-debt-than-climate-crisis-report\">mounting debt that many poor countries are facing</a>. “Most developing countries are in debt. Can we do something to engage those countries? Can we reduce this burden and assist them towards net zero?” he said.</p> <p>Maait made it clear that tackling the debt burden, which inhibits countries from taking measures that would reduce emissions, and making investments that would help them cope with the effects of the climate crisis, would be a key priority for Egypt. “We need to sit down together and come up with a solution – the alternative is to let the risks increase, the challenges increase, and people’s suffering increase,” he said.</p> <p>Helping poor countries cut their emissions, and become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2021/nov/07/how-vital-is-adapting-to-a-changed-climate-just-ask-a-poor-country\">more resilient to the effects of extreme weather</a> would benefit rich countries too, he added. “The risks of climate change are not for one country but for all of us,” he said.</p> <p>Rich countries would also need to find ways to compensate poor countries for not extracting more oil and gas, he said. He gave the example of Senegal, where<a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/germany-could-help-explore-senegal-151215557.html\"> major gas discoveries are expected</a> that could transform the economy – but would also constitute a vast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/may/11/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas\">“carbon bomb”</a>, of the kind that if exploited would lead to temperatures far exceeding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/11/cop26-jargon-buster\">the 1.5C temperature limit targeted in Glasgow</a>.</p> <p>“Senegal were hoping this discovery would help them.

possibility of a better budget bottom line due to higher commodities prices, Chalmers warned against “assumptions about improvements in the budget”.</p> \n<p>“Commodity prices have been stronger than assumed for a little while now but there’s no guarantee of that uplift in the budget and there are other factors working against us, including some pressures on the budget which were not disclosed or booked by the previous government.”</p> \n<p>Chalmers said that “inflation is worse than Treasury thought not that long ago” – suggesting the budget could reveal a blowout in the cost of infrastructure and other projects – but declined to give specifics about what landmines Labor had uncovered in its briefings.</p> \n<p>Chalmers confirmed <a

\n<p>“This is a really important opportunity to examine the framework, the operations, of the Reserve Bank to make sure that we are making monetary policy in this country in the best possible way and considering the interaction with fiscal policy as well,” he said.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Chalmers hinted that Labor would continue to look for measures to ease the cost of living in its October budget but extending the six-month halving of petrol excise was unlikely.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Since then, it has grown to a company that employs 160 people and has an annual turnover of £34m. Its factory can produce up to 10m cans a year of what is billed as “the only British organic baby milk, with no palm oil or fish oil”.</p> <p>Dylan McMahon, head of growth at Kendamil, said the company obtained permission from the FDA on Tuesday night and would start sending its baby milk across the Atlantic “in the next week or so”.</p> <p>Will McMahon, the commercial director of Kendal Nutricare, said the Covid-19 pandemic had disrupted the supply chain for infant formula, while the Abbott recall caused a 40%-plus shortage of baby formula on shelves in the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said the US had been “a closed shop for baby formula” for decades, where the top four producers account for more than 95% of purchases.</p> <p>“In the United Kingdom, consumers have a much broader selection of products and that availability of foreign brands allows gaps to be filled. This is something relatively unique to the US,” he said.</p> <p>“The bigger opportunity here is as a company we’ve been in touch with the FDA and working with them for over five years with the aim of bringing product into the US. There is enormous curiosity and demand for Kendamil in the States, so we are hopeful that we will have everything in place with the FDA to be able to continue to supply legitimately well beyond November.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/25/bill-irish-official-status-northern-ireland-language-government","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T08:30:51Z","webTitle":"‘It can’t be sidelined’: bill aims to give Irish official status in Northern Ireland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/25/bill-irish-official-status-northern-ireland-language-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/25/bill-irish-official-status-northern-ireland-language-government","fields":{"headline":"‘It can’t be sidelined’: bill aims to give Irish official status in Northern Ireland","trailText":"UK government to table legislation to safeguard language as revival gains momentum","body":"<p>Gregory Campbell, a Democratic Unionist party MP in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a>, once expressed his scorn for the Irish language with six words that became infamous: “<em>Curry my yoghurt, can coca coalyer</em>.”</p> <p>He coined the gibberish phrase in 2014 during an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-29895593\">address to the Stormont assembly</a> to mimic and deride nationalist colleagues who began speeches with “<em>go raibh maith agat, </em><em>ceann </em><em>comhairle</em>”, which means “thank you, chairman”.</p> <p>It caused uproar but Campbell was unrepentant. A DUP conference later cheered him when he brought a pot of yoghurt to the lectern and said curry was for lunch. The message was clear: Irish was for republicans, not unionists.</p> <p>But eight years later the UK government is to table long-delayed legislation to promote and safeguard Irish – and a small, growing number of people from Protestant and unionist backgrounds in Northern Ireland are already learning it.</p> <p>“We have signed up nearly 300 people a year, it’s going really well, we can’t meet the demand,” said Linda Ervine, who runs <a href=\"https://www.ebm.org.uk/turas/\">Turas</a>, an Irish language project in east Belfast, a loyalist heartland. “For the Protestant students who come, it’s surrounded by negativity, yet they still come.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa05ed5efd89bee6e2fec255939cee71baaa9c19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa05ed5efd89bee6e2fec255939cee71baaa9c19/0_357_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The DUP MP Gregory Campbell poured scorn on the Irish language in 2014 with the gibberish phrase: ‘Curry my yoghurt, can coca coalyer.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The DUP MP Gregory Campbell poured scorn on the Irish language in 2014 with the gibberish phrase: ‘<em>Curry my yoghurt, can coca coalyer.’</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A decade ago, Protestants and unionists were nervous about learning Irish, fearing they would be seen as traitors, said Ervine. “Now instead of being worried about friends and neighbours knowing they’re bringing them along.”</p> <p>These classes, in an area bedecked with union jacks and murals of the Queen, underline the shifting fortunes of a language that for centuries was marginalised and discriminated against.</p> <p>On Wednesday Brandon Lewis, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, is to introduce the identity and language (Northern Ireland) bill at Westminster to recognise and protect Irish and foster Ulster Scots.</p> <p>It will give the Irish language official status, allow the use of Irish in courts, create two commissioners plus an office of identity and cultural expression and provide £4m to An Ciste Infheistíochta Gaeilge, an Irish language investment fund. “This bill represents a significant milestone in laying down a new cultural framework,” Lewis said.</p> <p>Irish language activists welcomed the legislation and urged swift implementation. “That is now the immediate litmus test for the British government. Having legislation is one thing, acting on it is the real test,” Conchúr Ó Muadaigh, of the Conradh na Gaeilge language group, told the BBC. “Without that immediate action this legislation won’t be worth the paper it is written on.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dc211c35698eb0952ac73fddac3be1f3dff016f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dc211c35698eb0952ac73fddac3be1f3dff016f/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irish language activists hold a rally in Belfast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irish language activists hold a rally in Belfast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Political battles will continue. Some unionists last year celebrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/10/irish-language-belfast-preschool-unionist\">blocking </a>what would have been Belfast’s first Irish language preschool. Many accuse Sinn Féin of “weaponising” Irish into a wider push for a united Ireland. Nationalist parties and the centrist Alliance say Irish should have a similar official position to that of Welsh and Scots Gaelic, aligning Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK.</p> <p>For more than a decade the UK government and even the DUP, as part of power-sharing deals, made promises about official recognition, only for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/14/irish-language-row-threatens-to-derail-northern-ireland-government\">nothing to happen</a>. There is concern the absence of a Stormont executive – which the DUP is boycotting – could stymie implementation of the legislation.</p> <p>But there is a sense of momentum. Last weekend more than 10,000 people marched through central Belfast under the banner of An Dream Dearg, an Irish language campaign group, to demand “<em>cearta, cothromas agus cóir</em>” (rights, respect and recognition). Cinemas are showing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/12/quiet-girl-irish-language-film-colm-bairead-foster-claire-keegan\">An Cailín Ciúin</a> (The Quiet Girl), a drama hailed as a breakthrough for Irish language films.</p> <p>“I hope the legislation is going to make a difference but I think it’s only the beginning of the journey,” Ervine said. “Hopefully people will show respect to the language and see that it can’t be sidelined.”</p> <p>Some of her students come because they are curious about the fuss over Irish, others are keen to learn the origin of place names, others enjoy the linguistic challenge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It’s the original language of the country and deserves to be kept alive for that reason alone. It could die out if it’s not supported,” said Mildred Bass, 72, a retired civil servant who started attending classes last year.</p> <p>Paul Taylor, 56, who runs a catering business, said the language belonged to everyone. “It existed before Protestants and Catholics, before Christianity, before the border, it’s something we all share. It’s something that could, and should, bring people together.”</p> <p>Taylor, who is apolitical and from a Protestant and unionist background, said the classes had awoken a deep connection to the language. “I’m really proud of learning Irish and what we’re doing here.

As long as this business model remains the same, we will continue to steal the dignity from patients in the name of funding operations.”</p> <p>He said concerns were raised that some Western staff who organised photoshoots in developing countries often ignored the critical views of local colleagues.</p> <p>Zahid said MSF should stop allowing photographs taken while on assignment for the NGO to be sold.</p> <p>Some MSF staff had raised concerns internally about the photos from DRC, which clearly identified a 16-year-old girl who was gang-raped by three armed men.</p> <p>An article on the Souk MSF website, a platform for staff to discuss the NGO’s operations, criticised the photo essay by Newsha Tavakolian, an <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/newsha-tavakolian/\">Iranian photographer with Magnum,</a> for “offer[ing] a problematic vision, both of the DRC, of ​​sexual violence and of the women who suffer it”. </p> <p>Tavakolian said MSF had selected the photos for publication and removed them without informing her. “They also refrained from publicly explaining the reasons for making this decision, nor did they highlight the fact that I was never told not to take images of minors,” she said. “It simply was never discussed.”</p> <p>Jacob Burns, director of studies at the Centre de Réflexion sur l’Action et les Savoirs Humanitaires), part of the MSF Foundation that assesses and analyses the charity’s work, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobTBurns/status/1528651884164153344\">said on Twitter</a>: “These photos and their framing were heavily criticised by numerous colleagues. Clearly indefensible to publish identifiable photos of a teenage rape survivor, and the issues with this project don’t end there.”</p> <p>A spokesman for MSF said its work with photographers was done to raise awareness of under-reported crises. “MSF does not profit from those stock image sales. In most agreements we have with photographers, there is an understanding that they will keep the copyright and will be able to publish or sell their stories and images. The aim is to highlight neglected crises as widely as possible – along with the stories of those involved, where they consent.”</p> <p>But he added: “Unfortunately, some of the images, especially those collected a long time ago, are far from meeting adequate standards in terms of dignified representation of patients or communities.

recommended that all people aged 16 to 64 with certain risks factors be eligible to receive a second booster dose. </p> <p>People who are now recommended to receive a second booster dose include those with immuno-compromising conditions, cancers, specific chronic inflammatory conditions, chronic liver disease, chronic lung disease and severe chronic kidney disease. </p> <p><strong>Karen

<p>She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now, people with certain risk factors that would make them more susceptible to severe effects from Covid-19 have the opportunity to receive a second

Cannon-Brookes is AGL’s biggest shareholder with about 11.3% and needs support from 25% of the holdings to foil the demerger.<br></p> <p><strong>Debby Blakey</strong>, chief executive of Hesta, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The events at AGL represent a watershed in active ownership in this country. Shareholders are pushing for greater action on climate change and a more rapid transition that aims to enhance the company’s ability to create long-term, sustainable value.</p> <p>We cannot simply divest away from the risk of Australia being slow to transition to a low-carbon future. Responsible investors have a responsibility to their members to go to where the biggest emissions are and as owners try and first change the behaviour of these companies.</p> </blockquote> <p>The vote will be on 15 June. Should MCB succeed, he would seek to accelerate AGL’s exit from coal-fired power. Its Liddell plant in the Hunter is already down to three units and will close them by next April (handily after the NSW state election, next March).</p> <p>The remaining plants are Bayswater, near Liddell, and Loy Yang A in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dee65e9745fab923c9d9d9a6ede328d1e2e350c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dee65e9745fab923c9d9d9a6ede328d1e2e350c2/0_104_3111_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Cannon-Brookes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Cannon-Brookes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A lot is happening in the energy sector, as it happens. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/25/coalition-delayed-news-that-electricity-prices-are-set-to-rise-until-after-federal-election\">As we reported here</a>, the Australian Electricity Regulator will tomorrow release the default market offer for 2022-23 – after the Morrison government delayed it from 1 May, when it is usually published. </p> <p>With wholesale prices soaring, the offer is likely to be lifted, perhaps by 10% or more. Those same market forces have claimed one corporate victim, with more to come.</p> <p>Yesterday, the <strong>Essential Services Commission</strong> in Victoria <a href=\"https://www.esc.vic.gov.au/electricity-and-gas/information-consumers/what-happens-if-your-energy-retailer-goes-out-business\">initiated a “retailer of last resort”</a> for customers of failed gas retailer<strong> Weston Energy Pty Ltd</strong> to other retailers in the state to ensure continued supply of essential gas services. </p> <p>The commission said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Weston Energy was suspended from the Declared Wholesale Gas Market by the<strong> Australian Energy Market Operator</strong> for failing to comply with AEMO requirements under the National Gas Rules.</p> </blockquote> <p>The market suspension affects <strong>184</strong> large and medium-sized customers with <strong>1140 </strong>sites in Victoria. Customers will be contacted directly with information about the new arrangements, including options for ongoing supply, and whom to contact for more information or in the event of any disputes, the commission says.</p> <p>In short, Weston was paying too much for the higher energy prices than it could pass on (presumably it hadn’t hedged enough). This provision has not been used since 2016, one insider says. With the energy squeeze likely to get worse, it’s a fair bet that it won’t be the last Retailer of Last Resort order.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

Interestingly, the Australian government won support from India, Japan and the US to include the following line in the <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/quad-joint-leaders-statement\">joint leaders’ statement</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>We welcome the new Australian Government’s commitment to stronger action on climate change, including through passing legislation to achieve net zero by 2050 and lodging a new, ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution. </em></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Wesley Morgan</strong>, a Climate Council researcher and research fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute, said today that the Quad leaders’ summit was “the <strong>first of many important steps on the road to repairing Australia’s international climate reputation</strong>, which was in tatters after years of failings from the former Morrison government”.</p> <p>Morgan said the new Albanese government’s decision to place climate change at the centre of Australia’s foreign policy and acknowledge it as a threat to national security had already delivered “crucial economic and strategic dividends for Australia”.</p> <p>Morgan cited the prospect of a reset with Pacific island states, improved relations with the US, and a signal from the EU’s special envoy for the Indo-Pacific about the prospect of progress on the free trade agreement between Australia and the EU. </p> <p>Morgan said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Right now, <strong>it’s safe to say that we can hold our heads a little higher</strong>. However the new Australian government has a mandate to go even further and faster, which would deliver even more economic and strategic dividends.</em> </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Cheryl Durrant</strong>, a Climate Councillor and former director of preparedness and mobilisation at the Australian Department of Defence, said Australia was “now back in step with its allies on climate change”. </p> <p>Durrant said the latest developments were “encouraging” and climate change needed “a strategically coherent response”.</p> <p>The new government has pledged to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030 on 2005 levels, compared with the former government’s formal target of a 26% to 28% cut. But it has so far stopped short of heeding calls from the Pacific for even more ambitious action and specific curbs on fossil fuel projects.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T02:30:54.119Z\">at 3.30am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-628d90f08f084f9a73ca58ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/benita-kolovos\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T02:14:31.320Z\">3.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Victorian government working towards free flu shots, Daniel Andrews says</strong></p> <p>Victoria’s premier, <strong>Daniel Andrews</strong>, says the state government is working with pharmacists and doctors to make the flu shot free for everyone in the state. <br><br>The Queensland government has already made the jab free amid soaring influenza rates in the state, while the New South Wales government is taking steps to do the same.</p> <p>Currently in Victoria, the flu shot is free for those considered most vulnerable to the flu, including children aged between six months and five, people aged over 65, pregnant women and those with underlying health conditions. </p> <p>Andrews said the government would have more to say about increasing the eligibility for a free vaccine soon:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>We’re working with the Pharmacy Guild and the AMA on that very issue.

Sitting Labor MP Brian Mitchell leads in Lyons by 703 votes, and Liberal MP James Stevens leads in Sturt by 1,261 votes.</p> <p>Then there are two more complex races where Labor, Liberal and Greens are all polling similar numbers. The key count in these seats will be the three-candidate-preferred count, after all minor candidates are excluded. If the Liberal or Greens candidate comes third in either seat, Labor will win. If the Labor candidate comes third, the Greens will win. Neither seat can be won by the Liberal candidate.</p> <p>In Brisbane, sitting Liberal National MP Trevor Evans is in clear first place, with Labor’s Madonna Jarrett just 34 votes ahead of Greens candidate Stephen Bates. Scrutineering data suggests the Greens will catch up to Labor on preferences, which would then unlock Labor preferences to elect the Greens. So this makes the Greens the slight favourite.</p> <p>In Macnamara, the three candidates are very tightly clustered, but Labor MP Josh Burns is leading on 32.3%, ahead of the Greens on 29.8% and the Liberal Party on 29.0%. It seems likely that Burns will stay in first place and win with strong preferences from whoever comes third, but it is still quite tight.</p> <p>If these six seats go to the party currently favoured, the final count will be:</p> <ul> <li>Labor - 76 (+7)</li> <li>Coalition - 59 (-17)</li> <li>Greens - 4 (+3)</li> <li>Centre Alliance - 1</li> <li>Katter’s Australian Party - 1</li> <li>Independents - 10 (+7)</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T02:52:44.680Z\">at 3.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-628d8b978f08e646defad4bb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T01:52:15.334Z\">2.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ACT reports 934 new Covid cases</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Australian Capital Territory has recorded 934 new cases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ACTHealth/status/1529267060559466497\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ACT COVID-19 Update – 25 May 2022<br><br>💉 COVID-19 vaccinations<br>◾ Aged 5-11 years (1 dose): 80.6%<br>◾ Aged 5-11 years (2 doses): 67.7%<br>◾ Aged 5+ years (2 doses): 97.2%<br>◾ Aged 16+ years (3 doses): 76.3% <a href=\"https://t.co/H6HmU4tAqn\">pic.twitter.com/H6HmU4tAqn</a></p>&mdash; ACT Health (@ACTHealth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ACTHealth/status/1529267060559466497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 25, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T01:54:15.247Z\">at 2.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-628d89038f084f9a73ca58c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tamsin-rose\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T01:46:42.524Z\">2.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Consent-focused education campaign to begin on social media and Tinder ahead of new laws coming into effect in NSW</strong></p> <p>Videos showing young people having “simple” and “easy” consent conversations will begin appearing on social media platforms and the dating app Tinder from today as part of an education campaign to coincide with the new New South Wales consent laws coming into effect next week. </p> <p>The campaign was designed to demonstrate successful consent conversations and is being targeted at 16 to 24-year-olds.

And what we have done is we have drawn a line and we have said, if this veers clearly into the lane of serious online abuse – and I have to prove serious intent to harm, as well as the fact that it’s menacing, harassing, and offensive in all cases, so a very high bar – but it tackles that content that clearly veers into that lane and it’s designed to silence.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Later in the panel discussion <strong>Brett Solomon</strong>, the executive director of digital rights group Access Now, pushed back against the idea of more eSafety commissioners in other countries in charge of removing content.</p> <p>He said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>A state-centric online policing framework can actually be a dangerous precedent that leads to greater insecurity and greater lack of safety for the populations that I work for and that I work with.</em></p> <p><em>We have concerns about this idea of online policing that comes from the state because particularly as you say, when we move from content that we speak about, or content or data about us, when it actually becomes about our identity, when it becomes about our biometrics, our irises ... our faces and our gait and all of the things that are going to happen with 5G and the metaverse, then it becomes even more important that we have the proper regulations and frameworks in place.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Inman Grant defended her powers, pointing out that there was a lot of discerning involved:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Some of our cases take two weeks and nothing is black and white. It requires a regulatory investigation and there are four different levels ... I have to be transparent in terms of what I report, but I can be challenged.

The reality is that the people we lost in droves were predominantly women – educated women. </p> <p>They were women who were financially secure.

of defeat in their seat “was not rocket science – it was an unpopular prime minister, climate, integrity and women”.</p> \n<p>“What we did individually had such a limited impact,” they said. “The broad thrust of the voters’ message in the campaign was ‘we love you but a vote for you might be the difference between Morrison continuing as PM or not’.</p> \n<p>“It was just such a strong desire to see a change of government.”</p> \n<p>The outgoing MP called on the Liberals not to obstruct “whatever Labor does on its integrity commission” and its climate targets of 43% reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050, which it intends to legislate.</p> \n<p>After reports that the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, was approached to challenge Morrison but declined, the MP said “no doubt” the change in leader could have helped hold seats.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a

Wilson, who was defeated by independent Zoe Daniel, said the Liberals were “shattered” by a result replicated “nationally, not just in Goldstein”.</p> \n<p>“If it just happened in Goldstein you’d say ‘well, there’s something wrong here or something wrong with me’ … but we haven’t seen that,” he said.</p> \n<p>“As the candidate whose name is on ballot you have to take responsibility for a loss, but I also acknowledge that it wasn’t as though it was just existing in our community.</p> \n<p>“The trend that exists here, exists in Higgins, Kooyong, Wentworth, Mackellar and North Sydney.”</p> \n<p>On Wednesday Dave Sharma said Morrison “definitely” was a drag on his vote, and had a negative approval in seats such as Wentworth.</p> \n<p>Sharma said voters had a “visceral” reaction to Morrison, citing reasons including “that he was too religious, they didn’t like that he carried coal into parliament one time, that they didn’t believe his sincerity on climate change … they didn’t like our handling of Brittany Higgins’ rape allegations, and Grace Tame”.</p> \n<p>“Undoubtedly, the prime minister had lost some prestige and credit during the last few years,” he told Radio National. “I think frustrations with the government are growing as they tend to accumulate after us being in power for as long as we were.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

said the teal independents “positioned themselves quite cleverly”, picking up a protest vote against the government “without being a Labor-Greens vote”.</p> \n<p>Sharma said it was “analytically wrong” to claim the Liberals could win by shifting to the right because “you can’t tell me where the seats are that we will win … if we go to the right”.</p> \n<p>“The only places we’ve lost are to the Greens, Labor and independents – if we want to win back 20 seats, I think that’s the only place we can find them.”</p> \n<p>But Howarth, re-elected in his Queensland seat of Petrie, said the Liberal party should maintain a policy of net zero emissions and releasing super for first homebuyers, but wider changes were not needed.</p> \n<p>“We didn’t lose because our policies were wrong, we lost because people wanted to change the prime minister,” he told Guardian Australia.</p> \n<p>“Look at Labor’s corflutes; they were all about Scott Morrison.

Over the past decade of social media, our interiors have come to be seen as an expression of who we are. Not only is society more individualistic than it was 10 years ago, it’s more polarized.</p> <p>So why do we persistently reach for these drab, midrange shades? The answer is not black and white.</p> <p>Indeed, says the British art historian James Fox, author of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693329-the-world-according-to-color\">The World According to Colour</a>, there is no such thing as a neutral color: “Only what a given society agrees is neutral,” he says. “But if you step outside that society, or look back through history, you realize that everything is ideological in some ways; everything is a stylistic choice.”</p> <p>“Neutral” might be best understood as “dominant,” says Fox (whose own house in Hackney, London, is painted in Dulux’s Pebble Shore, a sandy grey “with a touch of khaki”). From the late aughts, grey began to displace bright whites and creams as the preferred palette for interiors to become, in the 2010s, as ubiquitous as “magnolia” – a buttery yellow-based white – was in the 1980s and 1990s.</p> <p>But the origin of this great wave of grey goes back through centuries of western culture to a longstanding prejudice against bright colors, as explored by the artist David Batchelor in his 2000 book Chromophobia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"921b70fc99420f94aa35a3f32c1189eb037cea9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/921b70fc99420f94aa35a3f32c1189eb037cea9f/0_116_2480_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephant’s Breath, by Farrow & Ball.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephant’s Breath, by Farrow &amp; Ball.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farrow &amp; Ball</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goethe’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Colours\">Theory of Colors</a>, published in 1810, maintained that bright colors were suited to children and animals, not sophisticated adults; this view was shared by great artists and thinkers throughout history from Aristotle and Plato to Le Corbusier and Cartier Bresson.</p> <p>Still today, words such as “lurid” and “garish” have negative connotations. “Color is often represented as feminine, or Oriental, or primitive, or infantile, rather than grown-up and philosophical and serious … and it’s clearly indexed to issues of race, culture, class and gender,” says Batchelor.</p> <p>Yellow in particular has fallen out of favor in recent decades, associated with defeat and age; “the color of bile and urine,” says Fox.</p> <p>Even cream is now too much for us to stomach; it is regarded in the world of interiors as “white that’s gone off”, Fox says. It seems no coincidence that it began to curdle in the late 1990s, as Ikea started to crack the US and UK markets with its sleek, hard-wearing take on modernism.</p> <p>The UK, in particular, started increasingly to look to Scandi style after decades of chintzy prints, then Mediterranean jewel tones and terracottas. The scene was set for grey to take over from cream as a similarly livable colour, with a great diversity of shades but a sobriety more appropriate to the times.</p> <p>“Refined taste is associated with a desire for the muted, the minimal, the sparse,” says Fox. Over the past 15 years, “what we have seen is a move from the yellow end of the spectrum to the cooler one – from beige, to greige”, amounting to what Fox calls “a desaturating effect” across culture.</p> <p>This doesn’t apply to interiors only: compared with the caramel-washed sitcoms of the 90s, today’s television shows and films are graded to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22840526/colors-movies-tv-gray-digital-color-sludge\">a greyish “sludge”</a>. Apple, meanwhile – perhaps the defining brand of the past century – abandoned its candy-coloured iMacs and iPods post-millennium in favour of clean lines of chrome, glass and “space grey”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3ac6f0eaed4999d759733e1a3dfd4631e2f09b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3ac6f0eaed4999d759733e1a3dfd4631e2f09b0/0_0_390_585/333.jpg\" alt=\"BenjaminMoore’s Revere Pewter gray, a US bestseller.\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BenjaminMoore’s Revere Pewter gray, a US bestseller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benjamin Moore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another defining 21st-century brand, Kim Kardashian , embodied the shift. Soon after she started dating Kanye West in 2011, she <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kim-kardashian-decorating-with-neutrals\">famously</a> threw out her wardrobe of bright prints to become the monochrome muse of the past decade, influencing fashion, beauty and even interiors.</p> <p>In 2016 Architectural Digest <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kim-kardashian-decorating-with-neutrals\">pointed</a> to Kardashian’s tonal style in support of painting grey walls; her own LA mansion is <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-home\">almost exclusively</a> ecru. Such a coordinated décor might seem labour-intensive, the mark of a professional stylist, but greys are relatively forgiving. Fox says it is because they are naturally occurring in fabrics and textiles, lending them a “protean, amorphous” quality: “They can adjust to all sorts of environments, they do well in the light and the shade, and they seem like they have been around a long time.”</p> <p>Multipurpose and timeless-seeming, grey makes the perfect backdrop for a fast-fashion generation more likely to refresh their home with new accessories than a professional redecoration.</p> <p>“That’s what I love about the color greige: it’s such a great base,” says Jasmine Young, 30, who shares her Dorset home (complete with Elephant’s Breath walls) with 45,000 followers <a href=\"https://instagram.com/south_coast_home\">on Instagram</a>. “If you want to bring in color, you can easily change up the look through cushion covers or a throw.”</p> <p>From vintage to modern aesthetics, to dark and light woods, chrome fittings to natural fibres – greige “literally works across all interior styles,” says Young. In this way it is like a real-life Instagram filter, using color not to express your individuality but as a consistent backdrop for it.</p> <p>Fox notes the irony: as our politics and culture have become more extreme, our palette has become more muted – and “just as we are being driven apart, our homes are becoming more similar”. In his trendy area of London, he says, nearly every front door is painted in Farrow &amp; Ball’s Railings, a not-quite black, “and most people have Elephant’s Breath on their internal walls”.</p> <p>But it extends far beyond Hackney, as the 15,500 photos <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/elephantsbreath/\">hashtagged</a> #elephantsbreath go to show. Indeed – like reclaimed wood, industrial fittings and other hallmarks of what has been <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification\">termed</a> “International Airbnb Style” – grey walls have become a global signifier of generic “good taste”.</p> <p>It is this unambitious, anodyne aesthetic – like looking at a perfectly curated Instagram grid – that depresses Batchelor, author of Chromophobia. Avowedly opposed to neutrals, he is unpersuaded by arguments that greige contains subtle depths: “You can have a colour chart that says ‘bland’ and stick it all under that,” he says with disdain.</p> <p>“It’s all so safe, that’s probably the most dispiriting part of it: it threatens nothing and no one, apart from with a slow, unadventurous death.”</p> <p>But even Batchelor admits that he prefers to live in a neutral environment mixing brick, ceramic tiles and white (“my wife is a chromophobe,” he says). Since the mid-2010s especially, people have sought not to be energized by their homes – but soothed.</p> <p>“Everything in the outside world is so chaotic. I like to come into a place and immediately feel the calmness,” Kardashian <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-home\">told AD</a> in February 2020.</p> <p>Through the pandemic, this took on a premium. Rebecca Wilkins, 29, moved into her first home in Birmingham in February 2020 and painted its cream walls grey. “I just like living in a neutral home, any color makes me uneasy,” she says – even her dog, she adds, is grey.</p> <p>But the uncertain times were also a factor: “I don’t know if I would have been so focused on being in a calming space if I wasn’t in my home so much.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Instagram image of neutral walls and furnishings\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Instead she has contented herself with replacing the cool greys of her “neutral home interior” – followed by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rmw.home/\">60,000 people on</a> Instagram – with warm ones.</p> <p>Fox, too, has noticed a recent shift towards the yellower end of the spectrum. Changing Rooms’ Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen has even <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/a34984815/laurence-llewelyn-bowen-magnolia-paint/\">threatened</a> the return of magnolia.</p> <p>It is a tentative sign that the blanket of grey over interiors is starting to lift. “People are being a little more brave with colours,” says Hannah Yeo, color marketing manager at Benjamin Moore. She singles out a return of red, orange and yellow – and not just for accents. “The classic red dining room is coming back.”</p> <p>So, too, are Apple’s colourful computers, with the iMac recently <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/04/imac-features-all-new-design-in-vibrant-colors-m1-chip-and-45k-retina-display/\">relaunched</a> in seven colours. It suggests that post-pandemic people are prioritising not serenity in their homes, but joy.</p> <p>Neutrals will always make up the majority of paint manufacturers’ bestselling shades, says Yeo, and she does not foresee grey, “an essential colour”, ever going away entirely. But it might increasingly coexist alongside brighter hues. This year’s colour trends are those that inspire levity, she says: “I think people are yearning for that. We’ve been all greyed out.”</p> <p>Canadian colour consultants The Paint People recently reached the same conclusion, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cI3U8bV75s\">declaring</a> on YouTube “the death of greige: a paint colour category that has absolutely dominated interior design for well over a decade”.</p> <p>What will replace it, they predicted – and also Benjamin Moore’s <a href=\"https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/color-overview/color-palettes/color-of-the-year-2022\">colour of the year</a> for 2022 – is a light, silvery green.

Almost two decades her junior, he is asleep in a chair. “The sight of his arm hair, ablaze in the sun, sends a sob down my spine,” she notes. The arm, it seems, is “the one that I have not shackled” – Vladimir is tied to the chair.</p> <p>The narrator then goes back to explore how she got to this point, unpicking the complexities and generational tensions around assault in an American university, the power play between professor and student, the tangles of desire and envy, defiance and shame, ambition and failure. Above all, though, Vladimir is a novel about female appetite – for sex, food, power, success – and what the ageing process does to it.</p> <p>The narrator’s husband, John, the chair of the English department, has been suspended while the authorities investigate his past misdemeanours – he had sex with his students before regulations outlawed such behaviour. Although the narrator is struggling to distance herself from this scandal, she considers the whole thing a bit ridiculous. Theirs has long been an open marriage, and his dalliances were all “consensual”; he didn’t “drug them or coerce them”. Young women today, she notes scathingly, seem to have “lost all agency”, believing themselves to be victims when they plainly aren’t. Despite her disdain, she courts her students’ approval, designing courses to “cow and delight” them (her motto: “Kill them with care”). But in the politicised environment of a campus, the “students rule the roost” and when they grow agitated, demanding to know why she hasn’t left John, she is forced to kowtow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Julia May Jonas explores how sexual desire, rage and creativity can become destructively entangled. The narrator is furious with her husband on a visceral level: she shudders when he touches her, and as the hearings start to dismantle his career and reputation, she focuses, obsessively, on the gorgeous new junior professor, Vladimir. At 40, Vladimir is a talented debut novelist with a glamorous, unstable wife and young daughter. She notes his literary talents with envy. Early in her career she produced two novels, one well received, one not, and has written nothing since. In fact, she has funnelled considerable energy into minimising her literary ambitions, convincing herself that she must model for her now adult daughter, Sid, the notion that happiness lies in curtailing the desire for success. She presents her child as a triumph: stable, functional, a non-profit lawyer living in the city with her lovely girlfriend. However, when Sid appears late one night, fresh off a train, smashed on rum, it seems that this may not be the case.</p> <p>Approaching 60, the narrator is acutely aware that she is no longer a sexual object. Now, though, it is her turn to look, not just with lust at Vladimir’s body, but with envy at the bodies of younger women – her students, Vladimir’s wife. She also turns this bitter gaze on herself. She has always been “vain”, but now she monitors every wrinkle and mark, dressing meticulously, fiercely controlling her weight. This self-scrutiny is brutal. When she invites Vladimir to swim in her pool, she prepares with an anti-cellulite massage and a spray tan, but even then cannot bear the idea of being looked at. Unable to express herself physically, her pent-up sexual desire erupts on the page, and she begins to write again, feverishly. She simultaneously channels her considerable intellectual and manipulative skills into trapping Vladimir. Having fallen instantly for his beauty, she seduces him with intellectual flattery, attention, food and alcohol – lots of it: martinis “dirty, and wet”, bottles of Sancerre, gin and tonics, Manhattans. It is slow, deliberate, decisive and, we know, will lead to the point where she has him shackled to that chair. The question is, how, and why – and will she hurt him?</p> <p>The opening sentence of Vladimir raises a distinctly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/23/100-best-novels-lolita-vladimir-nabokov-nymphet\">Nabokovian ghost</a> (“When I was a child, I loved old men, and I could tell that they also loved me”). There are faint nods to Pnin in the campus setting, with Vladimir the academic, but also perhaps in the novel’s other themes: failure, humiliation, isolation, loss. These are the spooks that haunt the narrator’s chilly, bookish mind: the shame of growing irrelevant, invisible, unwanted and undesirable.</p> <p>Vladimir<em> </em>is a quietly captivating novel. Jonas’s voice is so assured, in fact, that for most of the time it seems astonishing that this is a debut. The confidence wavers towards the end, though, with a heavy-handed denouement: an unsuccessful attempt to tame the complex themes, and pin down this slippery and uncomfortably compelling narrator. The wobbly ending is disappointing – the narrator is oddly neutered by it – but perhaps this is a price worth paying for what is otherwise an engrossing and clever debut.</p> <p>• Vladimir is published by Picador (£14.99).

And understand that his awful destiny is bound up with British shame, envy and the class system? Mike Hodges created a Brit-crime magnum opus with this unforgettably sleazy, slimy, nasty film from 1971 – now on re-release, linked to the <a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=mikehodges\">director’s retrospective at London’s BFI Southbank</a>. It is a violent kitchen-sink pulp with the observational brilliance and dour working-class realism of something by Ken Loach, adapted by Hodges from the novel Jack’s Return Home by the neglected British writer Ted Lewis.</p> <p>Hodges gave the role of a lifetime to Michael Caine as the dead-eyed, pill-popping gangland enforcer Jack Carter, who is working for London’s mobster porn supremos with their interest in trafficking and exploitation. Carter journeys up from “the smoke” to his Newcastle hometown to investigate the apparent suicide of his brother Frank. But plenty of influential people don’t want that can of worms opened. Caine brought the cool, near-sociopathic self-possession he’d shown as Alfie and Harry Palmer, and cranked it up to a new level of ruthlessness. It is the unmistakable halting sing-song of Caine’s delivery that makes sense of the legendary pre-violence speech: “You’re a big man but you’re in bad shape; with me, it’s a full-time job. Now behave yourself.” (Carter has apparently lost his own north-east accent.) This was a line that Hodges wrote himself; it isn’t in the book.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NtstlDW0Zo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0NtstlDW0Zo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Get Carter was, appropriately, produced by Michael Klinger, the former strip club and stag film entrepreneur who with imagination and flair got into legitimate production and distribution, and the film features a glorious array of character-actor talent, including Ian Hendry as Eric, the cringing mob factotum in a dove-grey chauffeur’s outfit and dark glasses, Britt Ekland as Jack’s secret girlfriend Anna, supposedly going out with Jack’s boss but planning to get away to South America with Jack soon; Bernard Hepton as the cringing underling Thorpey (to be confronted in the gents’ lavatories, for maximum squalor), and Alun Armstrong as the biddable Keith whom callous Carter exploits. John Osborne contributes a delicious cameo as the slippery gangboss, Mr Kinnear, and Rosemarie Dunham is outstanding as Carter’s unhappy landlady who listens to Carter having phone sex with Ekland and then has sex with Carter herself in a bed over which is a sampler reading: “What Would Jesus Say?” What indeed?</p> <p>Almost every line Caine utters as Carter has become iconic, simply by virtue of the forthright and distinctive intonation: “In a THIN GLASS,” he says to the Geordie barman, actually snapping his fingers. Londoners shouldn’t try this one, although Carter is happy enough with a half-pint dimple mug at his brother’s wake. And the extraordinary scene in which he arrives at his late brother’s house first, pokes around the empty dismal rooms before having a grisly encounter, is a macabre masterpiece.</p> <p>The snippiness and nastiness is brilliantly conveyed by the sneering beta male Eric, jealous of Carter. In fact, everyone hates Carter when he shows up and starts sticking his nose in and throwing his weight about, mostly because he’s got above his station. Carter takes care of himself, he wears nice suits and there is an air of exiled glamour about him, as well as contempt for his former associates, which makes his terrible fate all the more stomach-turning. A stone-cold, liquid-nitrogen classic.</p> <p>• Get Carter is released on 27 May in cinemas.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/25/indigenous-activists-among-goldman-environmental-prize-winners","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T07:30:30Z","webTitle":"Indigenous activists among Goldman environmental prize winners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/25/indigenous-activists-among-goldman-environmental-prize-winners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/25/indigenous-activists-among-goldman-environmental-prize-winners","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous activists among Goldman environmental prize winners","trailText":"Recipients from around world demonstrate power of unified community action in battle to save the planet","body":"<p>Indigenous activists and lawyers who took on transnational corporations and their own governments to force climate action are among the 2022 winners of the world’s pre-eminent environmental award.</p> <p>Taking on powerful vested interests is a risky business, and the recipients of this year’s Goldman prize demonstrate the power of unified community action, perseverance and the courts in the battle to save the planet from environmental collapse.</p> <p>The winners include a former fossil fuel insider turned climate entrepreneur who harnessed public participation and a pioneering legal strategy to successfully sue the Dutch government for failing to protect its citizens from the climate crisis. The historic victory led by 55-year-old Marjan Minnesma obliged the Netherlands to start slashing greenhouse gas emissions, triggering similar lawsuits across the world.</p> <p>The African winner, an environmental lawyer from Nigeria, also has a Dutch connection. It took almost two decades for Chima Williams, 52, to secure a ruling in The Hague that finally holds Royal Dutch Shell accountable for oil spills by its subsidiary that caused widespread ecological, social and economic damage in the Niger Delta.</p> <p>None of the winners succeeded alone. Rather they worked with those affected, neighbours, and colleagues to defend their communities, and in doing so created legal precedents and policies that go some way to shielding citizens from corporate greed and political failures.</p> <p>In Latin America, the joint winners are Alex Lucitante, 29 and Alexandra Narváez, 30, who spearheaded an Indigenous movement to protect the Cofán people’s ancestral territory from goldmining. This grassroots campaign resulted in a legal victory in October 2018 when Ecuador’s courts cancelled 52 goldmining concessions that had been granted illegally without the community’s consent – saving 32,000 hectares (79,000 acres) of pristine, biodiverse rainforest considered sacred by the Cofán.</p> <p>The case relied on evidence gathered by forest patrols, camera traps, GIS tools and drones organised by the community and their allies. Narváez was the first woman to join La Guardia, the territorial forest patrol, a move that challenged traditional patriarchal beliefs and inspired other women to take an active role in the struggle.</p> <p>“As women we have to defend Mother Earth, to speak out for the future of our children and defend our way of life in spite of the machismo and being afraid. It’s been beautiful to be part of this struggle with other women from my community,” Narvarez said.</p> <p>The victory set a precedent in Ecuador, where the constitutional court is using the case as an example of how to respect the rights of Indigenous peoples and guarantee free, prior and informed consent.</p> <p>Latin America is the most dangerous place in the world for defending land and environmental rights, as governments systematically violate Indigenous people’s right to be consulted – a right laid out in the legally binding Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention.</p> <p>The 2015 Goldman prize winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/who-killed-berta-caceres-behind-the-brutal-of-an-environment-crusader\">Berta Cáceres,</a> an indigenous Lenca leader from Honduras, was murdered less than a year later for leading a campaign to stop an internationally financed hydroelectric dam illegally sanctioned without consultation.</p> <p>The other Goldman winners include a retired teacher from Thailand who empowered fishers and farmers to stop a Chinese-led canal project that threatened Asia’s most biodiverse river, and an American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/10/nalleli-cobo-the-young-activist-who-led-her-la-neighbourhood-against-big-oil\">student</a> whose campaign to shut down toxic urban drilling led to Los Angeles banning all new oil projects and committing to phasing out existing sites by 2030.</p> <p>Niwat Roykaew helped turn villagers who depend on the Mekong river for food, medicine, irrigation and spiritual nourishment into citizen scientists and citizen journalists to alert the world to the threats posed by the canal blasting project. It forced the Thai government to cancel a major deal, a rare win in the region where environmentally destructive megaprojects are hard to stop.</p> <p>“The Mekong is like a mother to us, she gives us everything we need,” said Roykaew, who is in his early 60s. “It’s important to inform and empower the powerless so they know as citizens they have the right to ask questions and oppose multimillion-dollar projects by big countries.”</p> <p>As fossil fuel companies continue to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/carbon-bombs-2022\">bet against climate action</a> and boast of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/13/oil-gas-producers-first-quarter-2022-profits\">record profits</a>, the community-led victory in Los Angeles, one of America’s most oil-friendly polluted cities, shows what’s possible.</p> <p>Nalleli Cobo joined the community’s fight to shut down an oilwell when she was just nine years old after she and other children started falling sick. With her mother, Cobo knocked on doors, filed complaints, attended rallies and testified at town hall meetings about the chronic headaches, nosebleeds, and body spasms she suffered.</p> <p>In 2015 she co-founded the South Central Youth Leadership Coalition, which successfully sued the city for environmental racism – specifically for disproportionately permitting oil drilling in Latino and Black communities. As a result, city officials last year voted to phase out existing oil projects. This was seen as a huge victory, as about 580,000 residents currently live within a quarter of a mile of an active well.</p> <p>Cobo, who has survived gruelling surgery and chemotherapy since being diagnosed with cancer aged 19, said: “I kept fighting because no child should be denied the right to play outside or open windows like I was. It’s powerful to know that we, an invisible community, made this change.”</p> <p>Cobo, now 21, is studying political science at university, and plans to run for US president in 2036.</p> <p>The Goldman prize was founded in 1989, since when 213 grassroots environmental activists from 93 nations have been honoured.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/25/go-after-the-money-goldman-environmental-prize-winner-honoured-for-urging-banks-to-divest-from-coal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T07:30:30Z","webTitle":"‘Go after the money’: Goldman environmental prize winner honoured for urging banks to divest from coal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/25/go-after-the-money-goldman-environmental-prize-winner-honoured-for-urging-banks-to-divest-from-coal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/25/go-after-the-money-goldman-environmental-prize-winner-honoured-for-urging-banks-to-divest-from-coal","fields":{"headline":"‘Go after the money’: Goldman environmental prize winner honoured for urging banks to divest from coal","trailText":"Julien Vincent’s Market Forces organisation started with a spare laptop and a spare bedroom before raising the ire of the former Coalition government","body":"<p><br>The laptop was second-hand, but Julien Vincent had a spare room and a very, very big idea: could he start a movement to convince Australia’s biggest financial institutions to stop investing the billions of dollars that sustained the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/australias-greenhouse-pollution-from-coal-higher-per-person-than-any-other-developed-country-data-shows\">fossil fuel industry</a>?</p> <p>“There wasn’t much to lose really,” says Vincent. “But yes, I was nervous early on because of the significance of the people we were taking on.

Vincent’s approach saw climate activism pulling on a business suit to sit down in the offices, boardrooms and shareholder meetings of financial institutions.</p> <p>Today Vincent is awarded the prestigious <a href=\"https://www.goldmanprize.org/\">Goldman environmental prize</a>, described by some as the “Green Nobel”.</p> <p>He is honoured for creating a “challenging financial landscape for the Australian coal industry, a significant step toward reducing fossil fuels that hasten climate change”.</p> <p>With that award, Vincent’s work stands alongside previous winners that were at the centre of some of Australia’s most famous environmental battles – from saving the Franklin River to blocking uranium mining.</p> <h2>Climate not weather</h2> <p>Growing up in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda, Vincent was no more interested in the environment than most young people. A pivotal moment came when he went to Monash University to do a degree in atmospheric science.</p> <p>“I wanted to be weatherman,” he says. But among the lecturers on his course was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/02/csiro-has-become-extravagant-consulting-company-one-of-its-former-top-climate-scientist-says\">Prof David Karoly</a> – a veteran of Australian climate science. What Karoly and other lecturers outlined to the student Vincent was pivotal.</p> <p>“I was being confronted with all these charts and it was like I was in on a terrible secret that these scientists were desperately trying to get out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"471034da7886fa57d8d39de72e7070a7e3379309\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/471034da7886fa57d8d39de72e7070a7e3379309/0_0_2832_4240/668.jpg\" alt=\"Julien Vincent with his Goldman Environmental prize\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julien Vincent with his Goldman Environmental prize, in Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Goldman prize</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I could see those charts and their profound consequences. It was off the scale. I was all in by the time I’d finished those first couple of climate science lectures.”</p> <p>Vincent finished his degree with honours in arts and climatology, but didn’t know what to do with it. He had some savings from working in a bottle shop.</p> <p>He quit, paid off the lease on his Melbourne flat and took a few volunteer roles and, crucially, a four-month internship at Greenpeace which turned into a job as a campaigner. “I had no money, but I had time,” he says.</p> <p>In 2012, while working at Greenpeace, Vincent was part of a campaign that blocked a new coal power station being built at Morwell.</p> <p>That campaign, Vincent says, was successful because it targeted the legitimacy of the project’s income stream – in that case, federal and state government grants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/11/australia-gas-project-petroglyphs-woodside-climate-culture-carbon-bomb\"> ‘Our ancestors are in the rocks’: Australian gas project threatens ancient carvings – and emissions blowout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I was starting to win campaigns by going after the money. I thought: why isn’t there a group in Australia that’s focused on that day in, day out?”</p> <p>So, armed with that second-hand laptop, Vincent researched who was financing coal projects and tallied up the billions being spent by Australia’s big four banks – Commonwealth, NAB, ANZ and Westpac.</p> <p>He named his venture Market Forces. Slowly adding to the original one-man band, Market Forces would publish their results, organise public protests and “divestment days” where customers would close accounts at banks that backed coal.</p> <p>At the same time, Vincent says his campaign meets the financial institutions – from chief executives to managers – to outline their campaign plans.</p> <p>Blair Palese, a long-term climate campaigner who founded the group 350.org in Australia, worked alongside Vincent in some of those early campaigns.</p> <p>“Julien is an Everest climber,” she says. “He is a very determined and focused human being.

It meant the financial institutions he was meeting and campaigning against “know he’s going to turn up next month to check on them”.</p> <p>“Julien holds them accountable every day,” Palese says.</p> <h2>People power</h2> <p>A 2019 pledge from the Commonwealth bank to stop funding thermal coal by 2030 was a tipping point for the campaign, Vincent says, with the other three major banks following soon after.</p> <p>“That was years of campaigning – we had divestment days, shareholder actions,” he says, as well as a string of meetings with bank bosses.</p> <p>“The lesson was that you can get to a point of mutual understanding and trust. We were not satisfied with what they were doing, and they didn’t appreciate our campaigning. But we had years of meetings and there was an understanding.

We’re here to stop runaway climate change”.</p> <p>He is worried that a move to massively expand liquified natural gas – LNG – could be just as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/may/11/fossil-fuel-carbon-bombs-climate-breakdown-oil-gas\">damaging to the climate</a> as the coal it claims to be replacing. The campaign is funded by about 1,000 regular donors and 10 philanthropic sources.</p> <h2>Overwhelming honour</h2> <p>Each year the Goldman prize names a “hero of the environment” from six different regions around the world. This is only the fifth year the prize has gone to Australia since its launch in 1990.</p> <p>Bob Brown was one of the inaugural recipients for his role as an “irresistible moral force” spearheading the campaign to protect Tasmania’s Franklin River.</p> <p>“Were it not for Bob Brown’s beautiful and elegant defences of the environment, decency and common sense, I would not be involved [in environmental campaigning]. A huge part of this honour is that I’m on a list that starts with Bob Brown,” Vincent says.</p> <p> Other previous Goldman prize winners have fought some of Australia’s most famous environmental battles that blocked sand-mining and logging on Queensland’s Fraser Island, fought uranium mining in Kakadu national park and stood against a nuclear waste dump in South Australia.</p> <p>“To put my work on a footing with that is a bit overwhelming,” says Vincent. “I feel very very proud.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/25/how-two-goldman-prize-winners-won-landmark-rulings-in-dutch-courts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T07:30:29Z","webTitle":"How two Goldman prize winners won landmark rulings in Dutch courts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/25/how-two-goldman-prize-winners-won-landmark-rulings-in-dutch-courts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/25/how-two-goldman-prize-winners-won-landmark-rulings-in-dutch-courts","fields":{"headline":"How two Goldman prize winners won landmark rulings in Dutch courts","trailText":"Marjan Minnesma’s legal fight forced the Dutch government to cut emissions and sparked other climate lawsuits","body":"<p>The road to a landmark legal victory compelling the Dutch government to take climate action began a decade ago when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2020/nov/30/the-goldman-environmental-prize-winners-2020-in-pictures\">2022 Goldman prize winner</a> Marjan Minnesma received an official letter saying the government did not want to be a frontrunner in tackling the climate crisis.</p> <p>At the time the Netherlands was one of the world’s worst greenhouse emitters and had a dismal record on renewables that was highly dependent on fossil fuels – a stark contrast with its environmentally friendly image of windmills and bicycles.</p> <p>The government’s refusal to take action was causing mounting anxiety among Dutch citizens as large swathes of the country’s low-lying coastline are vulnerable to rising sea levels and flood damage – both of which are forecast to get worse if global greenhouse gas emissions are not radically cut.</p> <p>Time was running out, yet still the government sanctioned new fossil fuel projects and refused to make science-based policies. Enough was enough, decided Minnesma, who founded the climate solutions non-profit Urgenda.</p> <p>“The only democratic thing to do was to go to court with the facts, without the party politics, without the PR,” said Minnesma, 55, who is among seven winners from six continents recognised this year by the world’s foremost environmental prize.</p> <p>In 2013, Urgenda filed a lawsuit arguing that the government’s failure to take action violated its constitutional duty of care towardscitizens.</p> <p>After multiple appeals, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/dutch-officials-reveal-measures-to-cut-emissions-after-court-ruling\">December 2019</a> the Dutch supreme court issued an extraordinary ruling upholding lower courts’ decisions that obliged the government to cut emissions by 25% below 1990 levels by the end of 2020. It was the first time a court anywhere in the world had ordered a government to mitigate global heating by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Like most Goldman prize winners, Minnesma led a David versus Goliath campaign, but the victory stands apart for several reasons.</p> <p>The legal case was formulated with help from the public through so-called “crowd pleading” – a hybrid of citizen science and crowdfunding. In the end 886 individuals, including a five-year-old boy, joined as co-plaintiffs. But this was not a traditional class action involving a group of victims having to prove they had been harmed; rather a motley crew of ordinary, worried citizens demanding action to prevent harm.</p> <p>“We went to court on behalf of the greater good – it’s a new type of campaigning,” said Minnesma. The plaintiffs filled the courts, and the hearings were also livestreamed. “It was about the judges having to look into people’s eyes as they decided, knowing that the world was watching.”</p> <p>In addition, Urgenda worked with hundreds of NGOs and businesses to come up with 54 detailed emission-cutting measures, including lowering speed limits from 80 to 60mph, introducing subsidies to cut livestock numbers, and increasing rooftop solar and home insulation. “Most governments are not very creative, they know how to use the law and something about subsidy schemes … So we gave them the solutions.”</p> <p>Minnesma, whose résumé includes stints at Shell and Greenpeace, does not see herself as an activist, but rather as a climate entrepreneur at the forefront of innovation.</p> <p>The 25% reduction is work in progress and Minnesma has threatened to go back to court if the cuts are not scaled up to counteract post-pandemic greenhouse gas rises, but billions of euros have already been allocated to fund many of the mitigation measures submitted by the plaintiffs.</p> <p>The Dutch ruling sparked a wave of similar lawsuits across the world, leading to recent victories in France, Colombia, Germany, Ireland, Pakistan and Nepal.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.urgenda.nl/en/themas/climate-case/global-climate-litigation/\">According to a tally</a> by the London School of Economics, there are at least 68 climate action lawsuits directed against governments. Minnesma and her colleagues helped to create a climate litigation network to spark new cases and share information so mistakes can be avoided.</p> <p>“Our case has inspired hundreds of other cases and given people hope that much more is possible. It helped people realise that governments are responsible for protecting us against climate change,” she said. “Industry are the biggest polluters which the government should fix, it’s not up to consumers alone.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST<br><br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>But waiting for governments to do the right thing isn’t an option, insists Minnesma.

Courts in Nigeria have ruled against oil companies but there has been little enforcement of court rulings or regulations, and previous attempts to hold transnational companies to account in their home countries had failed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e99f642b322be32f085f828b9a579bb8f0d06f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e99f642b322be32f085f828b9a579bb8f0d06f3/0_438_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Environmental lawyer Chima Williams with Nigerian farmers at the law courts in The Hague in October 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Environmental lawyer Chima Williams with Nigerian farmers at The Hague, October 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Utrecht/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Williams, with Friends of the Earth Netherlands, filed a lawsuit in 2008 against Shell and its Nigerian subsidiary on behalf of the victims of two major oil spills, seeking compensation for lost income due to contaminated land and waterways, and improvements to the company’s neglected pipelines.</p> <p>According to Williams, it turned into a fight against an army of lawyers and a PR machine, with Shell’s tactics reminiscent of a cold war counterinsurgency playbook. Communities were divided and the oil spills blamed on sabotage by criminal gangs.</p> <p>“Shell used legal gymnastics to delay the process for years. The divide and rule strategy came first, and then stigmatisation and criminalisation of the communities in order to try and avoid being held accountable,” said Williams, executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Rights Action.</p> <p>At one point the case was delayed for three years because Shell claimed it was too dangerous to send its team assessors to the delta, despite operating 50 oilfields in the region.</p> <p>Finally, in January 2021, The Hague court of appeal ruled that Shell could not hide behind its local operators, but rather that the company has oversight and control over its subsidiary and therefore a duty to prevent oil spills.</p> <p>It was the first time Shell had been held accountable in a Dutch court, which has still to rule on compensation for the affected communities. Shell recently reported its highest ever quarterly profits, $9.13bn for the first three months of 2022.</p> <p>The landmark ruling has ramifications for communities across the Niger delta, where Shell controls about half of the region’s oil production, and for those affected in other countries. Williams said: “This has been celebrated as a pan-Niger delta victory, it’s restored people’s hope that justice can be done. If we can get this judgment against Shell in the Netherlands, there’s no hiding place for anybody.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/24/texas-school-shooting-uvelde-what-we-know","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T07:06:54Z","webTitle":"Texas school shooting: what we know so far","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/texas-school-shooting-uvelde-what-we-know","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/24/texas-school-shooting-uvelde-what-we-know","fields":{"headline":"Texas school shooting: what we know so far","trailText":"First victims being named as US president calls for action on gun laws","body":"<ul> \n <li><p>An 18-year-old man, identified by police as Salvador Ramos, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/texas-school-shooting-uvalde-robb-elementary\">opened fire</a> in an elementary school in Texas.

Usually this is conceived as the result of a plague. Less often, the cause is violence. Occasionally, the men don’t die and the sexes are just segregated in different geographical regions. Or men miraculously vanish without explanation.</p> <p>Left to themselves, the women create a better society, without inequality or war. All goods are shared. All children are safe. The economy is sustainable and Earth is cherished. Without male biology standing in the way, utopia builds itself.</p> <p>I’m describing a subgenre of science fiction, mostly written in the 1970s-90s. It was once so popular it was almost synonymous with feminist SF. In 1995, when the Otherwise Award, a literary prize for “works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one’s understanding of gender”, gave five retrospective awards, four of the works were set in such worlds: Suzy McKee Charnas’s Motherlines and Walk to the End of the World, and Joanna Russ’s The Female Man and When It Changed. The fifth was Ursula K Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness, about a world whose inhabitants are all of the same sex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2e87e1b286bda002fe8e608acf0b54db2de4bab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2e87e1b286bda002fe8e608acf0b54db2de4bab/0_113_3672_2203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ursula K Le Guin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ursula K Le Guin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recently there has been a revival of the genre in radically different form, with titles including Lauren Beukes’s 2020 novel Afterland, Christina Sweeney-Baird’s 2021 thriller The End of Men, and my own new release, The Men. I think the way that these contemporary novels diverge from their earlier counterparts tells us something useful about gender politics in the 21st century. Part of the story, too, is a growing opposition to the basic premise, a conflict in which my novel has been recently embroiled.</p> <p>The women-only utopia has a modest prehistory, going back to the myth of the Amazons and early feminist works such as Christine de Pizan’s 1405 The Book of the City of Ladies. But in its strict form as a single-sex utopia, it begins with Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland of 1915. Here, in an uncharted and unspecified wilderness, three male explorers stumble on a plateau the local “savages” fear as a realm from which no man returns. With their aeroplane, they are able to land there, and are instantly taken prisoner by the all-female inhabitants. The book then becomes a tour of the features of the women’s ideal society.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e694e9b2afdf8c4a46dceb5202fd1903a521194d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e694e9b2afdf8c4a46dceb5202fd1903a521194d/0_0_256_400/256.jpg\" alt=\"Herland by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.\" width=\"256\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Herland by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Women’s Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Women excel in all occupations. Older women gain prestige instead of losing it; the women are physically formidable and easily subdue their male captives. Charmingly, the narrator says of the national costume: “I see that I have not remarked that these women had pockets in surprising number and variety.” Their babies never cry.</p> <p>Much less charmingly, we’re assured the Herland women are Aryans, and their society is focused on the perfection of their race. In fact, many of the hallmarks of fascism are here: the paganism, the obsession with cleanliness, the emphasis on gymnastics, the eugenics. The Herlanders also have no erotic or even romantic feelings for each other; they have bred those dirty things out.</p> <p>The golden age of the genre, roughly coinciding with the era of second wave feminism, could scarcely be more different. Here the keynote is freedom, and lesbian polyamory is the order of the day. Solo travel features prominently: the authors are captivated by the idea of women hiking alone into the wilderness without the threat of rape. No regret is expressed about the loss of men, which is always in the distant past. Indeed, the topic is often treated with a bracing gallows humour.</p> <p>Alice Sheldon’s 1976 novella, Houston, Houston, Do You Read? (published under her pen name, James Tiptree Jr) gives the idea in its most trenchant form. Three male astronauts return to Earth after several hundred years in space. Learning that all human men have died centuries ago, they assume they will be masters of the helpless women who remain. Instead, the women test them by giving them disinhibiting drugs, watch them flail around blurting out rape fantasies and assaulting girls, then politely inform them they will be euthanised: “We simply have no facilities for people with your emotional problems.” However, they do thank the doomed men, saying: “You have brought history alive for us.”</p> <p>Joanna Russ’s novel The Female Man (written in 1970 but first published in 1975) is considered the masterpiece of the genre. Here, four versions of the author inhabit four parallel worlds. One is ours, where the protagonist is Joanna. The second is a more conservative New York, where the anxiously conventional Jeannine works to catch a husband she doesn’t truly want.</p> <p>The third world is Whileaway, Russ’s utopia, where all men died of a plague 800 years earlier. Here, Janet fights duels, roams the wilderness, and is cheerfully promiscuous while adoring her wife, Vittoria, who, she boasts repeatedly, is much admired by Whileawayans for her big ass. Whileaway is a joyous, irreverent creation. Russ makes no apologies for stocking it with her own predilections (we’re left in no doubt of her opinion of big asses). Its people grumble all the time and are often jerks; it is above all things free – though it does have capital punishment for people who don’t do their share of the work. Even if it’s not your idea of paradise, you never doubt Russ would be happy there, which is more than you can say for most utopias and their creators.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In almost all these stories, at least one man is saved</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Only towards the end of the novel are we introduced to the fourth world, a gender-apartheid society where men and women are locked in perpetual war. Here, Jael is fixated on revenge against men because of the sexual abuse she suffered as a child. After tearing a would-be rapist apart with the steel claws implanted in her fingers, she comments: “I don’t give a damn whether it was necessary or not … I liked it.” In an aside, she announces that this world is the past of Whileaway; its men didn’t die of plague, but were exterminated. She approves: “In my opinion, questions that are based on something real ought to be settled by something real without all this damned lazy miserable drifting. I’m a fanatic. I want to see this thing settled … Gone. Dead.”</p> <p>The 21st-century revival is a very different animal. First, instead of being a dimly remembered political event, the mass death comes now. It has no good aspects. Men die horribly in front of us. Women are plunged into collective grief. Technological society falls apart for lack of skilled workers, and the world goes into decline. Women, meanwhile, are just as violent as men, and no more cooperative or empathic. The only result of generations of indoctrination into female roles is that girls are crap at engineering.</p> <p>Another difference is that, in almost all these stories, at least one man is saved. The best known example is the comic Y: The Last Man, by Brian K Vaughan and Pia Guerra, published from 2002 to 2008. Here, all male mammals die from plague except our hero, Yorick, and his pet monkey. Only yesterday an unsuccessful stage magician, Yorick is suddenly the most important person in the world, as his DNA holds the key to the survival of humanity. He’s hunted across post-apocalyptic America by various groups, notably a cult of rabid feminists intent on exterminating every last man. Of course, he is also desired by randy women wherever he goes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1fcc090ed8ecb5cb68b8f4b0b622c8c3984fa020\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fcc090ed8ecb5cb68b8f4b0b622c8c3984fa020/0_0_260_400/260.jpg\" alt=\"Afterland by Lauren Beukes.\" width=\"260\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Afterland by Lauren Beukes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Lauren Beukes’s 2020 novel Afterland, a threatened male is again the focus, after 99% of all male humans are killed by a flu that triggers prostate cancer. Survivors are incarcerated by the government and prevented from reproducing until a cure is found. The few free men are pursued by baby-hungry women and hunted by profiteers who want to harvest their sperm. The main character has broken her son out of a research facility and is fleeing with him through a post-apocalyptic world.</p> <p>Christina Sweeney-Baird’s The End of Men (2021) shows the male plague through a kaleidoscope of viewpoints. None, however, find the new world an improvement. As in Afterland, there’s an intense focus on sperm: though only 90% of men die of plague, there is somehow a critical shortage. The government enacts a form of eugenics, restricting the precious substance to mothers it deems fit. This move may be uncomfortably reminiscent of the politics of Herland, but the impression is not that Sweeney-Baird is a fan of eugenics; she is imagining things she thinks would happen if there were a male plague, not suggesting what should happen.</p> <p>All three of these works are apolitical. In their different ways, they are thrillers, and the reception of these works in most quarters has correspondingly been about their success as such, not their politics, and has been mostly positive.</p> <p>The exception is the reaction of a group of critics who are hostile to the genre. You might think this would be about the fantasy of male genocide. In fact, it’s the erasure of trans identities. The line between male and female in these books is always based on traditional notions of biological sex; trans women share the fate of cis men. In the old utopian versions, female societies are always better; this is seen as implying that gender traits are biological. In some second wave works, trans characters are described with open bigotry; Joanna Russ later apologised for the (mercifully brief) depiction of trans women in The Female Man. But this is not the main point: the premise itself is seen as bioessentialist and harmful to trans and non-binary people.</p> <p>Even a recent book by a trans author, Gretchen Felker-Martin’s Manhunt (2022), has drawn criticism online. In this novel, a plague transforms men into mindless, cannibalistic monsters who roam the woods, raping and killing. Trans women must stave off transformation by constantly taking hormones they can only get by killing men and eating their testicles. Meanwhile, they’re being hunted by TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists), who see them as man-monsters waiting to happen. The book is written to graphically convey the terror of transphobia. Still it’s been attacked by some on Twitter for its bioessentialist premise. Although producers of the TV version of Y: The Last Man hired trans writers to make the story more inclusive, it too was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/22679725/y-the-last-man-hulu-fx-tv-comic-trans\">considered problematic</a>. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There’s something transformative about utopian fiction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My own book has been the focus of attacks, even before its publication. Once again, it is the premise that matters. In my novel, all male humans disappear inexplicably in a single moment, and the resulting female society has a utopian odour. It’s no Whileaway; the plot is largely about the grief of people left behind. But fossil fuel emissions plummet, it’s easier to elect leftwing politicians, and, yes, lesbian polyamory is the order of the day. In the book, trans women are treated as women, trans men as men, and their problems are viewed sympathetically, but it has the hated premise. The attacks on it escalated to the point that a writer, Lauren Hough, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/books/lauren-hough-lambda-literary.html\">had a prize nomination from an LGBTQ arts organisation rescinded</a> for defending it online.</p> <p>Critics of the genre make important points, but I wouldn’t have written my book if I didn’t believe their criticisms were too sweeping. The more thoughtful versions of the narrative don’t affirm a gender binary, but try to dismantle it by erasing sex as a category. Russ’s Whileawayans are better and happier not because they are biologically female, but because they are free from sexism. The premise also interrogates the belief that excluding certain people is a means to a peaceful society. Exclusion as social policy is a time-honoured tradition in America (think mass incarceration and racial segregation) and on the rise worldwide.</p> <p>It’s also the idea behind excluding trans women from women’s changing rooms. Making people ask hard questions about it is crucial to all campaigns for justice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/21/sandra-newman-do-i-want-men-to-go-away-no\">Sandra Newman: ‘Do I want men to go away? No’ </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, Russ’s and Sheldon’s utopias (and, I hope, mine) are fraught with doubt. They present the reader with impossible choices – between accepting abuse and becoming as great a monster as your abusers; between rape and genocide. They are not works of dogmatic certainty like Gilman’s. They don’t even claim to know the nature of gender. All they know is that patriarchy is killing us, and something has to give.</p> <p>I believe there’s something potently transformative about utopian fiction. Too many of us now are trying to make a political revolution without hope. Our narratives of justice are all about punishment. We squabble about what constitutes punching up or punching down, but are poor in solutions that don’t involve punching. In our art, we don’t imagine better worlds, only more and grimmer apocalypses, and the people in them only long for the patriarchal world order that gives us supermarkets, indoor plumbing and hormone patches.</p> <p>When you put down Y: The Last Man or Manhunt (or Station Eleven or World War Z), it’s with a sigh of gratitude for the status quo. When you put down The Female Man, it’s with the unsettled, heady feeling that a freer world is just out of reach – but also with a consciousness<strong> </strong>of the violence that lurks behind most promises of freedom. We still have no answers and every utopia is riddled with asterisks. Let’s mind the asterisks and listen to the criticisms – but let’s dream our dreams.</p> <p>• The Men by Sandra Newman is published by Granta Books (£14.99).

Ancelotti has seen and done it all at club level, and yet he is often the first to admit that the first secret of management is that you need a little luck.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/24/jordan-henderson-liverpool-real-madrid-champions-league-final-nhs-raising-money\">Jordan Henderson: ‘Real Madrid are facing a different Liverpool, for sure’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even so, there was something startlingly apostate to it: the pivotal point of a Champions League semi-final, and you decide to delegate your last big call to your senior players. The prevailing orthodoxy of modern coaching is control: control of the ball, control of the situation, high intensity and high stress. And yet in that moment Ancelotti relinquished control, handed over the keys to a decision for which he would ultimately be held responsible. “It describes him perfectly as a coach,” Kroos said afterwards.</p> <p>Naturally this speaks to the popular caricature of Ancelotti as a manager from the laid-back, carefree school: the jolly cigar-smoking uncle, the sort of guy who can fix anything, a man who just instinctively knows how to work a barbecue. To a large extent that calmness is a facade, a persona as carefully crafted as the touchline thespianism embodied by so many of his contemporaries.</p> <p>“For me, the toughest spell is the three or four hours before kick-off,” he said on Tuesday when asked to reflect on his experiences of Champions League finals. “It’s a physical malaise. I’ve struggled with it a bit more this season: increased sweating and an accelerated heart rate. Negative thoughts creep in. But fortunately, all that stops once the game starts.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acfaa1acb01288debb22cb7969abddea6e7a83b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acfaa1acb01288debb22cb7969abddea6e7a83b6/0_56_3376_2140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlo Ancelotti and Karim Benzema wave to fans in Madrid during the team’s title parade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlo Ancelotti and Karim Benzema wave to fans in Madrid during the team’s title parade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Óscar del Pozo/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so clearly there’s something else going here as well, and perhaps you only really glimpse it in the very biggest games, under the highest pressure. Ancelotti doesn’t just cherish his players and put an arm around their shoulder. He trusts them: not just to execute his gameplan but to craft it, not just to assimilate his message but to pass it on and make it their own. Which, when you think about it, is no less courageous or daunting an approach than plotting and prescribing every last detail to the nth degree. It’s just a different form of courage: the courage of faith.</p> <p>There is a story that Ancelotti relates from his days managing Milan, when he had the pleasant dilemma of trying to accommodate four world-class midfielders – Andrea Pirlo, Clarence Seedorf, Kaká and Rui Costa – in the same midfield. After speaking to all of them, Ancelotti said: “You have to work it out. Or one of you will be on the bench every game.” </p> <p>And so in collaboration with Ancelotti, the quartet came up with the midfield diamond that would earn Kaká the Ballon d’Or and Milan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/24/match.sport\" title=\"\">the Champions League in 2007</a>. Perhaps this approach only really works at a club where the talent is as autonomous and gifted as that Milan squad, or Real now.</p> <p>Certainly Ancelotti has been fortunate to inherit a core of senior international players who already know their roles and responsibilities, who are settled without being complacent. One of the things that most surprised Ancelotti when he returned to the Bernabéu for his second spell last summer, having previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/14/carlo-ancelotti-real-madrid-coach-champions-league\" title=\"\">managed them from 2013-2015</a>, was how little players like Kroos, Marcelo, Casemiro and Luka Modric had changed, how little their hunger and attitude had waned from when they were young men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f90322f8aa4a6c6f6b54c48faa5625564262e387\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f90322f8aa4a6c6f6b54c48faa5625564262e387/0_0_3267_2179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rodrygo celebrates as his two quick semi-final goals helped eliminate Manchester City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rodrygo’s two late, quickfire goals helped eliminate Manchester City in the semi-final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet by the same token there is something remarkable about the way Ancelotti has managed to pacify and unite a club whose internal politics and external din have driven many of the world’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/23/mourinho-real-madrid-sid-lowe\" title=\"\">top coaches to distraction</a>. Recall the state Real were in when he took over: financially hampered, reviled the world over for its role in the European Super League project and in desperate need of a rebuild. Sergio Ramos and Raphaël Varane had gone and taken their 26 years of Madrid experience with them.</p> <p>Much of the credit for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/real-madrid-secure-35th-la-liga-title-with-dominant-win-over-espanyol\" title=\"\">Madrid’s La Liga title</a> and run to the Champions League final has gone to its stalwarts: Modric, Karim Benzema, Thibaut Courtois, all of whom have been excellent. But in fact Ancelotti has quietly overhauled the playing XI, rebuilding his frontline around the explosive Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo (both 21), handing Éder Militão (24) a regular role in defence, trusting Fede Valverde (23) in midfield. All of which looks elementary in retrospect, but Madrid is frequently a place where young talent goes to grow old and go on loan. Older players like Isco, Eden Hazard and Marcelo have quietly been eased to the margins, and yet still seem thoroughly buzzing to be there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In large part this is the atmosphere that Ancelotti helps to create: one in which stress is a burden and not a prerequisite, one in which he doesn’t claim to have all the answers, one that simply accepts we are all just passing through, that life is too short for petty enmities. “I have been in football since 1977,” he said earlier this season. “I don’t have the time or the desire to fight.”</p> <p>Likewise, you suspect that Ancelotti cares little for the legacy he has carved out for himself, for the many critics who over the years have derided him as a washed-up relic, an anachronism, a cup manager. Well, Ancelotti has now won league titles in five countries, is beloved the world over and is on the verge of being the first coach to win four Champions Leagues. If this is obsolescence, there are plenty of young coaches out there who would love a bit of it.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/25/george-floyd-murder-britain-black-americans-racist-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T07:00:29Z","webTitle":"George Floyd’s murder should have been a watershed, but Britain has learned nothing | Afua Hirsch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/george-floyd-murder-britain-black-americans-racist-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/george-floyd-murder-britain-black-americans-racist-violence","fields":{"headline":"George Floyd’s murder should have been a watershed, but Britain has learned nothing","trailText":"Black Americans fleeing the racist violence symbolised by events two years ago have not found a sanctuary in the UK, says writer and broadcaster Afua Hirsch","body":"<p>Since the murder of George Floyd two years ago today, I have been anecdotally observing the phenomenon of African-American refugees: families I have met who have fled racism in the US and sought refuge in Britain. Their journey follows the arc of all that has happened since. This time two years ago, they were traumatised by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">possibility of police violence</a> against their own children. Little more than six months later they were tipped over the edge by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/09/us-capitol-insurrection-white-supremacist-terror\">the Capitol riots</a>. Seeking another English-speaking home where they could obtain visas and avoid armed police, they came here.</p> <p>As they have discovered, Black people here hardly perceive this country as a sanctuary. In the past week alone we were confronted with inquest evidence that <a href=\"https://www.hja.net/news-and-insights/press-releases/civil-liberties-human-rights/black-british-man-with-severe-asthma-dies-in-brixton-whilst-under-arrest-by-met-police/\">Ian Taylor</a>, a 54-year-old asthmatic, was told to “stop acting up” by police officers but then died from a cardiac arrest. The verdict found that police assessments of the risks he faced were inadequate. The timing finds us on Floyd’s anniversary absorbing another painful story of a Black man pleading in vain for help to breathe.</p> <p>In the same week, they may have encountered the story of <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2022/05/21/south-wales-boy-has-finger-amputated-after-racist-bullying-in-gwent-16685766/\">Raheem Bailey</a>, a little boy who lost a finger desperately trying to flee attackers. We don’t yet know the full facts of his case, but his mother says he had been hounded by racist bullies since the beginning of the school year.</p> <p>They will read the findings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/racism-in-uk-maternity-care-risks-safety-of-black-asian-and-mixed-ethnicity-women-study\">a year-long study</a> describing systemic racism in UK maternity care. And that minority-ethnic people make up about 13% of the UK’s population, according to census data, but the latest figures from England and Wales show that these groups make <a href=\"https://www.thejusticegap.com/proportion-of-ethnic-minority-prisoners-on-remand-rises-17-in-six-years/#:~:text=According%20to%20Ministry%20of%20Justice,to%2029%25%20six%20years%20earlier.\">up 34% of those held on remand</a> in prison.</p> <p>The promises that flowed after the murder of Floyd have been flagrantly broken, or kept only in the most cynical way. It’s true that for those working in companies or public sector organisations, language and tone has adjusted. US studies have shown that the mention of “systemic racism” has increased <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67e79b20-bc41-4cb0-992f-a28e3eaa5695\">300-fold</a> at company events such as earnings calls and investor meetings.</p> <p>But investigations into British companies, museums, academic institutions and public sector organisations found that few of their <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/uk-black-lives-matter-george-floyd-pledges-businesses_uk_5fc12988c5b6e4b1ea4af536\">high-profile public statements</a> in the six months after Floyd’s death were matched with action.</p> <p>The government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/31/deeply-cynical-no-10-report-criticises-use-of-institutional-racism\">Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities</a> was a humourless joke, sponsored by a minister who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/23/kemi-badenoch-equalities-minister-reportedly-wrote-i-dont-care-about-colonialism\">tolerant of colonialism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/20/teaching-white-privilege-is-a-fact-breaks-the-law-minister-says\">intolerant of anti-racism</a>.</p> <p>And yet this ineffectual and often performative anti-racism has still been enough to trigger a backlash. In the US, rightwing fanatics have confused the hitherto academic critical race theory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/17/critical-race-theory-republicans-moira-donegan\">with anything anti-racist</a>. This has proved such a heady cocktail that some US states have spiralled into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/06/dave-eggers-offers-replace-books-south-dakota-school-board-pulp\">a book-pulping frenzy</a>. While the British government is yet to embark on this particular bender, it seems inspired, and has also attempted to make CRT a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/23/uk-critical-race-theory-trump-conservatives-structural-inequality\">villainous household name</a>.</p> <p>But the most sinister, perverse consequences of Floyd’s murder are the new laws that put both the actual bodies of Black people and anti-racist activism as a whole at risk.</p> <p>In the US at least 160 Confederate statues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/23/160-confederate-symbols-removed-public-spaces-2020\">were removed in 2020</a>, but the UK has moved swiftly to protect its racist symbolism. The <a href=\"https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2839\">Police, Crime Sentencing and Courts Act</a> invokes the toppling of Bristol’s Edward Colston statue – for which four people were acquitted of criminal damage – and makes future damage to memorials punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Protest will now be harder and more aggressively policed. This speaks directly to already aggressively overpoliced Black people in particular as a double attack. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/03/british-people-id-black-boy-from-kent-deportation-id-privilege\">Nationality and Borders Act</a> makes it possible to strip people with dual citizenship of their Britishness without notice, a fitting tribute to another troubling anniversary this year: 10 years of the “hostile environment”.</p> <p>But not all refugees are equal. The Americans I have met, who were able to arrange corporate relocations to facilitate their flight from racism, are likely to consider visiting Rwanda as a form of chosen return to the African continent, while the Nationality and Borders Act means black and brown refugees from poorer nations face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/18/i-thought-the-uk-was-a-good-country-man-faces-removal-to-rwanda\">being deported there</a> against their will.</p> <p>Those Americans, like other middle-class Black families, are also likely to be better cushioned against the coming recession, which new data suggests will widen an already record level unemployment gap between ethnic minority workers in Britain and everyone else. Recent statistics from the Office for National Statistics show Black households face being <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/black-people-savings-labour-analysis-b2012717.html\">disproportionately affected</a> by the cost of living crisis, with the majority of households having less than £1,500 in savings, and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/black-cost-living-households-food-b2051285.html\">being more likely to go hungry</a>. </p> <p>And yet, I have not seen the same energy for racial inequality evidenced in October – when Black History Month gave racial inequality modest airtime – on budget day.</p> <p>In June, the UK will celebrate the Queen’s platinum jubilee, but questions of racism are almost nowhere to be seen. It’s as if the royal family and structural racism are wholly unconnected.</p> <p>But the years since Floyd’s murder have emboldened Black and Indigenous communities around the world to see British royal tours as the tip of a multi-generational iceberg of racist trauma. The royals, meanwhile, still seem to think they are heading to subservient colonial playgrounds. The tour of Jamaica by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge was so disastrous it unintentionally became a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/25/william-and-kate-caribbean-tour-slavery-reparations-royals\">generous gift</a> to the republican cause. Prince Charles’s tour of Canada was met by <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/prince-charles-promises-canada-healing-and-understanding-over-schools-scandal-12615567\">demands for the Queen to apologise</a> for atrocities committed against at least 150,000 Indigenous children</p> <p>At home, Britain remains distracted by the wrong questions. <a href=\"https://www.britishfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/BF_Jubilee-Report_WEB.pdf\">One survey asked people</a> if they would be comfortable with a minority-ethnic prime minister, to which the majority answer is apparently yes. But to ask if the public are at ease with diversity assumes that there is something to be uneasy about, and strikes me as the radically wrong question.</p> <p>A better question <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/144/1447586/his-name-is-george-floyd/9781787635838.html\">being asked in the US</a> is what happened to the reconstruction-era promise to the formerly enslaved that they would be given <a href=\"https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/forty-acres-and-mule/\">40 acres and a mule</a>. Had that promise been kept, Floyd’s life would have turned out very differently – he may have inherited a tobacco farm rather than finding himself in the struggle to buy a pack of cigarettes that led to his death.</p> <p>Britain never bothered to make any such promise to either its enslaved or exploited colonial subjects. And a better question is: why not? Why is the UK failing to recognise, for example, the impact of its colonial land grab in Kenya? Mau Mau survivors there think <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/kenya-colonial-tea-plantations-kericho-fcdo-uk-b2072971.html\">a fitting way</a> to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee would be recognition that their own elderly relatives were robbed of their dignity and land.</p> <p>I think about African-American refugees to Britain, and any other newcomers, visitors or tourists, watching in awe as the nation gears up for the spectacle of union jack-lined street parties. But it’s what is absent that counts: I anticipate our supposed newfound anti-racist insight will also be suspended mid-air like bunting.</p> <p>It’s great that people are more fluent in the language of anti-racism, allyship and racial equity, but the cultural compartmentalisation of events such as this are the tests we continue to fail.</p> <ul> <li><p>Afua Hirsch is a writer, broadcaster, and former barrister</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/may/25/which-football-clubs-have-won-the-league-title-in-their-centenary-year","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T07:00:29Z","webTitle":"Which football clubs have won the league title in their centenary year? | The Knowledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/which-football-clubs-have-won-the-league-title-in-their-centenary-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/may/25/which-football-clubs-have-won-the-league-title-in-their-centenary-year","fields":{"headline":"Which football clubs have won the league title in their centenary year?","trailText":"Plus: yo-yo clubs avoiding each other, statues of bookable offences and which match produced the most pundits? ","body":"<p><strong>“How many clubs worldwide have won the league title in their centenary year and which was the first?”</strong> asks Masai Graham.</p> \n<p>Quite a few clubs have celebrated the big 100 with a league title, Masai. Alan Gomes gets the ball rolling with an example in Portugal. “Porto’s official date of foundation is September 1893. And Porto won the Portuguese title for the 1992-93 season. There is, however, some controversy about when Porto were founded. The club recognises 1893 as its official foundation year, however, the club’s founder, António Nicolau de Almeida, was persuaded in the late-1890s by his English wife to abandon football, which she apparently deemed “too violent”. The club lay dormant until 1906, when it was “refounded”. But if you want to use 1906 as the starting point instead of 1893, well, Porto won the 2005-06 Portuguese league as well.”</p> \n<p>Peter Collins gets symmetrical. “Chelsea won their first league title in 1954-55, 50 years after being founded, and their second in 2004-05, 100 years after being founded.” From there, Richard Wilson takes us to the former Yugoslavia. “There are a few centenary champions but some of their claims are more disputed than others,” he writes. “Dinamo Zagreb were formed in 1911 as HSK Gradanski and won a league and cup double in 2010-11. However, given Gradanski were disbanded after World War Two, owing to the perception of the club by the Partizans as collaborationist (as so many clubs in Yugoslavia were), there’s a fair argument to make that the club were only formed out of their ashes in 1945 and, as such, we’ll need to wait to see if they pull a centenary title off. The club would definitely claim heritage back to Gradanski’s start.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7732cb537fb8968d83ec24dee4288c44616d760\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7732cb537fb8968d83ec24dee4288c44616d760/0_261_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inter’s captain Javier Zanetti lifts the the Scudetto trophy in 2008, the club’s centenary year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inter’s captain Javier Zanetti lifts the the Scudetto trophy in 2008, the club’s centenary year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Crvena Zvezda (Red Star) could also be accused of similar – while the club state they were formed in 1945, their origin is similar to Dinamo’s in being formed from the ashes of another club in SK Jugoslavija and, if that lineage is accepted, then Zvezda’s 2013-14 title win would have been during their centenary season. The club would definitely <em>not</em> claim heritage back to Jugoslavija’s start. But beating both of these would be Zrinjski Mostar who were founded in 1905 as Dacki, before becoming Zrinjski in 1912. They were then banned from existence during the first world war, came back, banned after the second world war for being explicitly nationalist and then came back in 1992. Zrinjski won the title in their centenary year of 2005 and, to top things off, have won the title this season, which marks 100 years since the reappearance of the Zrinjski name after their ban.</p> \n<p>“And finally, if you want an unarguably uninterrupted centenary champion, look to Slovenia’s Celje. Formed in December 1919 they won their only national title in their centenary year of 2019-20 under Dusan Kosic, courtesy of a final-day draw against Olimpija – the first of what is three successive seasons on which the Prva Liga has been decided on the final day.”</p> \n<p>And Dirk Maas has handily collated all the examples he could find and thinks Linfield may be the first team to have achieved a centenary-year title victory. It’s limited to Europe, South America and North America.

Knowledge regular Chris Roe was all over this like a cheap statto, and tells us that the Fulham/Norwich switcheroo – which will enter its fifth season in 2022-23 – is an English league record.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"494db1792704bf1b550430050cb5af026379bb11\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/494db1792704bf1b550430050cb5af026379bb11/0_0_8640_5760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fulham are back up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fulham are back up.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier García/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Norwich and Burnley yo-yoed in different directions for four seasons between 2013-17 but, unlike Fulham and Norwich, weren’t in the same division in the seasons that preceded or followed those ups and downs. They probably don’t qualify as an answer to the actual question, but climate-conscious feature that we are, we couldn’t bring ourselves to waste good research.</p> \n<p>Chris has highlighted a number of teams who avoided each other for three seasons, having been in the same division immediately before <em>and</em> after they started the cycle of promotion and relegation. Leicester and Bolton (1994-97), Birmingham and West Brom (2006-09), Norwich and QPR (2013-16) and Norwich and Hull (2014-17) all fit that particular statistical bill. We don’t yet know whether Fulham and Norwich will end up back in the same division in 2023-24, 2024-25 or whenever their current sequence ends.</p> \n<p>“Around two-thirds of teams yo-yoing for at least three seasons have happened in the last 30 years,” adds Chris. “Does this mean that the standard gap between divisions is getting bigger (ie a team is too good for tier two, but not strong enough for tier one)?” Questions like that are way beyond our pay grade, and intelligence. But yes, yes it does.</p> \n<h2>Statues of bookable offences</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/andybrook1/status/1526509990768431105\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Is Sergio Aguero the first footballer to receive a statue of a bookable offence?</p>— Andy Brook 🏆 (@andybrook1) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andybrook1/status/1526509990768431105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 17, 2022</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>“I suspect you will get loads of these, but obviously the most famous statue of a bookable offence [only bookable? – Knowledge Ed] is the five-metre high statue of Zinedine Zidane <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/11/world-cup-moments-zinedine-zidane-head-butt\">head-butting Marco Materazzi</a>.

The systematic murder of the Ukrainian people has largely been forgotten, or at the very least internalised, by the game at large. Shall we talk about the lessons football can learn from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/football-ignored-the-truth-about-roman-abramovichs-oligarch-money-for-too-long\" title=\"\">its indulgence of a man</a> accused by the UK government of having “the blood of the Ukrainian people on his hands”? Or shall we talk about what this all means for Romelu Lukaku’s future? Football has long had an unmatched talent for extracting the serious from the trivial, and the last few weeks have proven that the reverse is perhaps also true.</p> <p>We have seen this, too, in some of the fawning early press coverage of Boehly’s arrival in London. Look, he stopped to take a selfie with some fans! Look, he wears a hoodie and jeans just like a normal person! Perhaps there is a legitimate point of difference here with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/roman-abramovich-billionaire-oligarch-money-russia-chelsea\" title=\"\">the reclusive and untouchable Roman Abramovich</a>, the sincere hope among Chelsea fans that this ownership may offer more of a recognisable human face. But equally, let’s remember what matters and what doesn’t.</p> <p>Mike Ashley wore a Newcastle shirt and drank pints in the stands. Michael Knighton stood on the Old Trafford pitch juggling a football. The Venkys promised to bring Ronaldinho to Blackburn Rovers. None of this was a reliable portent of anything at all. If you can afford to buy a Premier League football club, let’s assume you can also afford to hire a PR firm.</p> <p>And so, amid all the smoke and misdirection, what can we realistically expect from Boehly-era Chelsea? The prevailing view seems to be that Chelsea will be run along the lines of the Dodgers, who over the past decade have been transformed from wasteful underachievers into one of the sport’s pre-eminent forces and – by some distance – its biggest spenders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a72a92c74583a9eac07a89e4ee33e5e0312d39d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a72a92c74583a9eac07a89e4ee33e5e0312d39d/0_0_5616_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Todd Boehly takes his place in the directors’ box before kick-off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Todd Boehly takes his place in the directors’ box before kick-off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first four years under the ownership of Guggenheim – the management company of which Boehly was the president – the Dodgers spent $1bn on new players. Attendances steadily began to rise. In 2020 the Dodgers finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/27/la-dodgers-win-world-series-tampa-bay-rays\" title=\"\">ended their 32-year wait for a World Series victory</a>.</p> <p>If the skeletal details of the Dodgers takeover bear some similarities with Abramovich’s arrival at Chelsea in 2003, then closer scrutiny also reveals some of the differences. The Dodgers in 2012 were a serially failing organisation, characterised not just by mismanagement and apathy but a basic sense of waste. There was plenty of low-hanging fruit to be picked off; easy streams of revenue to be tapped.</p> <p>But Chelsea will not be allowed to sell their own television rights, as the Dodgers did in a remarkable £6.8bn deal with Time Warner to set up their own dedicated channel. They do not own much of the land around Stamford Bridge, limiting the possibilities for expansion and redevelopment. The scouting and youth development structures – significantly beefed up under Guggenheim – are already well-funded and largely profitable. Of course there are inefficiencies – <em>cough</em>, Saúl Ñíguez on £200,000 a week – but as an organisation Chelsea in 2022 is starting from a much higher base, raising the open-ended question of what, exactly, success will look like.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is here that we come to the flipside of the Boehly masterplan: a virtuous circle of investment and revenue generation that will suit Chelsea fans just fine, as long as they don’t mind doing a lot of the investing themselves. Success has come at a steep price for Dodgers supporters: the cheapest season tickets at Dodger Stadium now cost £1,400, more than four times as much as they did a decade ago. The most expensive are more than £13,000, a rise of almost 150%.</p> <p>Parking prices have risen at a similar rate. A portion of fries in a plastic baseball helmet will cost you £8. And while the 2013 Time Warner deal was a clear win for the bottom line, it essentially excommunicated the 50% of the southern California population who couldn’t receive the new channel until 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/21/thomas-tuchel-considering-signing-new-forwards-for-chelsea-this-summer\">Thomas Tuchel considering signing new forwards for Chelsea this summer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, perhaps, is the real defining theme of Boehly’s vision for elite sport: as a premium consumer entertainment, cold product served with warm feelings. Of course Chelsea fans matter in all this: after all, you are his co-investors, partners in this giddy enterprise. You’re going on a journey with him. He promises you thrills, lavish hospitality, a front-row seat to the greatest show on Earth. In the meantime, he’s going to pass you over to Dana, who will take your direct debit mandate and provide you with further details of exciting new products in the CFC metaverse.</p> <p>In a way, this is the principal distinction between the Abramovich and Boehly eras. For Chelsea fans, the Abramovich years were a sugar-coated dreamscape, an abundant pageant whose surrealness derived from the fact that nobody could really work out why any of this was happening.</p> <p>Protection?

That’s what it is: an illustrated guide to the things that make Cocker who he is. He doesn’t appear in many of the photos; the great majority show his collection of ephemera: a 20-year-old pack of Wrigley’s Extra gum, a fragment of Imperial Leather soap with its old-style label still attached. That’s him in a nutshell: driven by a lifelong love of the everyday, perceiving romance and poignance in items that others chuck out. It isn’t wrong to say that without this sensibility, there would have been no Pulp, whom he led until 2013, no many-tentacled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/03/jarv-is-review-albert-hall-manchester-jarvis-cocker-pulp\" title=\"\">solo career</a> and consequently no national treasure status.</p> <p>This isn’t the story of his time at the top. The penultimate object in the book is an acceptance letter, dated 1988, from Central Saint Martins School of Art and Design in London. It was while studying film and video there that he “ran slap bang into the subject matter of The Song That Made My Name”, which is the book’s only reference to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwrXAxcy1X0\" title=\"\">Common Pe(Please let there be a sequel covering those years.)ople</a> and the starry decade that followed.</p> <p>Good Pop, Bad Pop ambles through the 25 years before Saint Martins, tracking Cocker’s worldview as it takes shape in his home city of Sheffield. It opens in the present day, as he’s clearing out the loft of his London house. There is a lot of stuff in there, and each item has a story. His task is to decide whether to keep each thing or “cob” it (throw it out). Mulling over these ancient treasures puts him in philosophical mood, and the book soon expands into both an autobiography and a treatise on pop.</p> <p>Good pop is anything – not necessarily music related – that democratises culture, from jumble sales to Penguin paperbacks. (Jumbles were nirvana: not only did they help Cocker find his own style – see the polyester BHS shirt on page 29 – they also served tea and cake. It was, he writes mistily, “a complete day out”.) Bad pop, represented by a cardboard joke version of Margaret Thatcher’s handbag that he bought at WH Smith in 1979 (cob), uses good pop’s informality and catchy slogans to manipulate the public. Alongside all that is Cocker’s hope that by revealing his creative pathway, he’ll induce readers to find their own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f0c4418c8bf19d1aaca68ffede6567d02eeb71a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0c4418c8bf19d1aaca68ffede6567d02eeb71a9/0_0_3024_3024/1000.png\" alt=\"Soap in a box from the collection.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">These foolish things ... soap in a box from his collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Jarvis Cocker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That generosity is a hallmark of the book. If pop could save a bespectacled beanpole who found his name so embarrassing he briefly called himself John, it might save others. Cocker’s thoughtful and very funny ruminations make it seem possible. Although these events happened at a time when aspiring bands could support themselves with supplementary benefit, and every community had a library, at least his enthusiasm is transferrable.</p> <p>It is the unglamorous, character-shaping details that fill the pages. There’s his childhood in a matriarchal home, and his aversion to change – the reason he saves things that still have their 1980s packaging, such as the Imperial Leather (keep). There’s an adolescence divided between punk gigs, jumble sales and trying to learn what “masturbation” meant. A ripped copy of The Fantastic Dirty Joke Book (keep) didn’t explain it, so he turned to the dictionary and learned it was “self-abuse”. For a time, he assumed it entailed “walking around shouting at yourself ‘shithead!’ or ‘fart!”’</p> <p>At the same time, he was formulating what he called The Pulp Master Plan. A school exercise book (keep) contains the blueprint for the band he wanted to form. They would wear Oxfam blazers and “rancid ties”, the music would be “fairly conventional but slightly off-beat pop songs”, and they would “[learn] about the world by looking at what it threw away. By what it deemed ‘worthless’”.</p> <p>By the time Cocker was in his early 20s, the Pulp aesthetic was fully formed. “Pop was empowerment,” he writes. “Pop was made to satisfy primal desires.” He moved into his own idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2019/apr/11/inside-andy-warhol-factory-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol’s Factory</a>, an unheated industrial building through which passed many of Sheffield’s alternative types. He spent his time there on the dole, writing songs and tending his collection of plastic carrier bags, which he used every day, and still does now. But in 1985, trying to impress a girl, he fell from a window, and spent six weeks in hospital. It brought about an epiphany: “The scales had fallen from my eyes. I now realised that I’d been surrounded by inspiration all along.” His songwriting changed, and with it, his life. How?

Both parroted the big lie and both were soundly beaten. It was a tangible sign that even many Trump voters are now weary of “stop the steal” and eager to look forward. It was also a blow to Trump in a primary season where his scattergun endorsements have come up with a decidedly mixed win-loss record.</p> <p>But studying Trump’s recent record as kingmaker misses the point. In fact, it actively helps Republicans create the illusion that they have moved on from “Make America great again” (Maga) even as they continue to push its radical rightwing agenda.</p> <p>It all began with Glenn Youngkin, who last year won election as governor of Virginia as a Trump-lite Republican. He never campaigned alongside the ex-president but also took pains to avoid criticizing him and alienating his base. “Don’t insult Donald Trump but do everything to keep him away,” was how columnist Peggy Noonan put it in the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>Youngkin projected the image of a safe, sane, old school Republican who could win back suburban and independent voters. But he went Maga by pushing hot button issues such as coronavirus mask mandates, transgender bathrooms and “critical race theory” and portraying his opponent as a “woke” liberal. He flirted with, but did not embrace, Trump’s false claims of a stolen election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53e3ba58f6bb386662f27ebb885a24fcf647bf0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53e3ba58f6bb386662f27ebb885a24fcf647bf0f/0_229_3464_2080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former senator David Perdue salutes Donald Trump during a rally in Georgia in March 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former senator David Perdue salutes Donald Trump during a rally in Georgia in March 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alyssa Pointer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The formula has been emulated in various ways by candidates facing extreme Trump-backed challengers. It worked for Brad Little, the governor of Idaho, and now for Kemp in Georgia. Neither should be mistaken for “NeverTrumpers” in the mould of Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney, Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger or Larry Hogan.</p> <p>Kemp has recently nodded to the Trump base by signing bills that would ban abortions six weeks after conception and allow Georgians to carry guns in public without a license or background check. While he, unlike Perdue, has steered clear of the big lie, he was content to sign a voter suppression law in the name of “election integrity”.</p> <p>And on Monday he campaigned alongside Mike Pence, who as vice-president was one of Trump’s principal enablers for four years. Neither man uttered a word of criticism of the Maga patriarch. Kemp told reporters: “I had a great relationship with President Trump. I’ve never said anything bad about him. I don’t plan on doing that. I’m not mad at him. I think he’s just mad at me and that’s something that I can’t control.”</p> <p>Even Raffensperger, while more outspoken in denouncing Trump’s election lies, has campaigned on preventing non-citizen voting, which is virtually non-existent in Georgia or anywhere in the US, as well as putting an end to no-excuse mail-in voting,</p> <p>The Trump-without-the-tweets approach is a good fit for governors, who can build rightwing legislative achievements in their own states. In the 2024 presidential election, it might prove a useful blueprint for Pence, offering a promise of Maga past, or Florida governor Ron DeSantis, offering a promise of Maga future.</p> <p>Democrats are alive to the threat of the Republican party selling itself as post-Trump to swing state voters. On Tuesday the Democratic National Committee said in a statement: “From Mike Pence refusing to criticize Trump, to Republican candidates across the country running on his ultra-Maga agenda, the Republican party is Trump’s party, and there’s no turning back now.”</p> <p>To underline the point, although Perdue’s defeat showed the electoral limitations of the big lie, Trump-endorsed candidates showed that Frankenstein still exercises at least some control over the Maga monster.</p> <p>In Georgia, Herschel Walker, the former American football star, won a Senate primary and will now face Democrat Raphael Warnock in November. Congresswoman and conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene easily defeated a cluster of primary challengers to become the 14th district’s nominee.</p> <p>In Texas, attorney general Ken Paxton defeated George P Bush, nephew of George W Bush, a former president and stalwart of the anti-Trump Republican establishment. Sarah Sanders, Trump’s former White House press secretary, is now the Republican nominee for governor of Arkansas.</p> <p>In some cases, Trump jumps in late to back a candidate already assured of victory; in others, his endorsement lifts candidates, sometimes to victory. It is not always clear whether the chicken or egg came first. But it is evident that Maga can be a bottom-up phenomenon: last August there were boos when Trump urged supporters to get vaccinated.</p> <p>Similarly, some voters have been comfortable with a paradox of pledging loyalty to Trump while rejecting some of his endorsements. Thousands, for example, voted for both Raffensperger and Taylor Greene on Tuesday. They sense, presumably, that even those whose faith wavers in Trump the man, will still remain apostles of Trumpism the movement.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/may/25/can-stranger-things-help-put-netflix-back-on-track","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T06:22:28Z","webTitle":"Can Stranger Things help put Netflix back on track?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/25/can-stranger-things-help-put-netflix-back-on-track","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/25/can-stranger-things-help-put-netflix-back-on-track","fields":{"headline":"Can Stranger Things help put Netflix back on track?","trailText":"Return of the blockbuster series arrives at a precarious time for the streamer and all eyes are on how many viewers click play","body":"<p>Way back in 2016, when Stranger Things first hit Netflix, the world was a different place. The streaming service itself cost $8, and if you weren’t turned on by the prospect of endless, if vastly quality-variable content, there was the small matter of Stranger Things to convince you to hit that subscribe button. It had 80s nostalgia in spades, a soundtrack better than most John Hughes movies, and somehow seemed to do Stephen King better than the writer himself – or at least those film-makers and showrunners who have tried to bring the horror maestro’s work to the screen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/02/ozark-farewell-crime-show-laura-linney-jason-bateman-byrdes-ruth\">Farewell to Ozark – the most thrilling, rewarding crime show around</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Flash forward six years and Stranger Thing returns following a three-year break (presumably disrupted by Covid). Now Netflix is no longer the streaming revolution’s bright young thing, but a creaking behemoth that costs up to three times as much as it used to, especially if you’re viewing in UHD, and has 6 million competitors. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/20/netflix-shares-fall-losing-subscribers\">It’s lost 200,000 subscribers and is predicted to lose 2 million more</a>. Stock valuation has fallen more than 25% and there’s even talk of an advert-fuelled cheaper version of the service, something Netflix said it would never do.</p> <p>Meanwhile, critically acclaimed Netflix-produced shows such as Archive 81 and The Baby-Sitters Club are being axed before they have really had a chance to shine, and there’s the small matter of the most massive summer season of streaming TV in memory around the corner, with the likes of Disney+’s Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ms Marvel, Amazon’s Lord of the Rings and HBO’s Westworld all set to muddy the waters. Truly, the Demodogs are at the door, and if they’ve not yet broken in yet, it’s probably only a matter of time.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVsJXiI60a0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mVsJXiI60a0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>All this means that the service needs its biggest beast to win back subscribers harder than Elle (Eleven) once needed to get out of Hawkins National Laboratory, especially with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/02/ozark-farewell-crime-show-laura-linney-jason-bateman-byrdes-ruth\">Ozark</a> having recently completed its four-season run. To put things in perspective, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/stranger-things-sets-netflix-viewing-record-series-1248225/\">the third season of Stranger Things was Netflix’s most-viewed show of all time when it hit screens in October 2019</a>, with more than 64m views in its first four weeks and more than 582m to date. Since then, <a href=\"https://top10.netflix.com/tv\">it’s been overtaken by seasons one and two of Bridgerton</a>, but is almost guaranteed to take back its crown with season four. <br><br>Luckily the first part of season four is a tour de force unlike anything ever seen before on TV, its appearance after all this time like discovering a fabulous, late-blooming batch of rogue rhododendrons that you swear you never planted in your garden (even if you are fully aware this evil but lovely shrub will probably turn out to be at least part Venus flytrap when you put your hands anywhere near it.)</p> <p>Ostensibly taking place six months after the events of season three, though some characters seemed to have aged about 10 years in that time, there is a new central baddie to replace the Mindflayer – or perhaps sit alongside it. He’s a terrifying undead wizard known as Vecna, who (like all Stranger Things monsters) has literally leapt direct from the game box of Dungeons and Dragons.<br><br>We meet Hawkins’s new hero, the lovable, slightly cowardly metal-head and incorrigible dungeon master Eddie, who finds himself accused of the murders that Vecna is really committing (with excruciating bone-snapping horror) in the upside down. There’s even Elle’s journey back to Hawkins lab, because we all know she’s never going to be allowed to live a normal, happy teenage existence. Meanwhile, Winona Ryder’s Joyce and Brett Gelman’s Murray Bauman find themselves bumming around Siberia in a desperate effort to find the long-lost Hopper (David Harbour), who if you will recall was last seen disappearing into hell with some Soviet miscreants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b83462f32784ab756944912f85f0df54abe7c951\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b83462f32784ab756944912f85f0df54abe7c951/640_0_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Millie Bobby Brown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Millie Bobby Brown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cast seems to have expanded exponentially beyond the initial four horsemen of the upside down apocalypse – Dustin, Lucas, Will and Mike – who we met way back in season one. Maya Hawke’s Robin Buckley is now a fully fledged member of the anti-Mindflayer team, and Sadie Sink’s wonderful Max is still dealing with the psychological and supernatural fallout of her bumptious brother Billy’s death in season three. But if there’s a whole lot more story to tell, it doesn’t really matter because most of the episodes now clock in at around 80 minutes, which makes the season’s part one not just an epic TV experience like no other but a glorious collection of seven interconnected, sprawling mini-movies that must clock in at around 500 minutes plus. And that’s before the final two episodes debut in July. Take that, streaming rivals! This season makes HBO Max’s four-hour plus version of Justice League look like an episode of Friends.<br><br>So will Stranger Things put Netflix back on its feet, win back those lost subscribers and allow the men in suits to breathe a sigh of relief? On this evidence the return of the show is certainly not going to do subscriber numbers any harm, and switching off before July’s two-part finale would be about as smart as trying to French kiss a Demogorgon. Longer term, it remains to be seen if the streaming service can keep breaking new ground, but it’s just rolled the equivalent of 20 on one of those many-sided D&amp;D dice. Just stop putting the price up now, please.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/may/25/first-edition-keir-starmer-book-oliver-eagleton","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T06:05:19Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Anguish at another US school shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/first-edition-keir-starmer-book-oliver-eagleton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/25/first-edition-keir-starmer-book-oliver-eagleton","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday briefing: Anguish at another US school shooting","trailText":"In today’s newsletter: how the killing of 19 children and two adults at a school in Texas will reignite America’s gun control debate","body":"<p>Good morning. “As a country, we have been through this too many times,” the president said. “These children are our children.

At least 19 children and two adults were killed.

He went on: “The hollowness in your chest. You feel like you’re being sucked into it and never going to be able to get out.”</p> <p>He said that “gun manufacturers have spent two decades aggressively marketing assault weapons, which make them the most and largest profit”. He did not immediately set out proposals for new legislation on gun control but asked: “Where in God’s name is our backbone?”</p> <p>Barack Obama said that he and his wife Michelle “grieve with the families in Uvalde, who are experiencing pain no one should have to bear”. And he added: “Nearly 10 years after Sandy Hook—and 10 days after Buffalo—our country is paralyzed, not by fear, but by a gun lobby and a political party that have shown no willingness to act in any way that might help prevent these tragedies.”</p> <p>“My heart is broken today,” Hal Harrell, the school district superintendent, said. “We’re a small community and we’re going to need your prayers to get through this.” Erica Leslie Lafferty, whose mother was killed at Sandy Hook, said that it was “beyond time to take action”.</p> <p>Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator who came to Congress representing the district that included Sandy Hook, teared up as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/literally-on-my-hands-and-knees-senator-chris-murphys-desperate-plea-for-gun-action\">he begged Senate colleagues to finally pass legislation to address gun violence</a>. “This isn’t inevitable,” he said. “These kids weren’t unlucky. This only happens in this country and nowhere else.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>How have the gun lobby and its allies responded?</p> <p>Republicans and those who oppose stricter gun control legislation suggested that stricter security measures in schools were the answer. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton said that “having teachers and other administrators who have gone through training and who are armed” would have saved lives.</p> <p>Senator Ted Cruz said that “one of the most effective tools for keeping kids safe is armed law enforcement on the campus”. Lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, said on the Fox News show Tucker Carlson Tonight: “We have to harden these targets so no one can get in, ever, except through one entrance.”</p> <p>There was no immediate response from the National Rifle Association, or from Donald Trump, who is due to speak at the group’s annual meeting for the sixth time on Friday. Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, is also due to speak at the meeting.</p> <p>***</p> <p>What is the law in Texas – and will anything change?</p> <p>Texas lawmakers have repeatedly fought to ensure the state has some of the least restrictive gun ownership policies in the country. The state enacted new pro-gun legislation last year <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/16/texas-permitless-carry-gun-law/\">allowing</a> most residents of the state to openly carry guns without having to get permits or complete training. Abbott <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/texas-gun-laws.html\">celebrated</a> it as “the strongest second amendment legislation in Texas history”.</p> <p>In Washington, the Democratic senate majority leader Chuck Schumer moved to force votes in the next few days on legislation to institute stricter criminal background checks on gun buyers, and enforce longer waiting times for anyone flagged as a potential risk.</p> <p>The same measures were passed by the house of representatives in 2019 and 2021. But because of Republican opposition, they have not passed the senate and become law, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/24/us/democrats-gun-control-school-shooting.html\">the New York Times said</a>. And the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said he was “horrified and heartbroken” by the attack, but gave no indication that his party’s stance was likely to change.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p>Every few months someone else declares that, surely, it is <strong>the end of the road for </strong><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> but it never quite pans out that way. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/disgraced-prime-minister-boris-johnson-party-lockdown\">Polly Toynbee takes a look</a> at how the prime minister keeps clawing his way back. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>As we <strong>wait for Sue Gray</strong> to deliver, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/24/three-cheers-police-blindness-partygate-boris-johnson\">Marina Hyde delivers her customary zingers</a> to fill the time – taking in everything from the photos of Boris Johnson drinking at the “not a party” to the government’s mishandling of the retreat from Kabul.

The problems began months ago when a newly built Aldi employed an enforcement company, </strong><strong>Parkingeye</strong><strong>, to manage its car park next door to the </strong><strong>Purbeck health</strong><strong> centre in Milton Keynes</strong><strong>. The automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) camera at the entrance to Aldi has been set up with an unnecessarily wide range so that it photographs vehicles turning into the adjacent NHS site. The Aldi store manager and Parkingeye have been made aware of this and ensure the tickets are cancelled when contested</strong><strong>, but not everyone will know to appeal and some staff have been sent several PCNs. Aldi blames Parkingeye and Parkingeye customer service is unable to arrange repositioning of the camera.<br></strong><em><strong>KH Chertsey, Surrey</strong></em></p> <p>The Aldi opened in December, so Parkingeye has had five months to sort its cameras out. Initially, Aldi told me that staff at the health centre, which includes a dentist, two specialist clinics and a GP surgery, should log their vehicle registration numbers at the Aldi store to prevent future PCNs. When I pointed out that it was unreasonable for drivers to have to register with a unconnected third party for permission to park in their own car park, it confirmed that the ANPR camera had now been adjusted so that only vehicles entering the Aldi premises would be captured. Parkingeye was contacted for a comment.</p> <p>Earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/09/food-bank-users-threatened-with-170-parking-fine\" title=\"\">I reported on an enforcement firm pursuing food-bank users and volunteers for charges of up to £170</a> when they parked in the food bank’s own car park. Management companies prevent abuse of private parking spaces, but extortionate charges and heavy-handed tactics have prompted a government crackdown. In February, plans were announced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/07/most-private-parking-fines-to-be-capped-at-50-in-england-and-wales\" title=\"\">cap most private parking charges at £50</a> and to require reasonable grace periods before PCNs were issued. Although private parking charges mimic council PCNs, they are invoices, not fines.

The re-examination of her death was ordered after Ian Stewart was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/22/helen-bailey-trial-ian-stewart-found-guilty\">convicted of murdering his new partner, the children’s author Helen Bailey</a>, in 2017.</p> <p>After Whelan’s death a police investigation concluded there was no third-party involvement and closed the case, while an inquest concluded she had died in “circumstances which were consistent with a nocturnal seizure having precipitated a cardiac arrest”.</p> <p>While West Yorkshire police say that conclusion remains and an investigation has not been formally reopened, the Guardian can reveal the force is approaching another police unit in relation to the murder of Diane Stewart. There is no suggestion Ian Stewart was involved in Whelan’s death.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/09/ian-stewart-helen-bailey-diane-stewart-brain-tissue-donation-web-of-lies\">re-examination of Diane Stewart’s brain</a> revealed it showed signs that “breathing had been restricted” for between 35 minutes and an hour before her death and ultimately helped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/09/man-who-killed-fiancee-found-guilty-of-wife-murder-six-years-earlier-ian-stewart\">secure a conviction against her husband</a>. </p> <p>Whelan’s mother, Caramella Brennan, approached West Yorkshire police with further questions after reading reports about the Stewart case. Brennan said slides of her daughter’s brain tissue had been preserved, meaning similar tests could be conducted.</p> <p>In March she approached the coroner’s service and shortly after was contacted by West Yorkshire police, who confirmed they would be liaising with the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit that investigated Stewart’s murder.</p> <p>It is understood the pathologist who conducted the original postmortem, Dr Matthew Lyall, is being considered to re-examine Whelan’s brain tissue.</p> <p>Whelan, a health and social care graduate with an ambition to work with young offenders, had a baby while at university and completed her studies while raising the child and working part-time at a nursery.</p> <p>Investigations into her death were severely hampered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/23/emily-whelan-family-fear-daughter-killed-sue-leeds-nhs-trust-after-body-decomposes\">the failings of Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust to preserve her body</a>. A forensic postmortem was ordered about 10 months after Whelan’s death but when the pathologist came to examine her body, it had decomposed.</p> <p>The pathologist “carefully considered” whether her death could have been caused “by injuries inflicted by another person”. He said his examination of the body was “severely hampered by changes of decomposition”. He said in the absence of obvious traumatic injury, he considered the possibility of an asphyxia death, meaning strangling or smothering.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said that in the first examination, the pathologist had mentioned “a few petechiae in the eyes” – tiny red spots that can be a sign of strangulation – but that they were not visible by the time he conducted his own assessment, adding “the decompositional changes could have obscured any that were there”.</p> <p>In a judgment handed down last year, a judge concluded that Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust had breached human rights laws by failing to preserve Whelan’s body, and awarded the family damages.</p> <p>Brennan told the Guardian: “Despite the breathtaking incompetence of the mortuaries, the coroner’s office and certain police officers during the first look at events surrounding Emily’s death, I’m hopeful the evidence will be found this time around.</p> <p>“There isn’t a day that passes where we don’t think about and miss Emily.”</p> <p>A West Yorkshire police spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we are approaching Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit to ask about the circumstances of their investigation into the murder of Diane Stewart, after the case was highlighted to us by the family of Emily Whelan.</p> <p>“At this time there is no change to our previous conclusion that Emily’s death was not suspicious with no third-party involvement.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/25/self-reflection-is-usually-for-leftists-and-the-weak-but-we-need-to-find-out-who-to-blame-for-the-election","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T05:55:01Z","webTitle":"Self-reflection is usually for leftists and the weak but we need to find out who to blame for the election | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/self-reflection-is-usually-for-leftists-and-the-weak-but-we-need-to-find-out-who-to-blame-for-the-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/25/self-reflection-is-usually-for-leftists-and-the-weak-but-we-need-to-find-out-who-to-blame-for-the-election","fields":{"headline":"Self-reflection is usually for leftists and the weak but we need to find out who to blame for the election","trailText":"There’s no time for dramatics because democracy has been MURDERED!","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62a284bac8fd116c010cbc8238cf69863722ba66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62a284bac8fd116c010cbc8238cf69863722ba66/0_0_1812_4639/391.jpg\" alt=\"First Dog on the Moon Cartoon: Dackbulge Freakout 2022\" width=\"391\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2022/may/25/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-is-the-shorter-one-part-play-better","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T05:50:59Z","webTitle":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: is the shorter, one-part play better?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/25/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-is-the-shorter-one-part-play-better","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/may/25/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-is-the-shorter-one-part-play-better","fields":{"headline":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: is the shorter, one-part play better?","trailText":"A three-and-a-half-hour version of the show has opened in Australia and the US.

But Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the theatrical sequel to Rowling’s books, has now been tightened from a two-part play to a single three-and-a-half-hour show with an interval.</p> <p>The new version – which opened in Melbourne last week, replacing the two-parter that began in Australia in 2019 – not only helps pack more audiences in, but it is likely to appeal to those with small children, smaller budgets (a ticket now costs between $60-$220, which is what you used to pay for each part), or people travelling to see it in the smattering of theatres putting it on around the world. The one-parter has also recently launched in San Francisco and on Broadway in New York, and will soon open in Toronto and Tokyo; the longer version will remain, for now, in London and Hamburg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/14/harry-potter-philosophers-stone-jk-rowling-sketches\">Harry Potter and the missing sketches: JK Rowling’s first drawings of boy wizard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So what’s the short review of this shorter play? The Cursed Child still feels like Rowling based it on a cheese dream, but the plot remains in tact, if a touch too frenetic.</p> <p>Without spoiling anything for those who haven’t seen either version, we follow Harry Potter’s adolescent son Albus as he starts at Hogwarts, where he attempts to escape the shadow of his famous father, now an overworked and overbearing adult. Albus and his BFF Scorpius Malfoy – the son of his father’s childhood enemy Draco – decide to travel back in time to change a crucial detail in Harry’s past, in order to improve the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22573e38bf88e8610f283b0d4881123b83b7d8b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22573e38bf88e8610f283b0d4881123b83b7d8b7/105_0_5637_3386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘No matter how many times you see this play, it’s hard to resist the joys of all the fiery explosions and optical illusions.’ Harry Potter and the Cursed Child at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michelle Grace Hunder</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far, so plotty. But with the new cuts, The Cursed Child is now even plottier, and there is still a lot of it to steam through. Exposition is rattled off like we’re at the races, lighter fluid can be seen splashing across the stage as the actors twirl about, and scenes change at breakneck speed. (I felt for many of the actors who, towards the end, are literally sprinting on and off stage.) Somehow, there are even more magic tricks: no matter how many times you see this play, it’s hard to resist the joys of all the fiery explosions and optical illusions.</p> <p>But gone is much of the background richness that, while not essential to the story, gave a better sense of Rowling’s world maturing. There was something interesting in seeing more of her boy hero as an adult man, trying to give his children a healthy childhood while reckoning with his undeniably traumatic one.</p> <p>Some characters are dropped entirely and go unnoticed; others are reduced to the point that you wonder why they are included at all. (Albus’s older brother James is forgettable now; their sister Lily is entirely gone.) One major character, who is secretly a villain and was included in much of the original show, is now barely on stage at all, making their big reveal feel a little wet.</p> <p>And yet, among all the cuts, one scene has noticeably been added: in the second half, Albus takes Harry aside to inform his father that he will have to accept Scorpius as “the most important person in my life”, a declaration made with weighted urgency and one that his father benignly accepts. The original show was criticised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/aug/16/harry-potter-possible-example-queerbaiting-cursed-child\">“queerbaiting”</a> Albus and Scorpius, but director John Tiffany – who is gay – then said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/30/a-whole-new-controversy-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-comes-to-australia\">“would not [have] been appropriate”</a> to make the nature of their relationship any clearer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/25/we-werent-planning-to-be-this-popular-australian-korean-rappers-1300-hit-the-big-time\">‘We weren’t planning to be this popular!’ Australian-Korean rappers 1300 hit the big time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Six years on, it is clear someone felt it was now appropriate. The sub is gone from the subtext; Scorpius’s female love interest in the original is now a platonic friend. Whether giving Harry a son who seems ever-so-slightly queer has anything to do with Rowling’s now public views on trans people, aired since the play debuted six years ago, is unknown and unlikely ever to be confirmed by anyone. Some wouldn’t even spot the change. What is inarguable is that someone thought the change was important.</p> <p>Crucially, the abridged Cursed Child is not better for being shorter. You’ll still whoop for all the wonderful magic, but this distilled version reinforces just how much this play has always functioned as a greatest hits tour of all things Potter: there are time turners, dementors, the invisibility cloak, trips into the Forbidden Forest, magical duels and plenty of surprise reunions with dead characters. If you have been able to see the longer version, 10 points to you – but unless you’re a huge fan, there is little reason to spend even more hours on it.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is on at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre; tickets are on sale through to October 2022.

These illnesses end the lives of approximately 41 million of the 56 million people who die every year – and three quarters of them are in the developing world.</p>\n    <p>NCDs are simply that; unlike, say, a virus, you can’t catch them. Instead, they are caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types are cancers, chronic respiratory illnesses, diabetes and cardiovascular disease – heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 80% are preventable, and all are on the rise, spreading inexorably around the world as ageing populations and lifestyles pushed by economic growth and urbanisation make being unhealthy a global phenomenon.</p>\n    <p>NCDs, once seen as illnesses of the wealthy, now have a grip on the poor. Disease, disability and death are perfectly designed to create and widen inequality – and being poor makes it less likely you will be diagnosed accurately or treated.</p>\n    <p>Investment in tackling these common and chronic conditions that kill 71% of us is incredibly low, while the cost to families, economies and communities is staggeringly high.</p>\n    <p>In low income countries NCDs – typically slow and debilitating illnesses – are seeing a fraction of the money needed being invested or donated. Attention remains focused on the traditional disease threats, yet cancer death rates have long sped past the death toll from malaria, TB and HIV/ Aids combined.</p>\n    <p>A common condition is a new Guardian series reporting on NCDs in the developing world; their prevalence, the solutions, the causes and consequences, telling the stories of people living with these illnesses.</p>\n    <p><b>Tracy McVeigh, editor</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“Most of [our patients] are returning back home,” he said.

One doctor, who had recently been on the cancer ward, said people were struggling to understand why they were still being refused treatment.</p> \n<p>“The nurses are very frustrated because patients are repeatedly asking them, ‘where are our cancer drugs?’, because they hear drugs are coming [in]. It’s heartbreaking for the nurses, and for the physicians working there. I saw one oncologist crying while giving an interview for the local media. They are in a dire situation,” he said.</p> \n<p>In a statement, a group of oncologists at the Ayder wrote: “The existing situation of cancer care in Ayder Comprehensive Specialized hospital is so bad that it is almost nonexistent, and those who have no involvement in the war are paying a huge cost.”</p> \n<p>The war has decimated the healthcare system in Tigray, home to more than 7 million people. But the parlous state of the Ayder’s cancer care is particularly striking given that, five years ago, doctors at the hospital had drawn up an ambitious plan to bring its oncology services into the 21st century.</p> \n<p>A comprehensive cancer care unit, housed in a new six-storey building, was to be built, and doctors were to receive specialist training in Ethiopia and abroad.

The one obvious stumbling block for a Bob’s Burgers movie is that the show is so resolutely minor, tied up in the day-to-day anxieties and miscues of a family whose lives rarely expand past the half-block between their restaurant and the decrepit boardwalk down the street. How do you expand the Belcherverse without losing the smallness that makes it great?</p> <p>For series creator Loren Brouchard, who co-directed The Bob’s Burgers Movie with Bernard Derriman and co-scripted with Nora Smith, the answer is: a couple of songs, a wildly discursive murder mystery, and that’s about it. Even the songs are a goof on splashy production numbers, squeaked out by tuneless New Jersey voices and choreography that’s less Busby Berkeley than Lars von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark. Yet it’s the perfect approach for a film that refuses to compromise its identity for the sake of cinematic scale, but doesn’t feel like three episodes strung together, either. It functions elegantly as both a victory lap for longtime fans and a belated introduction to the Belchers, a family of lovable misfits and cranks that’s as genuinely close as any on television.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hldGGWN9HcI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hldGGWN9HcI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The opening number establishes the lived-in chemistry between Bob (H Jon Benjamin), a world-weary and anxious burger flipper, and his wife Linda (John Roberts), whose optimism cannot be suppressed, even when someone is trying to bury her family alive. It’s 8 o’clock in the morning, and Bob is crafting a special burger for the loan officer at the bank, in the faint hope they can get an extension to keep their Ocean Avenue restaurant in business. “Your faces are making me sad,” says the banker, unmoved, as he shoos them away with seven days to make good on their payment. As soon as they retreat to a business with only one loyal customer, a giant sinkhole opens up right in front of the door and their landlord, Calvin Fischoeder (Kevin Kline), isn’t inclined to give them a break on the rent.</p> <p>The scramble to save the restaurant winds up getting linked to the mystery of a carny named Cotton Candy Dan who was murdered six years earlier, but The Bob’s Burgers Movie doesn’t let all this plotting get in way of its character sketch work. It also gives time to each of the Belcher kids: Louise (Kristen Schaal) frets over the pink bunny ears that she’s kept on her head since preschool; Tina (Dan Mintz) dreams of a summer fling with Jimmy Pesto Jr, who struggles to catch chicken nuggets tossed at his mouth; and Gene (Eugene Mirman) fashions a tooth-rattling musical instrument out of plastic spoons, a rubber band and an empty metal napkin holder. As much as Bouchard had to think about how to turn Bob’s Burgers into a movie, he insists on staying true to the personal eccentricities and small-scale observational humor that makes the show great.</p> <p>Unlike a comparable project like The Simpsons Movie, which rushed to squeeze in references and characters from 18 seasons, The Bob’s Burgers Movie doesn’t change the pace and tone of a typical episode any more than necessary. The murder mystery may lead to a hectic finale, but it also allows the film to drift into the weird shantytown of Carnyopolis, where ne’er-do-wells gamble over rubber prize-booth duckies. And the added stress of the restaurant possibly shutting down brings the best out of Linda, whose motherly impulse to look on the bright side gets ever more absurd. When the busted water main in the sinkhole is replaced, she praises the new, blue plastic pipe as “hip” and “modern”.</p> <p>What’s most striking about The Bob’s Burgers Movie is how rarely a family as relatable as the Belchers ever makes it to the big screen in Hollywood. The grownups worry about nursing their small dream of oceanside burger artistry, the kids are wrapped up in weird fantasies and pre-teen awkwardness, and Bouchard isn’t inclined to turn them into The Incredibles to pay the rent. They may sing for the movie’s sake, but they can’t carry a tune.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Bob’s Burgers Movie is out in Australia on 26 May and in US and UK cinemas on 27 May.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/24/five-key-takeaways-the-us-midterm-elections","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T05:05:28Z","webTitle":"Five key takeaways: the US midterm elections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/five-key-takeaways-the-us-midterm-elections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/24/five-key-takeaways-the-us-midterm-elections","fields":{"headline":"Five key takeaways: the US midterm elections","trailText":"Races from Georgia to Texas were a litmus test of Trump’s hold on the Republican party with some significant losses","body":"<h2>Blow to Donald Trump as a political kingmaker</h2> <p>Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, defeated former senator David Perdue, who had been endorsed by Donald Trump.

The <a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/butterflies/adonis-blue\">Adonis blue</a>, chalkhill blue and <a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/butterflies/silver-spotted-skipper\">silver-spotted skipper</a> have moved despite decades of conservation work boosting their numbers.</p> <p>All three species require warm, short, flower-rich chalk grassland, and all declined disastrously in the mid-20th century with the loss of such grassland and a reduction in traditional grazing.</p> <p>Since the 1980s, all three have been revived and were appearing to benefit from climate warming, moving north to new sites. However, their decline in the past decade may be caused by new factors, such as increasing nitrogen deposition – from farm fertilisers and vehicle pollution – that lead to vigorous grasses crowding out the more delicate wildflowers butterfly caterpillars need to survive.</p> <p>“It’s disappointing to see these species going back into the threatened group,” Fox said. “Insidious changes in the environment from climate change or nitrogen or both mean the habitat created by conservation management 20 years ago does not necessarily produce the same results today.</p> <p>“Land managers are continually having to experiment to produce suitable habitats for species such as these because everything else is changing. In the Netherlands, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisvanswaay/status/1225358445831950338?lang=bg\">scientists</a> are convinced <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320716309156\">nitrogen deposition</a> is a major factor in the decline of some of their rare butterflies.”</p> <p>The negative impact of global heating is evident in the inclusion in threatened categories of all four butterflies found in cooler, northern habitats.The large heath, scotch argus and northern brown argus are now listed as “threatened” and the mountain ringlet as “near threatened”. All four species are likely to disappear from the southerly parts of their range.</p> <p>The red list requires five years of positive data before an endangered species can be considered to be reviving and so the new list does not yet reveal improvements.</p> <p>These include a resurgence for the wood white after intensive conservation management.

Median overall survival is 23 months with the new immunotherapy compared with 16.1 months with chemotherapy alone.</p> <p>“Following its worrying provisional rejection by Nice earlier this year, the reversal of this decision now brings hope to eligible women for whom it could bring precious additional time before their disease progresses and more months to live and spend time with loved ones and doing what matters most to them,” she said.</p> <p>Keytruda is used with chemotherapy in women with triple negative breast cancer whose tumours express PD-L1 with a combined positive score greater than or equal to 10. They must also not have had chemotherapy for advanced disease, and they qualify for treatment if surgery is not possible to remove the tumour.</p> <p>Nice said that after its previous rejection, the manufacturer MSD proposed that the drug combination should be restricted to people whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS greater than or equal to 10. This meant Nice was able to look again and pass the drug, which helps the patient’s own immune cells to attack cancer.</p> <p>Helen Knight, the interim director of medicines evaluation at Nice, said: “I am pleased the company has been able to work constructively with us to find solutions to the issues highlighted in our previous draft guidance. People who were not able to access atezolizumab, another Nice-recommended immunotherapy, now have an important new option that can help them live longer and spend more precious time with their loved ones.</p> <p>“So, although our recommendation is for a narrower population than pembrolizumab combination is licensed for, it means the maximum number of people with advanced triple negative breast cancer now have access to effective treatments.”</p> <p>Morgan said she hoped women with advanced breast cancer would soon be able to benefit from more options. “Despite this positive news, we now also desperately need to see progress on the Nice appraisal of Trodelvy, which is another potentially life-extending drug for certain people with secondary breast cancer, that was devastatingly provisionally rejected in April.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Separately, a poll for Breast Cancer Now of 1,007 women with breast cancer has found 44% said the disease negatively affected their body image and 25% said the same for their sense of identity.</p> <p>Overall, 37% said their diagnosis worsened their mental health and self-esteem.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/25/sandy-hook-families-speak-out-after-uvalde-school-shooting","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T05:00:55Z","webTitle":"Sandy Hook families speak out after Uvalde school shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/sandy-hook-families-speak-out-after-uvalde-school-shooting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/25/sandy-hook-families-speak-out-after-uvalde-school-shooting","fields":{"headline":"Sandy Hook families speak out after Uvalde school shooting","trailText":"Bereaved say it is ‘beyond time to take action’ on gun control in the wake of the killing of 19 children in Texas","body":"<p>The families of people killed in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting have pleaded for action on gun control in the wake of the killings at Robb elementary school in Texas.</p> <p>Erica Leslie Lafferty, whose mother was killed in the massacre in Connecticut in 2012, said that it was “beyond time to take action” in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/texas-school-shooting-uvalde-robb-elementary\">attack in Uvalde</a> which has left at least 19 children and two adults dead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ericalaff/status/1529227013361438720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thoughts and prayers didn’t bring my mother back after she was gunned down in a hallway at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SandyHook?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SandyHook</a> - they also won’t bring the 15 murdered at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RobbElementaryschool?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RobbElementaryschool</a> back to life.

She was so terrified that she climbed out of the back window of the house where she was living, taking her seven-year-old son with her, and they became homeless.</p> <p>Sarah, who asked for her real name not to be published, had been in the UK since she arrived in 1994 as a two-year-old refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She had attended primary and secondary school in the UK and was working and paying taxes in London, but her uncertain immigration status had not been resolved when she was a child. As an adult she was required every three years to pay fees of about £1,000 to apply for visas that would allow her to remain. An error on her 2016 application form meant the visa was refused, but the fees were not refunded and she could not afford to reapply, and she slipped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/30/sri-lankan-man-left-in-immigration-limbo-for-decades-can-stay-in-uk\">into immigration limbo</a>. Even now, 28 years after arriving in the UK, she is still battling to get British citizenship.</p> <p>For three years she was at the mercy of the hostile environment. Her bank account was closed, because she was unable to provide any proof that she had the right to live in the UK (she lost the £200 savings in her account). She was unable to work and was denied benefits because of her lack of documentation. She spent years feeling nervous about going out, worried that she might be picked up by immigration enforcement officers; she often felt too frightened to take her son to school.</p> <p>“I became extremely paranoid. I couldn’t sleep properly – any sound would make me get up and look out of the window. From getting that letter, I don’t think I had a proper night’s sleep in about four years,” she said this week. She had no money, was unable to shop for food or clothes for herself or her son, and was entirely dependent on friends and family. Initially she was too frightened to stay with relatives, nervous about border officials tracking her down, but eventually she moved in with family members.</p> <p>“For years I’ve needed other people to help support me and my son,” she said. “If it hadn’t been for my family’s support, I would have stayed homeless. I probably would have become a prostitute, on heroin, and it would have been the Home Office’s fault.”</p> <p>She has no recollection of leaving the DRC – her earliest memory is of walking beneath a London flyover to nursery school – but knows her parents sent her to the UK with an aunt because they felt she would have a safer, more stable life in Britain, away from the conflict. Her mother has been trying to join her in the UK since 1994; she has made it to France but has not seen her daughter since Sarah was two. “She’s been saving money and is still trying to get through the immigration system to get somewhere closer to me,” Sarah said. Sarah’s childhood was difficult and she spent most of it in care; social workers neglected to regularise her immigration status.</p> <p>The requirement to save large amounts of money for immigration fees has blighted her adult life. “I had to make choices that I didn’t want to make. I did things that I shouldn’t have done,” she said, crying at the memory. “The fear still lives with me.”</p> <p>Despite having been born in the UK, her son is also fighting for British citizenship, a process that will be expensive to resolve. Sarah is working as a carer and remains in debt from the period when she was out of work; she knows she will struggle to pay the fees.</p> <p>“I do consider myself British, I’ve lived here since I was two, but it is difficult to consider yourself part of something that you’ve been rejected from.”</p> <p>In 2020 Sarah’s lawyer received an email from the Home Office acknowledging that she should have been granted indefinite leave to remain years earlier, and promising to rectify the situation. However, Sarah is still unable to access student finance, and had to leave a university course in healthcare management this year because she is not yet eligible for a loan. </p> <p>Sarah’s attempts to rectify her Home Office status have been supported by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. Paola Uccellari, the charity’s interim executive director, said: “Over the past 10 years this government’s hostile immigration rules have pushed tens of thousands of people into a living nightmare of legal limbo, fear and destitution. Every month we speak to people like Sarah who have lived here for decades but who have been robbed of their rights and status by this government, simply because they couldn’t afford extortionate visa fees or because they made a small mistake on a form.” </p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: “The government remains committed to having an immigration system which provides effective control, but which is also fair, humane and fully compliant with the law.</p> <p> “Our approach is subject to continuous review, and building on the Windrush legacy, we have adopted a people facing and individual approach and introduced new safeguards to our processes.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/25/birmingham-communities-feel-ignored-by-commonwealth-games-bosses","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T05:00:28Z","webTitle":"Birmingham communities feel ‘ignored’ by Commonwealth Games bosses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/25/birmingham-communities-feel-ignored-by-commonwealth-games-bosses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/25/birmingham-communities-feel-ignored-by-commonwealth-games-bosses","fields":{"headline":"Birmingham communities feel ‘ignored’ by Commonwealth Games bosses","trailText":"Exclusive: panel says organisers have failed to engage city’s diverse groups in a meaningful way","body":"<p>Organisers of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham have left diverse communities feeling “largely ignored” and have failed to engage them in a meaningful way, according to a report.</p> <p>The Birmingham Race Impact Group (BRIG) commissioned a panel of race equality practitioners and consultants to assess the Games in a number of areas including legacy, community engagement and procurement.</p> <p>Across all areas the Games were scored red (urgent action required) and amber (work needed), with the report highlighting how communities feel there has been a “tick box” approach to engaging with different ethnic groups in the city.</p> <p>Specific issues it highlights include engagement with schools focusing heavily on photo opportunities and flag-waving “akin to traditional subjugation-style opportunities for minority groups”.</p> <p>The Birmingham 2022 organising committee strongly rebutted some of the report’s claims. It said: “We are working hard to ensure that benefits [from the Games] are available to everyone across the region and are proud that our workforce reflects the diversity of the West Midlands.</p> <p>“Whilst we are disappointed with the conclusions reached within the report, we value BRIG’s input and will carefully consider their recommendations, so that we maximise every opportunity to benefit as many people as possible from all the communities across Birmingham and the West Midlands.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wearebrig.co.uk/post/brig-report-2022\">The report says</a> Birmingham’s diversity “was leveraged as a positive factor in the pitch to secure the Commonwealth Games”, but organisers have “failed to engage the city’s diverse communities in a meaningful way”.</p> <p>It says an equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) forum set up to improve communication with minority groups “was far from conducive in generating trust, confidence and positive relationships”, and participants reported confusion over its purpose.</p> <p>It says its conclusions “leave the diverse communities of Birmingham feeling that they have been largely ignored” and that the event’s “diversity credentials are at serious risk”.</p> <p>Mac Alonge, the chief executive of The Equal Group, a diversity and inclusion consultancy, who was part of the report assessment team, said: “The Games has been positioned as this great thing for the region, for the economy. But people haven’t felt it, people have felt frustrated.</p> <p>“I think it’s probably too late for this Games but there are lessons to be learned for future games and any future projects where there is an intense amount of capital being poured into a region.”</p> <p>Tru Powell, the director of Aston performing arts academy in the city, said his organisation had been sidelined despite repeated attempts to get involved in the Games.</p> <p>“I was really optimistic about the Commonwealth Games coming to the city. I was the first one to jump up and say hallelujah, yes, this is going to be great, there’s going to be so many opportunities,” he said. “But as things started to progress, I started to see who was benefiting from the Games and who, more importantly, wasn’t benefiting.</p> <p>“We are one of the largest grassroots arts organisations in the city, working every week with over 150 inner-city young people ranging from age six to 30,” he said. “I think it’s a catastrophe we’re not involved in some way, shape or form.”</p> <p>The 2022 Commonwealth Games has faced concerns around diversity since 2020, when there was backlash over the fact that originally only two of 14 directors on the board of the organising committee had a minority ethnic background, leading to other board members being recruited. There are now five people of colour on the board.</p> <p>Earlier this year there was also upset around a six-month cultural festival running alongside the Games, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/commonwealth-games-cultural-festival-accused-sidelining-people-of-colour\">some felt had sidelined minority groups</a>.</p> <p>A “truth and reconciliation action plan” <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/protests-part-of-commonwealth-games-18575596\">promised</a> by the former Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive David Grevemberg to tackle the problematic history of the event, formerly known as the British Empire Games, has failed to materialise.</p> <p>Saima Razzaq, the head of diversity and inclusion at Birmingham Pride, said: “Birmingham itself is fast becoming a city of two halves and this report must act as a wake-up call for everyone to do better by understanding what intersectionality truly means.</p> <p>“As well as the Commonwealth Games, this year marks the Queen’s platinum jubilee, 60 years of independence for Jamaica, 75 years since the partition of India, and with it also being 50 years of Pride in the UK, for us at Birmingham Pride these narratives are very much front of mind, and you can’t celebrate or commemorate one without the other.”</p> <p>A Birmingham city council spokesperson said: “The findings of this report are disappointing, and it is clear that there are things to be reflected upon by a range of organisations in the city.

For the first time private landlords, employers and NHS staff are to be co-opted into plans to carry out checks on migrants to ensure they are in the UK legally and to report them to immigration enforcement if not. May, who became home secretary two years before she announced her crackdown, warned: “We’re going to give illegal migrants a really hostile reception.” The policy heralded a culture change across a range of UK institutions unused to policing immigration.</p> <p><strong>22 July to 22 August 2013</strong>: a pilot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/22/go-home-vans-scrapped-failure\">scheme</a> takes place in six London boroughs featuring vans carrying billboards with the message: “In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.” Government hoped that the populist move would take some of the wind out of the sails of the Ukip party, whose anti-immigration, anti-EU narrative was gaining traction at the time. The operation was considered a failure with only a few dozen people leaving the UK as a result. The scheme was ridiculed, with some calling the helpline number saying things like: “Hello – I’d like to go home – to Willesden. Can you give me a lift?”</p> <p><strong>February 2014:</strong> BBC Panorama <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26024375\">exposed</a> cheating among overseas students taking English tests.

About 2,500 students were forcibly removed from the UK after being accused of cheating and a further 7,200 left the country after being warned that they faced detention and removal if they stayed.</p> <p><strong>October 2017:</strong> the Guardian reporter Amelia Gentleman begins the painstaking work of exposing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/apr/20/amelia-gentleman-windrush-immigration\">Windrush scandal</a>. Her exposé led to international condemnation of Home Office hostile environment policies. Gentleman has said it was not initially apparent how wide-ranging the scandal was. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/apr/20/amelia-gentleman-windrush-immigration\">said</a>: “Some MPs, such as Kate Osamor, were beginning to see lots of cases; others hadn’t heard of the problem. Mostly people assumed these were weird anomalies where something very specific had gone wrong. I realised how rapidly the problem was growing when the charity Praxis said it was seeing more and more cases every year.”</p> <p><strong>October 2021:</strong> the Home Office announces a controversial policy to push back small boats in the Channel. It later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/priti-patel-accused-misleading-parliament-refugee-pushbacks\">emerges</a> that officials never planned to use the policy against asylum seekers, the overwhelming majority of those crossing the Channel in small boats.

Rumours and leaks about the policy had been circulating for months before the government announced it formally. At least 100 asylum seekers who recently arrived in the UK in small boats are understood to have been issued with notices of intent that they will be flown 4,500 miles to Rwanda. The government has indicated nobody will be flown out to the central African country before 6 June. The PCS union, which represents many Home Office staff, and several refugee NGOs have launched legal challenges against the policy.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/may/25/terrawatch-earth-core-rusty-atmosphere","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T05:00:28Z","webTitle":"Terrawatch: is Earth’s core going rusty?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/25/terrawatch-earth-core-rusty-atmosphere","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/may/25/terrawatch-earth-core-rusty-atmosphere","fields":{"headline":"Terrawatch: is Earth’s core going rusty?","trailText":"Rusty bits on Earth’s core could explain how the atmosphere became oxygenated","body":"<p>Whether it is your bike or a garden fork that you forgot to put away, most of us are familiar with the rapid rusting that happens when iron-containing objects are exposed to the elements.</p> <p>But it isn’t just iron left out in the rain that is vulnerable: <a href=\"https://eos.org/features/is-earths-core-rusting?utm_source=EosBuzz&amp;mkt_tok=OTg3LUlHVC01NzIAAAGEE7-i5VNDEfe2naam4VDwvQuG3TbuA6COFPEHs3YcswwnjhOrYfM8qlt4pPgT7ZkngvoLRYhPj2b-e7U8zvt43bD7cPwyu821mzfYon4\">research</a> suggests Earth’s biggest deposit of iron – its core – could also be going rusty.</p> <p>Sitting 1,800 miles (2,900km) beneath Earth’s surface, it had been assumed the high-pressure environment and paucity of water-bearing minerals kept the molten outer core safe from the effects of rust.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/4/6/870/4107791\">recent experiments</a> have shown that rust can be stable at high pressures, and could plausibly be formed at locations where water-rich slabs of Earth’s crust have sunk to the core-mantle boundary.</p> <p>And if the core does get spots of rust this could explain the slower seismic waves observed in some areas of the lower mantle, such as deep underneath northern Mexico, where a chunk of crust from North and Central America is thought to have landed about 200m years ago.</p> <p>Now scientists are speculating that some of these heaps of rust might occasionally hitch a lift back to the surface via a mantle plume, providing a fresh explanation for how Earth’s atmosphere suddenly became oxygen-rich about 2.5bn years ago.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2022/may/25/the-great-british-breakfast-the-regional-treats-that-make-the-perfect-fry-up-from-laverbread-to-fruit-pudding","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T05:00:27Z","webTitle":"The great British breakfast!

Here are 10 dishes to try","body":"<p>Despite the somewhat chequered reputation of traditional British cooking, even its biggest critics will usually concede that breakfast represents its high point – and, while I wouldn’t say it’s all downhill from there, let’s be honest, the all-day fry-up is popular for a reason. As the late AA Gill once wrote: “Breakfast is everything. The beginning, the first thing. It is the mouthful that is the commitment to a new day, a continuing life” – and, as a country, we really take that commitment seriously.</p> <p>Not only is “le fry-up” one of the things we’re most famous for abroad, but unlike the royal family, or Mr Blobby, it’s one national treasure we can all be proud of, whether we sit down to a full Scottish in the morning, or grab a vegan sausage bap on the go. Mind you, that’s just about all we agree on, as I discovered last year when I set out on my bike to write a book on the subject – Red Sauce Brown Sauce. Any discussion about the great British breakfast tends to get bogged down in baked beans, or end in fisticuffs over back versus streaky – to say nothing of whether porridge should be salty or sweet, or the proper thickness of peel for marmalade. Instead of squabbling about such details, here are a few regional treasures I encountered en route that I think we should all be fighting to put on our plates:</p> <h2>1) Hogs pudding – West Country</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94d4638eb3f13a83885ceedd25a108946d18f88d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94d4638eb3f13a83885ceedd25a108946d18f88d/0_0_1860_1028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hog’s pudding\" width=\"1000\" height=\"553\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hog’s pudding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Steven Gregor/The Guardian; Zoonar GmbH/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also known as groat pudding, this rich and spicy white pudding is now found mainly in Devon and Cornwall, but was once common throughout the south – it pops up in <a href=\"https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1660/11/11/\">Samuel Pepys’ diary of life in 17th-century London</a> and<a href=\"https://janeaustens.house/object/martha-lloyds-household-book/\"> Jane Austen’s Hampshire housemate Martha Lloyd’s recipe collection</a> (a detail that conjures a delicious image of Jane writing Mr Darcy into existence while munching on a hogs pudding bap). Like its blood-based cousins, it was originally designed to help use up odd bits of a pig when that valuable animal was slaughtered, generally in the autumn. Offal and scraps were mixed with cream, eggs, herbs and spices, bulked out by breadcrumbs or cereals (hence the groat variation), and then made into a sausage, and boiled, a measure that would have extended their shelf life considerably before the advent of reliable refrigeration.</p> <p>These days, the squeamish will be relieved to know that hogs pudding tends to be made with pork meat, rather than internal bits and pieces; Sally Lugg of The Primrose Herd, near Redruth, uses belly and shoulder in<a href=\"https://www.primroseherd.co.uk/online-shop/pork-sausages/cornish-hogs-pudding.html\"> her award-winning version</a>, though she is wisely tight lipped about the other ingredients. Pepper often features prominently, though, and I like the ginger, allspice and mace found in older recipes, often alongside currants, as a reminder of the dish’s medieval origins. As hogs pudding is sold cooked, all you need to do is add it to the frying pan to heat through before you tuck in and realise, to quote my friend Pam: “Oh, it’s just like a sausage!”</p> <h2>2) Laverbread – Welsh coastline</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b51313d2d5f5ba436cd2eb01ffaee69a4771757\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b51313d2d5f5ba436cd2eb01ffaee69a4771757/0_0_1860_1028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laverbread\" width=\"1000\" height=\"553\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laverbread.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Steven Gregor/The Guardian; neiljohn/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nothing to do with bread, or molten rock, laverbread is in fact a paste made out of seaweed – Porphyra, known as laver in Wales and the West Country, sloke in Scotland and Ireland, and nori in Japan. Even if you don’t come from a laver-eating region, you’ve probably had it in a sushi roll at some point. Not that that dried nori sheets bear much resemblance to laverbread’s rich, dark, almost gelatinous good looks, described by Richard Burton, no doubt in his usual mellifluous tones, as “Welshman’s caviar”, and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMAd9R6fy1s\"> bushcraft instructor Andrew Price as “a bit like a cowpat … except it tastes absolutely delicious to anyone brave enough to try it”</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://selwynsseafoods.com/products/laverbread\">Kate Jones of Selwyn’s Seafoods, in Penclawdd</a>, explains that to make it they gather the seaweed from the rocks by hand, wash it to “get all the sand and the little shrimps and things out” and then slow cook it for hours with a bit of salt – “it doesn’t need a lot” – until it’s soft enough to spread on toast. Traditionally, the puree is then dolloped into the same pan as the bacon to sizzle in its fat, though a local chef tells me this can be an acquired taste, so, for English visitors, he makes it into little cakes flavoured with cheese and oats as well. However you eat it, packed with iron, as well as vitamins and minerals, it is an unusually nutritious addition to a fry-up – especially with a handful of cockles on the side.</p> <h2>3) Oatcakes – Midlands</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"237b21d1a7216c6d9ddd40f25fbc36d78763bb52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/237b21d1a7216c6d9ddd40f25fbc36d78763bb52/0_0_1860_1028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oatcakes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"553\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oatcakes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Steven Gregor/The Guardian; William Scott Lyons/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before any Scots complain, I’m not talking about your lovely crunchy biscuits here, but <a href=\"https://poveysoatcakes.com\">the floppy oat-based pancakes</a> found in the Midlands, and, I’m reliably informed, as far north as Manchester. Claimed by both Staffordshire and Derbyshire, the heartland of oatcake production is still the Potteries, where they were traditionally sold through the front window of terrace houses to workers on their way to clock in. The last of these “hole in the wall” businesses closed in 2012, due to redevelopment rather than a lack of demand; one baker told<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0017412\"> a recent edition of Radio 4’s the Food Programme, dedicated to the Staffordshire oatcake</a>, that, after some years in decline, the market is now growing, as local people rediscover their culinary heritage. Indeed,<a href=\"https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/robbie-williams-wants-open-oatcake-5464310\"> Tunstall boy Robbie Williams even gets his mum to send supplies to his home in LA</a>, while<a href=\"https://www.6towns.co.uk/2020/08/08/happy-oatcake-day/\"> 6 Towns Radio’s annual Oatcake Day has been endorsed by the likes of Stoke-born Slash from Guns N’ Roses … and US rapper Coolio</a>. Frankly, it’s a mystery to me why they’re not more popular outside their home region – anything a palm-oil-laced, long-life “wrap” can do, a warm, yeasted oatcake can do better. Mine’s a double bacon, egg and tomato please.</p> <h2>4) Soda farls – Northern Ireland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3420381272dbc322d9e608a9996a4cba2eb5c788\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3420381272dbc322d9e608a9996a4cba2eb5c788/0_0_1860_1028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soda farls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"553\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soda farls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Steven Gregor/The Guardian; Radharc Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/food-drink/recipes/how-to-cook-the-perfect-ulster-fry-29962910.html\">Northern Ireland’s signature fry-up</a> is a carb-lover’s paradise, which is why it may well be my favourite of all the national breakfasts. Not only does it often come with toast on the side, as is standard practice elsewhere, but, at its best it also boasts not one but two breads on the plate itself: potato, of the sort known in Scotland as a tattie scone, and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peNn3DmuZ38\"> the mighty soda farl</a>, an uncompromisingly dense hunk of pure pleasure. It’s child’s play to knock up from nothing more than flour, buttermilk (or milk mixed with a little lemon juice or vinegar), bicarbonate of soda salt, and sometimes honey or treacle. And, with no need to faff around with either yeast or ovens, it can be on the table in the time it takes to lever your nearest and dearest out of bed.

I’ll be honest: even as someone terminally greedy, the first time I saw a tray of what looked like raisin cookie dough in a Scottish supermarket, nestled incongruously between the haggis and the Wee Willie Winkie’s mini-sausages, I was seriously unnerved. Then I tried a piece. Made from a mix of suet, oatmeal and flour, dried fruit and spices, fruit pudding is really just a cross between a white, or mealy pudding as it’s also known north of the border, and a<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/clootiepudding_9528\"> clootie dumpling</a>. Hot and crisp from the pan, it pairs beautifully with cured meat.

Nevertheless, this was the equivalent of a multivitamin to our forebears coming out of a long hungry winter of salted meat with nary a fresh vegetable in sight.

A wodge of mashed potato and cabbage, fried until crisp on the outside, but still fluffy within, is, in my opinion, a fine addition to the breakfast platter, being better at soaking up egg yolk than such interlopers as the crunchy chip or greasy hash brown – and it offers the same soothing carby bland foil to the salty bacon and sausage as the divine tattie scone. Plus, it contains actual green stuff, which makes it, relatively speaking at least, the healthy option. More bubble and squeak please.</p> <h2>9) Fresh black pudding – East Anglia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c6284e58bf4456acab5a4283fddc3bc2404e2f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c6284e58bf4456acab5a4283fddc3bc2404e2f2/0_0_1860_1028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh black pudding\" width=\"1000\" height=\"553\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh black pudding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Steven Gregor/The Guardian; Martin Lee/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Black puddings are, of course, made all over these islands (<a href=\"https://stornowayblackpuddings.com/store/Original-Stornoway-Black-Pudding-650g-p132214054\">Stornoway</a> and<a href=\"https://www.buryblackpuddings.co.uk\"> Bury</a> are particularly famous for them), but I hadn’t realised, until I started researching my book, that these days almost all of them are made with dried blood. Not that dried blood, unappetising as I concede it sounds, is necessarily a bad thing on a breakfast plate. I’ve never met a black pudding I didn’t like, so it must be doing something right, but, in my experience, the results tend to lack the silky richness of products made with blood direct from the pig, rather than reconstituted with water like a boxed cake mix.</p> <p>Matthew Cockin and Grant Harper of<a href=\"https://www.fruitpig.co.uk/black-puddings\"> Fruit Pig, in Wisbech</a>, are still doing it the old way, driving an hour and 20 minutes to their nearest abattoir to get on to the slaughter line themselves, and literally holding the pig as the blood drains out of it – blood that would otherwise mostly go to waste (dried blood mainly comes from the Netherlands and Belgium). They believe it makes a better final product, and I agree, but I also applaud the way this embraces the original ethos of a black pudding: to make use of every precious part of a pig. If you eat bacon, I believe you should at least give black pudding a try.</p> <h2>10) Stotties – north-east</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16ff8c0c6f7225d5f5065e2653a2c2d5c6bcc634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16ff8c0c6f7225d5f5065e2653a2c2d5c6bcc634/0_0_1860_1028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stottie cake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"553\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stottie cake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Steven Gregor/The Guardian; Washington Imaging/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You may,<a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/remember-muhammad-ali-tucked-stottie-10355306\"> like Muhammad Ali, when confronted with this dense, round cake of bread on a trip to South Shields in 1977</a>, be wondering what the hell a stottie is when it’s at home.

Tory MPs might tut, but they would also mainly shrug.</p> <p><strong>Risk rating: 🥳</strong></p> <h2>A few salacious details about the same events</h2> <p>Gray is not expected to publish many, if any, actual photographs of illicit parties, in part because the report will not identify any junior officials. But it would be awkward for Johnson if one not yet seen was included, along with corroborating details, for example – as described by some people who attended – confirming that Johnson instigated the 13 November leaving drinks for his then head of communications, Lee Cain, poured drinks and made a speech.</p> <p><strong>Risk rating: 🥳 🥳</strong></p> <h2>New details about other events – more photos emerge</h2> <p>There has been understandable focus on the 13 November gathering, and on the birthday party for Johnson in June 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/boris-johnson-could-get-three-more-fines-over-partygate-say-insiders\">for which he was fined</a>. But Tory MPs could become twitchy if other events are brought to the foreground, for example an alleged party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/sue-gray-report-criticises-no-10-over-difficult-to-justify-parties\">in Johnson’s Downing Street flat</a> on the same evening that Cain left. On an optimistic note for Johnson, Gray is a civil servant, and is expected to focus more on process and generalities than specifics.</p> <p><strong>Risk rating: 🥳 🥳 🥳 </strong></p> <h2>Gray holds Johnson particularly responsible</h2> <p>This is where it becomes really tricky for the PM. The interim report did not blame Johnson personally, speaking only in general terms about leadership failures inside No 10. Gray’s full report could set out, whether explicitly or by inference, the idea that as prime minister he <em>could and should</em> have acted to stop the party culture that existed inside No 10 during lockdown. An official narrative portraying Johnson as complicit in the lawbreaking or, at best, an ineffectual bystander, would not be good news for Tory MPs. Along with the photos we have already seen, his supporters would find it hard to hold the line …</p> <p><strong>Risk rating: 🥳 🥳 🥳 🥳 </strong></p> <h2>A document proving Johnson knew an event was illegal</h2> <p>The biggest threat to Johnson is the idea that he deliberately misled parliament when he said, incorrectly and several times, that no rules were broken in No 10. His defence is that this was his sincere belief at the time, and intent to deceive is hard to prove. But a potential smoking gun that could prove his undoing would be an email, text, WhatsApp or other document emerged showing the PM realised at the time that one or more event was primarily social, and thus illicit. There has not been even a hint of a rumour about any such a thing linked directly to Johnson, so it seems unlikely. But it is one of the few revelations that could see him ousted by the MPs who have so far held their noses.</p> <p><strong>Risk rating: 🥳 🥳 🥳 🥳 🥳 </strong></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/25/astrazeneca-reviews-diversity-in-trials-to-ensure-drugs-work-for-all","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T05:00:27Z","webTitle":"AstraZeneca reviews diversity in trials to ensure drugs work for all","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/astrazeneca-reviews-diversity-in-trials-to-ensure-drugs-work-for-all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/25/astrazeneca-reviews-diversity-in-trials-to-ensure-drugs-work-for-all","fields":{"headline":"AstraZeneca reviews diversity in trials to ensure drugs work for all","trailText":"Firm aims to apply ‘equity lens’ across clinical tests to ensure diverse population groups take part","body":"<p>The pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is conducting a major review of diversity across its trials in an attempt to ensure its medicines work for all population groups, although it has admitted that including pregnant women is a particular challenge.</p> <p>The head of oncology at Britain’s biggest drugmaker, David Fredrickson told the Guardian that the firm was among those leading efforts to improve participation of people of colour and other under-represented groups in clinical trials.</p> <p>Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, he called it applying an “equity lens” to every phase of the medicine’s lifecycle.</p> <p>Concerns have been raised that a lack of diversity among volunteers participating in clinical trials may result in drugs and medical equipment being developed that are less effective in certain groups.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/nov/24/astrazeneca-to-run-more-clinical-trials-in-peoples-homes-to-improve-diversity\">AstraZeneca to run more clinical trials in people’s homes to improve diversity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pregnant women are one such cohort of concern. “Pregnancy is a common and almost universal exclusion for clinical trials,” Fredrickson said, admitting that the issue is a “more challenging one to tackle” for the industry.</p> <p>The situation meant that that group was excluded from trials for coronavirus vaccines, and public confusion over whether the shots were safe for pregnant women ultimately led to a low uptake.

Instead, the threat of <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21475439/\">a new bird flu</a>, just as likely to come out of a farm in New York or England as one in China or Bolivia, now stalks humanity. Chicken is now the rich world’s most popular meat and tens of millions of near-genetically identical birds prone to catastrophic disease are being mass-reared at any one time, often in unhygienic conditions, and are able to mix with wild birds. It is only a matter of decades before a new highly pathogenic avian influenza strain <a href=\"https://globalhealth.duke.edu/news/statistics-say-large-pandemics-are-more-likely-we-thought\">evolves to be easily transmissible between humans</a>.</p> <p>As much by luck as good judgment, humans dodged a bullet with Sars in 2003 and to some extent with Covid, which so far has killed about 1% of people infected. But major flu pandemics with very high mortality rates come along every 30 years or so and we are well overdue the next. If we are lucky we will find a vaccine fast and it will only kill 10-20% of people it infects. If we are unlucky, it could be just as transmissible as Omicron and as fatal as Ebola – in which case it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/06/covid-not-over-next-pandemic-could-be-more-lethal-oxford-jab-creator\">effectively be game over</a> for much of humanity and the global economy.</p> <p>But we may have seen nothing yet. Climate change is now kicking in, creating a hotter, sicker world with a potentially catastrophic impact on disease. Global heating fundamentally changes the landscape of disease by forcing or enabling species to survive in new places and mix with others. Insects already kill about 700,000 people a year, but global heating allows mosquitoes, mites, fleas, ticks and other vectors to flourish in new areas, spreading dengue, chikungunya, and other diseases to higher ground or to previously cooler climates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/what-is-monkeypox-source-cases-infections-spread-experts\">What is monkeypox and should you be worried?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Canadian bacteriologists have shown how in times of great historical environmental change – like now – pathogens jump more easily to new, susceptible hosts. All they need is the opportunity for contact, and warming does just that. Once they have expanded to new hosts, novel variants are more likely to emerge, each with new infection capacities.</p> <p>The situation looks bleak, but it is well within human ability to repair and turn this round. Science and new technologies are catching up with vaccines for rare and neglected diseases, and global surveillance and the early detection of potential virus spillovers in the wild can be greatly enhanced. But above all, global finance can be directed to improve creaking public health systems, especially in developing countries. They are the first line of defence and the surest precaution of disease containment.</p> <p>The big lesson of Covid – and now of monkeypox – is that much infectious disease has its roots in ecological change. That means the health of the planet and the health of humans and must be considered alongside that of animals. It also means we should prepare now for the unexpected, invest in public health as never before, stop cutting down the forests, address climate change and phase out intensive farming. A “one health”, planetary approach to health is the best – and possibly the only – hope we have.</p> <p>• John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/may/25/ill-be-back-terminator-grease-la-iconic-sixth-street-bridge-freeway-car-chases-shoot-outs","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T05:00:26Z","webTitle":"I’ll be back: from Terminator to Grease, LA’s most iconic bridge gets a thrilling sequel on seismic springs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/25/ill-be-back-terminator-grease-la-iconic-sixth-street-bridge-freeway-car-chases-shoot-outs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/may/25/ill-be-back-terminator-grease-la-iconic-sixth-street-bridge-freeway-car-chases-shoot-outs","fields":{"headline":"I’ll be back: from Terminator to Grease, LA’s most iconic bridge gets a thrilling sequel on seismic springs","trailText":"The Sixth Street Bridge was the gritty go-to location for dance-offs, shoot-outs and car chases until it was torn down.

Leaping across the Los Angeles river on its twin steel arcs<strong>,</strong> held aloft by its majestic art deco concrete pillars, the Sixth Street Bridge has provided a backdrop for shootouts and dance-offs ever since it was built in 1932,<a href=\"https://vashivisuals.com/the-6th-street-bridge-in-hollywood-films/\"> appearing in everything from Grease to Terminator 2</a>, and providing a dose of urban glamour in videos by everyone from Kanye West to Kid Rock.</p> <p>But Hollywood’s go-to crossing is no more. It was torn down in 2016 after being diagnosed with a terminal case of concrete cancer: the sand that was used in the mix turned out to have a lethally high alkali content, reacting with the cement to cause expansion and cracking. By the 2010s, officials calculated the bridge stood a 70% chance of collapsing in a major earthquake within the next 50 years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea of just crossing the river felt too small. As one engineer said: ‘Whatever happened to taking a Sunday drive?’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Every time it got wet,” says Michael Maltzan, “it basically turned to jelly. Which isn’t ideal for a bridge over a river.” The architect is standing atop the structure he has designed to take its place: <a href=\"https://www.sixthstreetviaduct.org/\">an almost mile-long, $588m new viaduct</a>, the largest infrastructure project the city has ever built. A decade in the making, the bridge is due to open this summer, reconnecting downtown LA with the eastern neighbourhood of Boyle Heights, its wider deck now incorporating cycle lanes and more generous sidewalks, with its concrete arches now safely supported on seismic absorbers – allowing it to move up to 30 inches in any direction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1f80469be4801b6788d4123b01b7ea25cb964f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1f80469be4801b6788d4123b01b7ea25cb964f4/445_0_1989_1194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Better shape up … the big auto showdown in Grease began beneath LA’s beloved landmark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Better shape up … the big auto showdown in Grease began beneath LA’s beloved landmark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: You Tube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“But the real challenge,” says Maltzan, “was how to come up with something as iconic as the original.” <a href=\"https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/sixth-street-viaduct\">For the Sixth Street Bridge is not just cherished by showbiz.</a> It was one of the last bridges built across the river by the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-oct-08-tm-33536-story.html\">Bureau of Engineering in the 1920s and 30s under Merrill Butler</a>, who saw the crossings as majestic civic monuments, a linear symphony in the sculptural possibilities of reinforced concrete. From Glendale in the north to Long Beach in the south, they were designed in styles ranging from neoclassical to Spanish colonial, streamline modern and gothic revival, each adorned with benches and balconies where people could rest and enjoy panoramic views. Sixth Street was the grandest of the lot, its lean double arches punctuated at either end with momentous pylons decorated with fluted zigzags.</p> <p>“I thought the two arches were important to recall,” says Maltzan, whose “ribbon of light” concept – designed with HNTB engineers and Hargreaves Jones landscape architects – won an international competition in 2012. “They were so much part of the civic memory of the city. But the idea of just crossing the river felt too small. Infrastructure has a responsibility to cross over social, economic and cultural divisions – and we wanted the bridge to reflect that.”</p> <p>Maltzan has taken the twin arcs and multiplied them fivefold across the 3,500ft length, hopping over railway tracks and roads as the viaduct makes its way eastwards. The result is almost surreal: seen from either end, it looks like the traces of two bouncing balls, ping-ponging their way across the valley, the arches rising to different heights according to what they are jumping over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cf688d13acfab518ad1e521fd9360d8e8c8cc89f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf688d13acfab518ad1e521fd9360d8e8c8cc89f/0_154_3168_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Come with me … the famous bridge featured in Terminator 2.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Come with me … the famous bridge featured in Terminator 2.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristar/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This being LA, there are several freeways to be crossed before the bridge gets anywhere near the river, which is itself more of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/oct/23/frank-gehry-revitalise-los-angeles-la-river)\">a trickle in a concrete gulley</a>. From the east, it straddles the I-5 before hitting the US-101, where the first pair of arches rise 40ft to form what feels like a gateway. Then come five pairs of 30ft arches, passing a low-rise warehouse district, then hitting the first set of railway tracks that flank the river. Here two pairs of arches rise to 60ft, forming a symbolic echo of the original structure.</p> <p>“We were inspired by the idea that movement in LA is so cinematic,” says Maltzan, who describes his 20 arches as “portals” that frame scenic views of the city, the intention being to make the act of crossing a pleasure in itself, not simply a way of getting you from A to B. “As one of the engineers said, ‘Whatever happened to taking a Sunday drive?’”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>‘Hope everyone pukes on their artisanal treats,’ said one gentrification protestor at the place where the bridge lands</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite the traffic-choked reality, LA’s freeways still hold a special place in the city’s psyche. In the more innocent 1970s, the British critic Reyner Banham rhapsodised that driving here was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/24/radical-alternative-reyner-banham-man-changed-perception-los-angeles\">“a special way of being alive,”</a> putting you in “a state of heightened awareness that some locals find mystical”. The freeway, he concluded, was where Angelenos “spend the two calmest and most rewarding hours of their daily lives”.</p> <p>Those two hours may have since doubled, or even tripled, but the car window remains the principal lens through which many experience the city. Drivers may be stuck in snarl-ups, but at least the views – of the towers of downtown to the west, of the San Bernardino mountains to the east – will be elegantly framed by Maltzan’s gymnastic arcs, which somehow have LA in their DNA, recalling the sinuous supports of <a href=\"https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Theme_Building,_LAX\">LAX airport’s space-age Theme Building</a>. Those on bikes, meanwhile, will have the pleasure of spiralling down a corkscrew ramp to a new 12-acre park, that will begin construction beneath the viaduct this summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c1e1616c97d79237957de4f92e835dcb4ed4325b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1e1616c97d79237957de4f92e835dcb4ed4325b/0_178_5341_3205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The grandest of the grand … the original Sixth Street Bridge crosses the LA River.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The grandest of the grand … the original Sixth Street Bridge crossing the LA River.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Citizen of the Planet/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some residents on the east side, however, have been asking who exactly this park is for, and what impact the bridge will have on the area. “It doesn’t seem like it’s being designed for our community,” says Kenia Alcocer of <a href=\"http://www.uniondevecinos.org/\">Union de Vecinos</a>, a neighbourhood group in Boyle Heights. “We welcome green spaces, but it looks like a plan for further gentrification, attracting other people to come here rather than focusing on the needs of locals.”</p> <p>The bridge is less than a mile long but the two places it connects are worlds apart. To the west lies <a href=\"https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/visit/a-visual-walking-tour-of-the-arts-district-in-downtown-la\">the arts district</a>, the once-scruffy edge of downtown that is now an exclusive enclave of galleries, restaurants and luxury apartments – all a stone’s throw from the homeless encampments of Skid Row. Moments from where the bridge lands is an outpost of haute couture chain Dover Street Market and a restaurant serving wagyu ribeye steak for $160. Trading on the area’s artsy cache (despite the fact that artists have mostly been priced out) the land below this side of the bridge will feature an <a href=\"https://www.sixthstreetviaduct.org/len_hill_arts_plaza\">“arts plaza”</a>, with a stage and terraced seating for performances.</p> <p>Boyle Heights, meanwhile, has long been a low-income Latino neighbourhood, a place of mom-and-pop stores, taco stands and the musicians who still congregate around Mariachi Plaza. In recent years, it has found itself on the frontline of the city’s gentrification battles, as hipster real estate expands ever eastwards – to be met with a frosty reception.</p> <p>“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/19/los-angeles-la-gentrification-resistance-boyle-heights\">Hope everyone pukes on your artisanal treats</a>,” was one response to a realtor who took clients on a bike tour of the neighbourhood in 2016. “Stay outta my fucking hood,” was another. Some galleries that moved into the Flats, the warehouse district beneath the bridge, have been hounded out. Their premises <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-gentrification-protests-future-of-boyle-heights-20180808-story.html\">have been spray-painted and some have received anonymous death threats</a>. But Alcocer fears their retreat was only temporary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"261aef6cabc822d8a14f2c48b124d8b3a3887d18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/261aef6cabc822d8a14f2c48b124d8b3a3887d18/0_600_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘A double-edged sword’ … the new bridge, known as the Ribbon of Light, at sunset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A double-edged sword’ … the new bridge, known as the Ribbon of Light, at sunset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa US/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The new bridge and park will see them come back stronger,” she says, “if we don’t organise and push back.” Grocery stores, laundromats and food wholesale warehouses have been replaced with breweries, coffee shops and cannabis stores, she adds, <a href=\"https://knock-la.com/california-emergency-rental-assistance-eviction-moratorium-ab-2179/\">while forced evictions have been rocketing</a>, with landlords keen to attract the new deeper-pocketed demographic. “We are wanted for our culture,” says Alcocer, “but we ourselves are not wanted. People moving here want the mariachi murals and the street stalls, but not the people. We’re just props to add real estate value.”</p> <p>The bridge promoters insist the park has been developed with the local community in mind. It will have picnic areas and grilling spaces alongside playgrounds, soccer fields and courts for basketball, volleyball and futsal, a Latin American version of five-a-side football.</p> <p>“The bridge is not the driver of gentrification,” says Maltzan, “but it’s a double-edged sword. It will inevitably bring more attention to this area, and when a neighbourhood becomes visible, developers always come in.” The city, he says, has a history of building infrastructure that was designed to connect communities but ended up doing the exact opposite, splitting neighbourhoods into silos.</p> <p>“LA has always portrayed itself as a multicultural city,” he adds, looking back at the expanse of his creation. “But it’s really a city of many separate cultures, which is a very different thing. I hope the bridge plays some part in weaving it together.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/24/raffensperger-defeats-hice-georgia-election","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T04:48:02Z","webTitle":"Brad Raffensperger defeats Trump bid to oust him as Georgia’s top election official","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/raffensperger-defeats-hice-georgia-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/24/raffensperger-defeats-hice-georgia-election","fields":{"headline":"Brad Raffensperger defeats Trump bid to oust him as Georgia’s top election official","trailText":"The secretary of state had been excoriated by many in the GOP for refusing to help overturn the 2020 election","body":"<p>Brad Raffensperger defeated congressman Jody Hice on Tuesday in a closely watched Republican primary for Georgia secretary of state, a significant victory for a politician who has been scorned by his own party for refusing Donald Trump’s request to overturn the 2020 election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/24/georgia-primary-elections-kemp-carr-trump\">Wins for Kemp and Carr in Georgia show Trump’s grip on GOP slipping</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a surprise, Raffensperger avoided a runoff and won an outright victory over Hice, receiving more than 50% of the vote, according to the election monitoring website Decision Desk HQ.

He made the main issue in his campaign preventing non-citizen voting, which is virtually non-existent in Georgia. He also staunchly defended a new state law that imposes new identification requirements on mail-in ballots and prevents handing out food or water within 150 feet of a polling place.</p> <p>“He did not break the law that one time.

Here’s where the night stands so far:</p> <ul> <li><strong>A shooting at an elementary school in </strong><strong>Uvalde, Texas, cast a devastating shadow over today’s primaries. </strong>At least 19 children and two adults were killed when a gunman opened fire in Robb elementary school. <strong>Joe Biden </strong>expressed outrage over the tragedy, calling on Congress to pass stricter gun laws. “Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen?” Biden said.</li> <li><strong>Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, defeated former Senator David Perdue, who had been endorsed by Donald Trump</strong>. Perdue’s loss marked a significant defeat for Trump’s reputation as a kingmaker in the Republican party, as the former president has used the power of his endorsement to wield influence over candidates and lawmakers. Perdue’s defeat raises questions about the impact of Trump’s endorsement, particularly for candidates challenging incumbents. In November, Kemp will face off against voting rights leader <strong>Stacey Abrams, </strong>who won the uncontested race for the Democratic nomination.<strong> </strong></li> <li><strong>Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state who attracted Trump’s ire for refusing to “find” enough votes to reverse Biden’s 2020 victory in the state, is projected to win the Republican primary for his position. </strong> Raffensperger is above 50% in his race against Trump-backed candidate <strong>Jody Hice, </strong>who has embraced the former president’s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election, and is expected to avoid a runoff and advance to the November general election.</li> <li><strong>Trump acolytes performed better in Arkansas and Texas. </strong>Trump’s former press secretary, <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong>,<strong> </strong>secured the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Arkansas, meaning she will likely follow in her father’s footsteps to become governor. Texas attorney general <strong>Ken Paxton, </strong>who filed a lawsuit challenging the results of the 2020 election, also easily defeated land commissioner <strong>George P Bush </strong>in his runoff race. Bush’s loss will have long-lasting repercussions for a political dynasty that has produced two presidents and helped shape Texas politics for several decades.</li> <li><strong>Congresswoman Lucy McBath defeated fellow House Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux to win the nomination in Georgia’s seventh congressional district. </strong>McBath currently represents the sixth congressional district, but she chose to run in the neighboring seventh district after Republican redistricting altered the state’s congressional map. McBath’s victory had particular resonance in the wake of the Uvalde shooting. McBath got into politics after her son, Jordan Davis, was shot and killed at the age of 17 in 2012. Since his death, she has staunchly advocated for stricter gun laws in honor of her son’s legacy.</li> <li><strong>A winner has still not been called in the runoff race between Democratic congressman Henry Cuellar and Jessica Cisneros in Texas’ 28th congressional district, </strong>which pitted a longtime centrist incumbent against a progressive challenger. Progressive groups had rallied around Cisneros, attacking Cuellar over his opposition to abortion rights as the country prepares for the likely reversal of Roe v Wade. But organizations backing Cuellar had spent heavily to help the vulnerable incumbent, and he currently leads Cisneros.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T04:33:35.850Z\">at 5.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-628dadec8f08b48a6e7438ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T04:21:55.512Z\">5.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Incumbent Brad Raffensperger is expected to win the Republican secretary of state primary, NBC and CNN project.</strong></p> <p>Raffensperger, who famously defied Donald Trump’s ask that he “find” Republican votes in the 2020 election, has nonetheless backed traditional Republican efforts to restrict voting. </p> <p>Trump-backed candidate <strong>J</strong><strong>ody Hice,</strong> who embraced the former president’s election fraud conspiracy theories, was trailing significantly.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T04:28:18.200Z\">at 5.28am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-628dab0f8f084f9a73ca5974\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-25T04:12:25.374Z\">5.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Incumbent Kay Ivey won the Republican nomination for Alabama governor, the AP projects. </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"263f20900fa3295de6c5371b311bae2373001efc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/263f20900fa3295de6c5371b311bae2373001efc/0_56_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ivey declared victory in her Republican primary race as she speaks at her election watch party in Montgomery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ivey declared victory in her Republican primary race as she speaks at her election watch party in Montgomery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mickey Welsh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ivey is poised to avoid a runoff, surpassing 50% of the vote despite attacks from within her party.

There has already been <a href=\"https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/05/23/record-early-voting-ends-setting-up-georgias-high-stakes-2022-election-day/\">record turnout</a> during early voting, and polls show <a href=\"https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/georgia-secretary-of-state-poll-bee-nguyen-brad-raffensperger-jody-hice/85-b46e0b61-4f60-4d66-96be-5de53a97b64e\">a close race</a> between Hice and Raffensperger.</p> <p><strong>Jay Williams</strong>, a Republican strategist in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia\">Georgia</a> not affiliated with either campaign, told me Raffensperger had made a strategic error in pushing back on Trump and predicted Hice would win.</p> <p>“He’s branded.

I was curious to see whether that belief was translating into who they were voting for. Would voters kick Raffensperger out of office for saying the election was legitimate?</p> <p>To my surprise, I didn’t find a huge amount of momentum for Hice, who has said the 2020 election was stolen and tried to overturn it. Instead, I found a lot of voters who said they supported Trump, but were also voting for Raffensperger.</p> <p>“I felt that under all that pressure, he did a good job. I know it upset Trump, and I’m a Trump person, but fair is fair,” said <strong>Carolee Curti</strong>, 82, who voted for Raffensperger in Rome, which is in the heart of <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong>’s deeply Republican district in north-west Georgia.</p> <p>“I think something happened, but I don’t know anything like everybody else.

But in Ukraine, the state-backed broadcast has remerged, albeit with a 21st-century spin.</p> <p>Shortly after Russia invaded, the country’s main TV channels started broadcasting the same content 24 hours a day, nicknamed the United News telemarathon. Each channel has a daily slot on the broadcast, which is shown simultaneously on all the channels. </p> <p>United News was initially aired by five channels owned by various Ukrainian oligarchs as well as the publicly owned channels. It has since been <a href=\"https://www.rnbo.gov.ua/ua/Ukazy/5295.html\">signed into law</a> and now includes all Ukrainian channels that used to show news.</p> <p>The head of Ukraine’s parliamentary broadcasting committee said he believed the arrangement should continue until the war ends.</p> <p>While some say there are critical strategic justifications for the telemarathon, others argue that it amounts to a monopoly of the information space by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s team and could be exploited for political purposes.</p> <p>“The telemarathon is the information war equivalent of our anti-aircraft systems and I think it’s the most optimal option for Ukraine right now,” said Svitlana Ostapa, the deputy head of Detector Media, a media monitoring organisation that tracks propaganda, disinformation and political interference in Ukraine. “It helps protect Ukrainians from Russian fakes and prevents panic among the population.</p> <p>In 2014, Russian propagandists and their allies released a barrage of disinformation about the Maidan revolution, Crimea and events in eastern Ukraine that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/17/crimea-crisis-russia-propaganda-media\">experts said</a> worked to destabilise the country.</p> <p>There are also more practical reasons for the channels working together. “Most of the journalists left Kyiv and the channels simply could not cope individually,” Ostapa said. “The top ministers and officials do not have the time to comment to more than half a dozen channels, and this format means they are communicating with the population once a day and not being seen to favour one channel.”</p> <p>The language used by Ukraine’s TV presenters has changed dramatically, reflecting usage among the wider population. Russian soldiers are often called “occupiers”, “terrorists”, “orcs” and “Rashists” – a combination of the words Russian and fascist.</p> <p>Guests are welcomed with the greeting “Glory to Ukraine!”, to which they answer “Glory to the heroes!”. The famous words of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/ukrainian-soldier-russian-warship-medal-snake-island\">a Ukrainian soldier</a> tasked with defending Snake Island in the Black Sea, who was recorded over the military radio saying “Russian ship go fuck yourself”, are mentioned without the swearword being censored, and the presenters regularly end their segments with “Death to the enemy!”, a historic Ukrainian wartime slogan.</p> <p>The 24-hour wartime news focuses on the Ukrainian military’s victories, its defence of Ukraine’s frontlines and Russia’s war crimes. The abrupt collapse of Ukraine’s economy in February means there is almost no advertising. Commercial breaks advertise hotlines for finding missing loved ones and reporting war crimes, as well as videos produced by normal Ukrainians, the Ukrainian army press service and the presidential office about the resistance of Ukrainian soldiers and citizens.</p> <p>Ostapa said the language and messaging were discussed in editorial meetings between all the channels involved, the culture ministry and the national broadcasting council, and there was now a move to ban slogans containing swearwords. The overarching editorial message of the telemarathon is Ukrainian resistance in the face of Russian brutality, <a href=\"https://detector.media/kritika/article/197522/2022-03-15-spilnyy-telemarafon-informatsiyna-ppo-v-tsyvilizatsiyniy-viyni/\">Ostapa wrote</a> in one her analysis pieces.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4BCAaa5Uko\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z4BCAaa5Uko?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Footage of Ukrainians protesting against Russian soldiers, voiced over with the words ‘Bravery has no boundaries, bravery is greater than arms’.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The TV channel heads have rejected accusations that the authorities dictate the content, saying dialogue with officials includes things such as censoring information that reveals Ukrainian military positions. And since May, Ukrainians looking for an alternative to news can tune in to other channels that show films and cartoons about good winning out against evil.</p> <p>But some see the unified TV coverage as propagandistic and point to the fact that airtime is now almost exclusively given to people close to the president, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVrJoWrkLMw\">including regular comedy</a> sketches by the president’s former comic colleagues.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu2F7OLShWE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mu2F7OLShWE?start=40&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=40\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>A video made by a Ukrainian citizen, Stepan Grebenko, that went viral and was shown during the breaks of the telemarathon.

The soldier responds with “In their death”, to which the presenter responds “Well, that’s positive”.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>“The telemarathon is an attempt by the presidential office to gain even greater control over the information space,” said Aksenyia Kurina, a journalist and campaigner who has spent her career focusing on censorship in Ukraine. “We may soon find ourselves in a heavily censored information space.”</p> <p>Zelenskiy won the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election with more than 70% of the vote, thanks in large part, said Kurina, to his innovative digital campaign. Zelenskiy’s party also controls Ukraine’s parliament.</p> <p>Though Ukraine’s media have celebrated a marked change in their president since the invasion, Zelenskiy was on terse terms with some journalists before the war. He was known to publicly display disdain towards journalists who asked critical questions, and his press service ostracised some reporters for critical coverage.</p> <p>“The telemarathon does not reflect reality, it forms a picture that the authorities would like to see. This is dangerous, because at some point the authorities may begin to believe in their own propaganda,” said Kurina. “I understand that many journalists are not able to cope with their emotions at the moment, for many this is a personal traumatic experience, but it is important to remember professional ethics and not to allow hate speech.”</p> <p>Notably, three channels owned by Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko and that are close to his associates have not been given slots and therefore do not contribute to the telemarathon’s content or editorial meetings. Poroshenko was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/petro-poroshenko-former-ukraine-president-kyiv-treason-case\">charged with treason</a> after Zelenskiy came to power, a case that the former president says is politically motivated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first, Poroshenko’s channels split their coverage 50-50 between the telemarathon and their own content.

He packed a small rucksack of possessions and a stack of cash, and flew out of the country on 2 March, pretending he was going on holiday.</p> <p>A few days later, he crossed from Poland into Ukraine, where he spent his childhood years. Now, he spends his days trying to convince officials to provide him with Ukrainian documents and allow him to sign up for military service.</p> <p>“I want to go to the place where I can defend my homeland with a weapon, I’m trying every day,” he said, in an interview in the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv. “I am never going back to Russia.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/russia-emigres-putin-war-ukraine-armenia\">Hundreds of thousands of Russians are believed to have fled the country</a> since Putin launched the war, and many intellectuals, journalists and activists have voiced their opposition to the conflict. However, among the political and business elites, defections have been extremely rare. Despite reports of widespread dismay over the invasion of Ukraine, only a tiny handful of people have spoken publicly to condemn the war.</p> <p>On Monday, Boris Bondarev, a career diplomat posted to the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/warmongering-lies-and-hatred-russian-diplomat-in-geneva-resigns-over-ukraine-invasion\">highest-level Russian diplomat to denounce the war</a>. When he resigned, Bondarev published a scathing letter in which he wrote that he was “ashamed” of his country and called the invasion a “disaster”.</p> <p>Bondarev said he made his mind up to resign on the day Russia launched its invasion, but it took months to gather the resolve to go public.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"795287f47ffa9eb734270a01a67d888fd2049112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/795287f47ffa9eb734270a01a67d888fd2049112/0_0_1476_1848/799.jpg\" alt=\"An image taken from the passport photo page of Russian diplomat Boris Bondarev, who handed in his resignation in May.\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image taken from the passport photo page of Russian diplomat Boris Bondarev, who handed in his resignation in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many fellow diplomats, Bondarev had remained in his post over the past decade, despite Russia’s growing isolation due to a series of crises, including its annexation of Crimea and the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014.</p> <p>“You understand that it is wrong,” he said in a telephone interview. “That it’s not good. But it doesn’t really touch you, your life. These bad things they happen somewhere far away. It’s not right but that’s how most people think.”</p> <p>“But now this is totally different: Russia attacked another country. This is Ukraine who we always considered to be our brothers and attacked them in the most brutal manner. Bombing cities. Claiming them to be Nazis and denazified. It’s something ridiculous. It’s something unimaginable.”</p> <p>Bondarev said he believed many of his fellow diplomats were also opposed to the war, but he never discussed it with them. “It isn’t something you really talked about with other people, it isn’t something you can speak about openly these days,” Bondarev said. “Everyone is silent.”</p> <p>Volobuyev said that after 2014, he had started to speak openly about his concerns over Russian politics in the workplace, and while many people were scared of getting involved in a discussion, he felt that most people he knew agreed at least partially.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9917d6f7aeccab184d952db4084b7fe42b75bd3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9917d6f7aeccab184d952db4084b7fe42b75bd3b/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Igor Volobuyev in Kyiv\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Igor Volobuyev: ‘A lot of people in Russia are just scared.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gleb Garanich/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“In Gazprom there were a few passionate Putinists, but the majority of people understood exactly what kind of country they lived in. A lot of people in Russia are just scared,” he said.</p> <p>“You have this internal censorship, that it’s dangerous to say certain things, and you live with this permanently. Ukrainians look at this and they don’t understand it because they are a free people,” he said.</p> <p>Volobuyev grew up in the Ukrainian city of Okhtyrka , and left for Moscow in 1989, when he was 18. After spending some time in journalism, he joined Gazprom, where he worked for 15 years before moving to become one of Gazprombank’s vice-presidents in 2015.</p> <p>As he tells it, he was originally a supporter of Putin, and voted for him in 2012, but his “eyes were opened” by the Maidan revolution in 2014 and subsequent Russia-backed war in Donbas. He wanted to return to Ukraine then, but said he could not, for family reasons, about which he declined to elaborate.</p> <p>“It was a choice between my homeland and my family, and at that time I chose my family. On 24 February this year, I understood I could not put it off any longer,” he said.</p> <p>Volobuyev was a mid-ranking cog in the Gazprom machine; among the higher business echelons few people have dared to break ranks.</p> <p>Oleg Tinkov, a self-made billionaire who set up one of Russia’s leading banks, has so far been the most outspoken public opponent of the war among the business elite. In one of a series of critical Instagram posts, Tinkov wrote: “I don’t see ANY beneficiary of this crazy war! Innocent people and soldiers are dying.”</p> <p>After his statements, Tinkov said he was forced to sell his assets at a knockdown price to an oligarch loyal to the Kremlin. In an interview with the Russian journalist Yury Dud, he said he was sure that the entire business elite backed his statements but were too scared to say the same publicly.</p> <p>“I have spoken to 12 of the top 20 on the Forbes list personally, and they all support me, there is a full consensus,” he said.</p> <p>He said half of those he had spoken to justified their silence by claiming to fear for their tens of thousands of employees, who could be affected if they fell out of favour with the Kremlin.</p> <p>“The other half say, ‘We’ll make a statement and then lose our business, like you, and then what, what have you achieved?’”</p> <p>Putin has referred to those who oppose Moscow’s actions as “scum and traitors”, whom the Russian people will “spit out like a fly”. In the current climate it is clear that public opposition to the war makes it dangerous to return to Russia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Bondarev said he was worried about the response to his statement and said he would “welcome” an offer of asylum in the west. Tinkov has said he has hired bodyguards.</p> <p>As a Russian citizen of Ukrainian origin, Volobuyev’s position is a little different. His arrival in Ukraine has given him a feeling that he has finally returned home, he said. But he accepts that he has a lot of work to do to persuade Ukrainians of his sincerity.</p> <p>“All these years, I said I was Ukrainian but I continued to live and work there. I understand that I have to repent, and to prove for many years that I should be allowed to live here and that I can be trusted,” he said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2022/may/25/dyson-reveals-its-big-bet-robots","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T04:00:25Z","webTitle":"Dyson reveals its big bet … robots","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/25/dyson-reveals-its-big-bet-robots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/may/25/dyson-reveals-its-big-bet-robots","fields":{"headline":"Dyson reveals its big bet … robots","trailText":"UK manufacturer aims to roll out machines capable of performing household chores such as washing up by 2030","body":"<p>Dyson has signalled it is placing a “big bet” on producing robots capable of household chores by 2030, as it looks to move beyond the vacuum cleaners, fans and dryers that made its founder one of the wealthiest British businessmen.</p> \n<p>The company, founded by billionaire Sir James Dyson, on Wednesday published photographs of robot arms being used in household settings, including cleaning furniture, a claw picking up plates, and a hand-like machine picking up a teddy bear.</p> \n<p>While those may not sound like major achievements, robots still struggle with many actions that represent simple tasks for humans, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/26/world-first-fruit-picking-robot-set-to-work-artificial-intelligence-farming\">grasping fragile objects</a> or dealing with unfamiliar obstacles.

In March last year, around the time he was moving from home affairs to defence, the Liberal party strongman Peter Dutton issued a warning to the citizens.</p> <p>He was going to sue people who posted rude things about him on Twitter. “Don’t Mess with Pete” was the message. He’s going to hunt you down and bring you to justice.</p> <p>His target was Shane Bazzi, an impecunious social justice campaigner, who on 25 February 2021 told his Twitter followers, “Peter Dutton is a rape apologist”.</p> <p>This six-word comment was linked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/20/peter-dutton-says-women-using-and-abortion-claims-as-ploy-to-get-to-australia\">a Guardian article from June 2019</a> where Dutton told Sky News that women detained on Nauru had been “trying it on” by claiming they were raped.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/shane-bazzi-wins-appeal-in-defamation-case-over-peter-dutton-tweet\">Shane Bazzi wins appeal in defamation case over Peter Dutton tweet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his especially nurturing way, Dutton claimed this was a ploy by these women to get to Australia for medical treatment. No doubt it was a shot across the bows of the medievac legislation, which the government was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/04/medevac-repeal-bill-passes-after-jacqui-lambie-makes-secret-deal-with-coalition\">desperately seeking to repeal</a>.</p> <p>On the first round, the federal court judge Richard White gave Dutton a small measure of success, awarding him $35,000 in damages because relatively few people had seen the tweet. After delving through dictionary definitions, the judge decided the tweet meant that Dutton “excused” rape and this was defamatory.</p> <p>Nothing seemed to turn on the fact that in 2016, Justice Mordecai Bromberg found that Dutton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/10/peter-dutton-will-not-appeal-ruling-pregnant-asylum-seeker\">exposed a female asylum seeker to serious medical and legal risks</a> and breached his duty of care after the woman was raped on Nauru.</p> <p>Justice White found that Bazzi’s tweet caused offence and distress to the minister, but fortunately there was no ongoing harm. Needless to say, the defences of honest opinion and fair comment did not fly.</p> <p>The sting for Dutton came later, in December 2021, when the trial judge decided that the minister should not recover his full costs because this was a case more appropriately decided in a magistrates court, and should not have been chewing up time and resources in the federal court.</p> <p>By now, Dutton was most likely underwater with the costs of the matter and his wider campaign to still critical voices.</p> <p>Bazzi appealed Justice White’s judgment on one point only – that the tweet did not mean Dutton “excused” rape. He argued that the trial judge had not properly taken into account the link to the attached Guardian article which showed, at worst, Dutton was “skeptical” about allegations of rape from asylum seekers on Nauru.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"app\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&link=true&link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>So it comes as reassurance to tweeters that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/shane-bazzi-wins-appeal-in-defamation-case-over-peter-dutton-tweet\">the full federal court found</a> the words of a tweet do not stand alone if there is context provided by a link to more information. The six words, “Dutton is a rape apologist” were “anchored” to the Guardian article about the claim that allegedly raped women on Nauru were “trying it on”.</p> <p>There was then a hunt to find what the tweet with the link could possibly mean.</p> <p>Justice White initially thought that an “apologist” was someone who “defends” something or someone. He then moved to saying that an “apologist” is a person who “excuses” something or someone.</p> <p>Appeal judge Michael Wigney said it is a “mystery” how the trial judge got from “defends” to “excuses”.</p> <p>Certainly, there was criticism of Justice White’s overreliance on dictionary definitions – something frowned on in the special parsing landscape of defamation courts.</p> <p>The appeal judges also pointed to a couple of English cases where it was specifically determined that in the social media world things are different.

That’s all I’m saying.”</p> <p>“Netflix has a policy that content ‘designed to incite hate or violence’ is not allowed on their platform, but we all know that anti-LGBTQ content does exactly that,” Glaad’s statement said. “While Netflix is home to some groundbreaking LGBTQ shows, it refuses to enforce its own policy in comedy. </p> <p>“The LGBTQ community and our allies have made it very clear that so-called comedians who spew hate in place of humor, and the media companies who give them a platform, will be held accountable.

These kids weren’t unlucky. This only happens in this country and nowhere else,” he continued. “It is a choice. It is our choice to let it continue.”</p> \n<p>Speaking to reporters afterward, Murphy did not mince words about the anticipated Republican reaction to the shooting – that the United States needs to do more to address mental illness and that guns are not inherently the problem.</p> \n<p>“Spare me the bullshit about mental illness,” Murphy said. “We don’t have any more mental illness than any other country in the world. You cannot explain this through a prism of mental illness because we’re not an outlier on mental illness … We’re an outlier when it comes to access to firearms and the ability of criminals and very sick people to get their arms on firearms. That’s what makes America different.”</p> \n<p>In his emotive speech on the Senate floor, the senator then clasped his hands together and pleaded with Republicans to help Democrats pass meaningful gun reform legislation.</p> \n<p>“I am here on this floor to beg, to literally get down on my hands and knees to beg my colleagues: find a path forward here,” he said.</p> \n<p>Few senators understand the horror mass shootings inflict on a community quite like Murphy, who spent the hours after the massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school consoling families who had lost children and loved ones.</p> \n<p>He spoke about the lasting trauma inflicted on students, schools and communities. Since that massacre 10 years ago when 20 children and six adults were killed, Murphy has made it his mission to enact gun control reform only to be disappointed again and again as the bills fail to overcome the Senate filibuster.</p> \n<p>Murphy asked Republicans: “Why do you go through all the hassle of getting this job, or putting yourself in a position of authority if your answer is that, as this slaughter increases, as our kids run for their lives, we do nothing.”</p> \n<p>He asked again: “What are we doing?”</p> \n<p>“Sandy Hook will never ever be the same. This community in Texas will never ever be the same. Why? Why are we here if not to try to make sure that fewer schools and fewer community go through what Sandy Hook has gone through, what Uvalde is going through.”</p> \n<p>The tragedy in Texas appeared to be similar to the 2012 mass shooting in Connecticut, where 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot his way into the locked building and then killed 20 first graders and six educators with an AR-15-type rifle.</p> \n<p>Murphy expressed hope that compromise on gun control measures is possible and urged fellow lawmakers to take a stand. Democrats lack a large enough majority in the Senate to pass gun control reforms without Republican support.</p> \n<p>“I understand my Republican colleagues will not agree to everything that I may support, but there is a common denominator that we can find,” he said, acknowledging the problem of gun violence cannot be solved overnight.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-91-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-25T00:04:54Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 91 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-91-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-91-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 91 of the invasion","trailText":"Invasion in ‘most active phase’, says Ukraine; Russian forces take control of three Donetsk regions; 200 bodies found in Mariupol basement","body":"<ul> <li><p><strong>Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/24/russia-ukraine-war-updates-moscow-to-deepen-ties-with-china-lavrov-says-west-pledges-to-send-more-advanced-weapons-to-ukraine-live?page=with:block-628cfd918f084f9a73ca5505#block-628cfd918f084f9a73ca5505\">has entered its most active phase,</a> according to Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk. </strong>Battles being fought in eastern Ukraine could determine the country’s fate, he added. “The situation on the (eastern) front is extremely difficult because the fate of this country is perhaps being decided (there) right now.”</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Russian forces have taken control of three Donetsk region towns including Svitlodarsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. </strong>Earlier today, it was reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/24/russia-ukraine-war-updates-moscow-to-deepen-ties-with-china-lavrov-says-west-pledges-to-send-more-advanced-weapons-to-ukraine-live?page=with:block-628d16998f08b48a6e74355d#block-628d16998f08b48a6e74355d\">Russian forces had entered Svitlodarsk and hung up a Russian flag </a>over the city administration building.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>The governor of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region said the situation there “is only getting worse” as Russian troops advance.</strong>“The situation is very difficult and unfortunately it is only getting worse.

The British ambassador to China, Caroline Wilson, tweeted on Monday that she had “stressed the importance of unfettered access to Xinjiang and private conversations with its people,” in her call with the UN rights chief.</p> <p>The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said on Tuesday that the leaked files contained “shocking details of China’s human rights violations” against the Uyghur Muslim population.</p> <p>“We reiterate our longstanding expectation that China grants the UN high commissioner for human rights full and unfettered access to the region so that she can conduct a thorough assessment of the facts on the ground, and we are following her visit this week closely,” Truss said in a statement. “If such access is not forthcoming, the visit will only serve to highlight China’s attempts to hide the truth of its actions in Xinjiang.”</p> <p>German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, who held an online meeting on Tuesday with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, called for a transparent investigation after “shocking reports and new evidence of very serious human rights violations in Xinjiang”. </p> <p>“Human rights are a fundamental part of the international order and Germany is committed to protecting them worldwide,” Baerbock said. “I think it’s important that these accusations, which have been known for a long time, are addressed by the Chinese side, and I made that very, very clear in this morning’s discussion.”</p> <p>Germany’s economy minister Robert Habeck called the latest reports of internment, mistreatment and forced labor of Uyghurs “particularly shocking”. Habeck said Germany for years had shied away from looking too closely at the problematic human rights record of its close trading partner, but that the country’s new center-left government was taking a different approach.</p> <p>Germany would scrutinize environmental, social and human rights aspects when considering German companies’ requests for loan guarantees for their investments in China, he said. “We will also examine very closely Chinese firms’ takeover bids in Germany,” he added, saying one recent offer was prohibited while another was withdrawn by the company after questions were raised.</p> <p>The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, echoed the concerns. She tweeted: “Horrified by the Xinjiang Police Files, which spotlight China’s mass incarceration of Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minorities.” Thomas-Greenfield also said that Bachelet and her office “must take a hard look at these faces and press Chinese officials for full, unfettered access and answers.”</p> <p>Bachelet is expected to visit the Xinjiang cities of Ürümqi and Kashgar on Tuesday and Wednesday as part of a six-day tour. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, meanwhile told Bachelet on Monday that he hoped her trip would “clarify misinformation” on China’s human rights record.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/may/25/gene-editing-could-increase-food-security-uk-adviser-says","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T23:01:19Z","webTitle":"Gene editing could increase food security, UK adviser says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/25/gene-editing-could-increase-food-security-uk-adviser-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/may/25/gene-editing-could-increase-food-security-uk-adviser-says","fields":{"headline":"Gene editing could increase food security, UK adviser says","trailText":"Legislation introduced in House of Lords aims to help speed up development of gene-edited products","body":"<p>Gene editing could drastically increase global food security and reduce reliance on chemical fertilisers and pesticides in the coming decade, a scientific adviser to the UK government’s environment department has said.</p> <p>Speaking before the introduction of a bill on genetic technologies to the House of Lords on Wednesday, Prof Gideon Henderson said the legislation aimed to create a simpler regulatory framework that would speed up the development and commercialisation of gene-edited products by allowing them to be treated differently to genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which are subject to strict regulation.</p> <p>“We anticipate [the bill] will enable precision-bred crops to navigate the regulatory system much more quickly, in something like one year compared with approximately 10 years under the present regime,” Henderson said.</p> <p>This could have numerous benefits, from building crops that are more resistant to the climate crisis, pests and diseases, to increasing crop yields, which could help to combat global hunger, Henderson said. It could also be used to create more nutritious crops, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/23/scientists-create-tomatoes-genetically-edited-boost-vitamin-d-levels\">vitamin D-enriched tomatoes</a>.</p> <p>The bill will also allow for similar changes for livestock to follow, once a regulatory system has been developed to safeguard animal welfare, for example preventing the creation of fast-growing animals that are unable to stand.</p> <p>Crucially, it makes a distinction between genetic modification, which involves introducing genes from other species, and so-called “precision breeding” to create desirable traits. The latter uses gene editing to make changes that mimic the process of selective breeding, only more precisely and far more rapidly than traditional breeding would allow.</p> <p>However, environmental groups dismissed any distinction between the two as PR spin. Kierra Box, of Friends of the Earth, said: “Gene editing is genetic modification by a different name. It still focuses on altering the genetic code of plants and animals to deal with the problems caused by poor soils, the over-use of pesticides and intensive farming.”</p> <p>Food labelling is another issue. Assuming it is passed, the bill will apply only in England, which could create conflicts with the Scottish and Welsh governments, which are maintaining, post-Brexit, a ban on GMO crop production and produce sales.</p> <p>Liz O’Neill, the director of the campaign group GM Freeze, raised concern that the bill would lead to the removal of labels that allow consumers to choose what they are buying and eating. Henderson said there was no intention to introduce a labelling system for gene-edited products.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"&lt;iframe id=&quot;morning-briefing&quot; name=&quot;morning-briefing&quot; src=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; seamless=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe&quot; height=&quot;52px&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; data-component=&quot;email-embed--morning-briefing&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Soil Association said it was disappointed to see the government prioritising technological solutions to the food crisis over strategies targeting unhealthy diets, a lack of crop diversity, farm animal overcrowding and the steep decline in beneficial insects. </p> <p>Some scientists agreed that gene editing provided only a partial solution to the problems facing society. “Gene editing has the medium-term potential to address food production and environmental challenges,” said David Rose, a professor of sustainable agricultural systems at Cranfield University.</p> <p>“However, there are legitimately held concerns about the potential for gene editing to consolidate power inequalities in the food supply chain, ethical concerns particularly about usage in animals, and the potential to facilitate greater intensification of farming which could harm the environment.”</p> <p>Other scientists would have liked to see the bill go even further. Prof Jonathan Jones, a plant scientist at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, said: “The proposed changes in regulation of gene-edited crops are a very positive step in the right direction and will align the UK better with regulations outside the EU.”</p> <p>The proposed legislation is likely to open up further rifts for the UK government with the Scottish and Welsh governments, who are opposed to the production and sale of genetically modified crops and products – despite heavy pressure from the National Farmers’ Union to accept them.</p> <p>George Eustice, the UK environment secretary, has written to the first ministers of Wales and Scotland, Mark Drakeford and Nicola Sturgeon, inviting them to adopt the bill’s measures.</p> <p>Eustice told BBC Scotland on Wednesday that if they did not do so, they could still refuse to allow GMO crops to be planted. However, under the current proposals, they would not be allowed to stop GMO products being sold in Scotland or Wales under the terms of the Internal Markets Act.</p> <p>The Scottish government warned it would vigorously resist any attempts by ministers in London to enforce their sale outside England. It said it had not been consulted by the UK government on the bill’s measures, so it needed time to study them before formally responding to Eustice’s invitation.</p> <p>“The Scottish government remains wholly opposed to the imposition of the act and will not accept any constraint on the exercise of devolved powers,” it said on Tuesday night.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/may/25/six-in-10-people-in-uk-believe-government-ignores-rules-partygate","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T23:01:19Z","webTitle":"Six in 10 people in UK believe government ‘ignores rules’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/25/six-in-10-people-in-uk-believe-government-ignores-rules-partygate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/may/25/six-in-10-people-in-uk-believe-government-ignores-rules-partygate","fields":{"headline":"Six in 10 people in UK believe government ‘ignores rules’","trailText":"People in the UK and Poland rated their governments worst on matters of trust and legitimacy in an EU-funded study","body":"<p>People in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews\">UK</a> are more likely than those in other European countries to say that their government ignores rules, according to a large six-state survey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/24/partygate-boris-johnson-meeting-sue-gray-lockdown-parties-downing-street\">with ‘Partygate’ probably to blame</a>.</p> <p>The EU-funded study found that 62% of people in the UK think their government ignores rules and procedures, compared with an average of 44% and well above the next highest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland\">Poland</a> (50%), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/24/revolt-against-liberalism-eastern-europe-poland-hungary-nativist-politics\">where the administration has been accused of authoritarianism</a>.</p> <p>The results, <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/news-comment\">published on Wednesday</a>, came as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/partygate-photos-boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-lockdown-breaches-sue-gray\">Boris Johnson was facing fresh claims of lying to MPs</a> over his knowledge of – and attendance at – parties during Covid lockdowns after photos emerged of him raising a glass at a Downing Street leaving drinks event.</p> <p>The other countries in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/kings-college-london\">King’s College London</a> (KCL) study, which surveyed 12,000 people in January, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/norway\">Norway</a> but the UK and Poland tended to rate worst on matters of trust and legitimacy.

Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was flying through the air as he always did, crushing forehands, flitting to the net. More than once he brought out his iconic single-handed backhand, just for fun. He banged his chest and rallied the crowd. He did not even need to: they have been eating out of the palm of his hand for 13 years.</p> \n<p>Inevitably, it did not last. After winning a set against one of the best clay court players in the world and then roaring back at the death, reality slowly caught up with Tsonga. He had been gradually ground down by Casper Ruud, the eighth seed, and eventually his body gave out. As Tsonga tearfully lost 6-7 (6), 7-6 (4), 6-2, 7-6 (0), one of the standout, most enjoyable tennis careers of the past 15 years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/may/24/french-open-tennis-2022-roland-garros-updates\" title=\"\">came to an end</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/24/pliskova-and-halep-battle-into-second-round-french-open\">Pliskova and Halep battle through into second round of French Open</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tsonga’s retirement announcement shortly before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/23/rafael-nadal-sinks-jordan-thompson-to-launch-bid-for-14th-french-open-title\" title=\"\">the French Open</a> was not a surprise.

He arrived in Paris ranked 297th with a 4-17 record since the beginning of 2021. Yet on a court that has inspired him throughout his career, for a short period he shone. </p> \n<p>The 37-year-old was bold and dynamic in the opening set, edging it on a tie‑break. After Ruud inserted himself into the match and slowly began to move away, Tsonga found a second wind deep in the fourth set, producing a faultless return game at 5-5 to break.</p> \n<p>Just as it seemed that Tsonga was heading for a dramatic fifth set, however, he began to struggle with a shoulder injury as he served out the set. He could not properly serve or strike forehands, and as everything fell apart he struck his own head and began to cry. No longer able to compete, Tsonga lost 11 of the final 12 points of his career. Tsonga embraced Ruud at the net, then he discarded his racket, returned to the centre of the court and kissed the thick clay one last time.</p> \n<p>A large group of some of the most important people on Tsonga’s journey were then brought on to the court, from his parents and wife, Noura, to his charismatic group of contemporaries: Gaël Monfils, Gilles Simon, Richard Gasquet.</p> \n<p>Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray provided video messages for him, then Tsonga closed off the emotional ceremony with a long, heartfelt speech.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41c34b6b1bc6805ab96fee5a475bc3ce453ce094\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41c34b6b1bc6805ab96fee5a475bc3ce453ce094/0_0_6618_3971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsonga plants a symbolic kiss on the clay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsonga plants a symbolic kiss on the clay.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shi Tang/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I wanted to show resilience from a young age,” he said. “I’m going to stay the person I am, and stay active, and do that as well as I can.

He had the brutal misfortune of peaking at the same time as Federer, Djokovic, Nadal and Murray.</p> \n<p>Alongside his countryman and close friend Monfils, for a long time he was one of the few male black players in contention at the very top of his sport. Along with his charisma, it made him an idol for so many, such as Félix Auger-Aliassime, who was present at the stadium as Tsonga battled.</p> \n<p>Tsonga’s career is not quite over.

The programme about the impact of Gentleman Jack – which is written by Sally Wainwright and stars Suranne Jones as the early 19th-century landowner, industrialist and lesbian Anne Lister, a real-life figure who left a series of diaries about all three things when she died in 1840 – could have been gruesomely self-congratulatory. But instead, it presents real women’s stories simply and unsensationally, letting the whole work serve as a tribute to Lister’s strength and to the programme by being a striking contribution – as direct as Jack herself – to lesbian visibility.</p> <p>In addition to the video interviewees, Gentleman Jack Changed My Life follows the stories of four women negotiating different challenges in their attempts to come out, to gain acceptance, to find the path to a certain kind of peace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"853f86980ae68a449ee863f9bf9aab5ea11f7b8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/853f86980ae68a449ee863f9bf9aab5ea11f7b8d/1269_55_3314_3092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suranne Jones as Anne Lister in Gentleman Jack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"933\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suranne Jones as Anne Lister in Gentleman Jack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aimee Spinks/BBC/Lookout Point/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These include 22-year-old Chichi, an illustration of how coming out is not a one-time thing but an ongoing process. She told her parents she was gay after they watched Gentleman Jack together. The conversation with her sisters didn’t happen until a year later, and she now faces telling her beloved grandparents, who are less likely to be tolerant. Internalised homophobia and fear linger, too. “I still,” she says, “have to push the word ‘gay’ out.”</p> <p>Sami, 35, an ebullient, charming barrister, is the carer for her mother, Hazel. She came out to her 10 years ago, but the reception – which they recall very differently – was such that she effectively went back in the closet. Now, with the support of Gentleman Jack, its fan community and all that it signifies for greater tolerance, Sami is broaching the subject again and hoping for another chance to live her life honestly. </p> <p>Yvonne and Pauline (not the latter’s real name) have also waited long enough. Yvonne, 63, is a divorced mother of two grownup children whose youth came flooding back to her as she was watching the series; it helped her finally make sense of it. She wasn’t straight. Her children have offered nothing but love and support, but Yvonne knows that in future she will have to make a choice between her Mormon faith and a relationship. “I will get: ‘I love you but I don’t love your lifestyle.’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8bc2cf5d4b459a563ac4b50eca3d4941f0ec03c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8bc2cf5d4b459a563ac4b50eca3d4941f0ec03c/0_286_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trixie (left) and Pauline outside Anne Lister’s home, Shibden Hall, Yorkshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trixie (left) and Pauline outside Anne Lister’s home, Shibden Hall, Halifax.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screenhouse/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pauline was a young woman when she fell in love with Trixie nearly 40 years ago. But Trixie decided she wanted to pursue marriage and a family, and they broke up. A few years ago, inspired by Lister’s courage, Pauline sent her former girlfriend a note hoping she was well. They are now back together. “When I got engaged to people, there was never any depth of love there … deep down, there was only one person who ever took my heart. This lady, really.”</p> <p>It is a bittersweet hour. The palpable anxiety, sorrow, fear, all those wasted years, the lives lived under the cosh of other people’s expectations, could hardly make it otherwise. But it is also a testament to the fact that things can change for the better: as Trixie returns, as Yvonne’s children tease her (“63! Everything to play for!”), as Hazel continues the struggle towards acceptance (“Would you come to my wedding?” asks Sami. “Course I would.” “Would you be proud?” “Have to cross that bridge when I come to it”). At a time when many lesbians still struggle for the freedom to love who and how they want, it feels like a quiet act of resistance to have such a celebratory show.</p> <p>And of course the women from whom they have taken strength – Lister, of course, but Wainwright and Jones too, and their rendering of her, front and centre, on screen. Who knew art still had such power? “It’s the first time I feel like I’ve written something important,” says Wainwright. Those who worship her show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/happy-valley\">Happy Valley</a> for its brutal, brilliant depiction of middle-aged women’s lives – 10 parts responsibility to one part quick cup of coffee in the garden – might beg to differ, but only in the matter of timing.

I’m shaking. I’m just shaking all over. With fear. With anger. With resolve,” he wrote.</p> <p>In a searing speech from the floor of the Senate just hours after the Texas shooting happened, Murphy vented 10 years of pent-up outrage at the lack of action on the part of his congressional colleagues despite the litany of violent gun deaths. “What are we doing?” he asked.</p> <p>Days after Buffalo, the country faces yet another Sandy Hook, he said, and turned the spotlight directly on his peers in the US senate, whom he accused of inaction in the face of the carnage. “There are more mass shootings than days in the year. Our kids are living in fear. This happens nowhere else but here in the United States of America and it is a choice, it is our choice to let it continue.”</p> <p>A similar sense of frustration and outrage was conveyed on CNN by Charles Ramsey, former police commissioner in Philadelphia. “This is something we should not even be talking about, this is absolutely crazy,” he said.</p> <p>“And what is crazy about it is that nothing will be done about it.

We have to save our kids, because this is what’s happening every single day in our cities.”</p> <p>The demands for action were echoed at the highest levels when Joe Biden, who ordered the White House flag to be flown at half mast, addressed the nation in a somber speech after returning for from a five-day trip to Asia that was bookended by tragedy.</p> <p>“I had hoped when I became president I would not have to do this, again. Another massacre,” he began, before taking a harsh tone in calling for “common sense” gun legislation.</p> <p>“When in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?” he said. “Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen?”</p> <p>“It is time to turn this pain to the action,” he added.</p> <p>Urgent calls to break the political impasse continued to pour in throughout the day.</p> <p>In a series of tweets on Tuesday evening, former president Barack Obama said that “it’s long past time for action” on gun violence in the US. “We’re also angry for them.

Mathematical modelling by Breban and his team in 2020 found that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, immunity to monkeypox fell from 85% in the early 1980s to 60% in 2012. With declining immunity, monkeypox posed “an ever-increasing threat for health security”, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7463189/#:~:text=Monkeypox%20could%20therefore%20emerge%20as%20the%20most%20important%20orthopoxvirus%20infection%20in%20humans.&amp;text=We%20use%20mathematical%20modelling%20to,of%20monkeypox%20will%20continue%20increasing.\">he wrote</a> at the time. In 2020 the DRC had more than 4,000 suspected cases and at least 171 deaths.</p> <p>“Our immunity level is almost zero,” Breban said. “People aged 50 and above are likely to be immune but the rest of us not, so we are very, very susceptible.” He believes the outbreak can be contained and said it was an opportunity to propose vaccination campaigns in countries where the virus is endemic.</p> <p>Until this year only a handful of cases of monkeypox had ever been spotted in the UK, all linked to travel from Nigeria. Since the first UK case of 2022 was announced on 7 May, nearly 300 suspected or confirmed cases have come to light in at least 16 countries.</p> <p>The surge in cases has raised questions about whether the monkeypox virus has evolved into a more transmissible form. So far scientists have found no evidence for this being the case, but researchers are studying the DNA to see if mutations in the virus may have changed its behaviour. Genetic studies so far suggest the virus matches strains that reached the UK, Singapore and Israel in 2018 and 2019.</p> <p>Prof David Heymann, a distinguished fellow at Chatham House’s global health programme, said the outbreak appeared more of a chance event, with the virus being amplified once it got into a community of men who have sex with men.</p> <p>Graham Medley, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said there was unlikely to be the same “explosive growth” of infections into the general population that was witnessed with Covid. But he said the outbreak could continue for several months as contact tracing slows but does not stop transmission.</p> <p>“As with Covid, we can expect twists and turns as monkeypox outbreaks continue,” he said. “At the moment the transmission chains are mostly within sexually active younger men, but there are other settings where there is sufficient contact for monkeypox to spread. The longer the outbreak continues and the higher the prevalence, the more likely that monkeypox will find these other niches.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Researchers in the UK have revealed promising yet tentative signs that an antiviral may help to reduce illness from the virus.

However, the one patient treated with tecovirimat had a shorter hospital stay and appeared to shed virus, detected by PCR tests, for a shorter period of time.</p> <p>Dr Hugh Adler, a co-author of the study at Liverpool university hospitals NHS trust, said that although only one patient was involved, the result for tecovirimat was “a promising signal”.</p> <p>“Now that we’re seeing more cases, unexpectedly, we think it’s important to share,” he said. “This is the sum total of human experience with these drugs and monkeypox so far.”</p> <p>The UK has secured a supply of tecovirimat and is offering a smallpox vaccine to close contacts of people diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness.

But outstanding performances turn it into something far more endearing","body":"<p>I did not love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/08/state-of-the-union-review-an-honest-and-perfectly-curated-portrayal-of-marriage\">the first season of State of the Union</a> (BBC Two), which appeared back in 2019, though I did end up with a grudging respect and admiration for it. It followed Chris O’Dowd and Rosamund Pike as a married couple meeting in the pub before their weekly counselling sessions. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/16/state-of-the-union-marriage-in-ten-parts-nick-hornby-review\">written by Nick Hornby</a> and directed by Stephen Frears (as is the new series), and each episode, roughly 10 minutes long, featured theatrical verbal sparring about love, marriage and record collecting. It relied heavily on the strength of its two leads, and it was arch, literary and occasionally insufferable. By the end, I was invested in the relationship and was willing them to figure it out. Its brevity gave it a loose, stagey charm.</p> <p>The second season moves the action to the US, to a coffee shop, where Brendan Gleeson and Patricia Clarkson await their therapists and try to make sense of a changing world. The most interesting choice is their age. Both are in their 60s, and have been married for more than 30 years. As in the first season, there have been affairs, but not recently enough for the wounds to feel raw. Instead, Ellen (Clarkson) is thinking they should probably get divorced, while Scott (Gleeson) is coasting, oblivious.</p> <p>At its best, there is little in the way of explicit drama. It is more a question of identity, and how that shifts over time. Scott describes himself as “a hard-working family guy”. Ellen points out that he has retired, and their grownup children have left home. He doesn’t know who he is at all.</p> <p>Gleeson and Clarkson are outstanding actors. It’s not quite a two-hander, as there are occasional interruptions from others, notably the Black, transgender, asexual barista Jay (Esco Jouléy) – more on them in a second – but it is all about Scott and Ellen, and the conversations between them that sustain each episode.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"985bd158f4e0df2ab99b50899e493f0124cf55da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/985bd158f4e0df2ab99b50899e493f0124cf55da/0_219_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jay (Esco Jouléy) looking sceptical in State of the Union.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just a writerly device … Jay (Esco Jouléy) in State of the Union.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Radford/BBC/Sundance TV &amp; AMC Film Holdings</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first half of the series is a lot to get through, which is an achievement for episodes so brief. Their early conversations are contrived and barely convincing. Scott’s beliefs lean towards “social conservatism”, while Ellen is a Quaker who does yoga and protests at new chemical plants. He doesn’t know anything about her life (“I know you did something … stretchy”), while the uncomplicated man she married no longer excites or stimulates her. They clash over politics, and they constantly bicker about Jay, who exists as a writerly device to incite change in Scott, the curmudgeonly “old fart”. Each time Jay patiently explains a facet of their identity to the couple, I wonder why they were bothering to indulge either of them.</p> <p>Scott needles Jay and Ellen over pronouns, and has lines like, “You gotta understand, all this is new to me.” He informs Jay that he would rather bump himself off than drink non-dairy milk; he loves films about Churchill; and he treats pretentious coffee menus as a personal affront. “You must never make jokes <em>about</em> or <em>to</em> wokeflakes,” he gripes to Ellen, whose character only really exists in opposition to his. She sponsors a Somali immigrant, drinks herbal tea and prefers to live simply and give her money away. Scott has, she says, “the views of a dinosaur about gays and women”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At first it feels as if Gleeson and Clarkson have been asked to improvise a Twitter row </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They are types, rather than people, and it isn’t until it breaks away from feeling as if Gleeson and Clarkson have been asked to improvise a Twitter row that it finds its feet. The psychotherapist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/apr/06/esther-perel-interview-pandemic-relationships-work-life-balance\">Esther Perel</a>, whose podcast Where Should We Begin? took listeners inside real relationship counselling sessions, has referred to love as “an active verb”. “We think it’s disappeared, and suddenly it shows up again. It’s not a permanent state of enthusiasm,” <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/love-is-not-a-permanent-state-of-enthusiasm-an-interview-with-esther-perel\">she told the New Yorker in 2018</a>. The back-and-forth of Scott and Ellen’s discussions encapsulate the idea that a relationship, and the people in it, change, as does what works for each of them. Towards the end of the 10-episode run, the programme starts to explore this idea in greater depth, and when it does it is thoughtful, contemplative and insightful.</p> <p>It is unusual, in a dramatic sense, in that it feels slovenly and sticky when it is all about conflict, but vastly improves when the tension between Ellen and Scott dissipates. Once they begin to have more even-handed chats – about the nature of intimacy and sex; about what they expect from life, now that they have reached this point; and about what it means not only to be happy, but to pursue happiness – then it becomes endearing, and plays to everyone’s strengths. As a zippy drama about a marriage in crisis, it is so much better without the crisis.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/24/tory-mp-berates-home-office-over-plan-to-house-asylum-seekers-in-yorkshire","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T21:41:08Z","webTitle":"Tory MP berates Home Office over plan to house asylum seekers in Yorkshire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/24/tory-mp-berates-home-office-over-plan-to-house-asylum-seekers-in-yorkshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/24/tory-mp-berates-home-office-over-plan-to-house-asylum-seekers-in-yorkshire","fields":{"headline":"Tory MP berates Home Office over plan to house asylum seekers in Yorkshire","trailText":"Kevin Hollinrake insists opposition to scheme to accommodate 1,500 people at former RAF base is not about nimbyism or racism","body":"<p>A Conservative MP has accused the Home Office of using his North Yorkshire constituency as a “sacrificial lamb for national policy”, as a controversial accommodation centre for 1,500 asylum seekers is set to open there.</p> <p>The Home Office says the site – the RAF Linton-on-Ouse airbase, which ceased military operations in 2020 – will accommodate its first 60 asylum seekers by 31 May.</p> <p>Kevin Hollinrake, whose Thirsk and Malton constituency includes the base, is angry about the plans and accused the Home Office of “pretty much an abuse of power”.

Johnson himself stated <a href=\"https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2021-04-15/181471\" title=\"\">in a parliamentary answer </a>to the Newcastle Central MP, Chi Onwurah, in April 2021: “The government was not involved at any point in the takeover talks on the sale of Newcastle.”</p> \n<p>Responding to the Guardian’s questions about Grimstone’s discussions, Downing Street again referred to that answer, and said the Newcastle deal was “a commercial matter for the Premier League and it was entirely for them to assess under its owners’ and directors’ test”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7d570e6747764a3f0e928ded6081e90c085d7c9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7d570e6747764a3f0e928ded6081e90c085d7c9/0_352_2817_3042/926.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Gerry Grimstone (top) arrives at Abu Dhabi airport with Boris Johnson in March during their visit to the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\" width=\"926\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Gerry Grimstone (top) arrives at Abu Dhabi airport with Boris Johnson in March during their visit to the UAE and Saudi Arabia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Newcastle takeover by a Saudi Arabian fund was deeply controversial and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/27/newcastle-takeover-sportswashing-saudi-consortium-amnesty\" title=\"\">vehemently opposed as “sportswashing”</a> by Amnesty and other human rights groups concerned about repression under Prince Mohammed’s regime, notoriously including the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Most Premier League clubs are also said to have opposed it, principally to prevent another club being mega-funded by Gulf state wealth like Manchester City, who have been financed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/manchester-city-win-premier-league-title-aston-villa-match-report\" title=\"\">to become serial champions</a> since their takeover by Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family.</p> \n<p>Although Johnson and his ministers have said they remained neutral, the government regards Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and other Gulf states as firm allies and crucial <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uae-to-invest-10-billion-in-priority-uk-industries\" title=\"\">sources of potential inward investment</a>, increasingly important after Brexit. Johnson has also burnished a strong personal relationship with Prince Mohammed, described as a “bromance” in <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/bromance-uk-boris-johnson-saudi-arabia-prince-mohammed-bin-salman/\" title=\"\">a recent article by Politico</a>.</p> \n<p>Grimstone is understood to have made contact with Hoffman after the proposed takeover stalled in June 2020. This followed the Premier League’s decision, based on legal advice, that the PIF’s 80% ownership of Newcastle would mean that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) would control the club. That meant the Saudi state itself would have to undertake the league’s “fit and proper persons” owners’ and directors’ test. This raised the prospect that the KSA would fail, and the takeover be blocked, principally because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/26/newcastle-takeover-in-serious-doubt-as-wto-rules-pirate-tv-channel-is-saudi\" title=\"\">the state had been found to be responsible</a> for pirating BeIN’s sports rights. The KSA refused to accept that, and in July 2020 the consortium announced the takeover was off.</p> \n<p>Responding to questions about Grimstone’s involvement, a spokesperson at the Department for International Trade (DIT) confirmed that the minister did speak to Hoffman, “as part of the countless conversations he has in his ministerial role”, but said he had “never tried to influence Mr Hoffman and the Premier League to approve the Newcastle takeover”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/13/newcastle-kit-sharing-saudi-arabia-colours-sportswashing-amnesty\">Newcastle kit sharing Saudi colours would be sportswashing, Amnesty says</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Guardian then asked Grimstone and the DIT why it was part of his ministerial role to discuss the takeover, whether Grimstone was also discussing it with senior Saudi officials up to Prince Mohammed’s office, and seeking to help broker solutions to the piracy and other perceived problems. The spokesperson did not answer those questions directly, but said: “Part of the minister’s role in his capacity as investment minister is to, amongst other things, keep abreast of large investments potentially coming into the UK, hence his high-level engagement with relevant stakeholders.”</p> \n<p>Asked to explain what the “high-level engagement” was, and who the “relevant stakeholders” were, Grimstone and the DIT did not respond.</p> \n<p>Lister acknowledged that he also made contact with Hoffman, in September 2020, saying he believed the Premier League had left the Saudi-backed consortium in doubt: “This has always been a commercial matter for the Premier League, not the government,” he said. “My only view was that the Premier League should take a clear decision on the merits or demerits of the proposal.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d33e7b22c68ddf28887e7ec2efd57e3c3137058\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d33e7b22c68ddf28887e7ec2efd57e3c3137058/0_0_3500_2558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yasir al-Rumayyan, the Saudi chairman of Newcastle (centre), with the directors Amanda Staveley and Mehrdad Ghodoussi at St James’ Park last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"731\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yasir al-Rumayyan, the Saudi chairman of Newcastle (centre), with the directors Amanda Staveley and Mehrdad Ghodoussi at St James’ Park last month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked to clarify why he believed there was uncertainty, given that the Premier League had communicated its decision in June 2020, Lister declined to expand.</p> \n<p>Last year <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9476763/Brilliant-Boris-said-told-Newcastle-deal-track.html\" title=\"\">the Mail reported</a>, based on leaked messages, that Lister had relayed to Johnson in September 2020 that the deal was “hopefully” going to be approved. The prime minister, who had reportedly received complaints from Prince Mohammed about the Premier League’s stance, responded: “Brilliant.”</p> \n<p>However the Premier League did not approve the takeover then, and only did a year later after the PIF provided “legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United”. Although some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/08/angry-premier-league-clubs-demand-emergency-meeting-on-newcastle-deal\" title=\"\">Premier League clubs were incensed</a> this was accepted, sources close to the process have explained that the assurances did make a crucial difference to the legal advice, so that KSA was no longer considered a controlling party.</p> \n<p>While Hoffman then told the clubs that the government had put pressure on the league to approve the deal, Richard Masters, the league’s chief executive, told them it had not, and said in a BBC interview: “There were conversations with government but there was no pressure applied.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Premier League declined to comment on Grimstone’s involvement, saying board and club meeting discussions are confidential, but did not dispute any of the details.

That’s the way I look at it. If we do manage to win it twice it’s because of the team, it’s because of the manager, it’s because of the staff and everybody involved. When the time comes for me to look back on it, that’s what I’ll think about. I never really see it as ‘me’.</p> <p>“Yes, I wear the armband on a match day and I’ve been here a long time but there are so many other leaders within the dressing room, so many big players, and it is a collective effort. It’s not about me trying to match other amazing captains that Liverpool have had, or trying to beat records. I am fortunate enough to be in a world-class team and very proud to be able to wear the armband and lead the team out. We will give it everything and hopefully bring another Champions League back to Anfield.”</p> <p>Henderson is a humble, selfless leader, but speaks with firm conviction on the second Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid in four years, relocated to the city where Alan Kennedy’s goal decided the clubs’ first final confrontation 41 years ago.</p> <p>“I would say they are facing a different Liverpool, for sure,” the midfielder states. “We did very well to get there when we played Madrid in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/26/real-madrid-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the final in 2018</a>. The lads were incredible. But we’ve grown since then. New players have come in, we’ve been successful, we’ve had bad moments as well within that period, and all of that you learn from.

It has been insatiable throughout this season’s pursuit of four trophies. Liverpool thrilled on the run to the 2018 final but were not established winners. The Henderson shuffle before a trophy lift had not been witnessed. It will be performed for the seventh time in three years should Liverpool land their seventh European Cup in Paris.</p> <p>“The Champions League was always a dream of mine to win, the Premier League was always a dream of mine to win, and when you do that you need to re-evaluate,” Henderson says. “You need to process that and think: ‘What now?’ It’s about the next challenge and finding a way to want it even more. And I think when you do become successful and win trophies it makes you want to get back there even more and do it all over again. You learn that it’s about the journey and all the memorable games it takes to get there. This season has been incredible for that. To be in this position with a chance of a treble on the last game of the season is an achievement in itself. You have to give credit to the lads for that.</p> <p>“The hunger has always been there, and when you do win the hunger grows, and you start thinking of other challenges, such as becoming a team that wins the Champions League twice. There are not many players who have done that, so to win it twice would be incredible. It’s the same with the Premier League – the first Liverpool team to win it in 30 years. You are creating history all the time and that’s what it’s all about. The more trophies you win the more history you create.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e580e161ad17ec0c8f65c7293053b9a4440a02fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e580e161ad17ec0c8f65c7293053b9a4440a02fc/0_164_3500_2169/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joy for Jordan Henderson as he lifts the Champions League trophy in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"620\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joy for Jordan Henderson as he lifts the Champions League trophy in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Henderson will have family and friends in Paris, including his father, Brian, whose embrace with his son after the 2019 Champions League final was one of the most emotional moments in Madrid. “It would be nice to have a repeat of that,” says the England international, who has been rested for June’s four Nations League fixtures.

It has been really emotional to meet some of the staff and to hear what they have been going through. It has been a very humbling experience. I have huge admiration for what they do, and what they have done over the last few years, and if I can help in a small way then I will. Hopefully as many people as possible up and down the country can do the same by signing up for the Big Tea.”</p> <p>Henderson remains in regular contact with NHS Charities Together’s chief executive, Ellie Orton, over how proceeds from #PlayersTogether are allocated. “Ellie knows better than me where it needs to go. But she does update me and when I go to hospitals she’ll tell me what’s been done to help, whether it’s quiet rooms, spaces, bringing staff in to help with the mental health aspect, packages for families of staff during Covid, communities; lots of different areas. I’ve been pleased to see it’s had a huge impact over the pandemic.</p> <p>“That is down to the players who got involved, not only on the money side – and I know the money has helped and will help – but the emotional element of the support we gave staff in that period was important too. A lot of people love football in this country and I’m sure a lot of the staff look up to different players at different teams, so for them to come together and support the NHS staff in a time of need made the biggest impact. We didn’t want PlayersTogether to be public. We knew it would probably end up getting out but we wanted to do it privately and we wanted to do it because we wanted to help.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Klopp has tried to help his players through the intensity of a 63-game season with no margin for error by repeating the mantra: enjoy the journey.

The Massachusetts court ruled that anti-Slapp laws do not apply to government cases.</p> <p>Healey, who is running for governor, hailed the ruling as “a resounding victory in our work to stop Exxon from lying to investors and consumers in our state”.</p> <p>In March, a federal court also refused to put a block on the state’s legal action and ruled that Exxon was obliged to turn over documents to investigators.</p> <p>The oil industry suffered another defeat on Monday when a federal appeals court ruled that a lawsuit by Rhode Island against 21 fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, BP and Shell, can go ahead in state court. Fossil fuel companies are attempting to move cases into what they regard as the more friendly forum of federal courts.</p> <p>Among other things, state systems often permit a much broader discovery process, which could force Exxon and other companies to hand over highly embarrassing documents revealing what they knew about the climate crisis and when, and how they responded.</p> <p>At least 10 other federal courts across the country have rejected the industry’s attempts to get similar cases out of the state systems.</p> <p>Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, welcomes the latest ruling to keep the process in state courts.</p> <p>“The ruling is a major victory for Rhode Island, which is now one step closer to putting oil and gas corporations on trial for fuelling the climate crisis, lying about it, and then sticking the state’s taxpayers with the bill for the damages,” he said. “Four circuit courts in a row have now handed major defeats to big oil companies in these cases, rejecting the industry’s efforts to escape accountability.”</p> <p>So far this year, federal appeals courts made similar rulings in Colorado, Maryland and California.</p> <p>In March, a Hawaii state court gave the go-ahead for a case to remain within its jurisdiction. Honolulu’s lawsuit alleges that the oil giants “engaged in a coordinated, multi-front effort” to deny the threat posed by global heating, to discredit the science of climate change, and to deceive the public “about the reality and consequences of the impacts of their fossil fuel pollution”.</p> <p>The chair of Honolulu city council, Tommy Waters, called it a “big and important win”.</p> <p>“We are facing incredible costs to move critical infrastructure away from our coasts and out of flood zones, and the oil companies that deceived the public for decades should be the ones helping pick up the tab for those costs, not our taxpayers,” he said. “The reason these companies are fighting so hard to block this case is they don’t want even more evidence to come out. This is just like big tobacco, when they tried to take advantage of the public.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
