The only difference was that the entire nose was missing and had since apparently been repaired, he said.</p> <p>The photographs were among archival material seized by police and held by authorities in Greece and Italy.</p> <p>In 2005 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/13/antiques-art-business-robin-symes\">Symes served a jail sentence</a> for disregarding court orders over the sale of a £3m Egyptian statue, with the judge dismissing his explanation as “a calculated deception”.<strong> </strong>In 2016 Italian and Swiss police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/stolen-artefacts-stashed-british-art-dealer-returned-italy\">recovered marble statues and other treasures stolen from Italy</a>, which they said had been stored by Symes at the Geneva freeport in Switzerland. Symes has never faced any action from the authorities in relation to the haul and has remained out of the public eye. </p> <p>Asked about the sale and Tsirogiannis’s allegations, Hindman Auctions said: “As is standard procedure for each of our sales, we cleared this lot with both the Art Loss Register and Interpol prior to bringing it to auction … Should credible information emerge, then we would, of course, re-evaluate the piece and work to restore it to its rightful owners.”</p> <p>It added that the presence of photos of the work in the home of Symes and Michaelides “is not in itself proof that it was either owned or traded by” Symes<em>. </em></p> <p>Tsirogiannis is an associate professor at the Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies and head of the working group Illicit Antiquities Trafficking of the Unesco chair on threats to cultural heritage and cultural heritage-related activities, Ionian University, Greece.</p> <p>Through his research, he received official access to tens of thousands of images and other archival material seized in police raids from individuals involved in the illicit trade. Over 15 years he has identified almost 1,600 looted antiquities within auction houses, museums, galleries and private collections, and notified authorities. He has played a major role in securing the repatriation of many antiquities to their countries of origin.</p> <p>The recoveries include an ancient Greek bronze horse that Sotheby’s New York had planned to sell in 2018, until he notified the authorities of its links to Symes. Greece claimed the horse as its national property, and in 2020 <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-antquities-horse-idUKKBN23J2ML\">Sotheby’s lost its legal challenge</a>. Greece’s culture minister welcomed the court’s ruling as a victory for countries seeking to reclaim their antiquities.</p> <p>Tsirogiannis has repeatedly argued that auction houses do not make adequate checks with Greek and Italian authorities, and criticised their failures to disclose an object’s full collecting history.</p> <p>He is all the more critical of the Hindman sale because he published details of this object and its “true collector history” <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/22980354/Something_Is_Confidential_in_the_State_of_Christie_s\">in the Journal of Art Crime</a> in 2013. He argued that if the US house had simply searched online about the sculpture, it would have found his paper “freely available”.</p> <p>In the text, he wrote that the head of Antisthenes first surfaced at Sotheby’s New York in 1981, with its nose worn away. He said it was offered “without any information regarding its consigner or collecting history” and sold for $4,840. In 2013, after he approached Sotheby’s for details, he received an email stating: “Sotheby’s does not disclose the names of consigners or buyers.”</p> <p>He said the sculpture had reappeared at Christie’s New York in 2012, as part of an anonymous private collection. “In the auction catalogue, the nose appears fully restored, but Christie’s failed to mention this restoration in [its] description. They also failed to mention its auction in Sotheby’s 1981 … The head was estimated at $100,000-$150,000, but apparently remained unsold.” It is believed to have been sold by Christie’s as an after-sale.</p> <p>Tsirogiannis said that while the Hindman provenance or ownership history includes the Sotheby’s and Christie’s auctions, it “excludes Symes-Michaelides – something that Christie’s also failed to do back in 2012”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said there was no record of this antiquity before the Sotheby’s 1981 sale, and that it could have come “from any country that was part of the Roman empire, given the quality and knowing how much Italy has been looted”.</p> <p>He has notified the US authorities about this case.</p> <p>Sotheby’s has been approached for comment.

There certainly is greater recognition now that China is stepping up its engagement in the Pacific and that China has security interests and sees itself as a security stakeholder in the Pacific.”</p> <p>Jonathan Pryke, director of the Lowy Institute’s Pacific Islands program, said it was an “extraordinary and unprecedented marathon of the region … that will leave a lot of people in the west nervous”.</p> <p>“It’s not just what the trip signals for China’s post-Covid re-engagement with the region, but what kind of deals he will be signing with counterparts along the way.”</p> <p>Vanuatu has just signed a contract with China for the construction of a new runway extension at Pekoa airport on the island of Santo, to allow access for larger aircraft, making it accessible for the delivery of humanitarian aid.</p> <p>China’s interest in Kiribati, meanwhile, has been of great concern to Australia, New Zealand and the US, due to its fishing resources and geostrategic location in the central Pacific.</p> <p>Kiribati and Solomon Islands both had diplomatic relations with Taiwan until 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/20/taiwan-loses-second-ally-in-a-week-as-kiribati-switches-to-china\">when they switched to recognise China</a>.</p> <p>“China is certainly very keen on shoring up its interests in Kiribati. It’s of significant strategic value, in terms of resources and geo-strategic location,” said Powles. “My assessment is that Kiribati is in China’s sights, but whether that will result in a security deal is unclear yet.”</p> <p>Teburoro Tito, Kiribati’s ambassador to the US and the UN, told the Guardian that China had agreed in principle to finance the refurbishment of a second world war runway on Kanton island, but denied a broader security deal was in the works.</p> <p>Tito said the Kiribati government had approached Washington about rehabilitating the port and runway but “the US turned us down”.</p> <p>“They said it would take time, maybe five, six years, to provide financing,” he said. “So the president asked the Chinese ambassador and he said yes in principle, though nothing has been signed,” Tito said.</p> <p>Tito said that while the funding agreement had been made “in principle” it would not happen unless the Kiribati president officially requested funding from China, and no formal request had yet been made.</p> <p>The project would achieve the twin goals of developing tourism in the Phoenix, site of some of the most pristine reefs in the world, and providing a refuelling station between Kiritimati and Tarawa.</p> <p>Kiribati has a long-standing defence treaty with the United States, the 1979 Treaty of Tarawa. “There has been a lot of talk about strengthening and renewing the treaty, but none about abrogating it,” Tito said. The treaty gives the US veto power over military installations in Kiribati built by third nations.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/may/24/how-did-he-get-away-with-this-what-the-papers-say-about-new-johnson-partygate-photos","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T03:12:29Z","webTitle":"‘How did he get away with this?’ What the papers say about new Johnson Partygate photos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/24/how-did-he-get-away-with-this-what-the-papers-say-about-new-johnson-partygate-photos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/may/24/how-did-he-get-away-with-this-what-the-papers-say-about-new-johnson-partygate-photos","fields":{"headline":"‘How did he get away with this?’ What the papers say about new Johnson Partygate photos","trailText":"Boris Johnson shown raising a glass at event during a national Covid lockdown, in newly released photos","body":"<p>Images have emerged of Boris Johnson raising a glass at a No 10 party during a national Covid lockdown, sparking fresh acrimony across the UK front pages on Tuesday.</p> <p>The prime minister is facing fresh claims of lying to MPs after four pictures, first published by ITV News, showed him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/partygate-photos-boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-lockdown-breaches-sue-gray-report\">toasting a senior aide at a Downing Street leaving drinks event</a>.</p> <p>“Fresh danger for Johnson over No 10 drinks pictures”, the <strong>Guardian</strong> front page reads, alongside a photo of the prime minister raising his glass.

What is the group, where did it come from and why do diplomats keep coming up with strange names for various partnerships?</p> <h2>What is the Quad?</h2> <p>Formally the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the Quad began as a loose partnership after the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami, when the four countries joined together to provide humanitarian and disaster assistance. It was formalised in 2007 by then Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe but fell dormant for nearly a decade, particularly amid Australian concerns that it would irritate China.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/may/24/australia-election-2022-news-live-update-anthony-albanese-to-meet-joe-biden-in-tokyo-penny-wong-teal-independents-peter-dutton-barnaby-joyce-quad-meeting\">Australia news live update: climate change the ‘main economic and security challenge’ for Pacific, Albanese tells Quad summit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group was resurrected in 2017, reflecting changing attitudes towards China’s growing regional influence.

The Quad leaders held their first formal summit in 2021 and met again virtually in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0346d6e1e37892dea0b3738ae1cd8273357382c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0346d6e1e37892dea0b3738ae1cd8273357382c7/65_600_5152_3093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Albanese, Joe Biden, Fumio Kishida and Narendra Modi at the Japanese prime minister’s office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Albanese, Joe Biden, Fumio Kishida and Narendra Modi at the Japanese prime minister’s office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zhang Xiaoyu/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Is it an ‘Asian Nato’?</h2> <p>China has complained that the group represents an attempt to form an “Asian Nato”, though unlike that alliance there is no mutual-defence pact in effect. Quad members say the group is meant to deepen economic, diplomatic and military ties among the four countries. And while they don’t often explicitly say it, those partnerships are meant to be a bulwark against Chinese aggression. In a March 2021 declaration laying out the “spirit of the Quad”, the leaders said: “We bring diverse perspectives and are united in a shared vision for the free and open Indo-Pacific. We strive for a region that is free, open, inclusive, healthy, anchored by democratic values, and unconstrained by coercion.”</p> <h2>Who are the new faces?</h2> <p>Tuesday’s meeting marks the first in-person gathering of the group for the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, who took office in October 2021, as well as for Australia’s new prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who was sworn in on Monday, two days after Australia’s parliamentary election and one day before the summit.</p> <h2>What about India?</h2> <p>The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, is attending as he faces increasing global scrutiny over his government’s crackdown on minorities, and some authoritarian tendencies. The other members of the Quad have been united in standing up against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, especially with sanctions, but India increased its purchases of Russian energy supplies after the war began. Moreover, the invasion has led to food shortages that are causing price spikes, yet India banned wheat exports following a heatwave that could make this global challenge much tougher to resolve.</p> <h2>Who else is involved?</h2> <p>South Korea has expressed interest in joining the Quad, though US officials have said they are not contemplating adjusting the membership. The group has held “Quad-plus” meetings that have included South Korea, New Zealand and Vietnam, which could form the basis for future expansion or partnership.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2022/may/24/suicide-attempts-among-australias-live-performers-rose-over-last-two-years-survey-reveals","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T02:25:54Z","webTitle":"Suicide attempts among Australia’s live performers rose over last two years, survey reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/24/suicide-attempts-among-australias-live-performers-rose-over-last-two-years-survey-reveals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/may/24/suicide-attempts-among-australias-live-performers-rose-over-last-two-years-survey-reveals","fields":{"headline":"Suicide attempts among Australia’s live performers rose over last two years, survey reveals","trailText":"Depression and anxiety double that found in general population, mental health researchers find","body":"<p>Levels of extreme psychological distress and suicidal ideation among Australians working in live performance and music are significantly higher than the national average, a new survey of more than 1,300 respondents has found.</p> <p>The survey, conducted in March and April by the Centre for Social Impact at Swinburne University of Technology, is a stark wake-up call, according to national charity <a href=\"https://supportact.org.au/\">Support Act,</a> which commissioned the research.

No matter how well he played on Monday, his French Open would end on Stade Philippe Chatrier against Nadal, the greatest clay court player ever.</p> <p>So it proved with a 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 loss in just over two hours. That was enough time to show Nadal, who turns 36 on semi-finals day in Paris, is not hindered at this stage by the chronic foot problem that had flared again recently in Rome. It was also ample to demonstrate again just how difficult it is for rivals against the Spaniard on his favourite court in a tournament he has lost at just three times.</p> <p>As Thompson noted, facing Nadal on Court Philippe Chatrier is the toughest test in tennis. The Australian Davis Cup stalwart started well, hitting a superb forehand winner on the run after being dragged from one side of the court to the other in what was his high point for the match.</p> <p>“I thought I was in trouble going out there and then, after that first point, I don’t know how I won it, but I was thinking ‘Shit. That’s what I’ve got to do to win a point?’,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96c9e6870afe48470fb134501de9d6f6ebe75418\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96c9e6870afe48470fb134501de9d6f6ebe75418/0_0_4876_3251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafael Nadal was imperious in his opening match at the 2022 French Open.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafael Nadal was imperious in his opening match at the 2022 French Open.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>About an hour later he provided the perfect illustration of what it feels like to play Nadal when posing inadvertently for a photograph that spread quickly on social media. After an epic point, the Sydneysider stumbled in disbelief to the net, leaning on it in despair and resting his head on his forearms pondering how another point had just gone begging.</p> <p>Holding game point on his serve when trailing 6-2 and 2-0, he had played a ripper of a rally. On the third shot, he clubbed a backhand down the line to set the Spaniard scrambling. With the court open, Thompson thundered an off-forehand which would have been too good for most players, but Nadal demonstrated incredible court coverage to reach it.</p> <p>Thompson then whipped a forehand back to the other side of the court and followed the ball in the net, a logical play given Nadal had no right to be anywhere near retrieving it. Somehow Nadal deftly sliced a backhand low to Thompson and followed up with an angle so acute Thompson’s lunge almost catapulted him into the net post he sought solace from.</p> <p>This was akin to playing against a brick wall. Or at the very least, the human version of playing the old arcade game pong, with the computer set to impenetrable mode.</p> <p>“I remember looking up at my camp and saying I’ve hit one of the biggest forehands I’ve hit [’yet] it came back. I hit a drive volley. It came back even harder and I wasn’t even close to the ball,” Thompson said. “I just looked up and thought, ‘I did everything I could and still I wasn’t even close to winning that point’. Sometimes you think, ‘What can I do?’ And I’m not the only one.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/23/jason-kubler-australias-third-tennis-special-k-breaks-through-at-french-open\">Jason Kubler: Australia’s third Special K breaks through at French Open | Courtney Walsh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Simply trying to win a point against Nadal is draining when he is in the mood he was in on Monday. The dimensions of centre court at Roland Garros add a dimension to the difficulty. Every tennis court is 23.77m long and 10.97m wide. But some appear far bigger than others.</p> <p>Nadal’s kingdom in Paris is one given the greater distance between the lines and sponsorship hoardings, which allows him to stand further back than he would on more regular tour courts. This gives more time to neutralise a rival’s serve, as Thompson ruefully noted, and makes him even more formidable an opponent.</p> <p>“For sure. I hit a couple of kick serves [and] on the back courts they would be in the side fence, but here it’s not even close to the side fence,” he said. “He’s got plenty of room and that makes it even tougher to get a free point … because he’s so far back and the court’s big.”</p> <p>With the match one hour and 13 minutes old, the Australian finally snapped after dropping serve again when missing a backhand volley. He paused and took two steps before clubbing a ball all the way out of the stadium, which is no mean feat given the grandstand dimensions of one of the world’s great courts. It did not ease the stress.</p> <p>“It’s just relentless pressure,” Thompson said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/22/new-zealand-woman-held-in-villawood-detention-centre-found-dead-detainees-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T01:05:29Z","webTitle":"New Zealand woman held in Villawood detention centre found dead, detainees say ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/new-zealand-woman-held-in-villawood-detention-centre-found-dead-detainees-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/new-zealand-woman-held-in-villawood-detention-centre-found-dead-detainees-say","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand woman held in Villawood detention centre found dead, detainees say ","trailText":"Activists say woman’s death is an example of people with serious mental health problems being detained without adequate care","body":"<p>Advocates and detainees say a woman’s body was found at Villawood detention centre on Sunday morning.</p> <p>The New Zealand woman was found dead about 10.45am, shortly after a room search had been conducted by Serco officers.

It was initially bound for Egypt with its cargo, but it was turned away from Alexandria after a warning from Ukrainian officials, according to the country’s government.

Kremlin aide <strong>Vladimir Medinsky</strong> claimed in an interview with Belarusian TV that “Russia has never refused talks”. “Freezing talks was entirely Ukraine’s initiative,” he said, adding that the “ball is completely in their court”.</li> \n   <li><strong>Polish president Andrzej Duda became the first foreign leader to address the Ukrainian parliament in person</strong> since the invasion began, backing Ukraine’s stance on territorial concessions and warning the international community that ceding any territory to Russia would be a “huge blow” to the entire west. “After Bucha, Borodianka, Mariupol, there cannot be business as usual with Russia,” he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front</strong> in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russia’s death toll from its war on Ukraine is akin to the losses suffered in its war in Afghanistan, the UK Ministry of Defence has said</strong>. In the first three months since Russia invaded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, it is likely to have suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine year war in Afghanistan, the MoD claimed. A combination of “poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility” and a command approach “prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes” has led to the high casualty rate, British intelligence added. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> \n   <li><strong>Russia is “concentrating its efforts” on assaults on the eastern Ukrainian city of Siverodonetsk </strong>and the nearby town of Toshkivka, the Ukrainian military has said in its latest operational <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/pfbid0pKws1AwMJopZ8Zz1imiWrVtsiuku8w1rLitM7ZX5FzVjkuR9oou8HtgxsqumzqZbl\">report</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>Ukraine is set to top the agenda at the four-day World Economic Forum in Davos</strong>, which kicks off on Monday with a video address from <strong>Zelenskiy</strong>.

But it maintains unofficial contact, including a de facto embassy, and supplies Taiwan with military equipment for self-defence.</p> \n<p>“America is committed to a one-China policy but that does not mean China has the jurisdiction to use force to take Taiwan,” Biden said, adding: “My expectation is that will not happen.”</p> \n<p>The president’s national security aides shifted in their seats and studied Biden closely as he responded to the question, with several looking down as he gave his answer on Taiwan’s defence. Within minutes, the state department began walking back the president’s comments.</p> \n<p>Analysts say that Biden was unlikely to be announcing a new policy towards Taiwan during his trip to Japan, but Monday’s remark did provide a window into the president’s instincts in the event of a Chinese attack.</p> \n<p>Taipei welcomed Biden’s remarks and thanked him for “reaffirming” Washington’s commitment. “The challenge posed by China to the security of the Taiwan Strait has raised great concern in the international community,” Taiwan’s foreign ministry said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14ba6ec560ea8a34f382ac9e012583987542189b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14ba6ec560ea8a34f382ac9e012583987542189b/0_312_8195_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Taipei 101 tower, once the world’s tallest building, dominate’s the city skyline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Taipei 101 tower, once the world’s tallest building, dominates the city skyline.

Japan’s ruling party is considering calls for the country to acquire the ability to conduct a first strike against enemy bases if it believes it is in danger of imminent attack – a move that some say violates its “pacifist” postwar constitution.</p> \n<p>“I applaud Japan’s determination to strengthen its defence – a strong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a>, and a strong Japan-US alliance, is a force for good in the world,” Biden said.</p> \n<p>Kishida said he would “fundamentally” reinforce Japan’s defences, adding: “I have said all options are on the table, including the capability for Japan to carry out first strikes on enemy bases.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"13ab39c0-3d68-4524-b3d4-cc0d7582d139\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WdOuDBa6-b4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the afternoon, Biden was due to launch a regional trade pact designed to show the US’s commitment to the region and bring stability to commerce after disruption caused by the war in Ukraine.</p> \n<p>The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) will help the US and Asian countries work more closely on supply chains, digital trade, clean energy, worker protections and anticorruption efforts.

It added that Barton failed to give candid evidence to the committee, and says as a result it had lost confidence in him. The committee also accused him of covering up political interference in the fast-tracking of some individuals out of Afghanistan.</p> <p>The committee said that while junior officials at the Foreign Office (FCDO) demonstrated courage and integrity, chaotic and arbitrary decision-making marked the planning and execution of the evacuation. “Sadly, it may have cost many people the chance to leave Afghanistan, putting lives in danger,” the report said.</p> <p>It also found that senior officials were intentionally evasive and often deliberately misleading to parliament, noting: “The integrity of the civil service depends on those leading these organisations showing the courage to tell the truth to the British people.”</p> <p>The report, one of the most damning to be issued by a select committee under the Conservative government, also extends criticism to the then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. “It might be convenient to blame FCDO officials or military intelligence for these failures, but ministers should have been driving this policy,” it said.</p> <p>“The fact that the Foreign Office’s senior leaders were on holiday when Kabul fell marks a fundamental lack of seriousness, grip or leadership at a time of national emergency. At several key stages in the evacuation there seemed to be no clear line of command within the political leadership of the government, as decisions were made on the basis of untraceable and unaccountable political interventions.”</p> <p>The report found there was a “total absence of a plan for evacuating Afghans who had supported the UK mission, without being directly employed by the UK government, despite knowing 18 months before the collapse of Afghanistan that an evacuation might be necessary”. It added: “The hasty effort to select those eligible for evacuation was poorly devised, managed and staffed; and the department failed to perform the most basic crisis-management functions.</p> <p>“The lack of clarity led to confusion and false hope among our Afghan partners who were desperate for rescue. They, and the many civil servants and soldiers working hard on the evacuation, were utterly let down by deep failures of leadership in government.”</p> <p>The all-party committee, which is chaired by the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, said answers given by senior officials were “at best intentionally evasive, and often deliberately misleading”. It said: “Those who lead the department should be ashamed that civil servants of great integrity felt compelled to risk their careers to bring to light the appalling mismanagement of the crisis, and the misleading statements to parliament that followed.”</p> <p>Two whistleblowers who worked in the FCDO resigned their posts to give scathing written evidence about the handling of the evacuation.</p> <p>The report also found there was an optimism bias inside the Foreign Office that the Biden administration would change the planned US withdrawal date from Afghanistan, and that when this proved incorrect, the UK revealed a lack of influence by failing to make Washington change its plans.</p> <p>Raab did next to nothing to engage with regional partners before the fall of Kabul, the report said. In a sign of the chaos, it found: “In the rush, staff failed to remove sensitive documents identifying Afghan job applicants, leaving them to fall into the Taliban’s hands. An internal review of the incident concluded that the FCDO cannot be certain that all other physical and electronic documents containing personal data were removed.”</p> <p>The report said the Foreign Office acted too late, largely after the fall of Kabul in August, in trying to devise a special category of people for evacuation such as journalists, judges and others who had helped the British government but had not been directly employed.</p> <p>The committee found that, as a result, the government “failed to deliver the bare minimum that we owed them: a well-considered plan for who would be prioritised for extraction, and clear communications to those seeking help. The lack of clarity led to confusion and false hope, hindering individuals from making the best decision for themselves based on a realistic understanding of their situation.”</p> <p>Singling out Barton, the committee found: “The fact that the department’s top civil servant did not return until the civilian evacuation was over, while staff across the department struggled to implement a poorly planned evacuation process under intense pressure, is difficult to understand and impossible to excuse.”</p> <p>Barton has already apologised for what he regards as an error, but he has so far refused to resign. The report criticised the department for failing to “perform the most basic crisis-management functions, such as rostering an adequate number of staff to key teams”. It said: “The political leadership on offer vacillated so much that no clear priorities were set for who should be evacuated and in what order, giving many thousands of vulnerable people, to whom we owed a debt, a hope that could never be met.”</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “Our staff worked tirelessly to evacuate over 15,000 people from Afghanistan within a fortnight. This was the biggest UK mission of its kind in generations and followed months of intensive planning and collaboration between UK government departments.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/24/girl-tried-to-kill-herself-after-strip-search-by-met-officers-mother-says","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T23:01:47Z","webTitle":"Girl tried to kill herself after strip-search by Met officers, mother says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/24/girl-tried-to-kill-herself-after-strip-search-by-met-officers-mother-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/24/girl-tried-to-kill-herself-after-strip-search-by-met-officers-mother-says","fields":{"headline":"Girl tried to kill herself after strip-search by Met officers, mother says","trailText":"Mother says she believes ‘racial stereotyping’ was a factor in her mixed-race daughter’s case","body":"<p>A 15-year-old girl of mixed white and black ethnicity was so traumatised after being strip-searched by Metropolitan police officers that she tried to kill herself, her mother has said.</p> <p>Olivia, not her real name, was menstruating when she was handcuffed and searched in front of male officers after more than 20 hours in custody.</p> <p>Her mother, Lisa, also not her real name, had told officers her daughter was autistic, had learning difficulties and had been self-harming, according to an investigation by BBC Radio 4’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0017kjd\">File on 4 programme</a>.</p> <p>Lisa said the ordeal had a devastating impact on Olivia’s mental health. “She became quite reclusive.

She said to me that they’d smashed her head on the cell floor and that they had [her] underwear off and that there was male officers there at the time as well.</p> <p>“And not only that, Olivia was actually on her period at the time too. And they used, I don’t know whether it was a knife or a pair of scissors, to cut off her underwear in front of these grown male officers, which I feel is not right.”</p> <p>Olivia later appeared in court accused of possession of a bladed weapon and was acquitted.</p> <p>Gail Hadfield Gardner, a lawyer who is representing the family in a civil case against the force, said rules had to be followed when searching minors. “The legal guardian, the person that has responsibility for that child needs to be informed. The strip-search needs to be done in front of same-sex staff only, not same-sex staff with the opposite sex onlooking,” she said.</p> <p>The Met’s deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor told the programme that an investigation was under way, which “will determine the appropriateness of the search and the way that it was conducted”.</p> <p>More than 13,000 young people under the age of 18 have been strip-searched in England and Wales since 2017, data obtained by File on 4 shows. The programme said separate data showed that two-thirds of children who had been strip-searched by the Met over the past three years were from ethnically diverse backgrounds.</p> <p>Taylor defended the force’s record, claiming searches was based on “intelligence-led policing”.</p> <p>The programme will air on Radio 4 at 8pm on Tuesday.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 24 May 2022 to correct the age of Olivia, who is 15 and not 14 as an earlier version said.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

Others who attended the leaving do were handed FPNs during the Met’s investigation, and the images will raise new questions about why Johnson escaped sanction. The pictures were obtained by ITV News.</li> \n   <li><strong>Questions are being raised about whether the photos prove Johnson lied at the dispatch box. On 8 December last year the Labour MP Catherine West specifically asked Boris Johnson at PMQs if there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November [2020]</strong>. <strong>Johnson</strong> replied: “No, but I am sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.”</li> \n   <li><strong>Labour says the new photographs prove beyond doubt that Boris Johnson lied to MPs.</strong> This is from <strong>Angela Rayner</strong>, the party’s deputy leader: “While the British public were making huge sacrifices, Boris Johnson was breaking the law.”</li> \n   <li><strong>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has been urged to investigate why Boris Johnson was not fined for the event</strong> at which he was pictured apparently raising a toast and drinking sparkling wine. The Lib Dem deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, has written to IOPC director general Michael Lockwood about the issue.</li> \n   <li><strong>No 10 has played down the significance of the new Partygate photographs</strong>, arguing that the Met police had access to photographs when it carried out its investigation.</li> \n   <li><strong>Lord Brian Paddick, a former Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner, has told Andrew Marr that the Met “didn’t want to upset” No 10 over Partygate</strong> and has compared the situation to the phone hacking scandal.</li> \n   <li><strong>The former leader of the Scottish Conservatives Ruth Davidson said it was clear Boris Johnson had lied to parliament</strong> and that his position was untenable.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Met’s decision-making process during the Operation Hillman inquiry into events in No 10 and Whitehall has been questioned by lawyers</strong>, with the Good Law Project’s Jolyon Maugham suggesting he would take legal action.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said publication of the Sue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gray-report\">Gray report</a> was being held up by a debate about who to name, and whether photographs would be included. </strong>He said the “extraordinary pressure” that No 10 staff were under during the pandemic helped to explain why the Partygate lockdown breaches happened. </li> \n   <li><strong>The PM’s spokesperson admitted that Downing Street instigated the meeting between Boris Johnson and Sue Gray that took place a few weeks ago. </strong>This came after Simon Clarke wrongly claimed earlier in the day that Gray had been the one to instigate it.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> <strong>“pressurised Sue Gray to drop” her report into Partygate during a secret meeting earlier this month, The Times is reporting. </strong>A source told the paper that the prime minister asked if there was “much point” of publishing the report given that “it’s all out there”.</li> \n   <li><strong>Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser who is now determined to be his nemesis, posted about Partygate on his subscription-only Substack account this morning</strong>. He correctly predicted that pictures would start to emerge. Among other things, he said Johnson attended a second birthday party in 2020, as well as the one for which he was fined, that has not been reported.</li> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that he was not “intrinsically” in favour of new taxes, but that a windfall tax was not off the table. </strong>Asked about the increasing clamour (particularly within his own party) for a windfall tax, he replied: “I’m not attracted, intrinsically, to new taxes. But as I have said throughout, we have got to do what we can - and we will - to look after people.”</li> \n   <li><strong>Simon Clarke rejected claims that Rishi Sunak’s wealth meant he was not suited to be chancellor </strong>when asked about the revelation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/20/sri-and-gopi-hinduja-named-uk-richest-people-james-dyson\">Sunak’s family is now on the Sunday Times rich list</a>, and that he is three times as wealthy as Ed Sheeran.</li> \n   <li><strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>,<strong> the minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency, may be anxious to get workers back into the office, but a large number of Britons like working from home</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/ishybridworkingheretostay/2022-05-23\">figures from the Office for National Statistics<strong> </strong></a>out this morning suggest. They show that almost a quarter of employees now describe themselves as hybrid workers – working partly in the office, and partly at home. </li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> <strong>has been urged by a Commons committee to issue 11 corrections</strong> relating to occasions when he falsely claimed employment is higher now than it was before the pandemic.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That’s it for tonight.

Any reasonable person looking at some of these photos will only be able to conclude that the PM obviously lied to the Commons, and possibly to the cops, and there is no reasonable story for how others were fined for event X but not him.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Cummings claims Johnson was not fined by the police for attending certain events because the police did not investigate his attendance at those events.</strong> He claims that Johnson benefited in a similar way when Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on ministerial standards, investigated the funding of the Downing Street flat refurbishment because certain lines of inquiry were not pursued. (When the final Geidt report into this was published, it was clear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/jan/06/uk-covid-live-nhs-backlog-omicron-boris-johnson-coronavirus-latest-updates?page=with:block-61d7129c8f085c1379d4d5b3#block-61d7129c8f085c1379d4d5b3\">some avenues for investigation had been left unexplored.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claims that Johnson attended a second birthday party in 2020, as well as the one for which he was fined, that has not been reported. </strong>He says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Some people told the police (but not Sue Gray, because they did not want the PM to read their evidence) that they had evidence regarding the <em>organisation</em> of illegal events from the flat. E.g apart from the ‘cake ambush’ there was a separate birthday party, uncovered by the media so far I think, that evening (which almost nobody knew about at the time, including me). There is a paper trail including WhatsApps from the flat. Sounds very bad for Boris/Carrie right? Surely that must be investigated? No! The police simply ignored it. Simple! PM cleared!</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Cummings says some junior staff at No 10 were told to attend events for which they have now been fined. </strong>Those staff relied on assurances that the gatherings were within the rules, he says.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This process for checking lawfulness was particularly crucial in No10 because No10 itself was <em>exempted</em> from some regulations (e.g so it could be part of the mass testing pilot) so staff did not know exactly what rules applied internally from day to day. They weren’t told ‘it’s your job to keep tabs on all the rule changes’, they were told ‘the PPS has a process to ensure everything is lawful’. Obviously you knew *an actual party* (such as clearly happened in 2021) would be against the rules but many of the fines were for events that junior staff thought were a normal part of work and <em>had been approved as lawful</em>. Such officials’ view, reasonably, is: we were told X is lawful but now it turns out Martin [Reynolds, the PM’s principal private secretary] didn’t do his job and it wasn’t and we’re being fined, but if <em>we’re</em> being fined, how come the PM who was there and appointed Martin, and unlike us <em>was</em> told BYOB was NOT within the rules, <em>isn’t</em> fined?!’</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Cummings was effectively sacked by Johnson and he has made no secret of his desire to bring him down. His critics would question whether he is a reliable witness.

But now more and more senior party figures are coming out to say they are in favour. Last night <strong>George Osborne</strong>, the former chancellor, told Channel 4’s Andrew Neil Show he was “sure” there would be a windfall tax (although he also said he did not think it would “massively help”). And <strong>Jesse Norman</strong>, the Conservative MP and former Treasury minister, has backed the idea. He told the Today programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have a situation in which millions of people, because of the massive increase in global oil and gas prices, are facing fuel poverty and a serious cost-of-living crisis in the next few months.</p> \n   <p>And so the question is, how should government respond to that?

Westminster is – yet again – waiting for the Sue Gray report. The first wait was terminated by the announcement of the Metropolitan police investigation, and the Met’s ruling that publication of the Gray findings in full would compromise the inquiry. There was then a wait for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/sue-gray-report-criticises-no-10-over-difficult-to-justify-parties\">Gray’s interim report</a> – or “update”, as she called it, because the police veto made it so thin it could not be called a proper report. But this week we are finally expecting the whole thing. Very few people think it will be damning enough to trigger a Tory leadership contest, but it should provide the public with by far the best account of exactly who extensive lockdown rule-breaking was in Downing Street. Until now all we’ve had are news reports, based on evidence from unidentified whistleblowers, and limited information from the Met about the fines issued – which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/boris-johnson-and-partygate-how-did-pm-only-get-one-fine\">many respects has begged more questions than it has answered.</a></p> \n  <p>Gray is a long-serving and very senior civil servant and she will have noticed that, when an independent-minded figure is about to deliver a verdict hostile to No 10, it is not unusual for Downing Street’s allies in the media to launch a hit job in advance. Right on cue, today’s Daily Mail carries a report accusing her of playing politics and grandstanding. It says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>“Sue Gray is supposed to be neutral but she’s been busy playing politics and enjoying the limelight a little too much,” said one insider.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Mail claims Gray’s team incorrectly said Downing Street was responsible for scheduling a meeting some weeks ago between Gray and Boris Johnson – which prompted claims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/22/she-has-been-horribly-isolated-friends-say-sue-gray-was-deliberately-ostracised-while-investigating-partygate\">Johnson was trying to pressurise her</a> when it was reported on Friday night. <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10843117/Boris-Johnsons-allies-accuse-Sue-Gray-playing-politics.html\">The Mail says:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Downing Street insiders are furious at the refusal of Miss Gray’s team to set the record straight.

Moore, who did not treat Depp, said the fingernail was exposed – as Depp described the palm-down placement of his hand – and would have been damaged.</p> \n<p>Depp has given different accounts of the injury, at times saying he had done it to himself, had caught it between accordion doors or had lied to protect Heard.</p> \n<p>Depp is suing Heard for libel in Fairfax county over a December 2018 op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post, describing herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse”.</p> \n<p>His lawyers say he was defamed by the article, although it never mentioned his name.</p> \n<p>Depp has denied he ever struck Heard and says she was the abuser in the relationship.</p> \n<p>Heard has testified about more than a dozen instances of physical abuse she says she suffered at Depp’s hands.</p> \n<p>A psychiatrist for Heard later argued on Monday that Depp’s chemical dependencies, narcissism and need for control skewed him toward violence in relationships.</p> \n<p>David Spiegel testified that the warning signs of intimate partner violence (IPV) were sometimes instilled in narcissist personalities, displaying poor self-control, rapid mood shifts, being envious and worshipping power and control.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c3f12b80307e6a92ae59a682a2c54f26af965e8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c3f12b80307e6a92ae59a682a2c54f26af965e8/0_7_5679_3407/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Heard in court with her attorney.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amber Heard in court with her attorney.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Helber/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Threatening, destroying furniture and property, breaking things, writing on walls and mirrors, writing in blood on furniture,” Spiegel testified, could all be indicative of interpersonal violence.</p> \n<p>In a bizarre turn in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/16/amber-heard-johnny-depp-hallucination-bed\">the long-running case</a>, Spiegel said Depp’s “processing speed” was delayed and his statements “disconnected” and cited that he had had his movie lines fed to him through an earpiece when filming.</p> \n<p>“I don’t believe that actors are routinely given their entire script through earpieces,” Spiegel said.</p> \n<p>“Do you know whether Marlon Brando used an earpiece?” Depp’s attorney asked Spiegel.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/16/amber-heard-haters-domestic-violence-victims-tiktokers-tweeters-johnny-depp\">‘It’s harmful and humiliating’: how Amber Heard’s haters undermine the victims of domestic violence</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Isn’t he dead?” Spiegel responded. “The answer is no; he does not use one now.”</p> \n<p>Depp, Spiegel said, had failed to remember three words when asked to repeat them five minutes later.

As for this film, one of the macabre things to be witnessed here has one character purring passionately: “It’s juicy with meaning!” Or … well … maybe just juicy. But very, very juicy indeed.</p> <p>This is set in an eerie future world in which people’s bodies are changing and everyone is beginning to divine that they are on the brink of a post-human evolutionary stage. Developments in medicine and analgesia have diminished physical sensation to the extent that pain is a thing of the past, so much so that it is sought after by a bizarre new breed of sicko sybarites, but conventional sensual pleasure is withering away also, along with the disgust and fear that has always moderated human behaviour. And along with this, bodies themselves have also shown that they are capable of growing new organs, whose function is not yet clear.</p> <p>Viggo Mortensen plays Saul Tenser, a performance artist whose body is exceptionally fertile with new organs. His girlfriend, former trauma surgeon Caprice (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/16/lea-seydoux-art-is-a-sexual-energy-cannes-lockdown-bond\">Léa Seydoux</a>) helps him to cultivate these – he sleeps and eats in bizarre carbuncular cradles, which look as if Antoni Gaudí designed ICU hospital beds. Periodically Caprice gets her scalpel out and removes Saul’s weird new post-Anthropocene organs and tattoos them in front of a live audience (who are presumably paying for the privilege, although the ordinary pre-post-human issue of how Saul and Caprice are earning a living is not explicitly discussed).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da241ca94e85a185f9328fb13db5cb1a389b4eac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da241ca94e85a185f9328fb13db5cb1a389b4eac/0_0_7563_5785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristen Stewart alongside Léa Seydoux in Crimes of the Future by David Cronenberg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"765\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Excellent … Kristen Stewart alongside Léa Seydoux in Crimes of the Future by David Cronenberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nikos Nikolopoulos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Caprice and Saul are required to report to an official government unit tasked with monitoring this sort of thing, run by Wippet (Don McKellar) and his nervily intense assistant Timlin (Kristen Stewart). She mutters to Caprice that “surgery is the new sex” and tries kissing Saul, who replies evasively: “I’m not very good at the old sex.” (Although it is perhaps the dictates of the old sex that mean in this film attractive young women take their clothes off quite a lot.)</p> <p>But Saul is secretly also reporting to a cop from the New Vice unit (Welket Bungué), about any possible infringements, and so he recounts his encounter with a certain Dr Nasatir (Yorgos Pirpassopoulos) who wants Saul to show his roilingly productive physiology for something called an “Inner Beauty Pageant”. There’s also a haunted figure called Lang (Scott Speedman), who claims that anatomising the corpse of his 10-year-old son, still in his possession, will prove that homo sapiens is developing the art of digesting plastic.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_bbLcJAHEo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v_bbLcJAHEo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In some sense, Crimes of the Future is an epically and operatically huge black comedy of outrage: the “inner beauty pageant” is incidentally a joke I first heard on TV’s Arrested Development, although the point there was that judges assessed the sweet personality of plain people, not their actual innards. So comedy is certainly a way of looking at Crimes of the Future and Kristen Stewart’s excellent performance is a part of that.</p> <p>But really the comedy interpretation could just be an incorrect and even hostile way of reading Crimes of the Future: laughing is Old Sex. Perhaps the point is that it has gone beyond Serious and Funny, beyond Disgusting and Sexy. The director has pointed out that this is not a remake of his 1970 film of the same name, but there are obvious points of similarity, with that earlier film’s themes of transgression, the clinical manipulation of sexuality, body fetish and weird gloopy stuff coming out of young people’s mouths. Is it just a mannerism? And a movie about a human world so impervious to traditional calamity that it is evolving its own occult inner galaxy of sensation is maybe obtuse given that we have not yet quite emerged from a global pandemic. At all events, it’s an extraordinary planet that Cronenberg lands us down on, and insists we remove our helmets before we’re quite sure we can breathe the air.</p> <ul> <li><p>Crimes of the Future

In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor slammed the decision, warning it would leave “many people … to face incarceration or even execution without any meaningful chance to vindicate their right to counsel”.</p> <p>The ruling in Shinn v Ramirez was written by Clarence Thomas, the rightwing justice who has come to the fore as a result of the court’s sharp shift to the right following Donald Trump’s three appointments. He was supported by all five other conservative justices, including the chief justice, John Roberts.</p> <p>In his opinion, Thomas presented the case as one of states’ rights. He said that federal courts should not be allowed to override the states’ “core power to enforce criminal law”.</p> <p>That continues to be the case, the majority ruled, even where defendants are given bad legal advice by counsel provided for them by the very same states that are condemning them to long prison sentences or even execution.</p> <p>In future, they will have no recourse to a federal court to try and reverse their wrongful conviction.</p> <p>The case before the justices arose after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/08/us-supreme-court-arizona-death-penalty-case\">state officials in Arizona</a> petitioned the supreme court to prevent two of the state’s death row inmates – one with a strong case of proclaimed innocence, the other with a history of family abuse – from seeking relief in federal court from capital punishment.</p> <p>The state argued that the condemned men should not be allowed to present new evidence to a federal judge when they had failed to do so previously in state court.</p> <p>Lawyers for the condemned men pointed out that they had only failed to present the evidence in state court because the legal counsel they had been assigned by the state was woefully inadequate.</p> <p>If they were blocked from petitioning a federal court, the men would in effect be sent to the death chamber simply because incompetent lawyers had missed a filing deadline or failed to uncover a glaring truth.</p> <p>Monday’s majority ruling prompted an outpouring of angry and anguished criticism from innocence rights groups and death penalty experts.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/innocence/status/1528768502680760321\">Innocence Project said</a> that overturning wrongful convictions was never easy, and that “today’s supreme court decision makes it that much harder to secure justice for wrongly-convicted people”.</p> <p>Thomas’s opinion also overturns previous supreme court rulings, in an abrogation of the court’s own adherence to the principle of stare decisis – that is, being faithful to precedent. In 2012 the supreme court ruled in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/2011/10-1001\">Martinez v Ryan</a> that prisoners could have access to federal court in cases where they had suffered from ineffective legal counsel in the state courts.</p> <p>“The supreme court seems hell-bent on disrespecting precedent and rolling back rights,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JNelsonLDF/status/1528753507108544514\">said Janai Nelson</a>, president of LDF, America’s first civil and human rights law organization.</p> <p>In her dissenting opinion, Sotomayor decried the ruling. “This decision is perverse. It is illogical,” she wrote.</p> <p>Sotomayor argued that under the court’s own precedent, prisoners cannot be held accountable – and effectively punished – for “their attorneys’ failures to present claims in state court”.</p> <p>She concluded that as a result of the majority decision from the nine-member supreme court bench, the Sixth Amendment to the US constitution’s guarantee that criminal defendants have the right to effective legal counsel at trial “is now an empty one”.</p> <p>In future, she said, prisoners who have had poor legal assistance would have no relief. “The responsibility for this devastating outcome lies not with Congress, but with this court.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/23/california-drought-water-restrictions-gavin-newsom","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T20:33:21Z","webTitle":"California threatens ‘mandatory water restrictions’ if people don’t cut back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/23/california-drought-water-restrictions-gavin-newsom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/23/california-drought-water-restrictions-gavin-newsom","fields":{"headline":"California threatens ‘mandatory water restrictions’ if people don’t cut back","trailText":"Governor’s warning comes amid drought after driest January-March period in at least a century","body":"<p>California could face mandatory water restrictions if residents don’t use less on their own as the drought drags on and the hotter summer months approach, the state’s governor has said.</p> <p>Gavin Newsom threatened the possibly of statewide mandates in a meeting with representatives from major water agencies, including those that supply Los Angeles, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area, according to his office. The Democratic governor has avoided issuing sweeping mandatory cuts in water use and instead favored an approach that gives local water agencies power to set rules for water use in the cities and towns they supply.</p> <p>January through March is typically when most of California’s annual rain and snow falls, but this year those months were the driest in at least a century. Despite calls for conservation, the state’s water use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/california-water-use-leaps-19-in-march-amid-one-of-the-driest-months-on-record\">went up dramatically</a> in March – 19% compared to the same month in 2020 – and now Newsom is considering changing his approach.</p> <p>“Every water agency across the state needs to take more aggressive actions to communicate about the drought emergency and implement conservation measures,” Newsom said in a statement.</p> <p>Some parts of California have already imposed local water restrictions on residents. This month, the mayor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles\">Los Angeles</a> ordered households and businesses to restrict outdoor watering to just two days a week in an effort to conserve.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/us-new-mexico-drought-wildfire-southwest\">‘Turning the dial up’: US south-west braces for extended wildfire season amid drastic drought</a> </p> </aside>  <p>California is in its third year of drought and virtually all areas of the state are classified as either in severe or extreme drought.</p> <p>Newsom last summer called on Californians to voluntarily reduce their water use by 15% by doing things like taking five-minute showers and avoiding baths, only running the washing machine and dishwasher with full loads and limiting water use for cleaning outdoor areas. But residents have fallen far short of the goal. </p> <p>How soon Newsom could impose mandatory restrictions if conservation doesn’t improve wasn’t clear. He plans to meet with the water agencies again in two months, his office said. A spokesperson, Erin Mellon, said the administration would reassess conservation progress in just “a few weeks”. She didn’t offer a metric the administration would use to measure.</p> <p>Newsom has already moved to force more conservation from local water districts. He directed the state water resources control board to consider a ban on watering of decorative turf, such as grass in office parks, and to force local agencies to step up their conservation efforts.</p> <p>After the last drought, the state started requiring cities and other water districts to submit drought response plans that detail six levels of conservation based on how much water is available. Newsom has asked the board to require those districts to move into “level 2” of their plans, which assumes a 20% water shortage.</p> <p>Each district can set its own rules for “level 2” and they often include measures like further limiting water use for outdoor purposes and paying people to install more efficient appliances or landscaping that needs less water. They must include a communication plan to urge local residents to use less water.</p> <p>The board will vote on those measures on Tuesday, and they would take effect 10 June.</p> <p>Last week, while touring a water recycling plant in Los Angeles county, Newsom spoke about the need to better communicate the need for water conservation with the state’s 39 million people. He has included $100m in his budget for drought messaging.</p> <p>During the last drought, from 2012 to 2016, the former governor Jerry Brown issued a mandatory 25% cut in the state’s overall water use, and the state water board set requirements for how much each water district had to cut based on their existing water use; districts in which people used more water were asked to cut more. Water agencies could be fined up to $10,000 a day if they didn’t comply.</p> <p>Newsom’s current approach gives local water districts some more flexibility, and he’s said it’s important to recognize different parts of the state have their own water needs.</p> <p>The state water board has imposed some statewide restrictions such as banning people from watering their lawns for 48 hours after rainstorms and sprinklers from running on to sidewalks. People can be fined $500 per day for violations.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2022/may/23/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-accuses-uk-role-forcing-sign-confession","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T20:01:08Z","webTitle":"Zaghari-Ratcliffe says Foreign Office complicit in forcing her to confess","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/23/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-accuses-uk-role-forcing-sign-confession","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/may/23/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-accuses-uk-role-forcing-sign-confession","fields":{"headline":"Zaghari-Ratcliffe says Foreign Office complicit in forcing her to confess","trailText":"UK accused of agreeing to Iran’s ‘unlawful’ request that she sign false statement as condition of her release","body":"<p>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has accused the UK Foreign Office of being complicit in forcing her to sign a letter of false confession to the Iranian government as part of the last-minute terms of her release in March.</p> <p>She signed the letter at Tehran airport as she waited to find out whether she would be allowed to leave Iran after six years in detention.</p> <p>The allegations, in a 20-page letter to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, exclusively obtained by the Guardian, suggest she was shocked when she found out the Foreign Office had agreed this condition as part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/17/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-anoosheh-ashoori-returns-uk-six-years-iran-prison\">her release</a>, adding its actions had “taken a huge personal toll on her and caused her severe trauma”.</p> <p>She says in the letter written by her lawyers from the human rights group Redress, who have called for a full investigation in to the Foreign Office, that “UK officials were complicit in an unlawful act by the Iranian authorities, telling her that she must sign a false confession in circumstances where she effectively had no other choice”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/23/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-accuses-uk-role-forcing-sign-confession\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe says UK official witnessed her signing false confession to secure Iran release</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lawyers claim “the actions of UK officials appear contrary to the UK policy not to ‘participate in, solicit, encourage or condone the use of torture or mistreatment for any purpose’”. The letter adds that the Foreign Office’s actions made the status of other UK detainees in Iran more precarious.</p> <p>The revelations suggest the Foreign Office and Downing Street have at best not been straightforward in revealing the terms for her release.</p> <p>In the letter, the lawyers from Redress say Zaghari-Ratcliffe asserts the requirement to sign the confession caused her lasting damage, and made her fearful of reprisals in London. They say: “Zaghari-Ratcliffe had resisted intense pressure to make a false confession on many occasions during interrogations and during her eight and a half months in solitary confinement. To be told to sign a false confession by her own government after all she had survived was deeply distressing to her.”</p> <p>In the final three days before her release, Redress has revealed, Iranian officials accused Zaghari-Ratcliffe of being a spy, taunted her by offering her release and then threatening to revoke it, and attempted to get her to – and eventually forced her to – sign a document confessing to unspecified crimes.</p> <p>The letter reveals the British ambassador called her on 14 March and told her she had to attend a meeting with Iranian officials to collect a new Iranian passport, even though her Iranian lawyer had advised her not attend.</p> <p>The letter says: “The ambassador picked her up in an embassy car, drove her to the government office and waited outside. Again Zaghari-Ratcliffe was required to attend the office alone. She was accused by Iranian officials of being a spy, was told that if she loved Iran she wouldn’t have done what she did, and asked if she regretted it. She was informed they were exchanging her for half a billion dollars. They then pressured her to sign a document purporting to confess to unspecified charges and promising not to sue the Iranian government. The document appeared to be a standardised form with blank spaces to fill in details of the alleged crimes and the confession. Zaghari-Ratcliffe steadfastly refused to sign this document.”</p> <p>At this point, she recounts in the letter, a “particularly sinister official was brought into the room to scare her. He accused her of being a spy and ruining Iran and told her: ‘If you don’t sign this, you won’t go home.’” Zaghari-Ratcliffe eventually relented to writing out a separate document in her own handwriting which removed the words “I confess”. The ambassador assured her afterwards that the document had no legal standing, she says.</p> <p>The following day at the airport she was filmed and intimidated including by one of her interrogators during her initial period of solitary confinement, she reveals. The letter says she became “so frightened of this interrogator that she began shivering. He told her: ‘You do realise we have the power to ruin you even if you are not in Iran?’”</p> <p>The letter continues that “at around 2pm, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was approached by the UK’s lead negotiator. By this time Zaghari-Ratcliffe was feeling deeply stressed and had not had any lunch or refreshments, save for one instant coffee.</p> <p>“The lead negotiator told her that the Iranians would not let her get on the plane unless she signed the document. Zaghari-Ratcliffe refused, and the lead negotiator told her that the confession would have no value and that she needed to sign it. Zaghari-Ratcliffe eventually agreed to sign the document if she could have her handwritten document back.

I have also noticed more kārearea (our native falcon), tauhou (waxeyes) and kererū. The cheeky chittering pīwakawaka is one of my favourites.

It has a high population density, with the population increasing year on year, putting greater strain on the natural environment. However, forest regeneration and pest eradication has a high level of local support. For this reason bird life … has increased dramatically over the past years. Te Korowai o Waiheke is a scheme to make Waiheke the world’s first predator-free urban island. The first phase included ridding the island of European introduced mustelids, with the second phase being various rat eradication trails currently taking place.

City scored more goals, made more passes and had more possession than any other team in Europe’s top five leagues this season.</p> \n<p>João Cancelo, Rodri and Aymeric Laporte made more passes than anyone else in the English top tier (Cancelo, an all-purpose influence, was also top 10 for tackles, dribbles and interceptions and 12th on shots at goal).</p> \n<p>It has been a kind of total football, the domination of every metric, a sky blue wash applied across every surface of elite English football. At the end of which, this is also a good moment to take a breath. There is no suggestion Guardiola intends to leave when his contract expires next year, but some things will change now. Key players in this group are reaching their peak. Some will leave in the summer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/manchester-city-complete-erling-haaland-signing-from-borussia-dortmund\" title=\"\">Erling Haaland’s arrival</a> suggests a different kind of rebuild in the offing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82edeecb763d1def76e1659b38f16a9ebbf3f5e5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82edeecb763d1def76e1659b38f16a9ebbf3f5e5/0_145_4981_2989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Walker, Ruben Días and John Stones celebrate with the Premier League trophy – the club’s fourth title in five seasons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle Walker, Ruben Días and John Stones celebrate with the Premier League trophy – the club’s fourth title in five seasons.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt McNulty/Manchester City/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And, looking back, the first six years of Guardiola at City have their own very distinct tone and texture. Zoom out a little to take in tactics, structure and ownership model, right down to the way full-blown internet tribalism has become an aspect of football fandom, and there is a fair case that Pep-era Manchester City is the single most transformative element in the modern history of English football.</p> \n<p>Two things seem clear enough. First, this has been a dizzying success. Four titles in six years: even taking out the Premier League premium that says the thing that has just happened is the only thing that has ever happened, this is one of the great title-winning eras in English football history.</p> \n<p>On the pure numbers Guardiola is now level with Kenny Dalglish and Herbert Chapman, one behind Matt Busby, two behind Bob Paisley, and, like everyone else, way back on Alex Ferguson’s 27-year total of 13.</p> \n<p>Factor in the shortness of his span and the sheer intensity of his influence and Guardiola starts to look like something even more substantial. He is now part of a tiny group – Chapman, Busby, Bill Shankly and Arsène Wenger spring to mind – whose success has also changed the way football is played, coached and understood in this country.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/23/pep-guardiola-jokes-of-comeback-plan-on-manchester-citys-parade\">Guardiola jokes going 2-0 down ‘was the plan’ at Manchester City’s title parade</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That tactical influence is the most obvious part of the Pep supremacy. In his time English football has tilted dramatically towards the possession style, the primacy of technique, the Catalan-Dutch obsession with the ball that is embodied best by Guardiola’s own evolving team.</p> \n<p>In the simplest terms, the season before he arrived City scored 71 goals and passed the ball 20,488 times. In the title-winning season just gone they scored 99 goals and made 26,132 passes.</p> \n<p>It is easy to take for granted the influence exerted over that time. Inverted wingers, false 9s, full-backs that wander, goalkeepers who love the ball: Pep has been the single biggest driver in these elements becoming part of English football’s internal language, to the extent even entry-level English managers will talk about their “philosophy” (love of knowledge) and accept the idea of coaching as a course of study, an intellectual discipline.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"429c14caf8c905d03418b6b20504f87e47d82853\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/429c14caf8c905d03418b6b20504f87e47d82853/0_416_5177_3106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City’s players enjoy their open-top bus parade through the city centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City’s players enjoy their open-top bus parade through the city centre.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Scroll back and it seems comical that as recently as 2016 there was still a small island hostility to this unproven (two Champions Leagues) outsider. The press conference at the King Power Stadium after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/10/leicester-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">a 4-2 defeat by Leicester Cit</a>y in December 2016, when Guardiola asked “what is tackles?”, has by now passed into low-key legend; a footballing version of the Sex Pistols playing Lesser Free Trade Hall in June 1976, a pistol-shot-to-wake-the-world kind of affair.</p> \n<p>At the time there was a degree of mockery. Fast forward five and a half years and it is remarkable to see the influence constant exposure to the Guardiola style has had. From a national team defined through its 140-year history by direct play and physicality, but now reconfigured to fetishise possession and patience; right down to the rhythms of park football, where the local under-11s will play an orderly passing game, where parents shout about pressing and not sending it long, where short passes are performatively applauded.</p> \n<p>Much of this was already in train pre-Guardiola, but his presence has supercharged it. He was right too. City made 300 fewer tackles this season than the year before he arrived, when they finished fourth behind Arsenal and Spurs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/23/player-ratings-manchester-city-premier-league-title-winners\">Player ratings for Manchester City’s Premier League title winners</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There are of course other sides to this transformation. City’s nation-state ownership is 14 years old now. Nobody was prepared for the changes wrought by this entirely different model, this entirely different set of motivations. In many ways it is simply the real world intruding. English culture, trade, economics, even the language has always been a magpie-ish thing, a business of export/import, borrowed talent, borrowed influences.</p> \n<p>This has been dramatically accelerated by globalisation. Qatar owns the tallest building in England. Abu Dhabi owns Manchester City. The project is in its own way a modern economic marvel: new spaces, new ground, new team, new style, new gravity.</p> \n<p>But it does also deserve to be judged as something more than a set of buildings and a payroll. The sporting infrastructure is delicate. And while plenty of other teams have tried to spend their way to success over the same period, City’s superpower has been to set about elite level sport with the coherence of an overt political project, backed by bottomless reserves, extreme executive competence and a willingness to litigate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for The Fiver.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up for The Fiver.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In many ways their success can look mundane from the outside: hire the best talent, spend the most money, remove the standard desperation of feuding egos, lust for glory, nepotism, incompetence.</p> \n<p>It is a part of Guardiola’s brilliance, his edge and his occasionally self-destructive obsession that under his hand this project has remained both beautiful and something that still feels like sport.</p> \n<p>City are exceptional title winners for so many reasons. Most obviously because they ended up with one more point than a brilliant Liverpool team.

The sister of Enriquez, Griselda Ville, told <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/05/22/family-of-slain-straphanger-slams-city-hall-for-transit-crime/\">the New York Post</a>: “I want every New Yorker to realize this could be your reality tomorrow – your worst nightmare could come true.”</p> <p>Enriquez’s brother-in-law was more direct, telling Adams through the newspaper: “Do your job. Get crime off the streets.”</p> <p>Official statistics show that fatal attacks on New York’s public transport network continue to be rare, with serious crimes on the subway and buses accounting for just 2% of the city’s total. Four people have been killed in foul play situations in the city’s sprawling, 24-hour transit system this year – the same number as the same period last year.</p> <p>Overall, New York is vastly safer than it was in the notorious 1980s and 1990s, when at its peak murders exceeded 2,000 a year compared with fewer than 500 last year.</p> <p>But that offers Adams, a Democrat who on 1 January succeeded two-term fellow Democratic party mayor Bill de Blasio, relatively little comfort as he struggles to establish his new mayoralty, now in its fifth month.</p> <p>He is battling on multiple fronts, from Covid infection rates that are rising again in the city, to an economy – especially in Manhattan – still languishing from the pandemic, and a perception of rising crime even though it is not borne out by the data.</p> <p>Through many of these challenges, the mostly underground, vast subway train system runs as a common factor.</p> <p>The perception of a crime problem has been heightened by recent shocking cases of crimes in the subway system, including a woman killed when she was pushed by a homeless man in front of a train in January, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/16/new-york-subway-shooting-brooklyn-reward\">mass gun attack</a> last month on the N train in Brooklyn in which 10 people were shot and 13 injured by a sole shooter, though nobody died.</p> <p>The latest attack comes at an awkward moment for Adams. He has been working hard in recent weeks to get the city moving again, calling for businesses to reopen their offices and workers to return to their desks.</p> <p>In March <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/2022/03/09/eric-adams-calls-bankers-back-to-offices-as-city-faces-mixed-recovery/\">he went to the headquarters</a> of Goldman Sachs, the employer of the rider slain on Sunday, to encourage the revival of in-person working which is still well below pre-pandemic levels in midtown and downtown. City authorities have projected that office vacancy rates across the five boroughs will remain at 20% over the next four years.</p> <p>One essential piece in getting the city back to work is to lure New Yorkers back on to the subway. But <a href=\"https://new.mta.info/coronavirus/ridership\">rider figures</a> are still at about 60% of their pre-pandemic numbers, creating a vicious circle in which the eeriness of relatively unpacked subway carriages and platforms further discourages people from returning to public transport.</p> <p>Adams, the second Black mayor in New York’s history, has responded to the challenge by leaning on his background as a NYPD officer and playing the “tough on crime” card. He has pledged to increase the number of officers on the subway system and remove homeless people who shelter in the network.</p> <p>He has also incurred the wrath of criminal justice reformers by recreating a contentious police unit that is charged with getting guns off the city’s streets but has a history of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/14/nyregion/nypd-anti-gun-unit.html\">brutality</a>.</p> <p>The mayor’s critics and political enemies have attempted to portray him as being more interested in his own national political prospects than in dealing with New Yorkers’ problems. He has invited those reproaches by presenting himself as the “face of the new Democratic party”.</p> <p>A day before the Manhattan Bridge subway shooting, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/05/21/eric-adams-eyeing-white-house-run-in-2024-sources/?utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter\">the New York Post ran a story</a> based on anonymous “sources” that claimed the mayor was considering running for the White House should Joe Biden stand back in 2024. The report was denounced as gossip by Adams’s publicity team.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/23/french-minister-refuses-to-stand-down-over-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T19:56:12Z","webTitle":"French minister refuses to stand down over rape allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/french-minister-refuses-to-stand-down-over-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/23/french-minister-refuses-to-stand-down-over-allegations","fields":{"headline":"French minister refuses to stand down over rape allegations","trailText":"Damien Abad, appointed to the new government on Friday, denies ‘deeply wounding’ accusations","body":"<p>A member of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a>’s newly installed government who has faced accusations of rape has strongly denied the allegations and insisted he will not stand down.</p> <p>Damien Abad, 42, appointed the minister for solidarity and the disabled, was forced to make a statement after two women accused him of rape in 2010 and 2011.</p> <p>Abad, who was named as a member of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron\">Emmanuel Macron</a>’s new government on Friday, suffers from a disorder called arthrogryposis that affects his limbs, and which he said makes him incapable of sexual assault.</p> <p>“I contest with the greatest force the accusations against me. All the sexual relations I have had in my life have always been consenting. These accusations are deeply wounding for me and my entourage,” he said on Monday.</p> <p>“I’ve always avoided making an issue of my disability. I am forced to do it now to defend myself and even talk about intimate matters in detail to explain that the acts I am accused of were materially impossible.

To address these subjects in public is extremely painful for me so now I am going to concentrate on my job as a minister.”</p> <p>Asked if he would stand down, Abad added: “Should an innocent man resign? I don’t believe so.”</p> <p>The accusations were published by the investigative website Mediapart. One of the women said she had gone for dinner with Abad in October 2010, drank a glass of champagne and woke up in a hotel room in her underwear with Abad.</p> <p>A second woman, reportedly unknown to the first, said she spent an evening with him in 2011 and had initially consented to having sex but then asked him to stop, which she said he failed to do.</p> <p>She first went to police in 2012 but said she was unable to complete the formal complaint that was finally lodged in 2017.

A woman had accused Darmanin of raping her in 2009; he has always strongly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the sex was consensual. He has brought a defamation lawsuit against the woman.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2022/may/23/joe-biden-inflation-january-6-supreme-court-democrats-republicans-us-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T19:46:47Z","webTitle":"Joe Biden says US recession ‘is not inevitable’ despite rampant inflation – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/23/joe-biden-inflation-january-6-supreme-court-democrats-republicans-us-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2022/may/23/joe-biden-inflation-january-6-supreme-court-democrats-republicans-us-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Joe Biden says US recession ‘is not inevitable’ despite rampant inflation – as it happened","trailText":"President warns inflation is ‘going to be a haul’ as poll finds 77% of Americans ‘pessimistic’ about cost of goods and services in coming months","body":"<div id=\"block-628be6918f089d657c064cc8\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-23T20:06:19.097Z\">9.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Closing summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It’s a wrap on Monday’s US politics blog.

<strong>Veronica Escobar</strong> will serve as the chairwoman of the panel leading the investigation, and Republican Mississippi congressman <strong>Michael Guest</strong> will be its ranking member, the statement added. The committee’s statement contained no other details into the allegations against Cawthorn.</p> <p>A pro-Donald Trump firebrand, Cawthorn has had his seat in the US House for one term but last week conceded defeat in a Republican primary challenge from North Carolina state legislator <strong>Chuck Edwards</strong>. </p> <p>His term, which began in 2021, is due to expire this upcoming January before giving way to the victor of the midterm election on 8 November. Edwards’ Democratic rival in that race is <strong>Jasmine Beach-Ferrara.</strong></p> <p>Several Republican leaders abandoned Cawthorn’s side after he alleged on a podcast that he’d gotten invites to orgies during his time in Washington and had seen leading but unnamed political heavyweights in the nation’s capital abuse cocaine. </p> <p>He also drew ire from some quarters after calling Ukrainian President <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> a “thug” following Russia’s invasion of his country in February.</p> <p>Furthermore, police stopped Cawthorn, 26, on driving citations three times, and he was caught with guns at airport checkpoints at least twice since last year, including last month. And videos during the primary campaign’s final weeks depicted Cawthorn in sexually suggestive poses.</p> <p>After conceding his loss, Cawthorn went on Instagram and called for “dark forces” of former president Trump’s Make America Great Again movement to take revenge against the Republican establishment. </p> <p>He wrote that he was “on a mission now to expose those who says and promise one thing yet legislate and work towards another, self-profiteering, globalist goal.”</p> <p>“The time for genteel politics as usual has come to an end,” Cawthorn added in his post, which thanked Trump for sticking by him, along with various other Republican congressional figures such as <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong>, <strong>Matt Gaetz</strong>, <strong>Paul Gosar</strong> and <strong>Rand Paul</strong>. </p> <p>Cawthorn’s chief of staff said Monday that the freshman congressman welcomed the investigation because it was a chance to prove that he “committed no wrongdoing and that he was falsely accused by partisan adversaries for political gain.”</p> <p>“This inquiry is a formality,” said the chief of staff, Blake Harp. “Our office isn’t deterred in the slightest from completing the job the patriots of ... North Carolina sent us to Washington to accomplish.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-24T04:27:12.881Z\">at 5.27am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-628bd54f8f08afed639a290a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-23T19:09:59.480Z\">8.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Court defeat for DeSantis's big tech clampdown</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis has been handed a court defeat over his crusade to end what he calls censorship by social media companies.</strong></p> <p>A three-judge appeals panel said key parts of DeSantis’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/25/florida-governor-de-platforming-politicians-law-ron-desantis\">May 2021 law</a> prohibiting politicians and prominent persons from being “deplatformed” was unconstitutional, the <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-ne-big-tech-injunction-upheld-20220523-lvrrd5zzubel3gif56kpbcbdda-story.html\">Orlando Sentinel reports</a>.</p> <p>The 11th circuit court of appeal refused to lift an injunction placed earlier by a <strong>Donald Trump</strong>-appointed district court judge, who disagreed with DeSantis’s assertion that big tech companies had no right to remove content or users. </p> <p>“Put simply, with minor exceptions, the government can’t tell a private person or entity what to say or how to say it,” the court wrote in its 67-page opinion, the Sentinel said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b6974ad5325b00f8cb915660af46c80a8aabf80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b6974ad5325b00f8cb915660af46c80a8aabf80/0_425_1826_1095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ron DeSantis speaks in May 2021 before signing his big tech censorship bill into law.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ron DeSantis speaks in May 2021 before signing his big tech censorship bill into law.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Juste/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When DeSantis<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/25/florida-governor-de-platforming-politicians-law-ron-desantis\"> signed it into law last year</a>, free speech experts countered it was a blatant contravention of the first amendment to the US constitution, and predicted it would fall under legal challenge.</p> <p>Like other DeSantis “culture war” legislation, including his controversial “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/dont-say-gay-bill-florida-senate-lgbtq\">don’t say gay</a>” bill and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/17/florida-rejects-math-textbooks-critical-race-theory\">banning of “woke” math textbooks</a> in classrooms, critics say it ignored real issues facing Floridians and was designed instead to appeal to the Republican base.</p> <p>The ruling strikes down $250,000 a day fines DeSantis wanted imposed on social media companies who banned political candidates.

The justice department is appealing the move.</li> <li>Title 42 is also standing in the way of a <strong>Covid-19 relief package</strong> making any headway in Congress. Republicans won’t budge on approving a deal to fund vaccines, tests and treatments without a vote to keep the immigration policy in place, despite a sharp recent rise in cases.</li> <li>We’re expecting one or more more minor rulings from the <strong>US supreme court</strong> today, ahead of what will be the blockbuster decision of the session in the coming weeks: whether the panel overturns the 1973 Roe v Wade protecting abortion rights.</li> <li>It’s the final day of campaigning in <strong>Georgia, Alabama</strong> and <strong>Arkansas</strong> ahead of tomorrow’s primaries. Former vice-president <strong>Mike Pence</strong> will rally in Kennesaw tonight for Republican Georgia governor <strong>Brian Kemp</strong>, whom Pence’s former boss <strong>Donald Trump</strong> wants to take down for rejecting his election lies.</li> </ul> </div>   </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/may/23/emma-raducanu-fights-back-to-sink-linda-noskova-at-french-open","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T19:20:31Z","webTitle":"Emma Raducanu fights back to sink Linda Noskova at French Open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/23/emma-raducanu-fights-back-to-sink-linda-noskova-at-french-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/may/23/emma-raducanu-fights-back-to-sink-linda-noskova-at-french-open","fields":{"headline":"Emma Raducanu fights back to sink Linda Noskova at French Open","trailText":"Emma Raducanu fought back to beat Linda Noskova 6-7 (4), 7-5, 6-1 and reach the second round of the French Open","body":"<p>Throughout the past 11 months as she has made her first journey around the WTA tour, every time Emma Raducanu has stepped on to a tennis court she has had to battle against the greater experience of her opponents as well as the quality of their games. Her sparse competitive record has meant that even opponents around the same age as her marched on to the court far more mentally and physically prepared for the fight to come.</p> \n<p>But on a damp, rainy evening on Court Simonne-Mathieu, Raducanu faced a completely different scenario.

I have to say Linda is playing some amazing tennis and she really came out there firing,” Raducanu said. “As soon as I dropped my ball speed, she was all over me and killing me from the end of the first set.”</p> \n<p>Despite breaking serve early in that first set, Raducanu was too passive from the beginning, opting to disrupt Noskova with copious looping balls and elongating points rather than imposing herself from inside the baseline.</p> \n<p>Noskova, meanwhile, knew exactly what she wanted to do in the biggest moment of her young career so far: attack. She took the ball daringly early with pristine timing, smothered all short balls and every time an opportunity to take her favoured backhand down the line opened up, Noskova took it on without a hint of doubt. Both in style and daring, she was not so dissimilar to the fearless Raducanu of last year before the blessing and burden of being a grand slam champion.</p> \n<p>As the first set wore on, Noskova’s confidence grew and it culminated in a stunning tiebreak triumph. She continued to blaze through the second set, breaking serve with a perfect return game to go ahead 4-3.</p> \n<p>As the match reached its most pivotal moments, Raducanu slowly began to creep closer to the baseline, taking the ball earlier and responding to Noskova’s fire with some of her own. Under pressure by Raducanu for the first time, Noskova offered up more errors. The gritty set ended with a touch of magic as Raducanu snatched it with a sweet winning drop shot.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With the momentum on her side, and Noskova’s high-octane attacking laced with far more frequent errors, Raducanu moved swiftly through the third set and into the second round. Even though Raducanu was heavily favoured to win, she demonstrated her toughness in addition to her durability after so many recent ailments.</p> \n<p>“I knew that if I got through some really tough moments in the second set, it might get to her,” Raducanu said. “And I think in the third set I definitely was able to kind of keep pushing. Eventually I was dominating more and more. I was pretty pleased.</p> \n<p>“Physically, I think I was really good out there. I lasted the whole three sets. I was really good. I was also thinking I’m going to outcompete her.”</p> \n<p>After a day of rest, Raducanu will face Aliaksandra Sasnovich, the world No 47, for a place in the third round.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Monday, the defending champion, Barbora Krejcikova, was taken out in the first round by French teenager, Diane Parry, losing 1-6, 6-2, 6-3 after leading 2-0 in set two.</p> \n<p>Krejcikova, the second seed, was competing in her first match since February after suffering an elbow injury.</p> \n<p>“I think I just collapsed physically, and it was tough because I didn’t play the matches,” said Krejcikova. “Usually the matches are different than the practices, and I tried to prepare the best way I could.

As a result, it has been the major focus of international efforts to prevent climate breakdown.</p> <p>However, other greenhouse gases also have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/06/reduce-methane-or-face-climate-catastrophe-scientists-warn\">sizeable warming effect</a>, and if we ignore them we will fail to keep temperatures within globally accepted limits, according to <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2123536119\">research published on Monday</a>.</p> <p>The study found that cuts to CO<sub>2</sub> alone could not achieve the reductions needed to stay within 1.5C of pre-industrial temperatures.</p> <p>But cutting methane and other “short-lived climate pollutants” (SLCPs) such as soot would reduce the global heating effect in the near term, thus giving the world “a fighting chance” of staving off climate catastrophe, the scientists said. Methane warming effect<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/06/how-satellites-may-hold-the-key-to-the-methane-crisis\"> is as much as 80 times that of C0<sub>2</sub></a>, although it quickly degrades in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Prof Durwood Zaelke, the president of the Washington-based Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (IGSD), and co-author of the paper, said cutting methane offered a quick way to reduce global heating while the world pursued longer term cuts in CO<sub>2</sub>. </p> <p>“We can’t solve the fast-moving climate problem with slow-moving solutions. Like Maverick [the Tom Cruise character in Top Gun], we’d better start feeling the need for speed,” he said.</p> <p>Zaelke called on European governments to stipulate that any gas they import to replace supplies from Russia should come from sources with low rates of methane leaks. “This is the fastest and most promising way to protect the planet while we decarbonise,” he said.</p> <p>Plugging the methane leaks from oil and gas operations, including shale wells, and stopping harmful practices such as venting or flaring the gas, is not only technically feasible but can also be highly profitable at today’s gas prices.</p> <p>Dr Gabrielle Dreyfus, chief scientist for the IGSD, and lead author of the paper, said: “This is an optimistic message, as we have low or no-cost strategies available, with no or low-cost interventions, that can slow global warming in the critical near-term.”</p> <p>Emissions of methane have been soaring in recent years, the result of leaks and venting from oil and gas exploration, and shale gas wells, and from the intensive rearing of livestock for food. Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/23/oil-and-gas-facilities-could-profit-from-plugging-methane-leaks-iea-says\">many countries were drastically under-reporting their emissions of methane</a>, and that the global problem was far worse than previously thought.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f35b2c7a8d80c8d54fe367ac6b5505c019e25b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f35b2c7a8d80c8d54fe367ac6b5505c019e25b0/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cattle feed ration in a ranch in Brazil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cattle feed ration in a ranch in Brazil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The IGSD paper, which was <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2123536119\">published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, showed the huge potential for “buying time” to change the world’s energy systems by concentrating on cutting methane, and other SLCPs including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/21/cutting-soot-emissions-arctic-ice-melt-climate-change\">soot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/kigali-amendment-little-noticed-treaty-could-help-delay-climate-catastrophe\">hydrofluorocarbons</a>, ground-level ozone and nitrous oxide.</p> <p>These substances contribute almost as much to global heating as CO<sub>2</sub>, according to the study, though most of them last only a short time in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Cutting CO<sub>2</sub> is still essential for the long term, but must be accompanied by strategies to reduce the levels of SLCPs. If not, then temperatures are likely to exceed 2C above pre-industrial levels, the upper limit set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, even if there are stiff cuts to CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions.</p> <p>Dreyfus said sharp cuts to methane and other SLCPs could result in temperatures lower by 0.26C by 2050, which is almost four times greater than the benefit of pursuing CO<sub>2</sub> cuts alone, which the scientists estimated would result in temperature cuts of 0.07C by 2050.</p> <p>She said: “These non-CO<sub>2</sub> targeted measures when combined with decarbonisation can provide net cooling by 2030, reduce the rate of warming from 2030 to 2050 by about 50%, roughly half of which comes from methane, significantly larger than decarbonisation alone over this timeframe.”</p> <p>The paper found the importance of “non-carbon dioxide pollutants” had been “underappreciated by scientists and policymakers alike and largely neglected in efforts to combat climate change”.</p> <p>Last year, before the Cop26 climate summit, the US and the EU launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/17/us-and-eu-pledge-30-cut-in-methane-emissions-to-limit-global-heating\">global pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030</a>, to which more than 100 governments responsible for more than half of those emissions are now committed.

She had already achieved what once felt impossible, rehabilitating from drug and alcohol addiction to continue a hugely successful career with Glasgow City, but now she had to do it all again. A relapse, brought on by the loneliness of Covid-19 lockdowns, had culminated in more suicidal thoughts and a high‑profile 10-hour police search that found her in Edinburgh.</p> <p>Living with 19 other patients inside the Nairn ward, a mental health unit at Glasgow’s Stobhill hospital, she could not let go of the thought that her chance of recovery had passed. “I felt like I was finished,” she says. “I thought I was done: that this is it for me, I can’t progress or move on from it, it’s taken over my whole life.

On Sunday, Shine will be part of the City side that faces Celtic in the Scottish Women’s Cup final and nobody should be surprised if she applies the decisive flourish once again. She scored a hat-trick in the 2015 final and a last-minute winner four years later, both times having cast aside personal demons. “I’ve learned to enjoy the moment as much as I can,” she says, and the very fact of being back out there is a marvel.</p> <p>Shine is chatting in the lobby of a Glasgow hotel, which might not be the way most sportspeople would wish to spend their 27th birthday. She has been joking with her teammates that she is in fact still 24 and points out, more seriously, that several years of a young life were effectively lost to addiction; listening to her talk, though, is to hear an older and wiser voice. Shine has known more highs and desperate lows than most will experience over an average lifetime and wants people to take inspiration from her journey.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I didn’t want to play football, I knew there was a serious problem</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That is why she has written a book, Scoring Goals in the Dark, partly drawn from a series of diaries she has kept since the age of 15. There are few such resources available to young footballers, and girls in particular: in a relentless sporting environment, where there sometimes appears little option but to bottle things up, the darkness can take over indiscriminately.</p> <p>“Trying to speak about it was so difficult because of the stigma,” she says. “I was in a professional environment, playing in the Champions League, and found myself in the depths of an addiction. I had no one to turn to as I thought people would look down on me, judge me for it, and I had lost a lot of respect from people as well. Being in the public eye while intoxicated was something I didn’t even think twice about in that moment.”</p> <p>Her book tells the story of a gifted all-rounder who played for her native Cork in the all Ireland camogie final – a variant of hurling played by women – as a teenager. “There’s no way that, lining up in that game at Croke Park, I’d have thought that I’d be an alcoholic or addicted to drugs five or six years later,” she says. “I’d never have associated myself with any of that. It’s just wild, the way things can turn out if you don’t look after yourself.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6d682afa6131cd25dd0ae797f65ceaa62314649c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d682afa6131cd25dd0ae797f65ceaa62314649c/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clare Shine said she lost lifelong friendships due to her addictions but is starting to rebuild those relationships now.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clare Shine said she lost lifelong friendships due to her addictions but is starting to rebuild those relationships now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A natural goalscorer, Shine settled on football and excelled with Raheny United before joining City for the first time in 2015, becoming a full international shortly afterwards. But alcohol was already playing too heavy a role for a player who became obsessed with finding highs that could match those felt on the pitch: months before moving to Scotland she had been hiding a problem that led to training sessions being missed and matches being dragged through in a haze; she would have panic attacks too and eventually sought help at Cork’s Pieta clinic for people in distress. “I was so good at hiding how I felt,” she says. “But as my addiction got worse it became harder to do that, because I was turning up to games where it was very visible.”</p> <p>Shine believes the book’s contents will shock some who were close to her. It pulls no punches in describing occasions when she was embarrassed in public, including drunken trips to watch Ireland play when she was injured, and lays out in detail the harm caused when her problems continued in Scotland. Her apartment became known as the “party flat”; homesickness did not help and she returned to Ireland, falling out of the game for a while before resurfacing with Cork City, who bore witness to her illness at first hand and arranged for her to visit an alcohol and drug rehabilitation centre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65e6d33d30c458ab286724a5d224a3bf2b7abece\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65e6d33d30c458ab286724a5d224a3bf2b7abece/0_0_2915_510/1000.png\" alt=\"Women’s football graphic Moving the Goalposts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"175\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter!</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our new women’s football newsletter\">  <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>“I just thought it was a phase, normal for people at my age,” she says. “I couldn’t differentiate between it being an addiction or me going through a certain period in my life.

I wasn’t trustworthy, you couldn’t rely on me for anything.

The fact she was back in Scotland to decide the 2019 final against Hibernian less than a year later, having been offered a return to Glasgow by their manager, Scott Booth, is utterly remarkable. So is the fact that, having relapsed in June 2020, she has reached that level once again now. Higher, too: Shine returned to the Ireland squad last summer before scoring for City in the Champions League against Servette in September.</p> <p>Coming back has not been entirely smooth, although she cannot praise Booth and the club enough for their care. “There was a period towards the end of last season where I was like: ‘I can’t continue, no way, I need to put myself first and do something else’,” she says. “I just felt I couldn’t reach all the demands. I got quite worked up about it but learned that you can manage things better and strike a balance. I’d run through a brick wall for this club but you need to do what’s best for you too. Pre-season went well, though, and that goal in the Champions League was a turning point for me. I thought: ‘I can definitely still do this sport.’”</p> <p>That is beyond question. Shine’s achievement, along with the clarity and candour with which she is able to describe events that are still very recent and raw, is extraordinary. “There’s obviously stuff I still have to work on and manage that may never go away,” she says. Routine is very important; so is resolution and she has recently begun talking with her mother, whose loving attempts to tame a near-impossible situation are addressed in the book, about everything they went through and the associated feelings of guilt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7bd34a434068f899b689ddb60918263d2157305f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bd34a434068f899b689ddb60918263d2157305f/0_0_1000_1500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Front cover of book “Scoring Goals in the Dark” by Clare Shine (with Gareth Maher).\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Now she can see a clear future for herself on and off the pitch, perhaps as a public speaker where the latter is concerned.

And it is in this spirit that he’s back in Cannes with this sensational black-widow noir romance, featuring a glorious leading turn from the Chinese star Tang Wei, who has bettered her iconic performance in Ang Lee’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jan/04/worldcinema.drama3\">2007 spy drama Lust, Caution</a>. She is effortlessly charismatic and (that overworked word) mesmeric; sexual but reserved, strong, capable, intimidatingly smart but bearing a poignant and unacknowledged emotional wound. And the intelligence and live-wire energy she brings to her relationship with the film’s leading man, Park Hae-il, is a marvel.</p> <p>The tension and the intrigue, the grandstanding emotional confrontations, the ingenious use of mobile phone technology (which so often stymies modern-day thrillers), the stylish set pieces, including a fantastic rooftop chase, and the deliciously manipulative plot twists are very Hitchcockian in their way. But the style is not pastiche, which is the way that idea usually arises; this is the kind of Hitchcockian film made by someone who hasn’t necessarily seen a Hitchcock film before.</p> <p>The setting is Busan where a cop called Hae-Joon is struggling with an unsolved murder case featuring a couple of known hoodlum suspects, one of whom resists arrest and gets a ferocious beating from Hae-Joon who then thoughtfully comments that this guy was not tough enough to be the villain he’s looking for. Hae-Joon is sort-of-happily married to Jung-an (Lee Jung-hyun), but he’s longing for the cigarettes she won’t let him smoke and is suffering from insomnia, which means that he takes surveillance and stake-out jobs because he can’t sleep anyway. Then a puzzling new case electrifies him. The smashed body of a climber is found at the foot of a well-known climbing rock. Did he fall? Did he take his own life? Or did someone push him?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s91GMZ097RM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s91GMZ097RM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On the man’s mobile phone the police find sinister photos of a woman’s beaten and bruised body. And his beautiful wife, Seo-rae (Tang Wei), instantly captivates Hae-Joon with her dignity and reserve. She is a caregiver who is loved by the old people she tends to, and the Korean patriot in Hae-jun is moved by her personal story: Seo-rae came to Korea as an illegal, passionate about Korea as the homeland of her grandfather who was a soldier in the nation’s defence against Japan in the 1930s. Seo-rae has an alibi for the time of death, but as the circumstantial evidence mounts against her, Hae-Joon begins to fall deeply in love with this woman, who appears also to be falling for him, her protector.</p> <p>Is Hae-Joon going to cover up for Seo-rae? Is she all that she appears to be? Well, audiences might think they broadly know the answers to both those questions, but the script by Park and Chung Seo-Kyung keeps you off-balance at every turn, periodically hitting you with new characters and fresh developments that you have to wait to understand. But each new scene had me propped further forward on my seat – further still for the second and then the third act – and Cho Young-Wuk’s musical score forthrightly ratchets up the fear. And in every corner of the detective’s life he finds a variation on a single question: at what point do you decide your marriage isn’t working? When do you know that you are in love? What will trigger the decision to leave? It’s a gorgeously and grippingly made picture and Tang Wei is magnificent.</p> <p>• Decision to Leave screens at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/cannesfilmfestival\">Cannes film festival</a>.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/23/queen-arrives-in-buggy-to-tour-gardens-at-chelsea-flower-show","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T18:06:05Z","webTitle":"Queen arrives in buggy to tour gardens at Chelsea flower show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/queen-arrives-in-buggy-to-tour-gardens-at-chelsea-flower-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/queen-arrives-in-buggy-to-tour-gardens-at-chelsea-flower-show","fields":{"headline":"Queen arrives in buggy to tour gardens at Chelsea flower show","trailText":"The monarch was chauffeured around the Royal Horticultural Society event in London","body":"<p>After two years of disruption the Chelsea flower show returned to its traditional May slot, with the Queen dropping in as guest of honour ahead of its opening to the public on Tuesday.</p> <p>The 96-year-old monarch arrived in a buggy to tour the Royal Horticultural Society’s showpiece event.</p> <p>Confirmation that the Queen, who has been experiencing mobility problems, would be attending came shortly before her arrival at the event at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London.

I’ve got my diary open.</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: Actually, what I’d like to happen is for you to put the phone down and then call me back in a couple of days with a time and date.</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: Why? It seems utterly pointless.</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: It’s so I can pretend that it was you who asked for the meeting. That way it looks as if I’m not trying to interfere in your report. Which I’m not, obviously.</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: Obviously. Well, actually I’m going to tell the truth …</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: Why would anyone want to do that?</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: … which is that you were the one who asked for a meeting.</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: There’s no need to play politics.</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: You’re doing my head in. You can save that crap for the Daily Mail. And for your useful idiots – Nadhim Zahawi and Simon Clarke come to mind – who will be sent out on the media round to tell your “true story” about our meeting that will fall apart within hours.</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: I’ll take my chances …</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: Mmm. I wonder who everyone will believe. Me or you and your ministers? That’s a toughie. Are you sure you don’t want to have a rethink? Thought not. So what do you want?</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: It’s like this … the Met have just told me they are about to conclude their investigations into the No 10 parties and I’m going to get off almost totally scot-free.</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: So how did you manage that? Did you pay a bribe?</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: I didn’t need to! Though Tory donors were all lined up to fork out if necessary. It turned out the police weren’t that interested in the investigation once they were told to bugger off and stop bothering me. Just had to write “no comment” on my questionnaire. So I got away with just the one fine for the party that was hardly a party and the Old Bill just fined a whole lot of junior staff to make it look like they had done something.</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: What now then?</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: We need to talk timings …</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: No we don’t. Because we’ve already agreed the timings. Once the police have concluded their investigation, I publish the report soon after.</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: Not those timings. The timings of some of my appearances at the parties. To make it look as if I just dropped in. Like you would for a work event. Which the parties definitely were.</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: You really don’t get it, do you? I can’t be nobbled.</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: Come on, Sue. Be a sport. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/22/aukus-row-boris-johnson-tells-france-donnez-moi-un-break\">Donnez-moi un break</a></em> as President Macron might say.

It was just my luck that my face was the only one in the photos that wasn’t blurred.</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: I think you’ll find ITV News has already got hold of those.</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: What about some of the others then? Surely we can come to a deal over them? I don’t mind you publishing pics of No 10 staffers, but I’d rather you kept me out of it. And definitely not the one where I’m doing vodka shots and breaking Wilf’s swing. Carrie still doesn’t know that was me. I told her it was Party Marty. Plus if you could avoid the ones where people are throwing up, that would be a help. We don’t want the public to think it was one long Ibiza rave during lockdown.</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: You don’t get it, do you? You disgust me. You tell lies to the country and parliament and get away with it time and again. And you’ll probably get away with it again. The police might have been craven halfwits, but I’m not. So I’m going to publish everything. The photos clearly show you attended multiple parties in Downing Street and the public deserves to know the truth.</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: Anyone can be ambushed by six bottles of wine, a bottle of gin and a bowlful of crisps. So don’t be like this. We’ve all had a drink …</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: We haven’t actually.</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: OK, then can you just tone down some of your remarks in the introduction? Make it sound like there was clear, sober leadership at No 10 and that it was just a few junior members of staff who were breaking the rules. Over and over again. And the only reason it kept happening was that I was so busy going to work events that I didn’t notice. In fact we were all working so hard, no one can blame us if things got a wee bit lively. I’m sure the same was going on in hospitals where the doctors and nurses were knocking back the hand sanitiser.</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: Have you finished yet?</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: Not quite. It’s taken as read there’s going to be fall guys in all this. So if you could finger Simon Case for me, that would be a big help.

As will you, if you play your cards right …</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: We’re done now.</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: Just for the record, this meeting never happened.</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: It’s bound to leak …</p> <p><strong>Johnson</strong>: In which case it’s a public meeting that was so above board, its contents have to remain secret.</p> <p><strong>Gray</strong>: Goodbye, prime minister.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/23/the-guardian-view-on-childrens-social-care-a-heartbreaking-market","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T18:01:12Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on children’s social care: a heartbreaking market | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/the-guardian-view-on-childrens-social-care-a-heartbreaking-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/the-guardian-view-on-childrens-social-care-a-heartbreaking-market","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on children’s social care: a heartbreaking market","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> The system is in crisis and profiteering providers are making it worse. The case for reform could hardly be clearer","body":"<p>There are 80,000 children in the care of local authorities in England. At the current rate of growth of 2% a year, the figure will be 100,000 in a decade. If removing more and more children from their families was producing good results in terms of preventing harm, and setting them up for life, that would be one thing. The truth is that while there are positive experiences of care, and inspirational stories of people who overcome tough beginnings to build successful lives, far too many are repeatedly failed. Care-experienced people face some of the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/children-social-care-review-england-communities\" title=\"\">severe disadvantages</a> of any section of the population. Overrepresented among homeless people and in the criminal justice system, they also suffer from worse health, education and employment outcomes than almost any other group.</p> <p>This is the moral and social case for reforming the children’s social care system, the rising cost of which is also placing huge pressure on councils. A <a href=\"https://childrenssocialcare.independent-review.uk/\" title=\"\">review</a> promised in the Conservative party’s 2019 manifesto, and prepared over the past year by Josh MacAlister, makes no bones about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/23/overhaul-of-childrens-social-care-in-england-urgent-and-unavoidable-review-finds\" title=\"\">extent of the dysfunction</a> – or the role of the private sector in exacerbating it. While local authorities have faced an ever-tightening squeeze on budgets over the past decade, the private providers that control 83% of the residential care market <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/06/the-guardian-view-on-privatised-childrens-services-deregulation-failures\" title=\"\">have been cashing in</a>. Profit margins averaged 22.6% in 2016-20, and the Competition and Markets Authority believes that fostering is on a similar trajectory, with a handful of providers increasingly dominant.</p> <p>Mr MacAlister is right to state that, like state education, looking after children <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/16/private-children-home-bosses-iengland-criticised-huge-profits\" title=\"\">should be organised not around a profit</a> motive but an ethic of care. The duty of councils, as set out in the Children Act 1989, is to “make such use of services available for children cared for by their own parents as appears ... reasonable”. Children in care, in other words, should be treated like other children. Rather than nationalise existing children’s homes, or cap their profits, Mr MacAlister wants councils to band together and squeeze them out by rebuilding their own services or, if they prefer, commissioning not-for-profit ones.</p> <p>Of course this and other proposed improvements will cost money. The review suggests a budget of £2.6bn over four years, some of which could be raised from a windfall tax on providers. Given ministers’ reluctance to tax energy giants’ profits, the chances of them doing this seem small. But the review comes with a warning that unless they do something the situation – and cost – will spiral out of control.</p> <p>To reduce demand, the review’s key proposal is a new community support system called “family help”. If early intervention were to be boosted, it suggests, 30,000 children who would otherwise end up in care could live safely with their families. Also recommended is a new focus on kinship networks, and payment of allowances. Other suggestions include the welcome one of shifting responsibility for youth offending from the Ministry of Justice to the Department for Education.</p> <p>So far, signs that the government will respond constructively are not good. The education secretary, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fundamental-shift-in-childrens-social-care-set-out\" title=\"\">Nadhim Zahawi</a>, said on Monday that a full response would take months. The report notes the strong connection between economic deprivation and child abuse and neglect. The reality ministers cannot hide from is that to reduce the risks facing vulnerable families, poverty needs to be reduced. Mr MacAlister is right to refer to the life chances of care-experienced people as a pressing issue of civil rights. It is good that their views and voices are listened to more than in the past. But while councils’ resources are stretched to breaking point, and ministers refuse to raise benefits, life for these unlucky children is unlikely to get better.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/may/23/burnley-may-face-bleak-future-unless-right-calls-are-made-in-critical-summer","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T18:00:42Z","webTitle":"Burnley fans fear bleak future with players leaving and debts to repay | Will Unwin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/23/burnley-may-face-bleak-future-unless-right-calls-are-made-in-critical-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/may/23/burnley-may-face-bleak-future-unless-right-calls-are-made-in-critical-summer","fields":{"headline":"Burnley fans fear bleak future with players leaving and debts to repay","trailText":"The relegated club need a new manager and will lose several players this summer, but keeping their captain Ben Mee is crucial","body":"<p>Certainties at Turf Moor are few and far between.

Parachute payments will help soften the blow but they will need to reconfigure finances to make the club sustainable.</p> <p>On the playing side of things, a recruitment drive will be required to replace departing players. Of those whose deals expire, James Tarkowski will definitely leave and talks with long-serving captain Ben Mee will now take place over extending his 10-year stay at the club. Matej Vydra is another who could be persuaded to re-sign but Ashley Barnes, Phil Bardsley, Jack Cork, Aaron Lennon, Erik Pieters and Dale Stephens might need to look elsewhere.</p> <p>Due to the disappointing nature of the season, few in the Burnley ranks will fetch a high price. Nick Pope will be the most expensive due to his impressive form to keep Burnley within touching distance of safety and Maxwel Cornet will attract interest thanks to a £17.5m release clause. Nathan Collins looked a Premier League player after deputising for Mee and Tarkowski for lengthy periods, while Dwight McNeil showed flashes of his talent after being reinvigorated following Sean Dyche’s sacking.</p> <p>Ensuring Mee stays is of the utmost importance for Burnley. He is a figurehead for the club, becoming the key middleman when asked to join the interim coaching staff for the final fling. Mee knows what makes the squad tick and was passing on information to Mike Jackson, seeing immediate improvements from players such as McNeil. The players look up to him and seek his advice on professional and personal matters. Burnley might need an overhaul but keeping their captain can help build a future.</p> <p>This leads to a problem for a club who are not known for their recruitment, rarely dipping their toes into the market during Dyche’s final years in charge. To completely overhaul an ageing squad with a strategy focused on signing younger players and with one eye on the overseas market is tricky, especially with an unknown budget available to whoever comes in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b61023a12f6970f998bb54c72ed35ee3ff7a2fae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b61023a12f6970f998bb54c72ed35ee3ff7a2fae/65_129_3418_2052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Mee (centre) is a figurehead at Burnley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Mee (centre) is a figurehead at Burnley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Klein/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without a manager, however, it is even harder to plan for the future. They need to know what type of players are required to fit the style of play demanded. Relegation will require a reset of the level of candidate Burnley can attract to Turf Moor. Anderlecht’s Vincent Kompany and Bodø/Glimt’s Kjetil Knutsen have both been targeted but are unlikely to desire the challenge of returning Burnley to the Premier League at the first time of asking. Regardless of who is put in charge, a quick decision is imperative.</p> <p>Few anticipate Jackson being offered the manager’s role on a permanent basis. The caretaker earned 11 points from his eight games in charge but that was not enough to keep Burnley up. He revitalised a stale squad in the short term but it is likely the club will make an external appointment, even if they miss out on their preferred targets.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/feb/02/burnley-us-takeover-has-left-club-90m-worse-off-and-loaded-with-debt\" title=\"\">ALK’s leveraged buyout of Burnley</a> put £65m of debt on the club that needs paying off. When Huddersfield went down they assigned their parachute payments to a bank loan debt, although their Championship finishes of 18th and 20th in the two seasons after relegation from the Premier League will not fill Burnley fans with confidence.</p> <p>Even if the parachute payments are utilised to pay the loan debt, there is still likely to be a financial shortfall. That will probably need to be made up by player sales. Huddersfield sold Philip Billing and Aaron Mooy following relegation, replacing them with cheaper options and bringing in a large number of players on loan over the course of the season. Huddersfield and Burnley are comparative in terms of size of club and stadium. When Huddersfield were relegated their revenue went from £119.1m in the 2018-19 season to £52.7m the following year, a sign of the financial situation Burnley will have to deal with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A new business structure has been put in place by ALK, including some impressive hiring from the club.

It will have been a simple decision, because rolling over at 170p a share, or £2.1bn, would be humiliating. Even some of the bears who used to get stuck into THG in the days of a 600p-plus share price thought fair value for this baffling group might lie around the 175p level.</p> <p>What, though, would Moulding do if a serious bid – which a few in the City define as one around 250p a share – were to turn up? Such a plotline looks unlikely (as the current share price of 139p indicates), but the working assumption is that he’d be tempted by the idea of going private. He spoke of “options” in the infamous interview with GQ magazine last year in which he said listing in London “sucked from start to finish”.</p> <p>If so, Moulding should remember that the grass is not always greener elsewhere. If the private route were intended as an excursion on the way to a US listing, he should note that American markets – the ones he eyed enviously – have subsequently clobbered the value of almost every “pre-profit” tech stock.</p> <p>Second, going public in London hasn’t been so awful for THG, all things considered; the company raised £920m of fresh equity at listing in 2020 and then another £800m exactly a year ago via a placing that brought in SoftBank and investment firm Sofina. The public markets, in other words, set him up with the resources to prove there’s a real long-term business within THG.</p> <p>Third, if he doesn’t like the wicked short-sellers found in public markets, a return to private ownership may not be a picnic either. Yes, THG inhabited that private equity world before its float at 500p, but that was an era of cheap cash and punchy investment appetites. Life, and private investors’ short-term demands, have moved on.</p> <p>Moulding should count his blessings: stock-market life is bumpy, but he retains enormous freedom to manage the business as he wishes. The private option might just load another layer of uncertainty on to the company.</p> <h2>Home improvement chain gets house in order</h2> <p>Depending on how you read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/23/bq-kingfisher-inflation-diy-demand-sales-covid\">the first-quarter numbers</a>, B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher’s power drill is either on the blink or working splendidly. Welcome to investors’ difficulty: how to assess the current strength of consumer demand when Covid trading conditions have distorted comparisons.</p> <p>At B&amp;Q itself, for example, sales were a thumping 18% below the same period a year ago, which feels a lot even when one remembers the whoosh in those months from working-from-home factors. On the other hand, B&amp;Q’s like-for-like revenues were 16% better than in the last equivalent pre-Covid quarter, so maybe there has been real underlying progress.</p> <p>Kingfisher’s chief executive, Thierry Garnier, did his best to encourage the cheery interpretation by describing demand as “resilient” and saying inflationary and supply chain pressures were being managed “effectively”. More to the point, he’s sticking to the previous profit forecast of £770m this year and threw a £300m share buy-back into the mix for good measure. The positive turnaround in the two French businesses – Castorama and Brico Dépôt – is clearly helping.</p> <p>The shares, though, have fallen by a third since the start of this year in anticipation of the day when the cost of living squeeze hits sales of kitchens and bathrooms. At that point, say the bears, we’ll be talking again about how Kingfisher is a “big box” retailer in a digital age.</p> <p>It will probably be six months, at least, before a clearer picture emerges. But one can probably say this already: the group is gaining market share in most places and looks a nimbler beast now that Garnier has reversed his predecessor’s obsession with centralisation. Kingfisher won’t be able to defy a storm in DIY-land, but it looks a net winner from the pandemic.</p> <h2>Publishing pay ratios won’t narrow the pay gap</h2> <p>Sadly, the disclosure of pay ratios between FTSE 350 chief executives and their workers, as required by Theresa May’s government, was never accompanied by an obligation on boards to feel shame.

That status was confirmed last week when US conservatives staged a special conference in Budapest, the centrepiece of which was an <a href=\"https://abouthungary.hu/speeches-and-remarks/speech-by-prime-minister-viktor-orban-at-the-opening-of-cpac-hungary\" title=\"\">address</a> by the newly re-elected prime minister. Speaking to the conference theme of “God, homeland, family”, the self-styled standard bearer for “illiberal democracy” did not hold back. Delegates were told that “ideologically trained bureaucrats” in Washington and Brussels – in cahoots with progressive liberals and “neo-Marxists” – were seeking to undermine traditional western values. Mr Orbán then outlined the strategy taken in Hungary to eradicate this threat. “The first point in the Hungarian formula,” he said, “is to play by our own rules.”</p> <p>In that spirit, Mr Orbán’s Hungary has flouted the democratic norms of European Union membership for years. On issues relating to corruption, the independence of the media, asylum and LGBTQ+ rights, Budapest has flatly ignored EU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/07/eu-urged-suspend-funds-hungary-breaches-rule-of-law-viktor-orban\" title=\"\">objections</a> to its actions. Mr Orbán has made domestic political capital from waging a culture war against Brussels, even as Hungary <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ca265c0-d1d1-4acf-bc9e-b208dab98293\" title=\"\">accessed</a> billions of pounds worth of EU regional aid. As he trolls the EU ever more brazenly from within and gives masterclasses to America’s “alt-right”, what can Brussels do about it?</p> <p>Up to now, despite a plethora of legal manoeuvres, the answer to that question has been not much. In 2018, the European parliament voted to pursue disciplinary action against Hungary under <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eut/teu/article/7\" title=\"\">article 7 of the EU treaty</a>, which is designed to protect the union’s fundamental values. But despite another Brussels hearing on the subject on Monday,matters have proceeded at a snail’s pace. Last month, the European Commission <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/rule-of-law/154810\" title=\"\">accused</a> Hungary of “continuous breaches” of anti-corruption rules, triggering a formal process that could lead to the withholding of funds. But though the move was acclaimed by MEPs, this is likely to be a similarly drawn-out process.</p> <p>The war in Ukraine has now complicated matters, giving Mr Orbán new leverage as the EU seeks to present a united front against Vladimir Putin. Hungary is the only member state refusing to sign up to a ban on Russian oil imports, despite concessions allowing it until 2024 to organise alternatives. Any eventual agreement is likely to come at a high price financially, in terms of assistance, and politically. As Lithuania’s foreign minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/hungary-sanctions-russian-oil-embargo-eu\" title=\"\">put it last week</a>, “the whole union is being held hostage by one member state”.</p> <p>For now, as the EU seeks to unite in the face of urgent geopolitical threats, it may have to put up with Mr Orbán’s efforts to undermine it from within. But a reckoning must surely come with a leader who holds its rules – and the values that inform them – in contempt. In theory, the article 7 process could lead to the suspension of Hungary’s voting rights in the EU. Almost certainly, there is neither the bandwidth nor the appetite in Brussels to go down that route, given current circumstances. But joining a club means playing by its rules, rather than your own. Sooner or later, there must be meaningful consequences for not doing so.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2022/may/23/justin-thomas-credits-caddie-bones-mackay-for-us-pga-comeback-win","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T17:55:51Z","webTitle":"Justin Thomas credits caddie ‘Bones’ Mackay for US PGA comeback win | Ewan Murray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/23/justin-thomas-credits-caddie-bones-mackay-for-us-pga-comeback-win","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/may/23/justin-thomas-credits-caddie-bones-mackay-for-us-pga-comeback-win","fields":{"headline":"Justin Thomas credits caddie ‘Bones’ Mackay for US PGA comeback win","trailText":"The playoff winner at Southern Hills credits Phil Mickelson’s former caddie for motivating him to fight back on day four","body":"<p>It remains unclear whether Phil Mickelson will emerge from exile when Greg Norman and his Saudi Arabian circus rumbles into Hertfordshire next month. Mickelson presumably has enough on his mind without contemplating the bitter irony of events at Southern Hills on Sunday. Nonetheless, to others it was striking that as Mickelson – the defending champion – sat at home in San Diego, a man once key to his success was instrumental in Justin Thomas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/23/justin-thomas-wins-pga-championship-golf-will-zalatoris\" title=\"\">claiming a second US PGA Championship</a>.</p> <p>Relations between Mickelson and Jim “Bones” Mackay are understood to be non-existent despite 25 years of professional association. Mackay was on the bag as Mickelson won five of his six major championships. Having stepped back from bag‑carrying duties and while working in television, Mackay decided privately that the only player for whom he would return to the game was Thomas. The call arrived last September; eight months on, Thomas has doubled his tally of major victories. “I think he has more shots than anyone on tour,” Mackay says of his employer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/21/tiger-woods-us-pga-golf\">Tiger Woods pulls out of US PGA to leave comeback plans in doubt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The admiration is mutual. Golfers can sometimes be reluctant to share credit at their highest moments. Not Thomas, who spoke of the heavy influence Mackay had in what was ultimately a playoff success over Will Zalatoris. Caddie and player had a heart to heart after Thomas shot 74 in the third round.</p> <p>“I just needed to let some steam out,” Thomas said. “I didn’t need to bring my frustration and anger home with me. I didn’t need to leave the golf course in a negative frame of mind. I played pretty well for shooting four over and I felt like I’d played terrible. And he was just like: ‘Dude, you’ve got to stop being so hard on yourself. You’re in contention every single week we’re playing.’</p> <p>“I’ve had a lot of chances to win tournaments and it’s a hard golf course. It’s a major championship. You don’t have to be perfect. Just don’t be hard on yourself. Just kind of let stuff happen, and everything is trending in the right direction. So just keep staying positive so that good stuff can happen.</p> <p>“I left in an awesome frame of mind. I think I was the last player to leave. It was so peaceful. It was almost kind of eerie how beautiful it was outside and there’s not very many times after shooting four over on a Saturday of a major I left in as good a frame of mind as I did.”</p> <p>There was even adversity in round four. Thomas admitted he shanked his tee shot at the par‑three 6th, with the resultant bogey arguably the finest he has ever made.</p> <p>The 29‑year‑old’s strength of character was emphasised by the scoreboard. Of the top 40 players on it, nobody bettered Thomas’s 67. Only Tommy Fleetwood, who by his own admission did not believe he had a legitimate chance of winning the Wanamaker Trophy, matched it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b580bc7dc3cbae9a59985bc34350baee21730dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b580bc7dc3cbae9a59985bc34350baee21730dc/0_0_5223_3482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Thomas of the United States poses with the Wanamaker Trophy after beating Will Zalatoris in a playoff to win during the final round of the 2022 USPGA Championship at Southern Hills Country Club on May 22, 2022 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Thomas poses with the Wanamaker Trophy after beating Will Zalatoris in a playoff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thomas was among those to have sympathy for Mito Pereira, the Chilean who held a one-stroke lead on the final tee of regulation play. Pereira’s cruel double bogey meant he did not even qualify for the playoff but his upbeat, candid performance in front of the cameras thereafter earned him a lot of new fans. Pereira also has the consolation of jumping inside the world’s top 50, from an earlier position of 100th. “You want to win a golf tournament,” Thomas says. “You don’t want someone to lose it.</p> <p>“Not exactly like that, but I have had times in my career when I feel like I’ve let a tournament get away. And I mean, it’s brutal. It’s not fun. But at the same time if you’re able to channel that, look back at it later or whenever the time is having calmed down and when reflecting, he’ll be able to learn from it and be better from it.</p> <p>“I know that down the road, whether it’s this year or years to come, if he’s standing on 18 with a one-shot lead in a major, he’s going to feel more comfortable because he’s going to draw on this experience. He played unbelievable golf this week. There’s no reason to hang his head.”</p> <p>Zalatoris insisted he is “close and super motivated” as he pursues a first main tour win. The good news is he will have an opportunity in three weeks’ time, as the US Open lands in Boston. Thomas will arrive there seeking to join his close friend Jordan Spieth on three major titles. In Mackay, he has a vital ally.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/23/biden-taiwan-china-strategic-ambiguity-us-foreign-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T17:54:42Z","webTitle":"Biden’s Taiwan vow creates confusion not clarity – and raises China tensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/23/biden-taiwan-china-strategic-ambiguity-us-foreign-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/23/biden-taiwan-china-strategic-ambiguity-us-foreign-policy","fields":{"headline":"Biden’s Taiwan vow creates confusion not clarity – and raises China tensions","trailText":"President’s blunt response appears to undercut US ‘strategic ambiguity’ on Taiwan as White House forced to walk back remarks","body":"<p>The somewhat routine press conference in Tokyo was winding down when the question came. “Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?”</p> <p>Many past American presidents would have deflected, demurred, declined to give a straight answer.

While the US is required by law to provide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/taiwan\">Taiwan</a> with the means to defend itself, it has never directly promised to intervene militarily in a conflict with China – but also never promised to stay out.</p> <p>This deliberate vagueness has – so far – helped deter China from invading Taiwan while also helping deter the self-ruled island from declaring full independence. Either scenario would trigger a major geopolitical crisis.</p> <p>Last year, Kurt Campbell, the US policy coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, defended the principle of strategic ambiguity, saying there were “significant downsides” to “strategic clarity”.</p> <p>But Biden has already shown himself less comfortable with shades of grey than his predecessors, insisting on a full withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/afghanistan-us-withdrawal-defeat-watchdog-report-sigar\">despite the ensuing chaos and collapse</a> than enabled the Taliban to regain power. He has also been pushing the envelope on Taiwan for some time.</p> <p>In an ABC News interview last August, he appeared to put Taiwan in the same category as other countries <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-22/biden-says-united-states-would-come-to-taiwans-defence/100560522\">with which Washington has explicit defence commitments</a>, such as South Korea.<br><br>Then, in October, the president told a CNN town hall, “Yes, we have a commitment to do that,” when asked if the US would come to the defence of Taiwan.

Better to embrace it as new US stance, one that is fully consistent with one-China policy but that alters how US will go about implementing it.”</p> <p>Glaser, of the the German Marshall Fund, added in a Twitter post: “A senior official from the Biden administration should give a comprehensive speech on US policy toward Taiwan.

But the numbers of people who have been chronically short of food in the world for decades are much higher than those stated in his article, because those are global averages based on unreliable data. Probably about 40% of the world’s inhabitants are food insecure.</p> <p>Globalisation of the food trade is the single most important reason for the growing hunger and poverty across the world. It removes agency from local people and places it in the hands of the giant food commodity and chemical seed companies, and the caprice of aid donors.

That can be overcome only once we have moved away from the globalisation of food to food sovereignty, particularly in the poorer parts of the world.</p> <p>Food sovereignty should be the aim of all official and private aid donors.

During the pandemic, progressives made the huge mistake of ceding the language of freedom to the right. Rather than offer alternatives to policies that systematically favoured the stay-at-home middle class, granted powers to the police that have been picked up in the policing, crime, sentencing and courts bill now belatedly opposed by progressives, and prevented us from being with family members as they drew their last breath, the left went along with it all.</p> <p>As a result, the word “libertarian” has been appropriated by small-state liberals. At one time, the left would have fought to recover the word for its own emancipatory project, the bedrock principle of which is that freedom is impossible without the security that can only be provided by the community acting in other-regarding concert. Nothing could be further from the fantasies of the libertarian right, which make a bonfire of the ties that bind people together in mutual aid.</p> <p>“It’s time for progressives to bite the bullet and start telling a story of our own,” Ellie Mae O’Hagan writes.

The backlash of the anti-woke mob was entirely predictable; many people are likely to be less receptive to progressive ideas or to addressing injustices if they have been on the receiving end of current “correct” ideology – for example, that they are inherently racist by virtue of their skin colour or transphobic if they insist on some acknowledgment of biological reality.</p> <p>All this is exploited by unpleasant sections of the rightwing media and the social media corporations that make their money by highlighting divisions and pitting people against each other.

Decisions in the defence end are clear cut with only five players named in the wider squad to be reduced to four before the Games begin. The issue in the mid-court is an over-supply of talent, with the Swifts’ Maddy Proud and the Magpies’ Kelsey Browne demanding selectors take notice despite sitting outside of the named squad.</p> <p>But it is at the shooting end where cracks are beginning to appear. Across the seven shooters in the 18-player squad, the only constant in the first 11 rounds of Super Netball has been inconsistency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/23/female-athletes-still-have-to-tread-a-hard-road-back-to-action-post-pregnancy\">Female athletes still have to tread a hard road back to action post-pregnancy | Megan Maurice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sunshine Coast Lightning captain Steph Wood has been named as vice-captain for her country, which suggests she will be the first lock at the shooting end. With 30 international caps under her belt, she has crucial experience for the team, but has played most of her best netball this season in wing attack. With Diamonds’ captain Liz Watson widely acknowledged as the world’s best wing attack, it is unlikely Wood will be required in this position in key matches. While she put in a good performance at goal attack on the weekend, overall she has the lowest percentage of all seven shooters in the squad, at just 71% accuracy and will need to increase her workload in the goal circle.</p> <p>Gretel Bueta is the other obvious choice in the circle and her form to begin the season was outstanding. However, as the fortunes of her Queensland Firebirds have unravelled, so too have Bueta’s performances. Her accuracy remains high – sitting at 87% for the season – but her high number of turnovers has been a concern. She gives away 5.36 turnovers per game and in the weekend’s loss to the Lightning she led her team in the turnover stat with seven across the match.</p> <p>However, Diamonds’ coach Stacey Marinkovich has shown a preference for Bueta in goal shooter, where her height, athleticism and accuracy are able to shine without providing as many opportunities for turnovers. With 40 international caps under her belt, Bueta is almost certain to make a resurgence in the Diamonds environment.</p> <p>The final two shooting spots are essentially a battle between five players who have a total of 14 international caps between them. Half of those caps belong to Wood’s Lightning teammate Cara Koenen, who is also the most accurate Australian shooter in the league at 89% for the season. But her team has been largely underwhelming this season and she has had limited opportunities to shine. With Bueta preferred at goal shooter, Koenen – who is slightly shorter and brings less flair and athleticism – may have to prove to selectors that she offers something different in that position.</p> <p>The other option at goal shooter – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/21/donnell-wallam-caps-netball-rise-with-australian-diamonds-commonwealth-games-call-up\">28-year-old rookie Donnell Wallam</a> – certainly brings something different to the squad. At 193cm she is the tallest of the seven shooters and the only one who exclusively plays a holding game. Her height and strength make her an imposing force in the goal circle. However, like Bueta her form has faded along with her Firebirds team. Of particular concern for Marinkovich would be her struggles against international goal keepers Geva Mentor (England) and Shamera Sterling (Jamaica) in recent weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"736ded4e7a6c4448023ad4e4c3a9edb1740205e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/736ded4e7a6c4448023ad4e4c3a9edb1740205e6/0_0_3455_2303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kiera Austin shoots during the Vixens’ game agains the Fever last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kiera Austin shoots during the Vixens’ game agains the Fever last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Worsfold/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/donnell-wallams-meteoric-rise-blazes-a-trail-for-indigenous-netball\">Donnell Wallam’s meteoric rise blazes a trail for Indigenous netball | Megan Maurice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Collingwood Magpies’ Sophie Garbin is also vying for a goal shooter role, however she has had limited court time this season, particularly in her preferred position, as Jamaica’s Shimona Nelson has been dominant for the Magpies in the circle. Garbin has mostly played goal attack and even in that position has not been able to find consistent court time, averaging just 39 minutes per game. Her ticket to Birmingham is looking increasingly flimsy as the season progresses.</p> <p>The Melbourne Vixens’ Kiera Austin was another who looked unlikely to be on the plane earlier in the season but has slowly worked her way into form after her return from an anterior cruciate ligament rupture. After the first two rounds, Austin has consistently put out 60 minutes on court and while her accuracy needs some improvement at 76%, her court craft and ability to adapt to different styles of shooting partner will make her a tempting option for selectors.</p> <p>The final option is the uncapped Giants Netball goal attack Sophie Dwyer. Known for her long shooting ability, the 20-year-old has improved her ability to perform under pressure since an underwhelming performance in the 2021 Super Netball grand final. At this stage she still appears to be an outside chance, but her fitness and accuracy (80%) mean she cannot be counted out.</p> <p>With only three rounds remaining in the Super Netball season and a number of these seven shooters likely to miss finals, the selectors will be keeping a close eye on the goal circles around the country in an effort to ensure Commonwealth Games gold makes its way home to the trophy cabinet after four long years.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2022/may/24/i-didnt-want-to-make-public-my-suffering-janine-mikosza-on-reinventing-the-trauma-memoir","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T17:30:43Z","webTitle":"‘I didn’t want to make public my suffering’: Janine Mikosza on reinventing the trauma memoir","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/24/i-didnt-want-to-make-public-my-suffering-janine-mikosza-on-reinventing-the-trauma-memoir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/may/24/i-didnt-want-to-make-public-my-suffering-janine-mikosza-on-reinventing-the-trauma-memoir","fields":{"headline":"‘I didn’t want to make public my suffering’: Janine Mikosza on reinventing the trauma memoir","trailText":"Having lived in 14 houses before she was 18, Mikosza’s Homesickness is a dialogue between two versions of herself, as she interrogates her past – and tests her memory","body":"<p>It’s a profoundly strange experience to interview Janine Mikosza immediately after reading her debut, Homesickness<em>.</em></p> <p>The book is<em> </em>a meditation on the nature of memory, truth and reckoning with past trauma – and it’s presented as one long conversation in which she interrogates herself.</p> <p>“I didn’t want to write a memoir,” shrugs Mikosza, who lives in Melbourne. “I didn’t want the exposure.

As Calle put it, finding a ‘place for my suffering’.”</p> <p>Cringing at the thought of first person, Mikosza pushed through everything she found personally excruciating about the form to write her memoir as a dialogue between two people: herself (Janine, the memoirist) and herself (Jin, the subject).</p> <p>“In memoir, there’s that split anyway: the present self, looking back at the past self. So this is a literal split.” Besides, she’s been talking to herself for years: “I talked to somebody else out loud all the time when I was growing up. It was a survivor strategy. Almost like an imaginary friend, but it’s me, a version of me … I still do it, sitting in the backyard.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0381630d9eff7087732d7f6472c253e8f1869f76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0381630d9eff7087732d7f6472c253e8f1869f76/0_0_3543_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of author Janine Mikosza at home in Melbourne, Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I talked to a version of myself out loud all the time when I was growing up.

It’s a bid to explore the long-held childhood trauma she experienced in some of them, which lives on in her mind and body.</p> <p>Included is a series of floorplans that Jin draws of each house, in advance of her return. Mikosza herself was excavating memories in real time as she wrote. “It was a test to see what I remembered … to map it all down. It also proved the fallibility of memory.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"726c804a7293887b351f3e05d2aff3764531d463\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/726c804a7293887b351f3e05d2aff3764531d463/0_0_2110_3296/640.jpg\" alt=\"CORROUX CIRCUIT HOUSE FLOOR PLAN drawn by Janine Mikosza, featured in her memoir Homesickness\" width=\"640\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drawing the floorplans before she revisited each house ‘proved the fallibility of memory’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Janine Mikosza</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so some rooms have been distorted – or blacked out – in her mind, by the memory of what went on inside them. Dark hallways loom large, a hidden chimney disappears and reappears, bathrooms are recoiled from.</p> <p>At times Jin’s suffering can be hard to read. She scoffs at the concept of writing trauma as therapeutic, quoting Sontag – writing is “like punching somebody” – and Ferrante – “twisting the knife in the wound”. But at other times the book is a gentle, almost teasing conversation between two women about the shifting nature of memory, the chaotic nature of pinning down trauma and the very long road to self-acceptance – or, in Jin’s case, trusting her own mind.</p> <p>Mikosza spent decades circling around her past in other ways, before finally committing to a book in 2013. Mikosza weaves this prior work – first as an artist, then as a researcher with a PhD in sociology – into her memoir, even pasting images of it in, where they join the floor plans almost like a scrapbook.</p> <p>There are photographs of a performance series she presented at aged 20, for instance, in which she blew up pictures of herself as a child, cut herself out of the life-sized prints and stepped through the holes. “It was like a scream then,” says Mikosza of her trauma. “It was very visceral and very raw. None of [it] was processed …</p> <p>“Now, with all the work I’ve done on myself – years of cycling through terrible therapists until finally hitting on a decent one, but also studying sociology – I was far more self-aware when writing this.”</p> <p>In conversation, Mikosza is searingly intelligent and well-read, referencing Roland Barthes, Maggie Nelson and Brian Castro off the cuff. But she’s also funny and self-deprecating (referring to her constant drafting process as returning to her own vomit) and all too cognisant of the fact that trauma is, well, so hot right now. As Jin contemplates in the book:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>I’d add to the literature on family violence piling up like dead bodies in bookstores. I’d return to my everyday struggle with the added burden of being called a memoirist. My life, not my work will be judged and reviewed.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Not only was Mikosza wary of how her memoir could be potentially packaged, she was acutely aware of the memoirist’s potential to inflict hurt.</p> <p>“Some memoirists just crash through, or some write to seek revenge ... But I wanted to approach it with kindness. I don’t want revenge on any of the people in the book. That’s why it took so long. I kept thinking, ‘How do I write this book without having any other people in it?’”</p> <p>In the book, Jin not only worries about hurting people from her past; she is also concerned about inflicting her story on strangers, even apologising to her therapist. “I was trying to turn it outwards again. I was interested in vicarious trauma. I interviewed therapists, and county court workers, and people who worked on the royal commissions [into family violence and the institutional responses to child sexual abuse]. I’m a researcher, that’s what I do, I interview people.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"415721d9cf2954a77e980cfb4853c3cd85113499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/415721d9cf2954a77e980cfb4853c3cd85113499/0_0_3543_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janine Mikosza included her art and floorplans in her memoir, like a scrapbook.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janine Mikosza included her art and floor plans in her memoir, like a scrapbook.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alana Holmberg/Oculi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Included in the book is an unflinching portrayal of Jin’s affair with “writer-man”. And yet Mikosza’s partner who she cheated on, the co-parent to her son, is the only person in the book to have their real name used. “Brett sat with it for a week. And he came back and he said, ‘No, print it all. I’m fine with it. It happened. I know it’s true. And I’m proud to be your partner.’”</p> <p>Mikosza’s questioning nature means she’s never quite ready to say<strong> </strong>“full stop here”. She wanted to leave uncertainty. “And the fact is it’s not over, it will never be over. I didn’t want a redemptive kind of repair arc. That’s not how trauma works – you carry it with you for a long time.</p> <p>“But despite all that, it feels finished. It is finished.

People my age have lived through so much: low-rise jeans, the film Batman &amp; Robin, boyfriends who broke up with us over MSN Messenger and the threatened return of low-rise jeans.</p> <p>(Opening with a gag is a millennial’s way of showing you how well she’s coping.)</p> <p>When I donned my Zoe Daniel T-shirt and voted against Tim Wilson on Saturday, I felt a familiar strain of misplaced optimism. I’ve been voting in Goldstein long enough to know it couldn’t possibly make a difference; it was impossible not to reflect on 2019, when our best efforts fell so far short. Standing in line at the polling booths, I once again drew on my depleted internal hope stores to find just a little more.</p> <p>Like other millennials, I’m compelled to keep trying against rhyme or reason.</p> <p>This is not a debate about which generation has it the hardest (it’s Gen X, the generation no one ever thinks about), but millennials are more depressed, more anxious and more burnt out than pretty much anyone else. More of us die “deaths of despair”. We’re lonelier, spend more time in therapy, and every few days the internet tells us we’re just being lazy.</p> <p>We can’t afford to buy homes unless our parents die. We’re proportionately underpaid and overworked, while pop culture tells us we’re lazy. We’re about to get reamed by inflation. We’re dealing with mounting debt, choosing between parenthood and sparing children from All This, criminally low minimum wages and welfare that’s below the poverty line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Australia weekend\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&link=true&link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Also, we will be devoured by climate change, while also being too young to have been able to make a measurable difference while it still counted.</p> <p>Caught between a generation that didn’t talk about its feelings and a generation that only talks about its feelings, we were raised on junk pseudo-psychology. We’ve been directed to find hope from within – as my friend Kaitlyn worded it, to “spin hope out of thin air”. We find comfort in content about how depressed everyone is. We’re subjected to endless affirmations, Instagram posts that remind us that it’s our fault if we feel bad, instructions to manage our own emotions, take deep breaths, learn to sit with the horror that is the reality of our futures.</p> <p>Year after year, we watch people who won’t be here make decisions on our behalf about the burning planet we will inherit, and then we get up the next morning and read some memes and laugh so we forget to think about deforestation. Our friendships are based in a common mortal suffering: in it together, commiserating the impending loss of everyone we love to climate disaster, geopolitical unrest, hate, poverty, despair.</p> <p>Therapists – if we can find an appointment – help us to ignore how awful everything is and keep going anyway. The media we consume is designed to distract and divert us – watching the same comfort TV, immersed in virtual worlds, swapping tiles on mobile games, tweeting until our internet gets shut off – so we can cope just well enough to stop plummeting into existential grief.</p> <p>I know everyone is tired, but hear me when I say: millennials are <em>tired</em>.</p> <p>But waking up on Sunday morning, still in a wondrous stupor/chocolate hangover after election night, I felt something new. A tiny brightness. A feeling sitting somewhere between hope and relief.</p> <p>Not because I necessarily think the Albanese government will drive real change (they still have to prove it) or because there are any real climate policies to speak of (though maybe the indies will draw them out) or because I’m naïve enough to believe it will all be different now (lol). What I felt was a general lightness. A weight had been lifted.</p> <p>I pondered this while I watched my gym membership payment come out of my account because I don’t have the energy to cancel it.</p> <p>What made <em>this</em> hope significant?</p> <p>I think it might be this: the hope is external.</p> <p>In the lead-up to this election, rightwing politics and the media that supports it said nothing would change. They gloated that teal independents had no chance, that bigotry was inevitable and that women would do what they were told.</p> <p>So, we did what we always do, which is to scrape the lining of our internal organs for the last remaining fibres of a reason to keep moving forward. We voted.</p> <p>And things changed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/stoking-fear-and-hatred-held-the-coalition-in-power-finally-australia-had-enough\">Stoking fear and hatred held the Coalition in power – finally Australia had enough | David Marr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not in the way they have been changing.

Here is the inside word on their favourite techniques and tools.</p> <h2>Sew it up</h2> <p>If you were hoping for a magic wand, this may be a disappointing insider tip: Amy Campbell, features writer for Vogue and GQ Australia, swears by keeping a needle and thread handy.</p> <p>“Every time I visit a hotel that has a baby sewing kit as part of its amenities offering, I pocket it,” she says. This way, if she ever needs to “sew on a button or quickly stitch a hem” she has different coloured threads and needles to choose from.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c1fbad0ac3365df0153c85906ee139d88fa4d782\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1fbad0ac3365df0153c85906ee139d88fa4d782/289_1406_1699_2123/800.jpg\" alt=\"A sewing kit \" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keeping a sewing kit on you means you can fix buttons and loose hems wherever you are, says fashion writer Amy Campbell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harriet Sutherland, the buyer and boutique manager at Brisbane boutique Camargue, also keeps a sewing kit on hand, particularly for <a href=\"https://www.fabriccare.com.au/snag-repair-needle\">the snag repair needle</a>. She says this type of needle has a “pointy end and a rough end” that works perfectly on snagged knitwear to pull the snag back through to the fabric and hide the pulled yarn.</p> <h2>Safety first</h2> <p>Ask any stylist what the one constant in their kit is and the answer will almost always be safety pins. Miguel Urbina Tan, the market editor for Harper’s Bazaar Australia, recommends buying “seamstress-grade safety pins in different sizes” rather than the ones you get at the grocery store.</p> <p>The pins come in handy for a range of instant fashion fixes. Campbell finds them most useful when trying to “replicate the function of a missing button in a rush”.</p> <p>Sutherland also makes sure she always has “a safety pin or two” in her handbag as a back-up, just in case an invisible hem falls down. Another hot tip for a quick fallen-hem fix is <a href=\"https://www.bigw.com.au/product/habeesavers-iron-on-hemming-web-19mm/p/191495\">tape</a> that can be quickly ironed into place.</p> <h2>Stains begone</h2> <p>Perhaps the only thing more annoying than finding a stain on something you want to wear while you’re getting dressed is not realising that the item you’re wearing has a stain on it until after you’ve left the house.</p> <p>Urbina Tan swears by the <a href=\"https://shop.coles.com.au/a/national/product/stain-remover-pen?uztq=46abcbb7e16253b0cdc3e6c5bbe6a3f0&amp;cid=col_cpc_Generic%7CColesSupermarkets%7CPLA%7CHousehold%7CAustralia%7CBroad&amp;s_kwcid=AL!12693!3!495221477975!!!u!1596586203829!&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1ZeUBhDyARIsAOzAqQJmxWKb6poCuj4ZyCV3TVlHA6xZMaAoUIiJ1VBqeyuzM-AMQ9blCrgaAsKWEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Magic stain remover pen</a>, which is small enough to fit in your pocket or handbag.</p> <p>Sutherland says when she pulled out a dress she hadn’t worn in eight years and found stains: “I used a Magic stain remover pen and the stains came off immediately.” She also keeps a sponge on hand to “remove surface-level marks or stains” from garments quickly.</p> <h2>Hang tight</h2> <p>As with most clothing care tips, prevention is better than a cure. If you want to pull shoes and clothes out of your wardrobe looking pressed and fresh, it’s worth investing in the right storage equipment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b6b2082d1faaeef75aad96c3727301d989eb634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b6b2082d1faaeef75aad96c3727301d989eb634/0_220_2589_1552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"T-shirts on wooden hangers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wooden hangers are better than wire ones – and cedar even better, to deter moths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AnikaSalsera/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wooden coat hangers are gentler on clothes than wire ones, and opting for cedar has the added benefit of deterring moths. Campbell only hangs her trousers on hangers with padded bars, to ensure they don’t crease.</p> <p>Similarly, shoes should be stored on shoe trees. Sutherland says this helps “maintain the shoe’s shape, draws out the moisture and combats odours”.</p> <h2>Wash with care</h2> <p>Putting clothes through the wash can be one of the fastest ways to age them. Marnie Gooding, the owner and founder of the fashion company Elk, recommends washing delicates and fine-gauge knits inside washing bags to protect them. Similarly, she uses a Guppyfriend bag when washing synthetics or activewear. And she suggests investing in a “good-quality clothes horse to lay knits flat when drying”, as this will help them keep their shape.</p> <h2>Other useful tools</h2> <ul> <li><p>Gooding recommends using a brass-tooth pilling comb to “remove both fine and larger pills from jersey to chunkier knits”.</p></li> <li><p>Campbell suggests investing in a good waterproofing spray to extend the life of shoes and jackets.</p></li> <li><p>Urbina Tan swears by<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Vapon-Topstick-Strips-Hypo-Allergenic-Purpose/dp/B014MPEDCY/ref=asc_df_B014MPEDCY/?tag=googleshopdsk-22&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=414877107566&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=2107971817872922552&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1000567&amp;hvtargid=pla-468643743020&amp;psc=1\"> Topstick double-sided tape</a> (also known as wig tape) in case of true fashion emergencies – when a safety pin just won’t cut it.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/24/postcode-lottery-access-to-abortions-being-hampered-across-queensland-years-after-decriminalisation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T17:30:43Z","webTitle":"‘Postcode lottery’: access to abortions being hampered across Queensland years after decriminalisation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/postcode-lottery-access-to-abortions-being-hampered-across-queensland-years-after-decriminalisation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/24/postcode-lottery-access-to-abortions-being-hampered-across-queensland-years-after-decriminalisation","fields":{"headline":"‘Postcode lottery’: access to abortions being hampered across Queensland years after decriminalisation","trailText":"Support services say many face lengthy wait times, conflicting advice and long distances to clinics","body":"<p>Queensland women are still facing barriers to access abortion services nearly four years after it was decriminalised in the state, according to support organisations.</p> <p>Children By Choice (CBC) chief executive, Daile Kelleher, said there have been devastating stories from women struggling with lengthy wait times, conflicting advice, and some forced to travel long distances to access abortion services.</p> <p>Kelleher said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/18/key-abortion-provider-marie-stopes-closes-regional-clinics-in-queensland-nsw\">closure of clinics operated by private non-for-profit healthcare service Marie Stopes </a>in Southport, Townsville and Rockhampton has created increased demand in south-east Queensland, blowing out wait times by up to six weeks in some cases.</p> <p>“Pregnancy is a time-sensitive diagnosis,” Kelleher said. “The more delays that people face … that actually has sort of real implications to the healthcare that they receive.”</p> <p>Since December 2018, abortion has been legal in Queensland and available on request as a health service, up until 22 weeks gestation.

But he said Marie Stopes has seen an increase in those without Medicare cards – such as migrants and international students – seeking terminations.</p> <p>“Often private health insurance doesn’t cover abortion care.

No one, no one, other than the people in here, expected us to be there. We did. We knew we were going to get there.”</p> <p>Whether hard work alone can deliver success is a matter for debate, but Aloisi was much closer to the mark in another regard. Even discounting their underdog status against Victory, there was little expectation at the beginning of the season that Western United would still be standing on the final day.</p> <p>Yet therein lies the beauty of their run, beyond the momentousness of qualifying for a maiden grand final. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/28/western-united-are-slow-and-steady-but-winning-the-a-league-men-race\">Riding a tide of 1-0 wins</a> and boasting a dressing room that is loving life under Aloisi, United have continued to defy those waiting for them to get found out.

They’re a bigger club than United. They have more history and trophies. They have more fans and culture. They have a well established, respected place in Australian football. But all that counts for naught in the final reckoning. </p> <p>Now standing between United and a remarkable title win is Melbourne’s dominant force. Patrick Kisnorbo’s City side will be looking to become the first A-Leagues side to win back-to-back premiership/championship doubles on Saturday evening, in a game which will also be their third consecutive grand final.

It is incredulous enough when Victory fans take this view – given the scorched earth approach taken to the existing football scene that preceded their and the A-Leagues’ birth – let alone supporters of a club that was re-badged following its purchase by a global football conglomerate just over a decade ago. Yet it is the prevailing narrative. </p> <p>Ultimately, the key for United remains in building their stadium and laying down deep roots in the west.

These cases do not usually lead to wider outbreaks.</p> <p>In other rare cases, owners of imported pets become infected, with animals such as rodents believed to be sources of transmission.</p> <p>But the World Health Organization [WHO] said cases are rising in non-endemic countries, with no link to travel or animals identified in most of these cases. </p> <p>So what are the main theories about why cases are suddenly emerging this time?</p> <h2>Protection from smallpox vaccines is waning</h2> <p>Prof. Raina MacIntyre, who heads the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute, <a href=\"https://insightplus.mja.com.au/2022/19/cases-of-monkeypox-found-in-sydney-and-melbourne/\">told the Medical Journal of Australia</a> that “waning of immunity from smallpox vaccination may be contributing to the increasing outbreaks of monkeypox”.</p> <p>“It is more than <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-3569_article\">40-50 years since mass vaccination ceased</a>,” she said.</p> <p>The smallpox vaccine offered the bonus of strong protection against monkeypox. A <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0010141\">study published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</a> in February which warned monkeypox cases were rising also attributed this to the cessation of widespread smallpox vaccination, given that virus has been declared by WHO as eradicated.</p> <p>In some countries where the virus has been detected, like Australia, mass smallpox vaccination never occurred.</p> <h2>Cases have actually been rising for a while</h2> <p>Epidemiologists flagged growing case numbers before WHO issued its alert earlier in May. There were calls for better worldwide surveillance and detection of monkeypox cases prior to the current outbreaks because of data suggesting a resurgence of the disease.</p> <p>Between 2010 and 2019, cases re-emerged in Liberia and Sierra Leone after a four-decade absence and in Central African Republic after three decades, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0010141\">research published in February and led by Pallas Health Research and Consultancy in The Netherlands found</a>.</p> <p>Since the Covid-19 pandemic began researchers and health workers worldwide are also more alert to symptoms of viruses and are quicker to report anything unusual, helping to lead to the detection of cases.</p> <h2>Could the virus have mutated?</h2> <p>Human-to-human spread is not easy for monkeypox; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2491159/?page=3\">one study found 3% of close contacts of someone with monkeypox will become infected</a>.</p> <p>But the strange rise in cases has raised the possibility that the virus may have mutated in a way that makes person-to-person transmission more likely.</p> <p>More data and laboratory analysis is needed to confirm this, however, and for now it is just a theory. Sequencing of the virus in laboratories is occurring, and we should know within days whether the virus has changed.</p> <p>While monkeypox has been around for decades it is nonetheless considered a rare disease, meaning there is always more to learn about it.</p> <h2>The virus may just have taken advantage of an ideal situation</h2> <p>When monkeypox does spread between humans, it is through close physical contact with someone who has symptoms. Monkeypox can lead to pus-filled lesions developing on the skin, and contact with fluid from this rash – including contact from contaminated clothing and bedding – can spread the virus.</p> <p>Sores in the mouth can also be infectious.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/21/new-york-city-resident-monkeypox-virus-positive\">Monkeypox outbreak: WHO working on sexual contact theory, top adviser says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the current outbreak, clusters have occurred among men who have sex with men, which has not been the case previously. But experts have warned against declaring it a sexually transmitted disease, or attributing spread to certain communities. It is much more likely that the close contact that occurs during sex is responsible for spread, rather than the disease being sexually transmitted.</p> <p>In the meantime WHO has urged people not to stigmatise those diagnosed with the virus.</p> <p>“<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/un-denounces-homophobic-and-racist-reporting-on-monkeypox-spread\">We have seen messages stigmatising certain groups of people</a> around this outbreak of monkeypox,” WHO said in a statement.</p> <p>“We want to make it very clear that this is not right.

If you’re not finding diverse talent, why is that?</p> <p>“The Coalition said for a very long time, we’re selecting on merit, we don’t do quotas. So women took that into their own hands. They created their own space.”</p> <p>Ultimately, though, Annese is optimistic.</p> <p>“The fact that these are no longer fringe issues is a pretty new phenomenon. Now they’re mainstream business issues, and mainstream political issues,” she said.</p> <p>“But I think we have to be vigilant. If you take your foot off the brake, there are always dark forces seeking to wind back … the progress that’s been made.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/24/supply-chain-delays-and-steel-costs-are-part-of-perfect-storm-stalling-renewable-energy-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T17:30:42Z","webTitle":"Supply chain delays and steel costs are part of ‘perfect storm’ stalling renewable energy growth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/24/supply-chain-delays-and-steel-costs-are-part-of-perfect-storm-stalling-renewable-energy-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/24/supply-chain-delays-and-steel-costs-are-part-of-perfect-storm-stalling-renewable-energy-growth","fields":{"headline":"Supply chain delays and steel costs are part of ‘perfect storm’ stalling renewable energy growth","trailText":"Covid disruptions in China and rising costs are affecting supplies of solar panels and wind turbine parts, while domestic energy prices climb","body":"<p>Supply chain delays from China and the soaring cost of steel and other materials are combining to slow the advance of renewable energy in Australia and elsewhere, a leading insurer and industry groups say.</p> <p>The cost of steel for wind turbine blades had risen by 50% or more since the Covid pandemic’s start, even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine prompted a scramble to accelerate the switch away from coal, oil and gas to clean energy alternatives, according to GCube, a global insurer of renewables that has recently opened its first Australian office in Sydney.</p> <p>“You’ve almost got the perfect storm right now,” Fraser McLachlan, GCube’s chief executive said. “We’re seeing delays of six months at a minimum to get replacement parts and things like that coming out of China, sometimes more.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/living-costs-in-outer-suburbs-would-be-slashed-under-plan-to-electrify-everything-analysis-finds\">Living costs in outer suburbs would be slashed under plan to ‘electrify everything’, analysis finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To order a blade for a multi-megawatt sized turbine can now take as much as a year or longer, adding to windfarm operators’ costs.

Australian prime minister’s ‘political wisdom’","body":"<p>The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has arrived in Tokyo for high-level security talks with the US, India and Japan amid a fresh political storm over whether the US would take military action to defend Taiwan from China.</p> <p>Albanese and his foreign minister, Penny Wong, touched down on Monday night for a meeting of the quadrilateral security dialogue (Quad) which will focus on measures aimed at curbing China’s assertiveness in the region.</p> <p>On the eve of the visit, Chinese state media put Albanese on notice that his approach to the Quad meeting would be viewed as a test of his “political wisdom” after the “anti-China strategy” pursued by the Morrison government.</p> <p>But the call for a reset in Australia’s strained ties with its largest trading partner will likely be immediately tested after the US president, Joe Biden, indicated on Monday <a

aggression.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

climate crisis and ‘respect’ region, Penny Wong says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking in Tokyo alongside the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, the US president was asked: “Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?”</p> <p>“Yes,” Biden said.</p> <p>“You are?” the reporter asked again. “That’s the commitment we made,” Biden said, in remarks that were seen as a departure from the traditional US position of strategic ambiguity on Taiwan.</p> <p>The comments put Albanese in a difficult position on one of the most vexed questions of foreign policy as he flags a diplomatic reset with Australia’s most important allies and stresses the importance of Australia’s partnership with the US.</p> <p>Just six months ago, Labor criticised the then defence minister, Peter Dutton, for <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/defence/defending-taiwan-against-beijing-is-a-must-says-peter-dutton/news-story/ef9dd7fd56515afbdc90021760d1d344\">telling the Australian newspaper</a>: “It would be inconceivable that we wouldn’t support the US in an action if the US chose to take that action” in Taiwan.</p> <p>Wong, then the shadow foreign affairs spokesperson, characterised this as out of step with the US policy of strategic ambiguity, while agreeing that the risk of conflict over Taiwan had increased.</p> <p>“We are sticking to the long-held bipartisan position on Taiwan, even if Mr Dutton is walking away from it,” Wong said at the time.</p> <p>Ahead of the Quad meeting, Albanese said he expected the relationship with China to “remain a difficult one” but the government would pursue Australia’s national interest without politicising national security.</p> <p>“The relationship with China will remain a difficult one, I said that before the election [and] that has not changed.</p> <p>“It is China that has changed, not Australia, and Australia should always stand up for our values and we will in a government that I lead.”</p> <p>Biden’s remarks – which are similar to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/biden-taiwan-china-us-defence\">those made last year that the White House later walked back</a> – come as the Quad members prepare to canvass details of the US’s newly announced Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (Ipef) as part of a broader strategy for the region aimed at countering China.</p> <p>Albanese will have one-on-one meetings with Biden, Kishida and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, following the Quad summit on Tuesday afternoon, all of which are expected to focus on China.</p> <p>The Chinese state media tabloid The Global Times published an opinion piece that questioned whether Australia’s policy on China under Albanese would differ from the “reckless” anti-China stance of his predecessor.</p> <p>“His [Albanese’s] attendance at the Quad summit … is expected to be the first test of the political wisdom of the new Australian government, especially on whether it could get rid of the shadow of previous Scott Morrison’s anti-China strategy that deeply hurt its own economy and trade,” the newspaper said.</p> <p>“Experts hold a cautious attitude toward how much the new Australian leader’s China policy will differ from Morrison’s reckless moves that served the US’s strategic interests. Especially in South Pacific island countries, the new Australian government is highly likely to invest more in competing with China.</p> <p>“But smearing China’s cooperation with those countries or distorting it as a ‘China threat’ would not change the course of the equal and reciprocal cooperation between China and Pacific island countries.”</p> <p>The opinion piece noted Albanese’s “little experience in diplomacy” and quoted a research fellow at the Guangdong Institute for International Strategies, Zhou Fangyin, offering advice to the incoming prime minister.</p> <p>“If the new prime minister is smart enough, he would adopt a cautious rhetoric and avoid putting the role of Australia under the spotlight, otherwise, it would only serve as a bad beginning for Australia-China relations under the new government,” he said.</p> <p>Albanese said he wanted to use the trip to showcase his new government’s commitment to the US alliance, which he said remained Australia’s “most important”, along with its other relationships in the region.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/us-would-defend-taiwan-if-attacked-by-china-says-joe-biden\">US would defend Taiwan if attacked by China, says Joe Biden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The meetings that we will have, not just with the United States, but importantly with our hosts in Japan and India, are going to be very important, in a good way, to send a message to the world that there’s a new government in Australia and it’s a government that represents a change, in terms of the way that we deal with the world on issues like climate change, but also a continuity in the way that we have respect for democracy and the way that we value our friendships and long time alliances.”</p> <p>The Quad summit is likely to finalise a new maritime initiative aimed at tackling illegal Chinese fishing in the Indo Pacific and will also canvass how the four countries can cooperate more closely on cyber challenges and climate change.</p> <p>Washington has expressed alarm at the recently signed security pact between China and Solomon Islands, which sparked concern that China was planning to establish a military base 1,700km north-east of the Queensland coastline. China is reportedly pursuing similar agreements with Kiribati.</p> <p>The White House has declared the summit would send a “powerful message” to Beijing about its focus in the Indo Pacific, which comes after Biden visited South Korea to meet with the president, Yoon Suk-yeol.<br><br>“We think putting that on display over four days — bilaterally with the ROK and Japan, through the Quad, through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework — it will send a powerful message. We think that message will be heard everywhere.

As Darren Chester pointed out on Monday <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/darrenchestermp/posts/pfbid02NX7RNx13oYjeFQw25mdLXWA1H7jN1NQEDqbiVN2Ln2yrZqkdCLV9o81DsKzd2oHrl\">there were some “significant swings”</a> this time.</p> <p>In Nicholls, independent Rob Priestly won more than 25% of the primary vote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/02/victorian-food-bowl-seat-up-for-grabs-in-three-way-fight-over-water-and-jobs\">from a standing start</a>, compared with the Nationals’ Sam Birrell, who attracted just over 27% with the benefit of millions of dollars of Coalition promises.</p> <p>The 17% vote for the Liberals’ candidate, Steve Brooks, sent a portion of preferences flowing back to the Nationals. Now that Birrell holds that seat, the Liberals are not allowed to run next time and will not be able to help out.

The National party lost 5.5% of their primary votes. (The Liberals lost 4%.)</p> <p>This brings us to Joyce’s claim to have increased his party room with another senator.</p> <p>The Liberals and Nationals take it in turns filling the second spot on the Senate ticket.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/27/high-court-rules-barnaby-joyce-and-four-others-ineligible-in-dual-citizenship-case\">The dual-citizenship crisis</a> that hit the federal parliament saw the Liberals pick up that spot after Fiona Nash was forced to leave parliament.

Back in 1993 the TV programme helped turn a dilapidated, burnt-out school into a nursery run by the charity for children with learning difficulties.</p> <p>That episode set the charity on course for growth that has continued to the present day. It now runs play schemes and other services for more than 2,000 children and carers. “Anneka was the catalyst,” said Cath Lee, Leeds Mencap’s chief executive.</p> <p>Challenge Anneka completed more than 60 projects during its six-year run on BBC One between 1989 and 1995, ranging from building a <a href=\"https://bryher-islesofscilly.co.uk/island-walk\">jetty in the Isles of Scilly</a> to putting up a <a href=\"https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/challenge-anneka-bridge-wadebridge-built-6509918\">suspension bridge in Cornwall</a> – nicknamed Anneka Bridge – and renovating an orphanage in Romania.</p> <p>The drama of the programme rested on whether it would complete its task within the few days allocated to it. Clad in her trademark brightly coloured jumpsuit, the presenter Anneka Rice’s job was to energetically persuade volunteers and businesses to help her deliver a much-needed charity or community project.</p> <p>Some, like <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9509809/Anneka-Rice-marks-30-years-TV-revealed-conditions-Romanian-orphanage.html\">the Romania challenge</a>, are seared into the memory of an entire Saturday night TV-watching generation. Rice’s team built a new home for 700 disabled children trapped in extraordinary squalor and facing abuse and neglect.</p> <p>Other projects proved to be less successful: Rice’s enthusiasm could not ultimately rescue a <a href=\"https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/how-derelict-gloucester-theatre-could-2540369\">crumbling theatre</a> in Gloucester, and the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/8236079.stm\">renovation of a horse</a> carved into a hill in Dorset later failed when replacement stone chippings used by the TV team fell away, much to the ire of local historians.</p> <p>At its peak, up to 12 million people watched episodes of Challenge Anneka. “It understood the magic of community projects,” said Lee. “How pulling together communities to share their skills, energy and resources can achieve amazing things.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rice has called Challenge Anneka her “life’s work” and often stayed in touch with its projects.

However, the targeted killings of influential Iranian military officers and scientists are the most visceral scenes of a dangerous shadow conflict that has resulted in up to a dozen Iranian officials being killed, many using the same modus operandi of gunmen riding motorbikes and using weapons fitted with silencers.</p> <p>The Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, on Monday called for the attackers to be caught. “I insist on the serious pursuit of the murderers by security officials, and I have no doubt that the blood of this great martyr will be avenged,” he said ahead of a visit to Oman. “There is no doubt that the hand of global arrogance can be seen in this crime,” he added, using a term used by Iran to describe Israel and the United States.</p> <p>Iranian officials claimed to have arrested “Zionist agents” but offered no evidence.</p> <p>Israeli officials offered no official comment on the latest assassination. However, the news was carried widely by Israeli press, who linked Khodayari to an alleged plot to kidnap Israeli diplomats abroad.</p> <p>Khodayari was a member of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, an elite unit tasked with exporting the values of the Islamic revolution into the Arab world and beyond. He had played a central role in military activities in Iraq and Syria, in which Iran has consolidated its presence over the last decade and developed formidable political influence.</p> <p>He was a close associate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/general-qassam-suleimani-obituary\">Maj Gen Qassem Suleimani</a>, the Iranian security tsar assassinated in Baghdad by a US airstrike in January 2020.

On the latest number, UK GDP in March was only 0.6% above its pre-Covid level, and it is substantially below the path it was expected to follow pre-Covid.”</p> <p>His comments are likely to be interpreted as a notice that the MPC will stop short of increasing interest rates from 2% to 3% in the next year as expected by most City economists.</p> <p>Bailey, who chairs the MPC, added that while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/17/uk-pay-inflation-unemployment-city-bonuses\">low unemployment and a high level of vacancies</a> were leading to a “tight labour market”, this was not the result of buoyant spending on Britain’s high streets, but rather that the number of people seeking work had dropped.</p> <p>“What we do have is a very tight labour market. But that does not look like a story about rapid demand growth,” he said. “The labour force has shrunk by around 1% since the onset of Covid. It looks much more like an impact from the supply of labour.”</p> <p>About 500,000 people who worked before the pandemic have stopped looking for a job, most of them over the age of 50.

In the short run, our priority is clearly … fighting inflation.”</p> <p>Lagarde’s comments sent the euro up 0.6% against the dollar to $1.0632, while Germany’s 10-year bond yield rose 0.03 percentage points to 0.97%.

The act makes individuals responsible for violations if they knew about them at the time.</p> <p>The suit against Zuckerberg is based on hundreds of thousands of documents, including depositions from employees and whistleblowers, that have been collected as part of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/19/facebook-cambridge-analytica-washington-dc-lawsuit-data\">ongoing litigation</a> against Meta.</p> <p>“Since filing our landmark lawsuit against Facebook, my office has fought tooth and nail against the company’s characteristic efforts to resist producing documents and otherwise thwart our suit. We continue to persist and have followed the evidence right to Mr Zuckerberg,” said Racine.</p> <p>Racine charges that the Cambridge Analytica scandal was a result of Zuckerberg’s desire to open up Facebook to third-party developers.</p> <p>The suit alleges Zuckerberg was aware of the risks of data leaks associated with the strategy. In one email discussing state leakage Zuckerberg noted “there is clear risk on the advertiser side,” according to the lawsuit.</p> <p>The suit points out that since 2012, Zuckerberg has served as chairman of Facebook’s board and controls approximately 60% of the voting shares.</p> <p>“At all times relevant to the lawsuit, evidence showed Mr Zuckerberg was responsible for and had the clear ability to control Facebook’s day-to-day operations,” Racine’s office said in a statement.</p> <p>As the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">revealed in 2018</a>, Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Trump’s 2016 election campaign team, gained access to the private data of 50 million Facebook users.

Critics of the fine said it did too little to change the company’s behavior and charged that litigation should have been brought against Zuckerberg.</p> <p>Carl Tobias, Williams chair in law at the University of Richmond, said it can be “difficult” to sue corporate officers in their personal capacity, and Racine had failed in an attempt earlier this year to sue Zuckerberg when the suit was filed too late. “This filing seems to be creative, but it may not be more successful than previous attempts to sue CEOs and corporate officers in a personal capacity,” said Tobias.</p> <p>Meta declined to comment.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/23/they-will-quite-often-give-you-a-wee-nip-rangers-count-puffins-on-farne-islands","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T17:12:42Z","webTitle":"‘They will often give you a wee nip’: rangers count puffins on Farne Islands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/23/they-will-quite-often-give-you-a-wee-nip-rangers-count-puffins-on-farne-islands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/23/they-will-quite-often-give-you-a-wee-nip-rangers-count-puffins-on-farne-islands","fields":{"headline":"‘They will often give you a wee nip’: rangers count puffins on Farne Islands","trailText":"Annual survey is important for understanding health of the Atlantic puffin’s breeding colonies","body":"<p>It may well be one of the least hi-tech nature counts in the UK, and involves rangers sticking their arms blindly down a hole knowing there will be one of five outcomes: they will feel either a puffin egg, a puffling, excrement, nothing at all – or the annoyed reaction of a puffin as a giant hand suddenly enters its home.</p> <p>“They will quite often give you a wee nip,” said Harriet Reid, an area ranger at the National Trust, smiling. “I can show you a couple of scars … it does hurt.

The coronavirus pandemic meant full surveys were impossible in 2020 and 2021. The rangers have an idea of how healthy the puffin population is, but really need the comprehensive data that they will get once again now the 14-strong team can return to live on Inner Farne.</p> <p>The biggest threat to puffin populations around the world is climate change. Icelandic populations are struggling, say experts, because of more frequent winter storms and greater stresses on food chains. In the UK the puffin is a red-listed bird, meaning it is of the highest conservation concern.</p> <p>In 2018, 42,474 breeding pairs of Atlantic puffins were counted. In 2019 it was 42,378. Last year it was 36,211 – but that was a reduced survey area. It is too early to be alarmed, and the feeling is that the breeding colonies on the islands are in good shape, Reid said.</p> <p>The pandemic has meant no live-on rangers and fewer visitors, so gulls, one of the puffin’s main predators, “have not been deterred as they usually would [be], causing more havoc than usual”, said Reid.</p> <p>For the count, rangers put their arms down puffin burrows if they cannot see signs of occupation. The burrows can be 3ft (90cm) deep and are Y-shaped. At one end might be an egg; at the other, puffin poo. “It really is 50-50,” said Reid.</p> <p>Puffins have colourful beaks that <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/puffin-beaks-are-fluorescent-and-theyre-not-only-ones-180968724/\">glow under UV light</a>. “They are iconic, I think,” said <a href=\"https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nes/people/profile/richardbevan.html\">Dr Richard Bevan</a>, a zoologist at Newcastle University who helps verify the count. “A lot of people these days are distanced from wildlife and there is a lack of knowledge, but the one species everyone can identify is a puffin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d4934ae4046b5a9950ac2cce756fa0759854e90e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4934ae4046b5a9950ac2cce756fa0759854e90e/0_546_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Puffins on rocks on farne islands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The puffin breeding colonies on the Farne Islands are thought to be in good shape.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Some people will see the thousands of guillemots on the cliffs here and go: ‘Are they penguins?’ When they see a puffin, they know it instantly.”</p> <p>Puffins are monogamous and keep the same partner for life, returning to the same burrow year after year for the breeding season. Their Latin name is Fratercula arctica, meaning “little brother of the north”. Their local name is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robgmacfarlane/status/883936280937148416\">tommy noddy</a> – and they do nod a lot.</p> <p>Visitors come on boat trips to the Farne Islands in their thousands each year to see the abundance of birdlife – shags, guillemots, eiders, fulmars, kittiwakes or the true Olympians of the islands, the arctic terns, which from Northumberland will migrate to Antarctica.</p> <p>But the stars of the Farnes are surely the puffins. Their walk is less a walk and more a scuttle, as though they’ve left the ironing out but can’t quite remember where it is. Their takeoff and landing is often comical, and their flight might best be described as frantic.</p> <p>“They are a species that people find really endearing,” said Bevan. “They are always squabbling. Two will start having a scrap and all the other ones come along to have a look. Even as a scientist you do go … ‘ahh, they are so cute’.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2022/may/23/office-for-students-chair-james-wharton-same-event-as-denounced-racist-zsolt-bayer","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T17:01:04Z","webTitle":"Office for Students chair speaks at same event as denounced racist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/23/office-for-students-chair-james-wharton-same-event-as-denounced-racist-zsolt-bayer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2022/may/23/office-for-students-chair-james-wharton-same-event-as-denounced-racist-zsolt-bayer","fields":{"headline":"Office for Students chair speaks at same event as denounced racist","trailText":"Tory leaders urged to investigate after James Wharton appears at Cpac Hungary on same day as Zsolt Bayer","body":"<p>Ministers are facing calls to investigate the chair of England’s university regulator about his participation in a conference for the Republican party, which platformed a notorious racist and antisemite.</p> <p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats called on Conservative party leaders and ministers to take action after James Wharton, chair of the Office for Students (OfS), addressed the <a href=\"https://www.cpachungary.com/en/program\">Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) Hungary in Budapest</a> on Friday.</p> <p>On the same day that Lord Wharton, who ran Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign, gave his video message, Zsolt Bayer, a television talkshow host in Hungary who has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/trump-shares-cpac-hungary-platform-racist-antisemite\">widely denounced for his racism</a>, took to the stage.

He also said Cpac was a “great chance to pick up new ideas”, to “reconnect with friends across the world” and to “fight for the values that we all hold dear”.</p> <p>Other speakers at the conference included Jack Posobiec, a far-right US blogger who has <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2020/07/08/twitter-gave-free-rein-jack-posobiec-publish-antisemitic-hate-and-disinformation\">used antisemitic symbols</a>, the former US president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, and the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage.

This is a step backwards and reinforces the rhetoric from rightwing politicians that racism is no longer an issue.”</p> <p>Kehinde Andrews, a professor of Black studies at Birmingham City University, said: “It is a worrying time for students from diverse, underprivileged and minority backgrounds.

The pay award being offered is just not credible.</p> <p>“A 2.2% pay increase (offered verbally not in writing) at a time when inflation is nearing 10% is a significant real-terms pay cut. It is neither fair nor reasonable to expect train drivers, or indeed any worker, to accept such a cut in their pay at the same time as their cost of living is soaring.”</p> <p>Aslef is preparing to ballot its members in early June to seek approval for industrial action, including an all-out strike, to improve the pay offer.</p> <p>He said ScotRail had cut far more services than it needed to; many drivers were sitting idle in mess rooms at stations around the country without trains to drive. “There are train drivers willing to drive trains. ScotRail has cut services far too much, far too deeply. It’s just bizarre. I don’t understand why they don’t want to talk to us.”</p> <p>ScotRail has been approached for a response to Lindsay’s allegations. Jenny Gilruth, the Scottish transport minister, suggested ScotRail was planning to meet Aslef this week. She said she was working with the operator to resolve the crisis.</p> <p>“We need to reach a resolution,” she told BBC Scotland. “Quite rightly, passengers are deeply frustrated. I’ve been hearing reports this morning. I travelled by train this morning to [Edinburgh] Waverley, where I am today, and people are scunnered [disgusted], quite frankly, by what’s happened.”</p> <p>Aslef officials believe ScotRail may be using the pay dispute as a cover to permanently cut its timetable, partly because passenger numbers have fallen sharply during the Covid crisis, and some observers expect numbers to remain below pre-pandemic levels as people’s work habits change.</p> <p>A report last year by Prof Iain Docherty of the University of Stirling said demand for rail was likely to increase substantially in future as the need for low- or zero-carbon public transport rises to cope with tougher climate targets.</p> <p>But in the medium term, he said Covid would have a significant impact on demand. “A scenario of around 20% less demand for rail commuting in a post-pandemic ‘new normal’ is therefore a reasonable starting point for future planning assumptions,” he said.</p> <p>The ScotRail controversy has increased criticisms of Sturgeon’s government, which includes two Scottish Green ministers.

At least 15 countries outside Africa have now detected the disease, totalling about 100 cases. Earlier on Monday, Scotland confirmed its first patient, who is isolating in hospital.</p> <p>Dr Nick Phin, the director of public health science and medical director at Public Health Scotland, said the overall risk to the public was low but he urged anyone with an unusual blister-like rash or blister-like sores on their body to avoid close contact with others and seek medical advice if worried.</p> <p>“We have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with such cases of infectious disease, and these will be strictly followed,” he said. “We are working with NHS Boards and wider partners in Scotland and the UK to investigate the source of this infection.”</p> <p>Boris Johnson, when asked about the outbreak during a visit to a school in south-east London, said monkeypox was a rare disease, but it was important to “keep an eye on it” given the unprecedented outbreak. “So far the consequences don’t seem to be very serious, but it’s important that we keep an eye on it, and that’s exactly what the new UK Health Security Agency is doing,” he said.</p> <p>Asked whether there should be quarantine for visitors or use of the smallpox vaccine, Johnson said: “As things stand, the judgment is that it’s rare. I think we’re looking very carefully at the circumstances of transmission. It hasn’t yet proved fatal in any case that we know of, certainly not in this country.”</p> <p>Monkeypox does not spread easily and is a mild disease in most people, but it can cause more serious illness in young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Phin said more vaccine doses and antivirals for monkeypox had been ordered.</p> <p>The UKHSA announced the first case in the latest outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/07/patient-treated-for-monkeypox-in-isolation-at-london-hospital\">on 7 May</a>, in a person who had returned to London from Nigeria, but some cases identified since seem to have been infected earlier and the majority have no travel history to Africa. The outbreak appears to be driven by the milder, west African type of monkeypox, which has a case fatality rate of about 1%, compared with 10% for the more severe central or Congo Basin type.</p> <p>People who are infected with monkeypox typically develop a high temperature or fever before small, flat spots appear on their skin. These become raised and filled with fluid before scabbing over. The spots can start around the mouth and spread around the body, including to the genitals. The virus can spread through large respiratory droplets, direct contact with body fluids such as saliva, or blisters and ulcers, and through contaminated sheets, towels and utensils.</p> <p>“Because the virus spreads through close contact, we are urging everyone to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service if they have any symptoms,” Hopkins said. “A notable proportion of recent cases in the UK and Europe have been found in gay and bisexual men, so we are particularly encouraging these men to be alert to the symptoms.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, should immediately contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service.</p> <p>Monkeypox is a viral infection most commonly found in animals in rural central and west Africa. In recent years countries such as Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have witnessed more cases in humans, with the virus spreading between people. A small number of cases have been detected in the UK since 2018, but until this year all were associated with travel to Nigeria.</p> <p>Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization’s lead on emerging diseases, said there would be more cases in the coming days, but the virus could be stopped. “This is a containable situation, particularly in the countries where we are seeing these outbreaks that are happening across Europe, in North America as well. We can stop human-to-human transmission,” she said. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/may/23/boris-johnson-bernard-hogan-howe-national-crime-agency-nca","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T16:38:09Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson faces backlash after pushing former Met chief for NCA role","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/23/boris-johnson-bernard-hogan-howe-national-crime-agency-nca","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/may/23/boris-johnson-bernard-hogan-howe-national-crime-agency-nca","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson faces backlash after pushing former Met chief for NCA role","trailText":"Lady Diana Brittan and ex-MP Harvey Proctor say Lord Hogan-Howe, who oversaw Operation Midland, should be ruled out","body":"<p>Boris Johnson’s attempt to appoint a former Metropolitan police commissioner into another senior police role has prompted a furious backlash from three high-profile victims of the VIP paedophile ring scandal.</p> <p>The widow of the late former home secretary Leon Brittan, the family of the late war hero Lord Bramall, and the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor have demanded that the prime minister reconsider whether Bernard Hogan-Howe is suitable to be the head of the National Crime Agency after presiding over the disastrous Operation Midland.</p> <p>Under Lord Hogan-Howe, Met officers raided the homes of all three men after receiving claims of ritualistic child abuse and murder from a single person.

Her socialist daughter, Agnes, is angry at the way women are employed in what she calls part-time “piss-pot jobs” because they are cheaper. The pay-off comes in 2019 when Agnes’s own daughter, accusing the Labour party of encouraging mass immigration, betrays her roots by voting Tory.</p> <p>Critics have pointed out Steel’s debt to Greek tragedy but I was more impressed by her reliance on a deeply English cultural inheritance. It is surely no accident that her play opens with the meticulous washing of a corpse and reminds one of The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd by a fellow Nottinghamshire writer, DH Lawrence. Constance’s husband, more devoted to his shop-steward duties than domestic strife, is similar to a character played by John Mills in a 1961 British movie, Flame in the Streets. Agnes’s diatribe about the neglect of those who do society’s dirty jobs directly echoes a speech in David Hare’s Skylight attacking the “rightwing fuckers” who sneer at those who deal with the mess others have created. The abortion, which is central to Steel’s plot, also brings to mind a raft of movies including Mike Leigh’s Vera Drake.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/26/beth-steel-playwright-the-house-of-shades\">‘You don’t have to be invited – you do it’: Beth Steel on her working-class family epic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You could argue that Steel tries to do too much; but better that than too little. Without mentioning the word “Brexit” or “red wall seats”, she goes a long way towards explaining why swathes of the north and Midlands swung to the right at the 2019 election. She is also very good on detail: the working-class father who in 1965 reads both the Daily Mirror and books at the dinner table is as plausible as the son who moves from adolescent communism to adult entrepreneurship. Having lived through all the events Steel describes, my only cavil is that she underplays the optimism that followed Wilson’s electoral victory in 1965 and that in 1996 anticipated Blair’s triumph at the polls the following year.</p> <p>Disillusion may ultimately have set in but in both the Wilson and Blair eras there was talk of a new dawn. My vantage point, as a middle-class metropolitan male, is however, wholly different from that of Steel and I respect the authenticity of her portrait of the east Midlands working class. All I can say is that her play is a work of enormous zest and zeal that shows theatre fulfilling its historic function of explaining the British to themselves.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/may/23/warmongering-lies-and-hatred-russian-diplomat-in-geneva-resigns-over-ukraine-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T16:16:53Z","webTitle":"‘Warmongering, lies and hatred’: Russian diplomat in Geneva resigns over Ukraine invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/warmongering-lies-and-hatred-russian-diplomat-in-geneva-resigns-over-ukraine-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/23/warmongering-lies-and-hatred-russian-diplomat-in-geneva-resigns-over-ukraine-invasion","fields":{"headline":"‘Warmongering, lies and hatred’: Russian diplomat in Geneva resigns over Ukraine invasion","trailText":"Boris Bondarev issues public statement saying: ‘Never have I been so ashamed of my country’","body":"<p>A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over his country’s invasion of Ukraine in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment.</p> \n<p>Boris Bondarev, a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva, wrote in a public statement: “Never have I been so ashamed of my country.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/russians-feel-sting-of-cultural-and-economic-rift-sanctions-ukraine\">Cosmopolitan no more: Russians feel sting of cultural and economic rift</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not about diplomacy,” wrote the diplomat, a 20-year veteran of the Russian foreign ministry. “It is all about warmongering, lies and hatred.

Money can skew games and there always remains the possibility of a brilliant player upsetting theory by doing something brilliant, but for those clubs who have a notion of an underlying philosophy of play it’s fairly clear what that looks like: a high offside line, a coordinated press and a capacity to retain possession when required.</p> <p>There has been a tendency to portray Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp as opposite poles, one focused on retaining the ball and one on regaining it. That is not unreasonable, although each has edged towards the other over the past couple of seasons. Perhaps what is most significant is that nobody really questions the axis by which they are judged. The age of attrition, of Greece winning the Euros, of José Mourinho, Rafa Benítez and Alex Ferguson in the Carlos Queiroz years, feels a long time ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/22/liverpool-denied-league-title-but-can-still-look-back-on-astonishing-season\">Liverpool denied title but Paris can provide final flourish to superb season | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Football changed in 2008, and not just because that was when Guardiola was appointed manager of Barcelona. Before then the knockout stage of the Champions League had only once yielded more than three goals per game; since then the average has only once dipped below three.</p> <p>It was then that a number of factors came together. Improvements in pitch, kit and ball technology had, for some time, meant that at the highest level a first touch could be taken for granted. The liberalisation of the offside law pushed back defensive lines. Intimidatory tackling had largely been eliminated. That meant there was more space which allowed diminutive technical midfielders who might previously have been bullied out of the game to flourish.</p> <p>Suddenly it became possible for the bigger teams, who were becoming relatively bigger than they ever had been before, to exercise greater control over games than ever before, to worry about manipulating space, Guardiola’s <em>juego de posición</em>, rather than having to scrap for midfield survival. That in turn led to significant discomfort when big sides met and one found itself unable to get the ball. One of the reasons Manchester United players lost discipline in the 2009 Champions League final was a sense of humiliation at having “only” around 40% possession.</p> <p>The following year, Mourinho’s Internazionale would show it was possible to win (or at least to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/28/barcelona-internazionale-champions-league\" title=\"\">lose narrowly enough to win on aggregate</a>) with just 19% possession. Sitting back, holding position, allowing the opposition the ball but only 30 yards or more from goal became a viable way to combat the possession sides. Football began to look at times like handball. But there was another way, which was that promulgated by Klopp, who disliked the passivity of bunkering down, hoping nobody pinged a long-range drive into the top corner or suddenly dribbled past three players to score. That was to press hard and high in a coordinated way and look for turnovers and rapid transitions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb3d3eca403ce2824c5a9d1306a580f9217fed7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb3d3eca403ce2824c5a9d1306a580f9217fed7c/0_110_3334_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola’s victory in the Champions League final of 2009 marked the dawn of a new style of football\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola’s victory in the Champions League final of 2009 marked the dawn of a new style of football.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lluís Gené/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Guardiola’s teams pressed but not with quite the same intensity or with quite the same immediate view to the counter. They would break if the opportunity was there, but if it wasn’t, Guardiola was perfectly happy for his sides to reset and begin the process again, something he said could take 15 passes. Guardiola was about control and Klopp about chaos.</p> <p>But as Guardiola’s Champions League hopes have regularly been undone by opponents playing on the break, he has had to adjust to counter the counter. In part there seems a clear intention to retain five outfield players behind the ball at all times, but there is also more of a <em>gegenpress</em>, which in turn has increased City’s threat on the counter. Klopp, meanwhile, seeing the accumulated fatigue – physical and mental – of constant heavy-metal football, has taken steps to control games more, which was one of the drivers behind his signing of Thiago Alcântara, perhaps the most characteristic Guardiola player there is.</p> <p>Thomas Tuchel, Antonio Conte, Stefano Pioli, Xavi, Julian Nagelsmann, Thomas Frank, Brendan Rodgers, Gian Piero Gasperini – the vast majority of modern managers lie at some point on the same spectrum. Exceptions, among top clubs, are rare and tend to be the result of a fascination with celebrity, often allied with grotesque mismanagement. Even had he had greater authority, Ralf Rangnick would have struggled with a squad struggling to accommodate Cristiano Ronaldo, whose destabilising presence at Juventus is a reason they have gone back to the familiar comforts of Max Allegri.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Real Madrid, so far, have been a fine example of how great players can suddenly turn games that seem to be going against them, but Paris Saint-Germain are the most interesting example of celebrity culture, the acquisition of a luxury front three necessitating the employment of a grimly industrial midfield that militates against fluency. The only real philosophical outlier is Diego Simeone at Atlético Madrid, although with each passing season the sense grows that that is a retro project of diminishing returns.</p> <p>It’s rare in the modern game that the lines are so clear. Guardiola implemented a style of play that capitalised on changed conditions, Klopp found a way of countering it, Guardiola reacted and what has followed is a synthesis of <em>gegenpressing</em> and <em>juego de posición</em>.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2022/may/23/davos-day-one-ukraine-mps-support-sanctions-zelenskiy-wef-food-crisis-economy-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T15:54:19Z","webTitle":"Davos day one: Zelenskiy calls for maximum sanctions against Russia; recession fears on the rise – business live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/may/23/davos-day-one-ukraine-mps-support-sanctions-zelenskiy-wef-food-crisis-economy-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/may/23/davos-day-one-ukraine-mps-support-sanctions-zelenskiy-wef-food-crisis-economy-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Davos day one: Zelenskiy calls for maximum sanctions against Russia; recession fears on the rise – business live","trailText":"Rolling coverage of the first day of the World Economic Forum in Davos","body":"<div id=\"block-628bacf08f089d657c064ab0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-23T15:53:18.434Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That is probably all for today.... here’s our news story on the main news event of the day, president Zelenskiy’s speech:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/23/zelenskiy-sanctions-russia-davos-speech-ukraine\">Zelenskiy urges ‘maximum sanctions’ against Russia in Davos speech</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>And some background reading about how Davos isn’t quite the same this year.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/can-davos-with-no-a-listers-still-play-a-part-on-the-global-stage\">With no A-listers, can Davos still play a part on the global stage?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>We’ll be back tomorrow. <strong>GW</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-23T15:54:19.019Z\">at 4.54pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-628ba93e8f089d657c064a73\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-23T15:46:40.989Z\">4.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Finishing on a positive note, David Rubenstein argues that the current crisis is a less serious economic shock than the Covid-19 crisis, the financial crisis, or the dot-com bust.</p> \n  <p>It’ll be a mild recession, if it’s a recession, he says.

While geostrategic considerations will drive some sourcing decisions, this need not lead to disintegration. Business leaders have an important role to play in this regard.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2022/04/12/global-trade-needs-more-supply-diversity-not-less/\">New IMF research </a>shows that diversification can cut potential GDP losses from supply disruptions in half. Auto manufacturers and others have found that designing products that can use substitutable or more widely available parts can reduce losses by 80 percent.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2021/09/22/how-countries-can-diversify-their-exports/\">Diversifying exports </a>can also increase economic resilience. Policies that help include: enhancing infrastructure to help businesses shorten supply chains, increasing broadband access, and improving the business environment. The WTO can also help with its overall support for more predictable, transparent trade policies.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Second, step up joint efforts to deal with debt</strong>.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With roughly 60 percent of low-income countries with significant debt vulnerabilities, some will need debt restructuring. Without decisive cooperation to ease their burdens, <em>both</em> they and their creditors will be worse off. But a return to debt sustainability will draw new investment and spur inclusive growth.</p> \n   <p>That is why the Group of Twenty’s Common Framework for Debt Treatment must be improved without delay. This means putting in place clear procedures and timelines for debtors and creditors—and making the framework available to other highly-indebted vulnerable countries.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Third, modernize cross-border payments</strong> .</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Inefficient payment systems are another barrier to inclusive growth. Take remittances: the average cost of an international transfer is 6.3 percent. This means some <strong>$45 billion</strong> per year are diverted into the hands of intermediaries—and away from millions of lower-income households.</p> \n   <p>A possible solution? Countries could work together to develop a global <strong>public digital platform</strong>—a new piece of payment infrastructure with clear rules—so that everyone can send money at minimal cost and maximum speed and safety. It could also connect various forms of money, including central bank digital currencies.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Fourth, confront climate change: the existential challenge that looms above everything </strong>.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>During the COP26 climate conference, 130 countries, representing over 80 percent of global emissions, committed to achieve net-zero carbon by around mid-century.</p> \n   <p>But we urgently need to close the <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2021/10/31/not-yet-on-track-for-net-zero-climate-threats-demands-more-ambitious-global-action/\">gap between ambition and policy</a>.

Ukraine needs military and financial suport, and tougher sanctions on Russia, if it is to prevail:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That is the only way to stop the atrocities, that happened in Bucha, that happened in Borodyanka, in other small villages in Keiv region.

wage war on anybody else in the future.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Anastasia Radina MP</strong>, who heads the Ukraine parliament’s anti-corruption committee, also spoke, said Ukraine needs “NATO-style heavy weaponry”.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Ensuring that Ukraine receives a proper supply of counter-offensive heavy weapons is the only way to ensure Ukraine exists, wins, and

Boris Johnson, be warned","trailText":"The ousting of shameless culture warrior Scott Morrison should send a shiver down Tory spines, says Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff","body":"<p>Populists can be beaten. There was a time not long ago when few could type that sentence with confidence, so the outcome of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/australian-election-2022-anthony-albanese-humbled-to-be-next-pm-as-voters-abandon-coalition\">Australia’s recent elections</a> will leave many progressives battling with the still unfamiliar sensation of victory.</p> <p>Scott Morrison, the now ousted rightwing prime minister dubbed Australia’s first “post-truth” leader, was never quite a Trumpian. But he was a shameless culture warrior presiding over a bungled Covid response and ensuing recession, plus a clumsy response to high-profile sexual misconduct allegations against parliamentary colleagues. He dragged his feet on the climate crisis even as apocalyptic floods, fires and droughts were convincing Australians that something had to change, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/21/scott-morrison-hawaii-horror-show-pr-disaster-unfolded\">holidayed in Hawaii</a> as wildfires raged at home. His opponent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/eight-priorities-anthony-albanese-new-labor-government-australia-federal-election-2022\">Labor’s Anthony Albanese</a>, was not exactly overburdened with charisma and the progressive vote eventually split between Labor, the Greens and the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/teal-independents-who-are-they-how-did-they-upend-australia-election\">teal independents</a>, an exasperated army of mainly female candidates pledging to clean up politics and tackle the climate. But the cautious Albanese and his mantra of “<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/albanese-banks-on-safe-change-to-woo-voters-20220401-p5aa5t.html\">safe change</a>” – nothing too big or scarily radical – still made it over the line, having seemingly learned from a previous Labor defeat blamed on an over-ambitious manifesto. If any of this sounds uncannily familiar to British readers, then it’s easy to see why Keir Starmer’s Labour party (and indeed the Greens) might suddenly have their tails up.</p> <p>First Donald Trump, then Marine Le Pen in the French presidential elections, now Morrison. This toppling of rightwing dominoes creates the sense of momentum British progressives have been missing. Now there are successful campaign architects to learn from overseas, and new ideas being road-tested in government; there will be friends in strategic places, perhaps new energy behind global efforts to combat the climate crisis, and the morale-boosting idea that the zeitgeist might finally be with them. You can almost feel the pendulum swinging away from a polarising and ultimately grubby era back towards a politics at least vaguely connected to truth and reality. Or at least you can if you want to badly enough.</p> <p>For a more cynical way of looking at this is that two years in, Biden’s ratings <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-bidens-approval-rating-sinks-below-donald-trumps-1708787\">have sunk far enough</a> to give Republicans plenty of hope for next time; Le Pen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/21/the-guardian-view-on-macron-v-le-pen-no-room-for-complacency\">still got way too many votes</a> for comfort; Albanese’s victory was not thumping; and Britain’s first-past-the-post system makes similar Green breakthroughs or progressive alliances harder here. Nor is Australia, which shifted rightwards in 1996 just as Britain was doing the reverse, historically a very reliable political weathervane.</p> <p>All that said, what should send a shiver down Tory spines is that Morrison’s aggressively divisive approach to issues such as immigration and his pursuit of socially conservative Labor voters seemingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/tony-abbott-and-scott-morrison-have-emptied-the-liberals-broad-church\">cost his party dear</a> in its wealthier, more metropolitan former heartlands. The nagging fear some Conservatives have that a diet of sleaze, culture wars and threats to tear up the Brexit deal will only lose them Tory votes in Worthing or Surrey has just played out on a big screen Down Under, producing roughly the kind of electoral realignment they fear.</p> <p>What makes this otherwise faraway election feel closer to home is that the Australian right’s thinking remains core to Boris Johnson’s project. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/priti-patel-blames-specialist-lawyers-rwanda-plan-delays\">Priti Patel’s plan</a> to export asylum seekers to Rwanda mirrors an Australian scheme to send refugees to Papua New Guinea, and she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/18/deeply-concerning-british-government-picks-alexander-downer-to-review-uks-border-force\">recently hired the man</a> who negotiated that deal to lead a review of Britain’s Border Force. Lynton Crosby, the 65-year-old Australian campaigns guru who enjoys near-legendary status in the Conservative party, doesn’t personally run campaigns any more but he still takes the odd phone call; his protege Isaac Levido <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/16/isaac-levido-the-australian-political-strategist-credited-with-boris-johnsons-victory\">ran Johnson’s successful 2019 campaign</a>, months after helping deliver a surprise victory for Morrison. David Canzini, the new deputy chief of staff installed at Downing Street to restore order post-Partygate, has also worked closely with Crosby. Interestingly the same questions asked in recent years about Crosby’s companies and their past relationships with the fossil fuel industry are now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/076df7d0-fc53-4ab7-828c-adcf1bb1c76c\">being asked in Whitehall</a>, as the government wrestles with what to do about soaring gas bills.</p> <p>The Treasury is visibly warming to the idea of a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, just so long as it doesn’t look like Labour’s windfall tax plan. But reports that Downing Street considers such a move “un-Conservative” have set rumours swirling. Johnson has never noticeably cared whether something is or isn’t conservative, if it’s popular. But Canzini cares. He is close to the pro-Brexit, low-tax, strongly ideological Tory right in Britain, some of whom also happen to be hostile to the net-zero agenda and may prefer to see fuel bills cut by scrapping green taxes (which fund the development of renewable energies in the longer term) than introducing new taxes.</p> <p>The outcome of all this wrangling obviously matters most to people who can’t pay their heating bills, but it’s a litmus test of Downing Street’s intentions too. If the windfall tax doesn’t happen some may begin to wonder – as an unnamed MP <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-canzini-the-key-player-in-westminster-youve-never-heard-of-5t7fftckm\">suggested recently to the Times</a> – about the government’s commitment to ban the installation of <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/gas-boiler-ban-explained-when-boilers-banned-2035-how-heat-pump-grant-works-1256370\">new gas boilers by 2035</a>. Does Johnson really want to go into an election arguing with outraged pensioners who can’t afford to replace their central heating? Or is this bold climate policy too at risk of being deemed a “barnacle on the boat”, that famous Crosby shorthand for anything that creates unnecessary friction or muddies the message?</p> <p>Contrary to popular belief, Crosby disciples don’t just blindly run the same hard-right campaign every time. Instead his hallmark is clarity, or the disciplined repetition of one key message carefully tailored to electoral circumstances, excluding everything else. That was as true of the London mayoral campaign he ran, pitching Johnson as a cuddly liberal, as of Levido’s tub-thumping “Get Brexit Done” campaign. But campaigns are ultimately just strategies for helping a party survive in office; they’re not necessarily about providing what a country actually needs. What’s interesting about Australia is that voters seem to have been pragmatically focused on the latter.</p> <p>Morrison was found wanting in thoroughly practical ways by climate emergencies and Covid. Some of Le Pen’s wilder ideas about tackling the cost of living crisis <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2fc8f0da-3be5-4b8e-8cee-35aad1590863\">fell apart under scrutiny</a>. Donald Trump did not make America great again. Simple answers to complex problems appeal, but they don’t actually work, and when that becomes painfully obvious – whether because wildfire smoke is choking your Melbourne suburb, or because your export business is collapsing thanks to Brexit – then populists become vulnerable. Perhaps the most useful lesson to take from Australia is that bad politics can still melt on contact with inconvenient truths. That feeling you vaguely recognise, but can’t quite put a finger on? That would be hope.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/may/23/todd-boehly-purchase-of-chelsea-set-to-be-completed-this-week-abramovich","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T15:38:47Z","webTitle":"Todd Boehly purchase of Chelsea set to be completed this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/23/todd-boehly-purchase-of-chelsea-set-to-be-completed-this-week-abramovich","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/may/23/todd-boehly-purchase-of-chelsea-set-to-be-completed-this-week-abramovich","fields":{"headline":"Todd Boehly purchase of Chelsea set to be completed this week","trailText":"The sale of Chelsea is likely to be completed this week with Roman Abramovich expected to agree to forgo a £1.6bn loan","body":"<p>The sale of Chelsea looks increasingly likely to be completed this week with the government optimistic that Roman Abramovich’s £1.6bn loan to the club will not go to the Russian or his family.</p> <p>There had been fears that a takeover by Todd Boehly’s consortium would fall through because of delays caused by the debt owed by Chelsea’s parent company, Fordstam Ltd, to Camberley International Investments, a Jersey-based company with suspected links to Abramovich.

Trifles and all-day drinking","trailText":"The outpouring of sentimentality leaves me cold – and I am sure the Queen feels the same. But silliness always stirs my national pride","body":"<p>There was only one thing Mr Z wanted from 2022, which was to be out of the country for the jubilee. Unfortunately, I failed to prioritise this one solitary wish, and now it’s too late because I am committed to making a trifle.</p> <p>Somehow a significant voice has been lost in the conversation about this joyful event. There are the people who love the Queen more dearly than their own kin, who have been making bunting for months and practising how to bake in red, white and blue; and then there are the enemies they constantly shadow-box, those who would tear down the monarchy for Marxism, or whatever. Missing from this are all the people who have, let’s say, a more textured view. We don’t hate the Queen – far from it.</p> <p>OK, so we may be a bit different in sensibility. She hates garlic, and I’m not wild about corgis, but I’m sure I would come round to them if I met more, and I have dearly loved family members who won’t even eat onions. True, I’m not cock-a-hoop about hierarchies based on historical wealth; I think Prince Andrew would have quite different prospects without the power of the assembled establishment behind him; and I’m hard pushed to choose between Princes William and Harry. Probably, the worst and best things each says about the other are equally true. None of this adds up to any feeling about the monarch more intense than that she is probably an all right person, doing what she can, in circumstances that none of us would choose. Come on, who would choose to be the Queen?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f5965f9e773c335e49da7df301242646a129fee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f5965f9e773c335e49da7df301242646a129fee/72_205_2454_2128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Queen cuts a cake to celebrate the start of the platinum jubilee last February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"867\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Queen cuts a cake to celebrate the start of the platinum jubilee last February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The objectionable thing about the jubilee – the reason sensible people would spend the weekend underground, or in Amsterdam, or unconscious – is the mad genuflecting, the bowing and scraping, the emotionality it demands. It’s not even as meaningful as an atheist kneeling in front of the pope. At least with him, you could muster some ambient respect from knowing that some people believed in it all. This is patriotism rendered as kitsch, a huge performance of plastic loyalty.</p> <p>I know for a fact, garlic and corgis notwithstanding, that nobody would agree with me more on this than the Queen herself. This is what the royals are all about. They certainly don’t parade their emotions – but more than that, they hate emoting. Do they use their loathing of sentimentality to mask an absence of real feeling? Who knows? I bloody don’t. But I know for a cast iron fact that if the Queen spent five minutes on eBay, looking at the unending pages of “I love you ma’am” biscuit cutters and random assorted items of decorative Britishness, she would think, “Jesus, another <em>outpouring</em>. Only this time it’s worse. Nobody even died.”</p> <p>On the other hand, there are elements of the prospective celebrations that fill me with national pride. I love the way the great British public grabs with both hands the chance to start drinking at 11am; attendantly, the lengths they will go to to normalise this as a community activity, so that all social barriers and traffic systems are torn down, to legitimise delinquency as a street party.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I love the way the great British public grabs with both hands the chance to start drinking at 11am</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a4310/the-crack-up/\">the sign of a first-class intelligence is to be able to hold two conflicting ideas at once</a>, the sign of a first-class patriotism is similar, with an extra dimension: to hate every serious iteration of national pride, while still loving every silly one. Moreover, to recognise that it’s in the silly stuff that nations distinguish themselves, and are at their best, while whenever we try to sketch out a serious “British value”, it’s generally on a principle with which any other given nation would agree, and in the act of trying to assert we’re the best at it, we capsize it altogether.</p> <p>I will be on British soil for the jubilee; I will make a trifle, probably with a stab at a colour scheme. I will resist with every sinew any British exceptionalist, Queen-worshipping, drummed-up, tear-jerky servility. Not just for me, but for the institution of monarchy itself. If it has one capacity in which it is singular – in the Queen’s generation at least – it’s for restraint.</p> <p>• Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/23/imran-ahmad-khan-sentenced-to-18-months-over-sexual-assault-of-boy-15","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T15:35:32Z","webTitle":"Imran Ahmad Khan sentenced to 18 months over sexual assault of boy, 15","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/imran-ahmad-khan-sentenced-to-18-months-over-sexual-assault-of-boy-15","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/imran-ahmad-khan-sentenced-to-18-months-over-sexual-assault-of-boy-15","fields":{"headline":"Imran Ahmad Khan sentenced to 18 months over sexual assault of boy, 15","trailText":"Ex-MP jailed after being expelled from Tory party following conviction for groping teenager at party in 2008","body":"<p>The former Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan has been sentenced to 18 months in jail for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy after plying him with gin at a party in 2008.</p> <p>The 48-year-old was expelled from the Conservative party and later resigned from the Commons, triggering a byelection in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, after he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/tory-mp-imran-ahmad-khan-guilty-sexually-assaulting-boy-15\">convicted last month</a> following a trial at Southwark crown court.</p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Baker, said Khan should serve 18 months, “half on custody, released on license for the remainder of the term, subject to recall should you commit a further offence”.</p> <p>Baker said the usual starting point for a sentence would be between two and four years’ custody. His sentence took into account the psychological harm caused to the complainant and his vulnerability, after his mother said he had not been “worldly wise” for his age.</p> <p>He said: “I do not accept you have remorse, rather the only regret you feel is towards yourself for having found yourself in the predicament you face as a result of your actions.”<br><br>The judge gave a lesser sentence in light of an absence of previous convictions, the value of Khan’s work, testimonies that he was a “man of positive good character”, and that he had “lost much of the status you built up”. He acknowledged that he may not have known the complainant’s age, and accounted for Khan’s ill health and the fact he is a registered carer for his elderly mother.</p> <p>Describing the events, the judge said the offence had taken place when Khan was aged 34, late at night on 8 January in 2008 in the complainant’s bedroom, while he was a guest staying the night in the family’s home after a party.</p> <p>He noted that the family placed their trust in him after guests had been led to believe he was “some form of foreign royalty”, based on an in-joke among friends that his long name meant his grandfather had been a tribal chief in Pakistan – “a title you clearly enjoyed and did nothing to discourage”.</p> <p>He described how Khan was permitted to share a bedroom with the 15-year-old and his younger brother, where he tried to persuade the boy to drink a gin and tonic by pushing it into his mouth, and invited him to watch pornography on his laptop. When the boy refused and climbed into his bunk bed, Khan reached up to feel around his legs and groin area “despite the complainant repeatedly moving his body away”. <br><br>The complainant ran to his parent’s bedroom, where his mother recalled that he was “shaking” and his father said “he was inconsolable”. The younger brother said the boy “was crying in a manner he had never cried before”.</p> <p>Khan’s accuser read a statement to the court describing the impact the incident had on his life, from finding it difficult to be touched during his teenage years to the toll the trial had taken on his mental health, including suicidal thoughts. He said it had put his relationship “under intense strain” and that he had turned down work due to stress, which meant his “businesses [were] floundering”.<br><br>“I worry when I have my own children I will find it difficult to leave them alone with strangers,” he said, noting how his parents had struggled to cope with their own feelings of guilt for allowing Khan to attend a party at their house.</p> <p>The judge declined the request for a suspended sentence from Khan’s QC, Gudrun Young, who argued he had already been punished by the high profile nature of the case, which had left his life and reputation “in ruins”.</p> <p>She said that if the trial had taken place 14 years ago it would have occurred before he held public office, and the absence of press interest would have allowed him to rebuild his life.</p> <p>“The prospect of him committing further offences is vanishingly small,” she argued, adding: “There is no sentence this court can impose, whether days, weeks or years, which can come close to how he’s already been punished and will continue for the rest of his life. He can never escape this, he will always be known as a disgraced former MP.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/may/23/englands-farrell-and-smith-partner-up-to-revitalise-attack-for-australia-tour","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T15:30:51Z","webTitle":"England’s Farrell and Smith partner up to revitalise attack for Australia tour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/23/englands-farrell-and-smith-partner-up-to-revitalise-attack-for-australia-tour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/may/23/englands-farrell-and-smith-partner-up-to-revitalise-attack-for-australia-tour","fields":{"headline":"England’s Farrell and Smith partner up to revitalise attack for Australia tour","trailText":"Owen Farrell has returned to England fold for a mini training camp where he and Smith are plotting much-needed improvements","body":"<p>Owen Farrell has returned to the England squad with a renewed hunger and has teamed up with Marcus Smith to set about revitalising their misfiring attack, according to the assistant coach Martin Gleeson.</p> <p>Farrell missed the entire Six Nations through injury but has returned to the England fold for a mini training camp where he and Smith are plotting much-needed improvements before the summer tour of Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/21/eddie-jones-casts-leinsters-power-game-as-the-template-for-england\">Eddie Jones casts Leinster’s power game as the template for England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eddie Jones has made no secret of his desire to pair Smith and Farrell together in the 10-12 axis – ideally with Manu Tuilagi outside them – but, because of injuries and Covid complications, the two have played only 68 minutes together, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/13/england-australia-autumn-international-rugby-union-match-report\" title=\"\">against Australia last autumn</a>.</p> <p>In Farrell’s absence, England scored only eight tries – five of which against Italy – during a disappointing Six Nations campaign. Since making his comeback for Saracens, however, Farrell has shown encouraging signs of form, having slipped off the boil last season and enduring a disappointing British &amp; Irish Lions tour of South Africa.</p> <p>England gathered on Sunday for their three-day camp in south-west London to begin preparations for the tour of Australia. Gleeson, the attack coach who is confident of “significant improvements” against the Wallabies, said Farrell and Smith have been putting their heads together.</p> <p>“[Owen] is key for us, a really important figure within the squad,” Gleeson said. “In the autumn him and Marcus got on really well. He drives a lot of the behaviours, the attitude, the desire in the team. The guy is hungry. He’s a student of the game. We have little groups with him, me and Marcus, speaking about what we need to do. It’s good to have him back in camp, really good to have his presence back again. I think it’s going to be a massive positive for the group.</p> <p>“They do work together really well, and I think [Owen] can free up Marcus a little bit so he doesn’t have too much to think about. Marcus plays with a smile on his face, plays what he sees and is pretty instinctive. [Owen] can be really controlled and methodical. The combination of those two from what I’ve seen is a good one.”</p> <p>Tuilagi’s return to the squad has also been welcomed by England while Gleeson is impressed by what he has seen from the 19-year-old London Irish speedster Henry Arundell. England will face the Barbarians on 19 June before seeking to extend their winning sequence against the Wallabies to nine.</p> <p>“From the Australia tour we want to see a significant improvement in where we’re going,” Gleeson said. “The next bit is the biggest bit where we’ll hopefully see the biggest difference in our attack.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/may/23/john-oliver-subway-franchisees","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T15:29:47Z","webTitle":"John Oliver on Subway franchisees: ‘Dream turned into a nightmare’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/23/john-oliver-subway-franchisees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/23/john-oliver-subway-franchisees","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver on Subway franchisees: ‘Dream turned into a nightmare’","trailText":"The Last Week Tonight criticised the sandwich store for its punishing practices that leave franchisees trapped and at a financial loss","body":"<p>John Oliver took aim at Subway’s franchise rules and regulations, warning against the company’s increasingly criticised practices.</p> <p>The Last Week Tonight host called the sandwich store “Dad’s attempt at dinner” before explaining that it has been in the news a lot lately and “rarely for anything good”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/16/john-oliver-us-utility-companies-last-week-tonight-recap\">John Oliver on the power of US utility companies: ‘The only game in town’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were accusations of fraud after it was claimed that the tuna being used wasn’t actually tuna, a case in Ireland where it was alleged that the bread couldn’t legally be called bread because of too much sugar, another case where the foot-long sandwiches were criticised for not being a foot long and a viral video of a Subway worker putting his penis on the bread.</p> <p>Subway remains the biggest restaurant chain in the US through sheer number of stores but thousands have been closing and franchisees have been getting restless, with 100 writing an open letter expressing concerns. Oliver said that their “dream has turned into a nightmare”.</p> <p>It was founded as a single sub shop in 1965 by Fred DeLuca, who was “obsessed with expansion”, Oliver said. Seeking to “create the image of success”, in DeLuca’s words, he continued to open locations, though the business didn’t make a profit for 15 years. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDdYFhzVCDM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jDdYFhzVCDM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Oliver said DeLuca had “an insatiable appetite for growth” and as the company became bigger, one of the reasons for the extreme expansion was the ease of opening a store. All you need is a plug, no deep-fryer or gas grill. But Oliver joked: “It is a restaurant serving human food, not an air mattress.”</p> <p>The startup costs are also significantly lower than for competitors, between $200-$500,000 compared with more than $1m like McDonald’s. But they bring in a lot less money, averaging about $400,000 a year compared with $3m for a McDonald’s.</p> <p>There’s also the issue of how much franchisees make. For a McDonald’s, they pay about 8% of their profits but for Subway it’s more like 12.5%, the highest fees for any chain, with a quarter of this funnelled into advertising, hence the wall-to-wall ads and product placement we see.</p> <p>“They are largely at the mercy of decisions their parent company makes,” Oliver noted. “So if Subway decides to change the menu or redesign the stores, franchisees may be on the hook for those costs. Also if the company announces a promotion or a discount, stores might have to go along with it even if it’s a money-loser for them.”</p> <p>The company also allows locations to open near each other and cannibalise their business with contracts allowing unlimited rights to directly compete. Corporate still gets royalty fees on every sale.</p> <p>There are also business development agents, who are often franchise owners themselves, who control a certain area and are tasked with finding and approving new stores and overseeing inspections for stores in their area.</p> <p>But these inspections can be “exceptionally harsh”, such as one employee who was criticised for “slicing veg in a choppy manner”.</p> <p>There’s an incentive to be harsh. If a store has multiple violations then Subway can terminate a franchisee agreement and resell, sometimes to the agent themselves at a discounted price.</p> <p>Oliver said one big issue is that “potential owners don’t fully know what they’re signing up to”, with there being “no easy way to find out what you might earn before you open”.</p> <p>The company won’t tell you and the FTC doesn’t require them to even if other companies do, such as Burger King.</p> <p>The senior leadership recommends calling other franchisees but they also added an aggressive non-disparagement clause so others can’t give info to a potential franchisee. Oliver also added that “calling people is for divorcees and serial killers”.</p> <p>Contracts also threaten cease-and-desist letters and biased arbitrations when speaking out to the media and the newest agreement even punishes for subjecting the brand to ridicule.</p> <p>Oliver expressed sympathy for those who spend “life savings on a store stuck in a business model that was stacked against them from the start”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2022/may/23/cathal-coughlan-frontman-with-irish-indie-bands-microdisney-and-fatima-mansions-dies-aged-61","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T15:28:59Z","webTitle":"Cathal Coughlan, frontman with Irish indie bands Microdisney and Fatima Mansions, dies aged 61","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/23/cathal-coughlan-frontman-with-irish-indie-bands-microdisney-and-fatima-mansions-dies-aged-61","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/may/23/cathal-coughlan-frontman-with-irish-indie-bands-microdisney-and-fatima-mansions-dies-aged-61","fields":{"headline":"Cathal Coughlan, frontman with Irish indie bands Microdisney and Fatima Mansions, dies aged 61","trailText":"Singer celebrated for versatile, sometimes confrontational songcraft had suffered a long illness","body":"<p>Cathal Coughlan, frontman with acclaimed indie bands Fatima Mansions and Microdisney, has died aged 61. His family announced the news, saying he “slipped away peacefully in hospital after a long illness”.</p> <p>Born in Cork, Coughlan first formed Microdisney with guitarist Sean O’Hagan in 1980, relocating to London in 1983. Playing variously smooth and jangling indie-pop, there was only the briefest brush with mainstream success when the single Town to Town came close to the UK Top 40, but they became much admired in the UK and Ireland indie scenes and recorded numerous sessions for John Peel. “I probably saw popular music as an easy route to cultural mobility, wherein a person with my then-fitful attention span and limited tolerance for the ‘wider picture’ of learning could live a creative life,” he later reflected.</p> <p>Microdisney split in 1988 and Coughlan formed Fatima Mansions, who broadened into everything from intense punk-adjacent rock to Europop and romantic balladry, with Coughlan celebrated for his intense, full-throated delivery. He later described his mindset at the time as “an outlaw mentality. The experience of having been in a band that was doing OK and tumbling out of it was pretty unsettling and I was existing on a hovercraft of alcohol and caffeine.” The band supported U2 for a leg of 1992’s Zoo TV tour, and had an unlikely Top 10 hit that year with an eerie trip-hop cover of Bryan Adams’ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3NLPSoU46k\">(Everything I Do) I Do It for You</a> (on a double A-side single with Manic Street Preachers’ cover of the theme from MASH).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnvsgWD_pAQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FnvsgWD_pAQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The band’s last recordings came in 1994. Coughlan also collaborated with comedian Sean Hughes as the duo Bubonique, and released a series of solo albums, most recently <a href=\"https://louderthanwar.com/cathal-coughlan-song-of-co-aklan/\">Song of Co-Aklan</a> in 2021. This year, he released an album as <a href=\"https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsandculture/arid-40815069.html\">Telefís</a>, a duo he formed with producer Jacknife Lee. In 2018, Microdisney briefly re-formed for a pair of concerts.</p> <p>Among those paying tribute was musician Luke Haines, who had collaborated with Coughlan on the high concept project <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_North_Sea_Scrolls\">The North Sea Scrolls</a>. “I have no words at the moment.

Cádiz’s coach was shattered, soaking wet and could hardly walk, T-shirt muddy and back gone, but he’d do it all over again. Even the bit where, liberated at last, he threw himself through the rain and on to the grass at the feet of his players and their fans. Especially that bit: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cadiz_CF/status/1528633499376357377?s=20&amp;t=4xG4JaX_FxbbalKfnsYf3w\">this was a team picture</a> they had desperately wanted to take, the photo of a first division side. It had hurt, the man who hid his fears from those he led struggling to get up again and limping away, the season taking everything from all of them, but they’ll be back. Having dragged themselves from relegation 1,000km from home, salvation was delivered on the final day in Vitoria.</p> \n<p>Vitoria, Pamplona and Granada. “We were playing three games in one,” Sergio said. The smallest thing is everything sometimes, football as cruel as it is brilliant. A penalty given and taken away on 86 minutes, a post on 92, a spot-kick missed by the man who least deserved to miss it, everything still on edge to the very last whistle: at the end of week 38, in which three clubs’ destinies were intertwined, the team who had it hardest, the only side whose fate wasn’t in their own hands, had survived. So had the team whose manager admitted they were “liquidated” a fortnight ago, the “walking dead”, handed an unlikely lifeline in the n92nd minute of the penultimate week. As for the team best placed to stay up – an 85% chance of survival, the stats said, and that sold them short – they had gone down. In short, Cádiz and Mallorca will be in <em>primera</em> next year; Granada, European quarter-finalists last season, will not.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/23/milan-triumph-of-the-collective-finally-casts-off-istanbul-syndrome-serie-a\">Milan’s triumph of the collective finally casts off ‘Istanbul Syndrome’ | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cádiz, Mallorca and Granada went into the final day on 36, 36 and 37 points respectively. Granada had just lost for the first game in five and the week before that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/09/jorge-molina-lets-joy-in-at-last-granada-la-liga-survival-fight\">they had beaten Mallorca, scoring six</a>. In the event of finishing level, head-to-head would see them through. Of 27 possible combinations, Granada would go down in only four. Cádiz had to play Alavés, Mallorca faced Osasuna while Granada had Espanyol. Safe but on Spain’s longest winless run, Espanyol had a caretaker manager and were missing their top scorer – the man who had scored more than four times as many goals as second highest. Granada were also the only team playing at home, Los Cármenes packed.</p> \n<p>Which is not to say the others went alone. Three flights set off from Palma at 2.15am, 2.45am and 3.15am on Sunday, returning again 24 hours later, travel and ticket for €50. The 484 allocation sold out swiftly, and plenty more Mallorca fans made the trip. Relegated Alavés, meanwhile, had put prices high precisely to prevent the place being full of visitors – a gesture the home supporters considered so out of order, another mistake in a catalogue of mismanagement that had precipitated their fall, that they decided to use their membership to help Cádiz fans. In total, 1,000 or so headed north.</p> \n<p>Injured winger Iván Alejo was among them. “Stiffer than Gareth Bale,” in his words, he was sitting in the stand, watching that game on the pitch and the other two on his phone, TV cameras watching him watch them. From there, he saw a nervous Mallorca limp towards the break: “There were too many emotions,” coach Javier Aguirre said. He also saw Granada lose Luis Milla after 30 minutes. And that was about it. By half-time, there were no goals, and not much football. “We started well but started to make the mistakes of a month ago,” Aitor Karanka admitted. “Today, we felt the pressure”. Cádiz too had been inhibited, “small” in their manager’s words.</p> \n<p>Early in the second half, Ángel Rodríguez gave Mallorca the lead after a gorgeous move. He raced into the corner, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsf_podcast/status/1528456130200223745?s=20&amp;t=g9ErpGcVvTbZFmZcKrV42w\">ball up his top</a>; Mallorca’s fans went mad; and Aguirre turned to look for his wife. “She must have gone to the toilet or something,” he said. Mallorca moved two points clear of relegation, which was bad enough for Cádiz and about to get worse. On 71 minutes, Anthony Lozano was standing at the side of the pitch about to come on when a ripple went around the ground. Something was happening. Behind him, Alejo was looking at the screen, nodding, about to tell them what. Granada had a penalty.</p> \n<p>This was it, over. Mallorca led. Now, Granada would too.</p> \n<p>Jorge Molina was standing on the spot, Diego López before him: 80 years between them. Normally Milla would take the penalty but Molina was their top scorer, the man whose extraordinary performance had seemingly secured survival <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/09/jorge-molina-lets-joy-in-at-last-granada-la-liga-survival-fight\">when they beat Mallorca 6-2</a>. Molina took a big breath, the weight of the world on big shoulders, and struck his penalty just past the post. Espanyol defender Sergi Gómez gave him an apologetic pat. High in the corner of El Sadar, Pamplona, there was a roar from Mallorca’s fans. In the stands at Mendizorrotza, Vitoria, Alejo clenched his fists and started shouting out a lifeline: come on, come on.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f37b22b9d93708cad4560d03a67183986c9897ba\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f37b22b9d93708cad4560d03a67183986c9897ba/0_99_3002_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jorge Molina’s penalty rolls the wrong side of the post.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jorge Molina’s penalty rolls the wrong side of the Diego López’s right-hand post.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran Santiago/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He had hardly stopped when he was off again. Iza Carcelén crossed and Lozano was there first, scoring. It was his first touch, the ball barely in play a minute since he came on, just two passing between the penalty miss in Granada and the goal in Vitoria: four points in the blink of an eye. Alejo set off down the stand, limping, nodded at the steward and clambered over the fence on to the pitch celebrating. “I made my ankle worse, but I’ve got a month to recoverer now,” he said afterwards in an interview that opened with him shouting: “Bloody hell! Shit on the bitch!”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/23/marseille-st-etienne-ligue-1-final-day-psg\">Marseille were the big winners in Ligue 1’s topsy-turvy final day</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cádiz were out of the relegation zone and Granada were going down but a single moment would shift everything. Anyone could go down and anyone could survive. Next goal wins. Or loses.</p> \n<p>Mallorca got it on 83 minutes. Clément Grenier, who had only been on the pitch for nine minutes and 59 all season, scored it, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsf_podcast/status/1528462745997389829?s=20&amp;t=g9ErpGcVvTbZFmZcKrV42w\">prompting a multi-player pileup</a> in the corner. Mallorca were virtually safe, Cádiz still clinging to their place, all too aware that a goal at either ground and Granada would push them into the abyss. With three minutes left, Cádiz conceded a penalty for a Pacho Espino handball only for VAR to take it away again. Granada, though, were pressing for the goal that would save them. In the 92nd minute, they almost got it, Molina’s close-range header saved. Then Carlos Bacca’s deflected shot hit the outside of the post.</p> \n<p>In Vitoria, the full-time whistle went, celebrations on hold until it went in Granada too. And then they went wild, Alejo limping over and planting a kiss on Lozano’s cheek. A missed penalty from Álvaro Negredo last week had put them in this mess; a missed penalty from Molina had got them out of it again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba0c34f4-9dec-4f79-b00d-3bf800cbad9c\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://football.theguardian.com/match-redirect/4263680\"></a>Barcelona 0-2 Villarreal, Real Sociedad 1-2 Atlético Madrid, Sevilla 1-0 Athletic Bilbao, Alavés 0-1 Cádiz, Granada 0-0 Espanyol, Osasuna 0-2 Mallorca, Elche 3-1 Getafe, Valencia 2-0 Celta Vigo, Rayo Vallecano 2-4 Levante, Real Madrid 0-0 Real Betis.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There was silence in Granada, their revival under Karanka not enough. Molina, a mountain of a man, looked broken. Cameras closed on his little daughter crying. It was a hard watch: him of all people. He stood before supporters, tears in his eyes, palms out. Afterwards, fans chanted his name through the fence, consoling him. Forty years old, it is five years since he returned to primera, a place <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jan/21/jorge-molina-road-to-verge-europe-getafe-la-liga\">he had graced like few others</a>. Back then, he had dragged Getafe up as top scorer, just as he had done with Betis two years earlier.

Sometimes, he wonders why he does this to himself; other times, like this, he knows exactly why. “What we went through after the 6-2 I wouldn’t wish on anyone,” he said. “We were like ghosts.

He is leaving after six years at the club he helped bring up from Segunda B. This is the first season they haven’t gone up or down. “Now tonight at least I can sleep easy,” he said, but sleeping wasn’t really on their minds, pizzas and beers loaded on a trestle table by the team bus, champagne open. It had been some day, and it had only just started for Cádiz and Mallorca, flights home, then nights out, the tension released at last, nine months and 90 minutes later.</p> \n<p>“It’s like the captain on the Titanic: you have to give them confidence, normality,” Sergio said. “But then there’s the tension, the emotion and it affects you. It’s like a film script. . It was all very macabre. The script was bombproof, pure tachycardia. How am I? Exhausted.” But it was done and Cádiz’s captain José Mari was beaming. “We’re the happiest footballers in the world,” he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

month","body":"<p>Scientists have created genetically edited tomatoes, each containing as much provitamin D3 – the precursor to vitamin D – as two eggs or a tablespoon of tuna. </p> <p>Outdoor field trials of the tomatoes are expected to begin in the UK next month, and if successful, could provide an important new dietary source of vitamin D.</p> <p>Approximately 13-19% of Britons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/03/study-to-decide-whether-vitamin-d-should-be-added-to-food\">have low levels of vitamin D</a>, which is needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. Our main source of this nutrient comes from exposing the skin to sunlight, which converts provitamin D3 into an active form of vitamin D that our bodies can use.</p> <p>However, in the UK there is only enough sunlight to achieve this between April and September, meaning we have to rely on dietary sources – such as oily fish, red meat, egg yolks and mushrooms – or supplements. This is particularly challenging for vegans, as many supplements contain lanolin from sheep’s wool.</p> <p>“Gene-editing tomatoes to accumulate provitamin D3 at levels above recommended dietary guidelines could result in better health for many especially as tomatoes are a widely accessible and readily eaten food,” said Guy Poppy, a professor of ecology at the University of Southampton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tomato plants were created by making tiny changes to an existing tomato gene using an editing technique called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2019/mar/28/the-biggest-revolution-in-gene-editing-crispr-cas9-explained-video\">Crispr-Cas9</a>. “It’s like a pair of molecular tweezers, which you can use to precisely snip out a very small fragment of the gene to enhance a desirable trait in plants a lot quicker than traditional breeding process, and without introducing any foreign DNA from other species,” said Jie Li at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, who led the research.</p> <p>In this case, their focus was an enzyme found in tomato plants that normally converts provitamin D3<sub> </sub>into cholesterol. By altering this enzyme, the researchers managed to block this pathway, meaning provitamin D3 accumulated in the tomatoes’ fruits and leaves.</p> <p>They calculated that the amount of provitamin D3 in one tomato fruit – if converted to vitamin D3 – would be equivalent to levels present in two medium-sized eggs or 28 grams of tuna. To convert this into active vitamin D3, the fruit would still need to be exposed to UVB light, or they could potentially be grown outdoors, something the researchers plan to test in upcoming field trials. The research was published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-022-01154-6\">Nature Plants</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/03/study-to-decide-whether-vitamin-d-should-be-added-to-food\">Study to decide whether vitamin D should be added to food </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It’s a nice example of the use of gene-editing technologies to make a very specific change to a crop,” said Prof Gideon Henderson, the chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p> <p>Such “precision-edited” crops are the subject of a bill, set out in the Queen’s speech, which will allow gene-edited plants to be treated differently to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) – the cultivation of which is governed by strict European rules that the UK hopes to move away from.</p> <p>“It’s an example of the type of product that could pass through traditional GMO legislation, but would do so very slowly under the present regulatory environment and could take decades to navigate the system,” said Henderson.</p> <p>Unlike GMOs, the tomato plants do not contain genes from other organisms and could theoretically have been created through selective breeding – albeit much more slowly.

The actor, who is surprisingly charming as he speaks from his sickbed via Zoom, says that, despite swapping school for Hollywood at the age of 14, he was never exempt from the universal awkwardness, anxiety and heartbreak of adolescence. In fact, it’s only now that Badgley feels he can revisit those turbulent years – and he has decided to do it for his first ever podcast.</p> <p><a href=\"https://podcrushed.com/\">Podcrushed</a> is a series in which Badgley starts each episode by reading out a listener-submitted story about their most poignant middle-school memory; the first is from a girl who pretended to have a heart attack in front of a crush rather than be forced to speak to him. Along with his friends and co-hosts – the super likable Sophie Ansari and Nava Kavelin (“We met when Penn was friends with my roommate, and I’d just have to act like it was normal that Penn Badgely was sitting in my kitchen”) – they reflect on their own experiences of excruciating crushes and low self-esteem. With celebrity guests, such as Badgley’s former co-stars Leighton Meester (Gossip Girl) and Victoria Pedretti (You) thrown into the mix, it’s frothy but thoughtful – and satisfyingly nostalgic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"55b2005e835e5bc2b778752ab7032286a46610cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55b2005e835e5bc2b778752ab7032286a46610cf/0_0_2992_2285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Badgley (left) in Gossip Girl, 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"764\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Satisfyingly nostalgic … Badgley (left) in Gossip Girl, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Eccles/Cw Network/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trio know full well that, thanks to Badgley’s presence, Gossip Girl and You fans are going to be tuning in – and they have a lot of fun exploiting this. Badgley’s literary narration has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/07/you-on-netflix-the-awful-sociopathic-show-were-absolutely-addicted-to\">a big Joe Goldberg vibe</a>, only without sounding like a serial killer (“A key element!” he points out). And the themes speak to outcasts who identify with his Gossip Girl character, Dan “Lonely Boy” Humphrey, who was initially written as the high school drama’s awkward antidote to Manhattan’s glossy teenage elite.</p> <p>“People associate me with a certain kind of storytelling,” says Badgley. “We have leaned into it; it just feels natural and fun. My adolescence, and growing up in Hollywood, is a running joke.”</p> <p>Ansari, an illustrator, and Kavelin, a producer – both of whom have worked in education – were initially sceptical about how relatable their chisel-jawed Hollywood host and his high-profile guests would be. They both wondered: “What awkward experiences did this person have? They are so well put together and beautiful and have everything.” Until they thought about it again: “But child actors need to deal with adult bullshit,” says Kavelin. “Can you imagine that, at 13 years old, a 40-year-old is telling you if you’re attractive enough?”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was awful when I realised, ‘You’re telling me I’m not going to be 6ft 3?’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s an experience Badgley became all-too-familiar with in his adolescence: “[It’s when] we first become conscious of our bodies. You’re mortified … people treat you based on how they see you. I remember being that age and realising, ‘This is my body and I will not have another body’ – that is terrifying. It was awful when I realised, ‘You’re telling me I’m not going to be 6ft 3?’ [He is 5ft 9].</p> <p>It wasn’t just crippling doubts about physical appearance: “When I was 12, the roles I was playing weren’t the cool guy. I’m known for playing awkward people – that’s my bread and butter, playing the awkward nice guy. But I had to look like I had my shit together in front of a casting director … The kind of insecurity I experienced was heightened.” But, he adds, “Just to be clear: I’m not asking anyone to care.”</p> <p>The truth is, people do care. We want to know if the teenage heart-throbs we grew up watching on TV had the same insecurities as us mere mortals. Badgley understands this cultural obsession, but – as someone who has played that role more than once – he worries about what real representations of teenhood the next generation, including his own stepson, will be plugged into.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"947e4f5dca4cc7c25f6303d2941f0262f5f76c5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947e4f5dca4cc7c25f6303d2941f0262f5f76c5a/0_117_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Penn Badgley in You.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Penn Badgley in You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John P Fleenor/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is this podcast his way of reconciling the part he played in that? “I think so, but not consciously. These are questions we delve into in great length,” he says. “In terms of my own personal reconciliation and my place in all of that, I’m not so sure … but I’m using this time of life as a door into culture and identity and self worth.”</p> <p>Thinking about what is out there for young people to relate to on-screen today, Ansari talks excitedly about Abbott Elementary – a forthcoming StarzPlay show about a Philadelphia public school – while Kavelin gushes about the moment she saw uncovered stretch marks on the leads in the second season of Bridgerton. And what about the Gossip Girl reboot: has Badgley watched it to see how it fares? “I haven’t, no,” he says, grinning.</p> <p>Down the line, there will be a special episode of Podcrushed in which all three hosts reveal their most memorable middle-school moments. “Most of my stories usually use something quite painful to get at some point about society,” says Badgley. “That tends to be the way I do it.” With such poetic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/05/softboi-what-is-it-instagram-q-and-a#:~:text=For%20anyone%20unfamiliar%20with%20the,feel%20superior%20to%20other%20people.\">softboi</a> lines, you are left wondering if he isn’t so far removed from the classroom crushes he plays after all.</p> <p>• <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/redditor/episodes/stitcher-presents-podcrushed\">Podcrushed</a> is out now, with new episodes every Wednesday.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/23/pandemic-parcel-boom-finally-over","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T14:51:29Z","webTitle":"Is the great pandemic parcel boom finally over?  | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/pandemic-parcel-boom-finally-over","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/pandemic-parcel-boom-finally-over","fields":{"headline":"Is the great pandemic parcel boom finally over?","trailText":"Remember when our only excitement was getting a package?

This is partly because everybody’s squeezed, but partly because deliveries are down , and from this it would seem that the new normal is steadily returning to the old normal. If you have observed the younger generation over the past two years, you’d think times had changed for ever. Teenagers and twentysomethings see a five-day delivery estimate as a breach of their human rights. I’ve seen a look of mild bafflement cross my kids’ faces when they order something on Amazon and it doesn’t arrive immediately, as if they were dealing not with a complex delivery chain but a magic lamp.</p> <p>For the rest of us, those pandemic years during which there was an actual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/22/uk-online-shopping-boom-fuels-cardboard-shortage-as-households-hoard-boxes\">cardboard shortage</a> because we were sending and receiving so many parcels were more mixed. Did our online shopping habits bring us closer to our neighbours? Maybe for a while, as we took in each other’s parcels and made like characters in a Richard Scarry book, but there was always the question: “When will this go too far? When will next-door have had an absolute bar of my repeat dishwasher tablet order? When will the smiling fade?” There was something unsettling about the galloping consumption, typified not by Royal Mail, but by Amazon. Midway through the pandemic, I ordered a fishing net from there which came in a box the size of a coffin. It begged the question, if you ordered a coffin, what size box would that come in? Would it be as big as your house? Resituating my shopping back to the actual shops was quite soothing, as it protected me from the realities of its waste and needlessness, which was a bit of a, ahem, paradox.</p> <p>The whole move to online shopping reminded me of the move from cash to credit cards. It was a simple enough switch, but would it change our attitudes in a more profound way? Would we lose our bearings and just spend indiscriminately? Or would the joy seep out of the process, so that we stopped buying stuff and, sooner or later, stopped wanting it? Neither, it turned out; we just adapted to a new reality, just as we adapted to the reality of carrying the sum of human knowledge in a phone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/10/next-day-delivery-unethical-amazon-workers-pollution\">Exhausted workers, polluting journeys: how unethical is next-day delivery?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back when we assumed that deliveries were the new normal, the mirroring prediction was that high streets would decline. It had implications for capital, playing out now in the confected new culture war of “back to the office or not?”, which is a proxy for “protect commercial landlords or not?” But it also raised questions about what on earth would happen to our high streets if we could not shop in them. Would defunct department stores become a hub for civic activism or, more likely, table football? Or would they just inevitably wither into dereliction until someone turned them into flats? Early signs from where I live are that everything that previously went bust is now a bar.</p> <p>The real mistake in all post-Covid predictions was to assume that because the changes were vast and sudden in 2020, then the change back would be similarly abrupt. Because we all moved instantly to shopping online, we would stay like that for ever, or move back en masse. All that acclimatisation to pandemic life, away from large groups of people and towards smaller ones, away from the office, towards the home office with the set-dressed Zoom background, away from the conference and the meeting towards the screen, it would all either be maintained as a seismic change, or it would reverse dramatically. That was the only way to give meaning to what was happening; that at least it might teach us something about how we’d prefer to live.</p> <p>In fact, the thing we like the least is sudden, major change. My young ’uns are still averaging about three parcels a week I’d say. All nonsense, like a single gel pen or a tiny jewellery hook. We inch back to normality via a series of minute decisions about how much cardboard we’d ideally like to dispose of, and how many neighbours we might bother to retrieve our parcels each week. If – for many of us – the answer is none, a painful home truth for Royal Mail will at least unfurl slowly.</p> <ul> <li><p>Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/23/watch-out-sharkcano-underwater-volcano-erupts-kavachi","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T14:48:32Z","webTitle":"Watch out for the Sharkcano!

Which water? </strong>The<strong> </strong>south-west Pacific Ocean, near Vangunu island in the Solomon Islands.

Now she has published her first collection, <a href=\"https://poetrybusiness.co.uk/product/a-square-of-sunlight/\">A Square of Sunlight</a>, and it’s an appealing debut. Short, plain-speaking anecdotes alternate between humour and sadness, the humour often laced with astringency. There’s a bracing urge to argue with the rules of appropriate elderly behaviour, as well as poems which recall the sense of deliverance from English stuffiness and parochialism experienced by the young in the 1960s. This week’s poem is one of the latter – with an extra, American dimension.</p> <p>Like several of the author’s “youthful-memory” poems, this one has a French setting. Cox doesn’t tell us what has brought the teenage protagonist to the Paris suburb: could she have been an au pair? (Perhaps unlikely, given her relaxed attitude to toenail-painting in the kitchen). The opening description of the street reflects a mixture of preconception (“proper French tree lined streets”) and surprised observation (the stag beetles “noisily hovering under a fretted iron street lamp”). Faithfully reporting on the unfamiliar, Cox deftly constructs a tone that’s naive but avoids self-mockery. The young woman is sharply alive to her new surroundings and armed with some of the required cultural fashion accessories, such as the Françoise Sagan novel, Bonjour Tristesse. The adult who’s remembering the scene can’t resist a few interjections, such as the remark about wanting to hear “the Beatles’ first LP” – a reference to Philip Larkin’s <a href=\"https://www.poeticous.com/philip-larkin/annus-mirabilis\">Annus Mirabilis</a>.</p> <p>The loose word-association of the band’s name, The Beatles, with the stag beetles of the opening street scene adds a tiny, pleasant stroke of redefinition. If you’re wondering, the Beatles’ first LP was Please Please Me, released in March 1963.</p> <p>The US president, John F Kennedy, was assassinated on 22 November of the same year. By introducing the radio announcement of his death, Cox evokes a much larger and more ominous political scenario. Part of that may be the question of the centrality of America to the experience of the locally marketed swinging 60s. I don’t know who first asked the question “where were you when you heard the news of the assassination?” or popularised the idea that it was something “everyone” would be able to answer. Clearly, the event entered the collective consciousness with particular intensity in the US. Cox echoes the question by answering it in her poem. Her narrator to some extent complicates the perspective. She notes the Picasso sketch of a sparrow, adding, as an interjection, that she now knows it “wasn’t an original” – a telling comment, perhaps, on the consumerism and commercialism powering the glorious fantasies of the era of liberation. But the narrator doesn’t stoop to pieties: the future is still hers, and the Frenchman’s kiss is a more potent symbol than the president’s death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/09/poem-of-the-week-importents-by-naomi-foyle\">Poem of the week: Importents by Naomi Foyle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As an afterthought, Meg Cox’s poem set me wondering which poets had written elegies for JFK.

Failure to boost pay for those being paid just 15p above the national minimum wage will also undermine efforts to recruit new staff, health leaders say.</p> <p>“Committing to giving more money to the NHS’ lowest paid workers is the right thing to do as inflation spirals and living costs mount,” said Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the whole healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>“Without a pay rise which at least matches what some parts of the private sector are offering, we are at real risk of a mass exodus of healthcare staff on the lowest pay who are quitting the NHS to search out jobs in better-paid sectors including supermarkets, pubs and high street shops.</p> <p>“Staff leaving the NHS at a time when they are most needed will also jeopardise the gains the health service is making in clearing the waiting list backlog,” Taylor said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>MPs on the health select committee are to examine the NHS workforce crisis at a meeting on Tuesday.</p> <p>Some NHS trusts are already setting up their own food banks for staff, and offering hot meals for £1 and hardship funds.

Not only did it feature the largest cast in the show’s history, it also introduced a number of promising new talents who we can expect to rise to prominence over the coming years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/22/saturday-night-live-season-finale\">This past week’s finale</a> also featured farewell performances from several of the show’s biggest names: Kate McKinnon, Pete Davidson, Aidy Bryant and Kyle Mooney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/22/saturday-night-live-season-finale\">Saturday Night Live: major cast members bid farewell in season finale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a whole, it was not one of the stronger seasons. After a lukewarm start, we got a few good episodes in the middle of its run, but the back half of the season vacillated between instantly forgettable and outright terrible.</p> <p>That said, there were still a number of excellent sketches to be found throughout. Here are the 10 best from season 47.</p> <h2>Science room</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSWlwM4s1Ds\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hSWlwM4s1Ds?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The common thread between the best episodes of the season was the host: save for one, they all gave duties to alumni, the first of whom was Jason Sudeikis. There were a couple of sketches from his episode that might have made the list, but this one from early in the episode got the biggest and most sustained laughter of the night. The science room sketches are reliant on a very simple formula – the friendly host of a children’s educational program loses his cool over the idiocy of his junior volunteers (Mikey Day and Cecily Strong) – but the fury with which Sudeikis reacts in this one (inverting the warmth of his Ted Lasso character) makes it the best of the bunch.</p> <h2>Aaron Rodgers Trump cold open</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU-WdnXJabs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CU-WdnXJabs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On the whole, this cold open from the season’s fifth episode is nothing special: another of their go-to Judge Jeanine set-ups, it’s the standard lazy run-through of weekly headlines and toothless satire aimed at conservative hysteria and hypocrisy. But it takes off halfway through with the first appearance of new featured player James Austin Johnson’s Donald Trump. Those who were familiar with Johnson’s uncanny Trump impersonation from his viral comedy videos over the last few years knew what an incredible get he was for the show, and that it was only a matter of time before the show busted it out. You can feel the electricity of the audience losing their minds over it. More than just the accuracy of Trump’s voice and mannerisms, Johnson’s interpretation works because he understands how utterly inane the former president’s rants are, turning him into a pop-culture-obsessed lunatic with an almost beatnik-like penchant for jazzy free association. It’s a huge improvement from Alec Baldwin’s terrible characterization.</p> <h2>Goober the clown on abortion</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exSZQICbSb8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/exSZQICbSb8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That same episode included this fiery performance from Cecily Strong on Weekend Update. Coming on the heels of Texas’s restrictive abortion laws Strong discusses her own abortion at 23, only she does it under the guise of the wacky Goober the clown, since “it’s a rough subject so we’re gonna do fun clown stuff to make it more palatable!” The rawness of the performance comes not from personal trauma – Strong makes it very clear that her abortion was absolutely the right decision, while emphasizing how common abortion is – but from the frustration of having to continue to fight for safe access: “We will not go back to the alley. I mean, the last thing anyone wants is a bunch of dead clowns in a dark alley.”</p> <h2>Kid Klash</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8p_SrLrsCw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R8p_SrLrsCw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As with Sudeikis’s episode, there were several sketches from Will Forte’s turn hosting that were in contention for a spot on this list, but ultimately the deranged Kid Klash makes the cut, both for how menacingly funny he is throughout, as well as for the impressive production value on display. As host of a messy, Nickelodeon-style obstacle course gameshow, Forte’s Mark Zazz puts a young contestant through sheer hell in an attempt to find a single white flag in a giant bowl of whipped cream. She gives up, but he won’t have it: “I didn’t start this gameshow to encourage children to quit like whiney little babies!” Kudos also due to Aidy Bryant for putting herself through the slapstick wringer.</p> <h2>Nugenix</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DhEEo5S9fg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_DhEEo5S9fg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>America’s greatest living actor, Willem Dafoe, hosted the strongest top-to-bottom episode of the season, even if only one of the sketches within made full use of him. Said sketch is a pre-filmed commercial for Nugenix. Dafoe, as himself, teams up with some retired ball players to sling the testosterone booster to a hapless 40-year-old who “can’t get hard any more”. Dafoe uses his singularly weird energy to great comic effect here, especially during the climax where he’s screaming in torment while being given a mechanical erection by Nugenix.</p> <h2>Peyton Manning on NFL playoffs</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgOdjs4WXvg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jgOdjs4WXvg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Far and away the most reliable professional athlete ever to host SNL, Peyton Manning popped in for a quick Weekend Update segment during the NFL playoffs. Rather than give his thoughts on the games, he recounts his addiction to Netflix’s romance series Emily in Paris. His total commitment to the bit is a thing of beauty, especially when he dramatically proclaims the show brings “a fresh take on feminism – FINALLY!” That line received probably the hardest audience laughter of the entire season, and for good reason.</p> <h2>Please Don’t Destroy – Martin’s friend</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfTv5cpmY1k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BfTv5cpmY1k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Like new featured players James Austin Johnson and Sarah Sherman, freshman show writers Ben Marshall, John Higgins and Martin Herlihy were previously known to comedy fans for the short sketches they put out online under the name Please Don’t Destroy. Their fast-paced, surreal videos made for a welcome addition to SNL, taking up a vacancy that once was host to favorites such as Saturday TV Funhouse and The Lonely Island. Always a highlight of the episodes they appear in, the funniest of the bunch sees Ben and especially John jealously squaring off with Martin’s inappropriately young, impossibly cool friend Connor. Hijinks, as always, ensue.</p> <h2>Five-timers club</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-gy_b5cPlo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W-gy_b5cPlo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After a dramatic year that included a stint in rehab, comedy superstar and former SNL writer John Mulaney made a triumphant return to the show for his fifth time hosting. As always, this marks an occasion to celebrate, even if fellow five-timers Steve Martin, Tina Fey, Candace Bergen, Paul Rudd, Conan O’Brien and Elliot Gould think the club is getting a little too big and “not special”. The volume of jokes – everyone gets at least one moment to shine – is matched only by the sheer star power on display. It’s also amazing to see Conan back on NBC and getting to say “Live, from New York!” (even if it’s already the middle of the episode).</p> <h2>Terry Fink’s 2022 Oscar predictions</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_YxSGgl93E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6_YxSGgl93E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Over the years, Alex Moffat has become the most reliably funny guest across Weekend Update. Of the various characters he plays, his best by far is Terry Fink, a friendly and excitable film critic who is in a permanent state of psychosis thanks to his constant ingestion of psychedelic drugs (“The LSD helps me L-S-See all these terrific films!”). This segment from March is the best thing he’s done during his time not just on Update but on the show as a whole. Especially good is his sustained mental breakdown, which he sells via a series of hilarious facial expressions.</p> <h2>Field correspondent Sarah Sherman gives an SNL studio tour</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgZoPczQF4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZhgZoPczQF4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The standout sketch from the season’s mostly terrible late run of episodes highlights new featured player Sherman leading a backstage tour of the studio, most of which is confined to Colin Jost’s dressing room, in which she has constructed a shrine devoted to herself and locked an intern up in a cage in order to embarrass him. Sherman’s energy and penchant for surreal horror comedy is certainly not for everyone, and in its slightly watered-down version on SNL has proven very hit-or-miss so far. That said, her one-sided rivalry with Jost has grown increasingly delightful over the season, and her performance here – especially a moment where she works through a flubbed bit of blocking – has been her best performance so far. It seems like the show is priming her for the Update desk (especially if the rumors of Michael Che’s departure pan out), which will certainly give the proceedings a weird new feel.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/may/23/up-to-100-ukraine-troops-could-be-dying-donbas-each-day-zelenskiy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T14:14:12Z","webTitle":"Up to 100 Ukraine troops could be dying in Donbas each day, says Zelenskiy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/up-to-100-ukraine-troops-could-be-dying-donbas-each-day-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/23/up-to-100-ukraine-troops-could-be-dying-donbas-each-day-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"Up to 100 Ukraine troops could be dying in Donbas each day, says Zelenskiy","trailText":"President gives insight into country’s casualties, as Luhansk governor says Russia using ‘scorched-earth’ tactics","body":"<p>Ukraine’s president has given an insight into the level of losses being suffered by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day.</p> <p>While Ukraine and its allies have made much of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/i-look-at-my-government-differently-losses-in-ukraine-test-russians-faith\">Russian losses</a> since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole.</p> <p>The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/russia-ukraine-war-severodonetsk-zelenskiy-says-donbas-hell\">Severodonetsk</a> and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two provinces that make up the Donbas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NeilPHauer/status/1528705949870981120\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Watching a Russian rocket artillery salvo being unloaded on Lyman from about 10km away.

This shift is particularly relevant for technologically advanced countries such as the United States, which invest significant resources in military medicine.”</p> <p>The new estimate came as Kyiv also revealed its worst military losses from a single attack of the Ukraine war on Monday, saying 87 people had been killed last week when Russian forces struck a barracks housing troops at a training base in the north.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/archive-zip/giv-6562kaxUpLBAUEGf/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/05/archive-zip/giv-6562kaxUpLBAUEGf/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The disclosure that scores had been killed in the attack demonstrated Russia’s ability to inflict huge losses, even far from the front. Previously, Kyiv had said eight people died in the 17 May strike on the barracks in the town of Desna.</p> <p>“Today we completed work at Desna. In Desna, under the rubble, there were 87 casualties. Eighty-seven corpses,” Zelenskiy said during a speech made by video link to business leaders in Davos, Switzerland.</p> <p>Moscow had said at the time that it hit a training base with long-range missiles. The toll Zelenskiy announced on Monday was more than double the number killed in a similar attack on a Ukrainian training base in Yaraviv in the west in March.</p> <p>The updated death toll from Desna emerged following recent remarks by senior Ukrainian officials, including the president, that warned of increasing bloodshed in the next phase of the conflict, amid anticipation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive later in the summer. </p> <p>Zelenskiy’s acknowledgment of the increasingly heavy toll on Ukraine’s military follows claims by the UK’s Ministry of Defence that since Russia invaded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, it has probably suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine-year war in Afghanistan, although those claims could not be independently verified.</p> <p>Like Ukraine, western allies including the UK have tended to emphasise Russian losses while avoiding the issue of Ukrainian losses as part of the information war with Moscow that appears in part aimed at trying to shift Russian public opinion against Putin’s invasion.</p> <p>A combination of “poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility” and a command approach that is “prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes” has led to the high Russian casualty rate, British intelligence said in its latest report released on Monday morning.</p> <p>Casualties are continuing to rise in the Donbas offensive, the report added. “The Russian public has, in the past, proven sensitive to casualties suffered during wars of choice. As casualties suffered in Ukraine continue to rise they will become more apparent, and public dissatisfaction with the war and a willingness to voice it may grow.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/may/23/pissarro-father-of-impressionism-review-film-exhibition-painter-monet-degas","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T14:00:36Z","webTitle":"Pissarro: Father of Impressionism review – quiet man of art brought into the light","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/23/pissarro-father-of-impressionism-review-film-exhibition-painter-monet-degas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/may/23/pissarro-father-of-impressionism-review-film-exhibition-painter-monet-degas","fields":{"headline":"Pissarro: Father of Impressionism review – quiet man of art brought into the light","trailText":"The impressionist painter lacks the glitzy kudos of peers such as Monet and Degas but is celebrated in this study, tied to an exhibition of his work","body":"<p>The French impressionists have proved fertile territory for gallery-film specialists Exhibition on Screen, with offerings hat-tipping Monet, Degas, Renoir and their peers. This one extends the range slightly outside the usual suspects by taking as its subject the impressionists’ Danish-French elder statesman Camille Pissarro, whose oeuvre is perhaps short on the world-conquering masterpieces of his fellows, but who nevertheless played a key role in establishing impressionism as a style, and as a movement.</p> <p>As its cue, the film takes the current Pissarro exhibition at the <a href=\"https://www.ashmolean.org/exhibitions\">Ashmolean Museum in Oxford</a>, so it’s possible to watch it, then see the paintings – or vice versa. (It was jointly mounted with Basel’s Kustmuseum, but audiences in Switzerland will have to settle for <a href=\"https://kunstmuseumbasel.ch/en/exhibitions/2021/camille-pissarro\">a virtual tour </a>as the show closed there in January.) The film is the customary solidly informative mixture of biographical detail and curatorial insight, tracing Pissarro from his early years in what was then called the Danish West Indies to Paris, via Venezuela and – while the Franco-Prussian war was raging – Norwood in London.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TqJQTyLKcE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TqJQTyLKcE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch a trailer for Pissarro: Father of Impressionism</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Pissarro’s own comments perhaps undercut the celebratory mood: his letters voice complaints that his paintings are “monotonous” and don’t “catch on” with deep-pocketed collectors. Be that as it may, the film does a nice job in humanising a hitherto-shadowy figure (in comparison, that is, with his stellar impressionist peers) courtesy of the Ashmolean’s voluminous archive.</p> <p>Artistically, Pissarro’s commitment to outdoor landscape painting and long-term interest in French rural life would be the bedrock of his work, though as his health failed his through-the-window street views pushed him towards the more commercially successful end of the movement’s output.

With Tom Marquand, her partner, also expected to be in the running, the PR potential for the sport was immense.</p> \n<p>As it turned out, Doyle’s challenge barely left the starting stalls. By the end of June, when Oisin Murphy and William Buick, the eventual winner and runner-up, had 46 and 51 wins respectively, Doyle was already well adrift on 32.</p> \n<p>In the first three weeks of the 2022 campaign, however, Doyle has hit the ground running. She rode 15 winners in May 2021 but is already up to 18 so far this month, two behind Buick – who remains the odds-on favourite for the title – and three in front of Marquand. Ben Curtis also has 18 winners but former champion Silvestre de Sousa, a 20-1 shot for the championship, has just nine and some catching up to do.</p> \n<p>It is also interesting that Doyle has been the busiest of the likely title contenders in the opening weeks of the campaign. Nikki’s Girl, the first of her seven mounts at Wolverhampton on Monday afternoon, was her 100th ride since the title race began on 30 April. Buick and Marquand had taken 91 and 84 rides, respectively, before Monday’s cards, while Curtis had just 68, and owed his current second place in the title race to a highly impressive strike rate of 26%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f562eeea-fd55-4c28-afef-0da8ba67a6d1\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Southwell:</b> 1.00 Do It For Thy Sen, 1.30 Debece, 2.02 Monteplex, 2.32 Balkotic, 3.02 Overtougeorge, 3.32 Lincoln Lyn, 4.02 Tiger Orchid.</p>\n    <p><b>Bath:</b> 1.15 Sisterandbrother, 1.50 Thismydream, 2.20 Symbol Of Hope (nb), 2.50 Silverscape, 3.20 Persuasive Powers, 3.50 Platinum Prince, 4.20 Charlie’s Yard, 4.55 Typewritten.</p>\n    <p><b>Bangor:</b> 1.40 Could Be Trouble, 2.11 Methusalar, 2.41 Stony Man, 3.11 San Agustin, 3.41 Durragh, 4.11 Lelantos.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield:</b> 4.35 Antonine Road, 5.10 Return To Dubai, 5.40 Torious, 6.10 Malrescia, 6.40 Beauzon, 7.10 Tin Fandango, 7.40 Hey Ho Let’s Go.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Newcastle:</b> 5.00 Stand Free, 5.30 Goodwood Glen (nap), 6.00 Eldar Eldarov, 6.30 Daytona Lady, 7.00 Substantial, 7.30 Clear Angel, 8.05 Secret Eagle.</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It will be all but impossible for Curtis to maintain that level of success through the summer months and even at this early stage – and before suspensions or injuries start to intervene – this year’s title could be coming down to a three-way go between Buick, Doyle and Marquand.</p> \n<p>Buick, of course, is an outstanding jockey and remains the strong favourite for the title.

Here is what we know about its likely contents – and their impact.</p> <h2>What is the report?</h2> <p>This is the final version of the report led by Gray, a senior Cabinet Office official, who was asked by Boris Johnson to uncover facts about the parties. An initial, 12-page version was published at the end of January, with the rest delayed because the Metropolitan police had begun their own, parallel inquiry. That was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/civil-servants-and-no-10-advisers-furious-over-single-fine-for-boris-johnson\">completed on Thursday</a>, and Gray can now send No 10 a much more thorough version, which is likely to name some officials at fault and could include photographs.</p> <h2>When is it coming?</h2> <p>We don’t know, but it is likely to be Tuesday or Wednesday. It is expected this week, and Johnson has promised to update MPs swiftly after it is published. The Commons is paying tribute to the Queen on Thursday, and then goes into a week of recess, so it is probable before then. The expected – but not confirmed – chronology is that Gray would send her report to No 10 in the morning, and it would be published by Downing Street soon after, with Johnson addressing MPs that afternoon.</p> <h2>What will it say?</h2> <p>That is the big question. There have been some anonymous briefings on what might come, but it is by no means certain that any have come from Gray’s team. The interim report, while light on detail, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/what-sue-gray-edited-report-into-alleged-lockdown-parties-says\">was strongly critical</a> of leadership and judgment inside No 10, and it is fair to say that nothing to emerge since then would make such a verdict unlikely again. According <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnsons-partygate-hangover-hrnbzs8mw\">to the Sunday Times</a>, Gray has said she was surprised Johnson was only fined once by the police, and believes he was responsible for other wrongdoing.</p> <h2>Who might be named?</h2> <p>The report is expected to name two dozen or so senior staff, alongside Johnson, in its description of what went wrong. Among those likely be identified include Simon Case, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service; Martin “Party Marty” Reynolds, Johnson’s former principal private secretary, who sent No 10 staff an email inviting them to “bring your own booze” to a drinks event on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/20-may-2020-what-was-uk-doing-while-no-10-aide-organised-a-party\">20 May 2020</a>; and Helen MacNamara, who was head of ethics at the Cabinet Office.</p> <h2>Who will be blamed?</h2> <p>It seems likely that Gray will, as she did in her interim report, point to a mixture of institutional failings and a lack of leadership within No 10. This would very much implicate Johnson, as he is in ultimate control, but it remains to be seen if the fuller report will point to others acting without the MP’s knowledge. Some reports have suggested Case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/21/boris-johnson-to-sacrifice-top-official-over-partygate-to-save-himself\">could be used as a scapegoat</a> by Downing Street once the report is out.</p> <h2>What will the impact be for Johnson?</h2> <p>That is the key political question. For months, Conservative MPs unhappy with his tenure as PM have said they wanted to wait for both the end of the police inquiry and Gray’s full report before deciding whether to seek a confidence vote in his leadership. However, the length of the police inquiry, and the fact Johnson was – to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/boris-johnson-and-partygate-how-did-pm-only-get-one-fine\">surprise of many lawyers</a> – fined only once for lockdown breaches, has taken the wind out of much of the rebellion. It would take some particularly damning passages, or photos, to prompt a concerted rebellion. That said, a damaging report followed by Tory losses in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/17/tories-fight-to-hold-off-labour-and-lib-dems-in-crucial-june-byelections\">next month’s byelections</a> in Wakefield and in Tiverton and Honiton could rebuild momentum for change.</p> <h2>Is the report Johnson’s last party-based hurdle?</h2> <p>No. The Commons privileges committee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/no-10-drops-attempt-to-delay-inquiry-into-whether-boris-johnson-misled-parliament\">will examine</a> whether Johnson misled parliament when he initially said he had no knowledge of parties and that he was confident all lockdown rules were followed. While the convention is that a prime minister who misleads parliament is expected to resign, Johnson is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\">no fan of parliamentary convention</a>. He says he did not deliberately mislead MPs, and intent can be hard to prove. Perhaps more sinister for him is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/partygate-photos-boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-lockdown-breaches-sue-gray-report\">prediction by Dominic Cummings</a>, his former chief aide, that photographs will soon emerge which will prove Johnson lied about parties.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/23/biden-sushi-pacific-lobster-cheeseburgers-japanese-food-fit-for-a-president","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T13:50:05Z","webTitle":"Sushi, Pacific lobster … cheeseburgers: Japanese food fit for a president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/biden-sushi-pacific-lobster-cheeseburgers-japanese-food-fit-for-a-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/23/biden-sushi-pacific-lobster-cheeseburgers-japanese-food-fit-for-a-president","fields":{"headline":"Sushi, Pacific lobster … cheeseburgers: Japanese food fit for a president","trailText":"Joe Biden’s hosts have treated him to Tokyo’s finest cuisine, but entertaining US presidents hasn’t always gone to plan","body":"<p>North Korea, China, trade and security.

Here are 10 day trips that will help you rediscover the fun of being spontaneous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d345de6c15a258d02f1112c077f852147f137320\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d345de6c15a258d02f1112c077f852147f137320/0_223_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Family crossing stepping stones in Cambridge Botanical Gardens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cambridge University Botanical Gardens is a family favourite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bax Walker/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>A botanical dream in Cambridge<br></strong>With plenty of historic sights to discover, Cambridge has a lot more going for it than just its university campuses – and it’s just over an hour away from St Pancras on <a href=\"https://www.thameslinkrailway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thameslink</a>. The Cambridge University Botanical Gardens, which boasts more than 8,000 varying plant species, is the ideal spot for solo travellers, couples or families. Bring a book to read among the blooms, or a watercolour set to capture the seasonal flowers. The nearby <a href=\"https://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fitzwilliam Museum</a> rivals the best European galleries with its collection of antiquities and modern art. And if you have a taste for modern and award-winning architecture, there’s the <a href=\"https://cambridgecentralmosque.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cambridge Central Mosque</a>, the first eco-mosque in Europe, which was specifically designed to minimise environmental impact. Within the mosque, there are beautiful gardens, exhibitions and a cafe.</p> <p><strong>A history hit in Dorking<br></strong>If you’re looking for somewhere to put your hiking boots to good use, Dorking is the place for you. You can reach the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (that’s the official name) in under an hour on a <a href=\"https://www.southernrailway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Southern</a> railway train from London Victoria. Once there, you’ll have 422 sq km (163 sq miles) of green space at your feet. Though if that’s not enough exploring for you, 15 minutes walk from the station there’s the historic Deepdene trail where you can discover the restored Hope mausoleum, the resting place of the family that once had an estate on the land. Brought your bicycle? Even better. Five miles down the road, you also have <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/polesden-lacey\" rel=\"nofollow\">Polesden Lacey</a>, a countryside retreat that looks over the Surrey Hills, with its glittering saloon full of English, Dutch and Italian paintings. A tip: go in June when the roses are blooming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a9c8b68e0ac9ae6b05f8564df62028dbffe9619\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a9c8b68e0ac9ae6b05f8564df62028dbffe9619/51_0_6366_3819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the Beachy Head chalk headland in East Sussex, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Eastbourne, visitors can hike the Seven Sisters or Beachy Head.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Dorney/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Go hiking in Eastbourne <br></strong>If you’re a fan of walking on the beach (who isn’t?), Eastbourne is the place for you.

The <a href=\"https://www.sevensisters.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seven Sisters </a>– a series of chalk cliffs – is one of southern England’s most striking landscapes and takes around four to six hours to hike. <a href=\"https://townereastbourne.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Towner Eastbourne</a>, a contemporary art gallery, is also nearby, in case you want to add some culture to your trip.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/leisure-like-a-local/gallery/2022/may/23/from-brighton-to-greenwich-10-of-the-most-instagrammable-day-trips\">From Brighton to Greenwich: 10 of the most Instagrammable day trips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>https://www.theguardian.com/leisure-like-a-local/gallery/2022/may/23/from-brighton-to-greenwich-10-of-the-most-instagrammable-day-trips</p> <p><strong>Eat your way through Portsmouth <br></strong>With its busy working port and historic naval dockyard, Portsmouth has lots for any visitor to see – and Portsmouth &amp; Southsea station is only two hours away from London Victoria on a <a href=\"https://www.southernrailway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Southern</a> train. But what you may not know is that it’s also a great city to eat in – so drag yourself away from HMS Victory and the Spinnaker tower and make time for foodie exploration. <a href=\"https://www.huntergatherer.coffee/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Hunter Gatherer</a> in Albert Rd, 200 metres back from the seafront, is a plant-based kitchen serving high-quality food from scratch. If you have a sweet tooth, head to <a href=\"https://www.huissouthsea.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Huis</a>, in Southsea, a Belgian bar where you can get your hands on some sweet Belgian waffles. And if you’re in the mood for seafood, check out the <a href=\"http://www.southseabeachcafe.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Southsea Beach Cafe</a> for some locally sourced fish and chips.</p> <p><strong>Shopping in St Albans<br></strong>Head to St Alban’s on market day – either Wednesday or Saturday – and you’ll find it brimming with colour, life and energy.

For more traditional seaside entertainment, there’s Brighton beach and <a href=\"https://www.brightonpier.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brighton Palace Pier</a> where you’ll find candyfloss and a water log flume ride. Shoppers can fill their tote bags with wares found on The Lanes, the narrow streets in Brighton’s historic quarter known for its independent designers and antique shops. But for blissful moments of not particularly doing anything, Undercliff Walk – a coastal uninterrupted walkway – can’t be beaten, nor can the <a href=\"https://brightonmuseums.org.uk/royalpavilion/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Royal Pavilion</a>, a landmark with colourful regency history. And the best thing is that Brighton is just over an hour away from London Bridge on <a href=\"https://www.thameslinkrailway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thameslink</a> and <a href=\"https://www.southernrailway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Southern</a> trains, making it the ideal impulsive British getaway.</p> <p><strong>Go glamping in a yurt in Chichester<br></strong>If nature is calling you, Chichester is the perfect place to spend some quality time outdoors – and it’s only an hour and a half away from London Victoria on a <a href=\"https://www.southernrailway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Southern</a> train.

Jump on a <a href=\"https://www.thameslinkrailway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thameslink</a> train from London Blackfriars, and you’ll be in Wimbledon in just over half an hour.</p> <p><strong>Explore wellness in Hastings <br></strong>For some, wellness is interchangeable with self-care, while, for others, it’s all about maintaining joy and seeking new experiences. On a day trip to Hastings – which is an hour and 20 minutes away from Brighton on a <a href=\"https://www.southernrailway.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Southern</a> train – you can have both. <a href=\"https://www.thewellingtoncentre.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Wellington Health &amp; Wellbeing Centre</a> offers a range of therapies from <a href=\"https://www.thewellingtoncentre.com/therapy/hot-stone-reflexology\" rel=\"nofollow\">hot stone reflexology</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.thewellingtoncentre.com/therapy/reiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reiki </a>and <a href=\"https://www.thewellingtoncentre.com/therapy/shiatsu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shiatsu</a>.

Although famous for these, this picturesque city has many hidden gems to discover too. A quintessential part of Cambridge life since the 1900s, punting is enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. You can’t visit and not take a punt at gently propelling yourself down the River Cam, which is only a 20-minute walk from Cambridge station. If you’re not confident at steering one yourself, <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/-l439/-tc48/?cmp=ga&amp;cq_src=google_ads&amp;cq_cmp=6476305822&amp;cq_con=80731138514&amp;cq_term=cambridge%20river%20tours&amp;cq_med=&amp;cq_plac=&amp;cq_net=g&amp;cq_pos=&amp;cq_plt=gp&amp;campaign_id=6476305822&amp;adgroup_id=80731138514&amp;target_id=kwd-50448472048&amp;loc_physical_ms=9045997&amp;match_type=e&amp;ad_id=511529949289&amp;keyword=cambridge%20river%20tours&amp;ad_position=&amp;feed_item_id=&amp;placement=&amp;device=c&amp;partner_id=CD951&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyMiTBhDKARIsAAJ-9VtTlt7BYoWgh6Qo4uyFmsSNTZhc5zUz8QNkK4GxGmbHoIY4q0SLeRgaAmYLEALw_wcB\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cambridge River Tours</a> has experienced punt chauffeurs who do all the hard work for you while you sit back and relax. If outdoor swimming is your thing, you’re in for a treat. Farther down the River Cam is Grantchester Meadows, which was named one of the top wild swimming locations in the UK. You can bathe alfresco in this idyllic setting, and with a range of swimming spots along the stretch of river between Cambridge and the village of Grantchester, there are plenty to choose from. Back on dry land, the <a href=\"https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cambridge University Botanic Garden</a> is an oasis in the heart of Cambridge. You’ll find a plethora of plant species (more than 8,000) from all over the world displayed across 40 exquisite acres of landscaped greenery where you can lose yourself blissfully.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"241b4cfd77308ec8d9ac786a70154e0d5fc86d54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/241b4cfd77308ec8d9ac786a70154e0d5fc86d54/612_0_2463_3079/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cambridge summer punting.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cambridge summer punting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"4b17daa1d4706dd5097a50a22e5fefa9968e8694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b17daa1d4706dd5097a50a22e5fefa9968e8694/3391_0_4403_5504/800.jpg\" alt=\"Man wild swimming in river.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man wild swimming in river.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cultura Creative Ltd/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"670029e43d456a7af3a39808c9507326b0b7532b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/670029e43d456a7af3a39808c9507326b0b7532b/0_355_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Botanical garden in Cambridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Botanical garden in Cambridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Bach/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Punt on – or swim in – the Cam before exploring the Cambridge University Botanic Garden</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Find peace in Peterborough<br></strong>Did you know that Peterborough has some stunning park life? Direct trains from St Pancras will whisk you to Peterborough, where you can roam the idyllic Nene Park.

It comprises six different meadowlands and stretches for six miles along the beautiful valley of the river Nene, with its rich diversity of wildlife species. The area is steeped in history with archaeological finds that stretch back to Roman times.

I’d say: “We’ve got to have an opener!” I’d been working on this groove with Roger Taylor, our drummer. It just wouldn’t go away. We played it at every soundcheck, every rehearsal, trying to make it work. And then we landed on this vibe and I knew we’d cracked it. That was Rio.</p> <p>It was the early 80s and we were all playing great, with absolute confidence. Doing 60 shows in six months does that to you. The song’s very flash. I like to say <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtcLKAGN-II\">it’s a young man’s bassline</a>. As I got older I thought much more economically. I could get the same effect without playing so many notes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"999886a78708149a4ea362ed6f2c45ea0d887fea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/999886a78708149a4ea362ed6f2c45ea0d887fea/0_0_3016_4104/735.jpg\" alt=\"Wet … Simon Le Bon and John Taylor pose on location for a video shoot.\" width=\"735\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘An extraordinary chemistry’ … Simon Le Bon and John Taylor pose on location for a video shoot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Express Newspapers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I loved Chic. While I was under no illusion I could play like their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/jun/04/the-chic-organization-10-of-the-best\">Bernard Edwards</a>, I was trying to nod in that direction. But what I played on Rio had power, I think. Brian Eno said in his diaries that it was always exciting to hear a band playing at the edge of their skills, even if those skills are low, and he’s right. The song is basically everything we had learned up to that point. But there was no crowding on it, despite everyone playing something that’s saying: “Me, me, me!”</p> <p>My wife and I were driving home from a restaurant recently and I put on KLOS, a rock station based in Los Angeles where we live. The first thing I heard was my bassline from Rio, with two blokes talking over it, analysing it. They couldn’t believe I played like that for seven minutes. And it made me realise that, yes, that song is a motherfucker and no one will ever be able to take that away from us. You can try. Duran Duran have taken a lot of punishment over the years – some of it deserved – but that track is here to stay.</p> <p>It’s what happens when you have five guys raised on glam, punk and beat, with the audacity to think they have something to say, pushing into each other and causing an extraordinary chemistry. I find it remarkable.</p> <h2>Nick Rhodes, keyboards</h2> <p>I was 19 and very ambitious, as was every other member of the band. We were moving ahead at full speed every day. We barely slept, did every interview we could, every TV appearance we were offered. We stayed up till the middle of the night tweaking songs and recordings and sounds. We gave our lives to Duran Duran.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTizYn3-QN0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nTizYn3-QN0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Rio is a bizarre mix. For the intro, I recorded the sound of metal rods landing on the strings of a grand piano, the kind of experimentalism I got from being into Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage. Although the video captured a moment in pop culture like nothing else, I still have very mixed feelings about it. I wouldn’t have admitted this back then but at the time, all I was worried about was getting salt water on my Antony Price suit. Simon Le Bon, our Action Man singer, loves all that, but I was not happy. I don’t like boats. Still, being on a yacht in the Caribbean and wearing an expensive suit was not the worst thing in the world. And it was only a couple of days of my life. Did any of us ever believe the video would last, past two weeks on Top of the Pops? Absolutely not.</p> <p>It did make it look as if we were only about drinking martinis on yachts, though. That was difficult to contend with. It made it difficult to be taken seriously when it looked like we were all “lifestyles of the rich and famous”. But the idea was just to make something funny and bright that worked with the song.

That’s fine. I love a lot of moaning songs. But we fully understood what was happening in the UK – we’d been through the late 70s, which was a pretty dark period, and we wanted to get out. We wanted some light. We grew up in lovely old Birmingham, a place I love dearly, along with the people, but if you looked at the 1978 skyline in Birmingham, let me tell you, you wouldn’t have wanted to stay there.</p> <p>As for the lyrics, I still don’t know what Simon writes about half the time.

It has already allowed gay ministers to marry.</p> <p>Faced with the threat of a global revolt within the Anglican communion, the Church of England has consistently refused to approve same-sex marriages.</p> <p>In 2017 the Scottish Episcopal church, which is Anglican, voted at its synod to approve same-sex marriages, becoming the first in Scotland to do so. The Church of Wales has indicated it may follow suit in several years’ time. Methodists, Quakers and the United Reformed church already conduct ceremonies.</p> <p>The measure had already been supported in an indicative vote by Church of Scotland presbyteries, which are its local governing bodies, but critics warned it could increase internal rifts and leave the church open to legal action.</p> <p>The Rev Scott Rennie, a minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/24/scotland-aberdeen-gay-priest-protestant\">at the centre</a> of a bitter and protracted dispute in the church over the employment of openly gay clergy 13 years ago, told the general assembly he was heartened that despite the fear and uncertainty surrounding the proposal, it now had majority support.</p> <p>“Marriage is a wonderful thing,” Rennie said. “My marriage to my husband, Dave, nurtures my life and my ministry, and frankly I do not think I could be a minister of this church without his love and support. It is always there in the background. Same-sex marriage is like opposite-sex marriage and it has its joys and sorrows, its glories and its tensions. It’s pretty normal, really.”</p> <p>Another speaker, Craig Dobney, told the general assembly that its past opposition to gay marriages had alienated people: a primary school near his church had stopped using it after the church refused to appoint a gay minister. “I worry that our churches have become irrelevant to our communities,” he said.</p> <p>There were warnings from opponents that the measure could expose ministers who opposed it to pressure and ostracism from equalities activists. Some are expected to call for stronger protection for traditionalists in church legislation at the general assembly on Wednesday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Rev Alistair Cook said he opposed the measure and would continue to refer to marriages taking place between a man and a woman. He said it was disingenuous to suggest this was a matter for individual ministers; this was church policy. “That is a deep theological change for the church,” he said.</p> <p>The Rev Ben Thorp, another critic, said there would be continuing tensions for ministers and presbyteries, since more than a third of presbyteries had voted against it. Churches that refuse to participate risk being targeted by groups supportive of same-sex marriage, he said.</p> <p>“It won’t be the end of the journey,” he said. “It won’t stop the decline of the church. It won’t make us suddenly more attractive to younger people. We will continue to be divided.”</p> <p>The general assembly’s vote comes against a background of steeping declining numbers of church marriages in Scotland and a sharp fall in religious observance.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/23/windfall-tax-energy-companies-bills-uk-consumers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T13:14:37Z","webTitle":"Forget a gimmicky windfall tax.

A windfall tax on energy companies is currently in populist vogue and is superficially plausible. Thanks partly to <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9491/\">reckless sanctions policies</a> against Russia, British energy users have seen their bills <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/1526818377309769728?s=20&amp;t=Z5bZrcx_cQsO1TiniXtBUA\">rocket by 70%</a> in the past year, with further hikes promised in October when the official price cap on a bill is forecast to rise to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/uk-high-fuel-bills-eon-boss-michael-lewis-says\">£2,600 a year – or even higher</a>. This is the dominant element in pushing UK inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/uk-inflation-soars-to-highest-level-in-more-than-40-years\">to 9%</a>. There is no evidence of energy sanctions altering Russian policy or benefiting Ukraine. There is overwhelming evidence they have hurt poorer Britons – and deeply.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/16/labour-commons-north-sea-windfall-tax-cost-of-living-tory\">Labour to try to force Commons vote on North Sea windfall tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oil and gas companies such as BP, Exxon and Shell have seen their profits soar, Shell’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/05/shell-profits-windfall-tax\">tripling to £7.3bn</a>. The reason is simply profiting on the back of sanctions. During Covid, many private firms benefited from government loans and grants to stave off collapse. If taxpayers should come to the aid of private companies in hard times, common equity entitles that aid to be recouped if and when times turn good. YouGov even has <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunak-turns-to-thatcher-for-windfall-tax-boost-mhj6kzgbt\">seven out of 10 Tory voters</a> saying yes to a windfall tax.</p> <p>Such one-off taxes are political gimmicks. They were previously adopted only in 1981, 1997 and 2011, when chancellors found themselves in budgetary difficulties and a particular sector seemed a soft target, such as banks and utilities. Introducing his 2011 windfall tax on oil companies, the then chancellor, George Osborne, <a href=\"https://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/windfall-tax-good-idea\">declared simply that</a> “when oil prices are high … it is fair that companies should contribute more”. Labour is now pressing for a rise in the energy sector’s corporation tax <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/10/windfall-tax-on-north-sea-oil-and-gas-could-raise-2bn-says-labour\">from 40% to 50%</a>. It estimates this would raise just under £2bn. Others want a tax on profiteering care-home owners.</p> <p>These are blunt instruments. Labour’s £2bn would go to the Treasury, where the question would be what to do with it. That money would buy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/03/at-307m-per-mile-of-track-can-the-cost-of-hs2-be-justified#:~:text=Every%20escalation%20in%20costs%20has,miles%20of%20high%2Dspeed%20track.\">less than 10 miles</a> of Rishi Sunak’s HS2 out of Euston. Adding it to existing benefits would aid both those worst hit by energy bills and those hardly affected. Fusing a windfall tax into relieving the cost of living surge would become a mere blip.</p> <p>Like the banks during the 2008 crisis, energy companies are oligopolies that cannot expect to escape public regulation, least of all when blessed with a political bonanza. The answer must be to slash the price cap and demand the companies spend their profits directly on cutting bills. The wimps of Ofgem, the industry regulator, must become tigers. They know that these companies – and their executives – are now wealthy. They know investment is not at issue: they are distributing massive profits and buying back shares. Unless the west goes collectively mad, energy supplies, and profits with them, will return to normal.</p> <p>For now, the priority is simply to bring the price of energy down, and at the government’s command. Yes, all consumers, rich and poor, would benefit; but it would not cost the exchequer a penny, and it would instantly relieve the cost of living at source.</p> <ul> <li><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/may/23/premier-league-2021-22-the-seasons-best-photos","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T13:00:36Z","webTitle":"Premier League 2021-22 review: the season’s best photos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/23/premier-league-2021-22-the-seasons-best-photos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/may/23/premier-league-2021-22-the-seasons-best-photos","fields":{"headline":"Premier League 2021-22 review: the season’s best photos","trailText":"Our photo editor selects his favourite frames – including epic celebrations, crunching tackles and a bizarre banner featuring the ‘Moyesiah’","body":"<p>This season we’ve received more than 800,000 Premier League pictures from staff, agency and freelance photographers.

Salah then scored a 12-minute hat-trick against Manchester United, which weakened Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s hold on the manager’s job. Salah also netted against Manchester City at Anfield, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/03/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">in a game which ended 2-2</a> following Kevin De Bruyne’s deflected 81st-minute strike.

relegation from the top flight was confirmed by defeat at Villa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b21d84ce60f01de522f1e242dc7541a6faa4c751\"> <img

of Burnley, while Tottenham leapfrogged Arsenal to claim fourth spot. But the biggest drama was shared between the top two sides, Manchester City and Liverpool, as they both looked destined to choke. The title rivals entered the final day separated by just a point, with City knowing that a win over visitors Aston Villa would seal the crown. In scarcely believable scenes, City fell two goals behind to Villa, while Liverpool struggled to overturn a dogged Wolves side at Anfield. Then, in the space of six inspired minutes, Guardiola’s side roared to a 3-2 victory to clinch their fourth title in five years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57d539a94afb7a7bd0b67ccc0eab8ff02bc609aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57d539a94afb7a7bd0b67ccc0eab8ff02bc609aa/0_0_2487_1559/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Ham’s Mark Noble gets emotional on the subs bench before the fixture against Manchester City, his final home game for the Hammers.

However, that prejudice stems from a time when “salad” was a green one with a sharp, French vinaigrette, and the wine more often than not an oak-aged bordeaux.</p> <p>These days, though, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/salad\">salads</a> come in all shapes and sizes, and are often the main point of a meal. There may also be more than one on the table, so there’s no point in being too precious about what you serve with them. It’s more useful, perhaps, to think mainly in terms of wines that <em>won’t</em> work so well with them, among which I’d probably put full-bodied reds such as cabernet sauvignon or shiraz, though even those work just fine in the context of salads that include lentils or other pulses. Charred vegetable salads are also game-changers. For instance, you might not usually think of drinking an oaky chardonnay with a salad, but if it includes grilled or roast corn or butternut squash, it’s going to be a winner.</p> <p>That said, the wines I generally turn to are fresh crisp whites and rosés (think of, say, the classic pairing of Provençal rosé and salade niçoise). Sauvignon blanc, with its marked, citrus character, is an obvious choice at this time of year, especially with salads that include asparagus and goat’s cheese; it’s good with tomato salads, too (there’s often a tomato stalk aroma in sauvignon). Smooth, creamy whites such as soave and chenin blanc go with creamy dressings such as for caesar salad; revisit the unfairly out-of-favour vouvray (see today’s pick), too. And aromatic whites such as pinot gris and riesling (Australian ones in particular) work well with south-east Asian-influenced salads that include the likes of lime, coriander and fish sauce – the Tesco wine below in my pick is a longstanding favourite.</p> <p>As for reds, keep them fruity and not too long in the tooth. Fresh, young reds will echo any red fruits in a salad, including dried berries such as barberries or cherries, and will pick up on any meaty element in the form of crisp streaky bacon or air-dried ham.</p> <p>If you are drinking a serious wine and want to make your salad more wine-friendly, it’s obviously best to avoid very hot or spicy dressings. Even with a vinaigrette, a touch of cream or chicken stock will offset the sharpness of the vinegar; herbs such as chervil and especially tarragon can also be a help. Honestly, the wine and salad problem is hugely overstated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"sgtrhfdg whatever\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 22px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Five wines to go with salads</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Just a short space and line here to put a rule under the header and create space for the first bottle\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7fe59956b26452f9d87b9276e5ef9358c05ad168\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fe59956b26452f9d87b9276e5ef9358c05ad168/240_0_1920_2400/800.jpg\" alt=\"Asda Extra Special Vouvray Chenin Blanc 2020\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Extra Special Vouvray Chenin Blanc 2020</strong> <a href=\"https://groceries.asda.com/product/chenin-blanc/asda-extra-special-vouvray-chenin-blanc/1000310031059\">£7.25 Asda</a>, 13%.

Ten Hag said: “I admire them both, Manchester City and Liverpool. They play really fantastic football. But you will always see that an era can come to an end and I am looking forward to battle with them.” He was pressed on whether he thought their superiority could be ended before the managers depart: “I think yeah.”</p> \n<p>Despite United’s lowly finish, Ten Hag suggested the group he takes charge of remains one that can challenge. “The season before, this squad finished second, so it has the potential,” he said. “I think if we improve, if we can work with them, we can get more out of them than this season. First of all, we want to make the fans proud. Second, of course at this moment the current situation is obviously not that good. It’s a big challenge. I want to build a team who are battling for each other, who are unified and who will get results.</p> \n<p>“Also we are playing in the Theatre of Dreams. We want to entertain. The intention is to play fantastic football. If we can’t play fantastic football, we still have to win.”</p> \n<p>Ten Hag was speaking on the same day the club’s co-owner Avram Glazer promised that there would be money to spend in the summer. “We have always spent the money that’s there to buy new players,” Glazer told Sky Sports. “We think Ten Hag is the right man. That’s why we hired him. He will do a great job. It has been a disappointing season but we are going to work hard to make next season a better season.”</p> \n<p>David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjær preceded Ten Hag in the nine years since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson, who guided United to their last Premier League title. Ten Hag was asked why he believes he can succeed when that quartet failed to secure the championship. “The confidence is that I have a good feeling from the people around,” he said. “We have a plan, and now it’s about getting the plan done. When we have good people around, with the right connection and the right commitment we will achieve the success we want.”</p> \n<p>Ten Hag shrugged off the notion that he is putting his reputation in jeopardy. “I don’t see it as a risk. This club has a great history and now let’s make a future,” he said. “It will be exciting.”</p> \n<p>Ten Hag did concede that he will have to hit the ground running. “What we’re thinking is: ‘This is a project and it takes time.’ But I also know at this club and at other clubs like Ajax and Bayern Munich [where he was second team manager] that at the top there is never time.”</p> \n<p>Ten Hag was guarded regarding his strategy for the side. “The plan is huge, and we only have a short time,” he said. “First of all we will roll it out to the staff, then the players, and then you will see. What we are doing first is constructing the staff, constructing the squad and constructing a good pre-season plan. We have a strategy, a concept, and we will work on that.</p> \n<p>“We at every club think about: ‘What is in the spirit of the club?’ That is what we want to know, but also that is why they appoint me as manager. I have to bring something to the club, a dynamic. If you want to get to the top, you have to demand, and that is what we are going to do.”</p> \n<p>Van Gaal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/28/van-gaal-warns-ten-hag-against-joining-commercial-club-manchester-united\" title=\"\">warned his compatriot</a> that he should choose a “football club not a commercial club” in reference to the perception that United’s prime objective is financial. Ten Hag said: “I have heard that but I’m convinced it won’t be the case. I spoke with the directors – football is one, two, three in this club.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ten Hag, who began Monday’s media briefing by shaking the hands of correspondents, was clear about the role of Cristiano Ronaldo. “Goals.

But it was initially suggested by officials in No 10 that it may be something that she might want to consider. But I think we’re getting into quite granular-level detail here.”</p> \n<p>No 10 has vehemently rejected the idea that Johnson meeting Gray at his or his officials’ request meant the prime minister was leaning on an official ahead of the publication of her full report into illicit gatherings in and around Downing Street during Covid lockdowns.

It is important that those practical dimensions are resolved.</p> \n<p>“The question of whether any of them are named in this report, the question of what evidence is included within it, are not straightforward here, and are genuinely sensitive for people’s lives and careers and public profiles.</p> \n<p>“I do not think that this meeting was anything other than a discussion of technicalities of the process.

I just think we’ve got to be really careful,” he told the Welsh Conservative conference.</p> <p><strong>Liz Truss </strong>The foreign secretary and torchbearer for the Conservative right admitted the UK was in a “very, very difficult economic situation” but said the Treasury should be cutting taxes rather than imposing a windfall levy on energy firms. “The problem with a windfall tax is it makes it difficult to attract future investment into our country, so there is a cost in imposing a tax like that,” she <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/truss-bats-off-windfall-tax-call-but-admits-uk-in-very-very-difficult-economic-situation-12615693\">told Sky News</a>. </p> <p><strong>Kwasi Kwarteng </strong>The business secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/01/kwasi-kwarteng-sunak-windfall-tax-oil-gas\">firmly quashed the idea</a> at the beginning of the month, days after it was mooted by the chancellor. Asked if he backed Sunak’s idea, he told Sky News: “I’ve never been a supporter of windfall taxes. I have been very clear on that publicly, I think it discourages investment and the reason why we want to have investment is because it creates jobs, it creates wealth and it also gives us energy security.”</p> <p><strong>Brandon Lewis </strong>The Northern Ireland secretary has said a windfall tax “sounds attractive but doesn’t work”. He said: “It puts off investment both in that sector and, absolutely, the risk in others,” he told the Daily Telegraph. </p> <p><strong>Suella Braverman </strong>The attorney general drew on her ideological worldview when she criticised the idea of a levy in an <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/highlights/2022/05/interview-braverman-says-that-what-may-emerge-from-russia-is-a-basis-for-charges-of-genocide.html\">interview with Conservative Home</a>. “I don’t think a windfall tax would be a great idea, if I’m honest. I think that we want to incentivise investment. Profits are not an enemy of Conservatives. Profits mean more investment. Profits mean more research. Profits mean more jobs,” she said.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg </strong>The Brexit opportunities minister warned against the idea that business was, as he put it, a “honeypot” that “you can just raid whenever you feel like”. He said: “Retrospective taxation is difficult because you are changing the understanding of what people do when they invest.” </p> <p><strong>Dominic Raab </strong>Taking aim at opposition calls for a windfall tax, the deputy prime minister described the idea as “frankly ill thought through”. He told Sky News: “If you look at Labour’s policy of a windfall tax, that would damage investment in energy supplies we need and hike bills. It’s disastrous. It’s not serious.”</p> <h2><strong>On the fence?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Boris Johnson </strong>The prime minister refused to rule out a U-turn to impose windfall tax on energy firms earlier this month. “The disadvantage of those sorts of taxes is that they deter investment,” he said in an interview on LBC, before adding “we’ll have to look at it” when it was put to him that energy bosses had said such a levy would not deter them from putting money into new technology. He said: “I don’t like them. I don’t think they are the right way forward. I want those companies to make big, big investments.”</p> <h2><strong>Potentially for</strong></h2> <p><strong>Rishi Sunak </strong>The chancellor has said he is “pragmatic” about the idea of a windfall tax on energy companies, claiming “no options are off the table”. In a Q&amp;A session with Mumsnet in April, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/rishi-sunak-uk-oil-and-gas-windfall-tax\">said</a> he feared the plan would put off investment in new oil and gas extraction. However, he added: “If we don’t see that type of investment coming forward and companies are not going to make those investments in our country and energy security, then of course that’s something I would look at and nothing is ever off the table in these things.”</p> <p><strong>Simon Clarke </strong>The chief secretary to the Treasury said he was not “philosophically attracted” to the idea of a windfall tax, but he appeared to be laying the ground to support it. “The sector is realising enormous profits at the moment,” he told LBC. “If those profits are not directed in a way which is productive for the real economy, then clearly all options are on the table. And that’s what we are communicating to the sector, that we obviously want to see this investment, we need to see this investment.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/may/23/girls-school-queer-taiwanese-movie-lee-mi-mi-screening-teenage","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T12:13:20Z","webTitle":"Girls’ School: Taiwanese queer gem is hopelessly devoted to teenage passions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/23/girls-school-queer-taiwanese-movie-lee-mi-mi-screening-teenage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/may/23/girls-school-queer-taiwanese-movie-lee-mi-mi-screening-teenage","fields":{"headline":"Girls’ School: Taiwanese queer gem is hopelessly devoted to teenage passions","trailText":"Lee Mi-Mi’s intoxicating film, which sits in a rich cinematic tradition of all-girls’ schools, with their homoerotic tensions, as social microcosms, earns a rare screening this week","body":"<p>Love is a many-splendoured thing in Lee Mi-Mi’s Girls’ School, a Taiwanese gem from 1982 beautifully restored just in time for its 40th anniversary.<strong> </strong>Screened in the UK at <a href=\"https://queereast.org.uk/film/girls-school/\">BFI Southbank as part of Queer East</a>, an LGBTQ+ film festival showcasing lesser-known treasures from east and south-east Asian cinema, Girls’ School is a time capsule of social attitudes towards homosexuality in 1980s Taiwan at the meeting point between commercial and arthouse film-making.</p> <p>As a site of surveillance, tempestuous impulses and healing camaraderie, all-girls’ schools can double as a microcosm for society and have a psychological intensity that has fascinated generations of film-makers. Dario Argento’s Suspiria (1977) views such places as a source of horror and mystery while The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969), adapted from Muriel Spark’s novel, dissects the complex patriarchal forces that control young women’s education. Girls’ schools are also ripe for explorations of homoeroticism and burgeoning sexuality. In Mädchen in Uniform (1931) and Jacqueline Audry’s Olivia (1951), lesbianism emerges as the transformative pull that soothes the loneliness of girlhood.</p> <p>Girls’ School might seem a less subversive work at first glance, but its eye for emotional realism is extraordinary. Revolving around an intimate friendship between two students, Chih-Ting and Chia-Lin, whose closeness draws malicious rumours from their classmates, Girls’ School astutely observes the details of female bonding and school life. In their uniforms of white shirts and black pleated skirts, the students march in straight lines as they gather for the semester’s opening ceremony. They make playful jabs at the teachers or pass each other discreet notes adorned with intricate drawings in class. It is as if the school corridors, and even the camera’s frame, can hardly contain the teenagers’ youthful energy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya9d0biDHfU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ya9d0biDHfU?start=9&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=9\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch a trailer for Girls’ School</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The familial neglect suffered by Chih-Ting, who comes from a broken home, has helped to fuel all-consuming devotion to Chia-Lin that alienates peers and alarms teachers. Chih-Ting’s “excessive” adoration is particularly interesting: it embodies the heady volatility of teenage years, with the “too-much-ness” of her emotions constituting the film’s overarching queerness, a resistance to punitive attempts at containment.</p> <p>Even when the plot swerves towards sudden tragedy, Girls’ School is not your typical queer sob story. Director Lee Mi-Mi weaves a poetic naturalism characteristic of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/18/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">Taiwanese new wave</a>. The young girls cycle through the city of Pingtung – Lee’s hometown – and their tearful words of separation are spoken on a rocky beach thrashed by the ocean wave; it all aches with the bittersweet fragility of youth. The streak of conservatism that occasionally appears might echo the dominant social ideology of the time, yet for queer viewers then, to witness, through a female gaze, how young girls passionately care for one another is still an intoxicating experience.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 24 May 2022 to remove an incorrect reference to the stage play of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.</p> <p>• Girls’ School screens on 24 May at BFI Southbank, London.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2022/may/23/challenge-anneka-to-be-revived-by-channel-5-after-nearly-30-years","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T12:07:35Z","webTitle":"Challenge Anneka to be revived by Channel 5 after nearly 30 years ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/23/challenge-anneka-to-be-revived-by-channel-5-after-nearly-30-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/may/23/challenge-anneka-to-be-revived-by-channel-5-after-nearly-30-years","fields":{"headline":"Challenge Anneka to be revived by Channel 5 after nearly 30 years ","trailText":"Anneka Rice, who was helicoptered in to complete a good cause on original show, urges fans to ‘dig out your lycra’","body":"<p>Anneka Rice is to dust off her jumpsuit and relaunch Challenge Anneka, a reality TV hit from nearly 30 years ago involving her flying into an area to complete a good cause against the clock.</p> <p>Announcing a reboot of the programme on Channel 5, Rice urged her fans to “dig out your lycra from the 1990s … there will be more instructions soon.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AnnekaRice/status/1528641136625127424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\">OMG! <a href=\"https://t.co/NHjGietSIC\">pic.twitter.com/NHjGietSIC</a></p>&mdash; Anneka Rice (@AnnekaRice) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnekaRice/status/1528641136625127424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 23, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Channel 5 confirmed the relaunched show would focus on “everyday heroes and deserving communities at a time when they’ve never needed help more”.</p> <p>Rice said: “The last few years have shown us all the power of community and how it’s good to be part of something bigger than ourselves.”</p> <p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she added: “There will always be a room for challenge on television, because it’s about kindness, it’s about community, it’s about the power of the collective. As humans we are totally hardwired to be altruistic.” </p> <p> The original show, which aired on the BBC from 1989 to 1995, with audiences of up to 12 million people, involved Rice arriving into an area of which she had no prior knowledge. It was based Treasure Hunt, an earlier show on Channel 4 when Rice would arrive by helicopter. </p> <p>Her challenge was to accomplish a charitable project in limited time by persuading people and companies to help.</p> <p>The relaunched show will feature Dave the sound man from the original series, but there will be a lorry instead of a helicopter.</p> <p>Rice told Today: “It might not be on the screen, but it’s been in my heart for the last 30 years because I’m still so involved with all those projects. The issues might look a bit different today, but they’re not at its heart.”</p> <p>She cited a project to help orphaned Romanian children that the original programme had helped to establish. She said that as adults the same people she had helped then were now involved in providing shelter for refugees from Ukraine.</p> <p>She said: “That absolutely floored me because it was like one humanitarian crisis 30 years ago, rolling into another one.”</p> <p>Rice suggested the relaunched programme would help challenge stereotypes about the role of older women on television, just as her original programmes had broken new ground in the role of female presenters.</p> <p>She said Treasure Hunt, a forerunner to Challenge Anneka on Channel 4, “put a woman absolutely in control right in the centre of the action driving the narrative. It really changed the face of TV and in a lot of ways, and I want to sort of fly the flag for women today”.</p> <p>She said: “Forty years ago, you have to remember where women were placed in television. They were usually either draped over cars as a prize on a quiz game or they were behind a news desk.”</p> <p>She said there was too much focus on the age of female presenters compared with their male counterparts.</p> <p>Rice said: “I feel just the same as they did 30 years ago, but possibly there’s more conversation about how we look, or about how we might be coping with it, whereas for men they just get on and do it, and their image and brand stays intact.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>She said Channel 5’s director of programming, Ben Frow, did not want to update the programme for a social media generation.</p> <p>“He didn’t want to change anything.

At one point in this Chinese animated blockbuster, the eighth film spin-off from a popular kids’ TV cartoon series, lead character Bramble (Joseph S Lambert) dresses up as a sexy lady, Bugs Bunny-style, as a diversion. And with his penchant for frequent snack breaks, this lovable lummox – who for obscure reasons lives with another bear, two monkeys and one human in the forest of Bear Ridge – resembles no one so much as the equally gluttonous Yogi Bear.</p> <p>Bramble winds up becoming smarter than your average bear when he tampers with a cuboid alien artefact that crash-lands in the woods and downloads hidden capabilities into his brain. But it belongs to Avi (Sara Secora), a blue, six-eared feline in a nanotech suit who is trying to recover her spacecraft. A member of the Rhyotan race who used to inhabit Earth, her knowledge of souped-up tech attracts the attention of Mrs Cruz, a slinky, manicured arms dealer, and her David Gest-lookalike husband, who are hoping to lay hands on an alien war machine.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmZicDSSeis\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AmZicDSSeis?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There’s something almost aggressively generic about Boonie Bears: Back to Earth, from the eruption of morphing Transformers-style gizmos, to character models that seem to have been leased from Kung Fu Panda, to the Sonic-esque Avi. But if that means the repartee between Bramble and Avi is mostly standard-issue smart-alec quippery, and the character arcs unfailingly bend towards the mawkish, the frenzied borrowing means Huida Lin’s film is not short on inspiration while in motion – which is most of the time. The kineticism and detail on show are a match for Pixar, ramped up by a satisfying anime sense of overkill, from a ridiculous flotilla of missiles launched by Mrs Cruz to a minion song and dance number.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/07/turning-red-review-pandas-and-pop-music-collide-in-solid-pixar-caper\">Turning Red</a> was the latest western animation eyeing up Asian audiences with its cultural leanings, but there’s enough competence on show in this globalist mishmash to suggest the traffic might one day move in the other direction. And bits of the comedy here – like the pair of scrap dealers prone to breaking out in mournful <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morin_khuur\">matouqin</a> when their luck turns bad – feels genuinely Chinese.

We have nominated some contenders for this category to get the discussion going</em></p> \n<h2><strong>Roy Keane</strong></h2> \n<p>In February, it seemed Roy Keane would be lost to our television screens, when Sunderland came calling for an emotional return to Wearside. Thankfully for those who enjoy Keane’s snarl as part of their Sunday afternoon routine, no deal could be struck. Roy stayed in the pundit’s chair. The habitual dismissals of bluffers and fakers, the smirks at Micah Richards’ self-aggrandisement, the systematic disemboweling of the latest Manchester United disgrace are top-value entertainment. Others may be more dab hands with the iPad, have a keener grasp of xG. They may even be more articulate but there is no better man at being Roy Keane, who can turn even Graeme Souness from alpha male to beta when on a roll. Keane’s rants are often glorious entertainment, appointment viewing when one of his pariahs is due a volley. As TV executives well know, Keane is box office. The sense is that the man behind the frown now knows that as well as anyone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Steve McManaman</strong></h2> \n<p>Hear us out here. McManaman is an urbane man, someone who moved to Real Madrid, worked out his place in the pecking order, quickly learned the Spanish language and soon became an important, popular if unspectacular part of a Liga- and Champions League-winning team. At BT Sport, McManaman has done pretty much the same, fulfilling the role of everyman, the bloke in the pub enjoying the match unfolding in front of him, sometimes with surprise, other times with disgust. Darren “Fletch” Fletcher provides the commentary, and Glenn Hoddle, on the big matches, often completes the triumvirate with his still-boyish chirrups, tactical experience and frequent lapsing into 1980s soccer vernacular. The role of “Macca” is to convey the shock and awe of the latter stages of the Champions League and Premier League by being wowed at everything happening in front of his eyes. He knows what he’s there for. Probably.</p> \n<h2><strong>Andy Hinchcliffe</strong></h2> \n<p>The co-commentator community has a hierarchical structure, with certain big beasts always likely to be handed the big matches. There are, however, plenty of less big matches to cover for Sky, whose output is often three Premier League matches a weekend, plus a Monday night and on occasion Fridays. Not even Gary Neville is willing to take on such a workload. That leaves opportunity for the second tier co-commentators, among which Hinchcliffe has become a doyen, as well as being a familiar voice to those who follow the EFL. The former Manchester City, Everton and Sheffield Wednesday left-back must own a reliable car, since his south Manchester tones pop up all over the country. All that travelling has left him with a vast knowledge of the game while his wry, off-beat jokes can often be heard making his broadcasting colleagues giggle off-mic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Lucy Ward</strong></h2> \n<p>Female voices are a full part of UK football coverage now, from presentation to match commentary to punditry to post-match interviewing it. It’s time some got over the idea of it being a man’s game. Ward is a former player, and someone whose experience within the game as an administrator, as a former head of education at Leeds, is unrivalled within the football media. Few can have such a wide knowledge of what it takes for young people to make it as a footballer. Her empathy for players is obvious, a strength in the commentary box alongside her reading of the game, tactical knowledge and a keen sense of the momentum a match might take. That’s married to a gentle playfulness, and a proudly northern accent.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8e923286b9235eccd40d3856cc679b1343fdacf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8e923286b9235eccd40d3856cc679b1343fdacf/0_6_4463_2677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Ward working for BT Sport at Villa Park during the season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucy Ward working for BT Sport at Villa Park during the season.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visionhaus/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Clinton Morrison</strong></h2> \n<p>The reformation of the Soccer Saturday crew on Sky has taken a while to get used to. When Jeff Stelling announced his retirement, only later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/28/jeff-stelling-continue-soccer-saturday-sky-sports\">to go back on it</a>, it seemed like the TV institution might come to its end. But those still lamenting the loss of Phil Thompson, Matthew Le Tissier and Charlie Nicholas, perhaps even yearning for dear old Alan Mullery and Rodney Marsh, do a disservice to the team who have kept the show on the road. Glen Johnson and Michael Dawson are bubbling, knowledgeable enthusiasts, Tim Sherwood’s arrival has soothed those who like to have a true football man around, talking the near-nonsensical language of the dressing room. There’s still <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/PaulMerse\">Merse</a> saying Merse things. These days something of a veteran of the studio team, and probably its snappiest dresser, Clinton Morrison offers self-effacing humour, piping hot takes and, just as he did when a player, is not afraid to hold back when he has an opinion. He never shirks an argument. That makes for quality entertainment, just as it did when the old guard were around.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/may/23/13-common-pet-problems-solved-dogs-cats-fish-rabbits","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T12:00:34Z","webTitle":"From bored goldfish to sexist dogs: 13 common pet problems - solved!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/23/13-common-pet-problems-solved-dogs-cats-fish-rabbits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/23/13-common-pet-problems-solved-dogs-cats-fish-rabbits","fields":{"headline":"From bored goldfish to sexist dogs: 13 common pet problems - solved!","trailText":"Does your rabbit chew the table legs?

Our panel of experts – from aquatic vets to dog therapists – is here to help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9ed25028474d7472d61d26deacc87e1a51ac0f32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ed25028474d7472d61d26deacc87e1a51ac0f32/0_0_10000_6000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"cat with “you talking to me?” speech bubble\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Cats</strong></h2> <p><strong>Since I’ve gone back to the office, I keep coming home to find that my cat has </strong><strong>peed on my bed. </strong><strong>What’s going on?</strong><br>Defecating and elimination outside a designated litter box is a sign of discontentment, communicating that they are either not happy or are stressed by something (medical or psychological).</p> <p>It can be a coping mechanism; leaving scent in various areas makes them feel safe. Your first port of call should be your vet, to rule out medical problems. Then, contact a behaviourist (try the <a href=\"https://cfba.uk/\" title=\"\">Canine and Feline Behaviour Association</a>) for a home visit. Once they have a definitive diagnosis they will set out a plan for you to follow to resolve this problem.</p> <p><strong>My (female) cat adores my husband but hates me. </strong><strong>Is she trying to oust me, and how can I fix </strong><strong>this?</strong><br>I am sure your cat doesn’t hate you; she wouldn’t even understand that emotional state. Cats choose their favourite people for a variety of reasons, from liking their natural odour, or that person either sitting in the spot they like or being the one who usually feeds them. Sometimes, it’s also to do with the cat’s background – traumas can alter how they respond to their new guardians. So: how to fix it. Become the cat’s only feeder, start to play more with her, and oust your husband from his favourite armchair. Failing this, you might just have to accept your cat prefers his company. Sorry.</p> <p><strong>My once docile cat keeps trying to nip our baby (who, in fairness, quite likes to grab the cat’s tail).</strong><br>Cats and babies are a delicate balance. Babies cry loudly, take away Mum and Dad’s attention, leave all kinds of new smells around the home and – yes – like to grab body parts. I would invest in a few cat towers or climbers, to help your cat get up high and out of the reach of tiny hands. Then your cat can relax while adapting to the small new alien in their territory. In the meantime, as your baby grows, it can be shown how to play gently using long rod toys, gentle pats on the back and treats in the hand.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.catbehaviourist.com/\" title=\"\">Anita Kelsey</a>, cat behaviourist</em><em> and author of <a href=\"http://www.catbehaviourist.com/lets-talk-about-cats/\" title=\"\">Let’s Talk About Cats: Conversations on Feline Behaviour</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1311b5d1cf0d66708afb7cae34a1dbf7364ad44c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1311b5d1cf0d66708afb7cae34a1dbf7364ad44c/0_0_10000_6000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dog with “I need a shrink” speech bubble\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Dogs</strong></h2> <p><strong>I think my dog may be sexist. He barks at men, especially those in hoodies. What can I do?</strong><br>While not sexist, dogs absolutely can discriminate – fears can be related to gender, age or skin tone, and usually stem from an early negative experience. Start off by giving him lots of treats every time you see any men at a distance (saving something especially delicious for gents in hoodies). He’ll start to pair the sight of a man with something positive. In the meantime, just remember to keep plenty of space between you and those scary men. Proximity can be built up over time.</p> <p><strong>Last month, we sent our dog to kennels for the first time. When we picked him up, he seemed low. I thought he was sulking but, a month later, I worry he’s depressed. How can we cheer him up?</strong><br>First things first – get him checked by the vets to ensure no hidden injury or sickness was picked up while he was away. Staying somewhere new, away from creature comforts and trusted humans, can be really tough. Think of things he enjoys doing, and try to do a few of them every day to boost his mood. Sniffing, playing and chewing are all great activities for creating feelgood vibes. For next time, it’s worth looking into a trusted home pet sitter.</p> <p><strong>How do I stop my labrador scavenging when he’s out walking, particularly </strong><strong>other dogs’ poo?</strong><br>Coprophagia (poo-eating) is definitely one of the less appealing doggy pastimes. There are a number of reasons for it – poor diet, hunger, boredom or even attention seeking. It can also be a symptom of poor gut health, so it’s definitely worth getting your dog checked by their vet. It’s also important to build up his focus on you and other forms of fun. Playing games with food or toys, alongside working on a strong “leave it” cue, will help manage scavenging.</p> <p><strong>My rescue dog </strong><strong>insists on humping other dogs. </strong><strong>He’s already been neutered</strong><strong>. What to do?</strong><br>Interestingly, humping isn’t always related to sexual activity. It can be displayed when a dog is stressed, or even be a sign of an underlying health issue. In the short term, interrupt play regularly (start with every 20 seconds) to turn your dog’s focus away from the other dog and towards you or some scattered treats. If your dog gets easily overexcited during play, teach him a new word that means they have to look at you in order to earn a delicious treat immediately. Start teaching it at home where things are calm, before slowly taking it out into the world of distractions.<br><em><a href=\"https://themindfuldogtrainer.com/#:~:text=My%20passion%20is%20for%20improving,fair%20and%20effective%20training%20methods.\" title=\"\">Caroline Wilkinson</a>, dog behaviourist, </em><em>dog </em><em>yoga </em><em>practitioner and founder of digital pet</em><em>-coaching service, </em><em>Barket Place</em></p> <h2><strong>Fish</strong></h2> <p><strong>My goldfish tank smells, despite constant cleaning. </strong><strong>Is there an aquatic equivalent to F</strong><strong>ebre</strong><strong>ze</strong><strong>?</strong><br>The majority of aquarium smells are due to an excess in organic waste, such as fish faeces and uneaten food, and subsequent bacterial blooms. Goldfish are messy creatures and will pollute a tank quickly if not maintained. Start by checking water quality to confirm whether the filter is adequately processing waste. If waste levels are high, assess your tank for overfeeding and overstocking – as a rule of thumb you should allow 20 gallons (90 litres) per goldfish.</p> <p>Generally, I recommend a partial water change of 20% to 50% weekly, making sure to siphon the substrate at the bottom of the tank where organic material collects. The closest and safest option we have to Febreze is running activated carbon in the filter unit, which does an excellent job at binding odour-causing pollutants.</p> <p><strong>My boyfriend insists our goldfish need stimulation. He buys them new ornaments </strong><strong>monthly </strong><strong>and last week I caught him ‘re</strong><strong>arranging their furniture’. Is he right?</strong><br>Fish are far more intelligent than we give them credit for. Israeli scientists have just conducted a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432821005994?dgcid=author#bib37\" title=\"\">study</a> which found that goldfish, in a tank on wheels, were able to navigate themselves around a room – an amazing demonstration of spatial awareness and cognitive function. Other studies have shown preferences in goldfish to spend more time in enriched stimulating environments, which to me indicates some level of benefit or enjoyment. Alternative forms of stimulation include a varied diet, live plants and hand feeding.<br><em>Dr Bryony Chetwynd-Glover,</em><em> director of <a href=\"https://londonaquaticvet.com/\" title=\"\">London Aquatic Veterinary Services</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Rabbits and rodents</strong></h2> <p><strong>Last year, we </strong><strong>got a sweet</strong><strong> house rabbit</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>but she chews everything from the carpet to the table legs. Please help</strong><strong>.</strong><br>This is perfectly normal behaviour for rabbits, it’s just not very convenient for us humans and becomes dangerous if they nibble through electrical cables (phone charger leads are particular favourites). There are a few things you can do. First, redirect this natural chewing behaviour towards more appropriate items: hay, clean deciduous tree branches, woven willow balls, etc. Second: make sure she has the companionship of another rabbit or two. Rabbits are a social species and must, for good welfare, live in pairs or small groups. Last, baby gates and puppy crates make good barricades against precious items or areas.</p> <p><strong>My son had two gerbils (Elsa and Ana). A few weeks ago, Elsa died. I panicked and bought a </strong><strong>look</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>like while my son was at school.</strong><strong> But </strong><strong>they fight constantly, and he’s now confused. </strong><strong> What do I do?</strong><br>I’m afraid you are going to have to come clean with your son. Gerbils, like humans, have preferences for one another, and should have an input on their new partner. This can be done at a rescue centre to see who gets along best. If Ana and Elsa grew up with one another, they will have been more likely to get on anyway.</p> <p>It’s possible the new pairing might get on better if you introduce them on neutral territory as the new Elsa is an intruder into Ana’s home. So, let them live together, somewhere new, for a couple of weeks before moving them back to their home.</p> <p><strong>Help! My daughter got a mouse for Christmas. A few days ago, I let it escape. How can I tempt it back?</strong><br>This is a very common scenario. Try to ensure there is no food left accessible to them, including cupboards and work surfaces. Then put out a temptingly baited humane trap, or even a ramp leading up to a suitable glass or plastic smooth-sided container with something soft in the bottom and food in it to keep them fed overnight. It might take several days or even weeks, but as long as there are no predators such as cats in the house, you should catch him or her safely soon.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://ebvs.eu/colleges/ECZM/members/dr-richard-saunders\" title=\"\">Dr Richard Saunders</a>, scholar in </em><em>zoo and </em><em>rabbit </em><em>medicine at Bristol Zoo</em><em> and vet specialist adviser to the <a href=\"https://rabbitwelfare.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Rabbit Welfare Association </a></em><em><a href=\"https://rabbitwelfare.co.uk/\" title=\"\">&amp; Fund</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Lizards</strong></h2> <p><strong>My son wants a lizard but the idea of feeding it baby mice makes me retch (I’m vegan). Are there any reptiles that can have a plant-based diet?</strong><br>Different species of reptiles need different diets and it is crucial they receive the correct nutrition in order to thrive, whether this comes from a meat-based, plant-based or even insect-based diet.</p> <p>Some reptiles, like many tortoises, are herbivores and require a plant-based diet to thrive; while others, such as bearded dragons, can have a largely plant-based diet in captivity but may need to supplement this with insects.</p> <p>It is important to ensure reptiles get adequate protein in their diets and ways of doing this will differ depending on the species.</p> <p>Not all species will be suitable pets for children as they have complex needs that must be fulfilled to make sure they are happy and healthy.

This new overhaul is based on a middle-class fantasy","trailText":"A new review passes the buck for children’s care on to the ‘community’, says social worker Rebekah Pierre","body":"<p>Like a protective sibling, I am the first to both criticise and defend the care system. It failed and saved me in equal measure. In adult life, I returned to it as a social worker. I know its flaws and its potential to change lives. The sector is stretched and underfunded. People working in the care system welcomed the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/education-secretary-launches-review-of-childrens-social-care\">promise of a review</a>, but our hopes were short-lived.</p> <p>The landmark review of children’s social care in England, <a href=\"https://childrenssocialcare.independent-review.uk/final-report/#\">released today</a>, has been dubbed a “once in a generation opportunity” to transform the system. To anyone who has lived through, or worked within it, that may have sounded more like a threat than a promise. Any harmful recommendations could linger for decades – a terrifying prospect. Children in care are among the most vulnerable in society: they are twice as likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/24/childhood-in-uk-care-system-makes-you-twice-as-likely-to-die-earlier-study-shows\">to die prematurely</a> and only 6% will <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2020/02/26/must-support-care-leavers-university/\">end up in university</a>.</p> <p>There are some positives here: the review seeks to increase life expectancy among children in care, double university entry, and make care experience a protected characteristic. But many have long <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/independence-of-major-childrens-care-review-in-question-over-the-appointment-of-a-charity-boss-78153\">questioned the independence</a> of the review. Its chair, Josh MacAlister, a secondary school teacher-turned-CEO of Frontline (a fast-track programme for social work) received <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2019/01/08/frontline-awarded-45-million-train-900-social-workers/#:~:text=Frontline%20awarded%20%C2%A345%20million%20to%20train%20900%20social%20workers\">£45m from the Department for Education</a> to train just 900 social workers in 2019. <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2020/07/24/frontline-participants-leave-host-councils-within-three-years-study-finds/\">Frontline retention rates</a> do not justify this eye-watering cost.</p> <p>Remarkably, the government has been unwilling to invest a penny in the review’s recommendations, <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2021/03/19/care-review-assume-extra-funding-recommendations-says-government/\">according to a leaked contract</a>. Additional money, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61509043\">£2.6bn requested</a> by MacAlister (which doesn’t even begin to plug the<a href=\"https://www.nationalworld.com/news/politics/childrens-social-services-face-ps4bn-budget-blackhole-since-2014-as-social-workers-call-for-more-cash-to-protect-kids-3497341\"> £4bn budget black hole</a>) will be taken from other public services. Perhaps that’s why the review focuses on scaling back so much. First to go is the independent reviewing officer role, designed to give children a voice and scrutinise care plans.</p> <p>One group, though, is exempt from the pinch. Private providers that charge local authorities <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/firms-charging-10k-a-week-to-look-after-single-child-in-care-5fp05jq92\">up to £10,000 a week</a> to care for one child won’t face profit caps, despite calls from people who work in the sector for limits on how much they can charge.</p> <p>Other cuts are better disguised. The review insists communities (an undefined, homogenous group) can provide “organic, responsive help that services simply can’t”. It elaborates: a classmate’s parent, or a friend or family member, can step in to “look after a child after school to give the parents some space”. This<em> </em>is neither fair nor sustainable.</p> <p>To state the obvious, communities are not always safe spaces. The Homes for Ukraine campaign is a prime example of this. While most hosts were genuine, this did not stop a minority <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61311046\">attempting to exploit vulnerable people</a> leaving a war-torn country. Children in care are easy targets of <a href=\"https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/what-we-do/our-work/child-criminal-exploitation-and-county-lines\">county lines exploitation</a>. Will gangs be exempt from volunteering?</p> <p>Law-abiding citizens who have protested against <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2022/04/19/resident-protests-against-childrens-homes-are-a-microcosm-of-an-uncaring-care-system/\">children’s homes being built on their streets</a> pose an equal threat. What will persuade them to suddenly tolerate, let alone mentor, the very children they want rid of? Not everybody lives in quaint cul-de-sacs where retired therapists can offer parenting advice over supper. This middle-class fantasy won’t work for people living in unsafe housing, or suffering intra-community abuse.</p> <p>We’re living in a time of unprecedented inflation, <a href=\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/uk-poverty-2022\">with one in five people in the UK living in poverty</a>. People are struggling to support themselves, let alone others. This is especially the case among underpaid and overworked teachers, who, among other “trusted adults”, are framed in this review as the panacea to the foster carer shortage. The review states that “if only 1% of teachers stepped forward to foster a specific child, there would be 4,610 new homes available”.</p> <p>The ethical implications of this are huge. Professional boundaries between teachers and pupils exist to keep children safe. It is unfair to expect teachers to provide a child’s intimate care, social-emotional support and potentially be marking their homework while balancing the needs of 29 other children in their class. In gaining a foster carer, we should not be expecting children, in essence, to forfeit a “normal” educational experience.</p> <p>The review states that we need more foster carers. This is doubtless true, but they also need time, training and experience in order to provide care. I was informally fostered by a “trusted adult” – a young community professional who, in earnest, thought they could help. I waited patiently for the spare room to be set up, but as autumn turned to winter, I was still sleeping on a sofa bed in the freezing cold living room. I now realise this was a sign they were wildly out of their depth, perhaps unsure they could commit to caring for a traumatised 16-year-old. One day after school, I found a note on the kitchen table. It said I had four days to find somewhere else to live – a particularly cruel deadline, given it was 20 December.</p> <p>I never really got over this. This rejection, at such a pivotal point in life, damaged my ability to form trusting relationships for years. I ended up in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/11/adult-hostel-17-british-state-parent\">unregulated hostel</a> among adults known to police (<a href=\"https://www.cypnow.co.uk/news/article/outrage-as-children-s-minister-dismisses-small-number-of-teenage-deaths-in-care\">22 children died in such settings</a> between 2018 and 2020, but the review failed to condemn the use of unregulated hostels in the past).</p> <p>In times of crisis, children need the best expertise available. Relying on a loose idea of “community” to supplement social care is a gross abdication of government responsibility. Communities can be a wonderful thing: while at the hostel, a family I had known my whole life provided invaluable care. They taught me slowly how to trust people again. But assuming parents and social workers haven’t already exhausted these avenues is naive. Practices such as <a href=\"https://frg.org.uk/family-group-conferences/what-is-a-family-group-conference/\">family group conferencing</a>, which is drawn from Māori culture and involves family and friends developing their own plans, have long been used in children’s social care.</p> <p>Meaningful change must be achieved by properly funding services and protecting children’s hard-won rights. Passing the buck to the public is a cop out. Even a child could see that.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rebekah Pierre is an author, journalist and social worker </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We would need a coalition of the willing – countries with significant naval power to protect the shipping lanes, and countries that are affected by this”.</p> <p>Nato as an alliance should not take a role, he said.</p> <p>After meeting Landsbergis, Truss said the UK would want British naval ships to join the escort if the practicalities could be sorted, including demining the harbour and providing Ukraine with longer-range weapons to defend the harbour from Russian attack. The UK is in discussions with allies about the plan and it would probably need US agreement to be activated.</p> <p>Truss said: “What we need to do is deal with this global food security issue and the UK is working on an urgent solution to get the grain out of Ukraine”.</p> <p>The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has warned of “a hurricane of hunger” if Ukrainian grain is not exported. The world’s 41 least-developed nations import a third of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia.

The Stadio Mapei’s north stand had been transformed into a miniature version of San Siro’s Curva Sud, visiting fans putting together a pre-game choreography to remind their team that: “We are always with you.” Although red-and-black stripes were prohibited in other parts of the ground, it was clear more sections had been colonised.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"688d486f19e4d91b6a8c084cb774dda7a55e5098\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/688d486f19e4d91b6a8c084cb774dda7a55e5098/0_0_3500_2353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milan fans at the game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milan fans at the game.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Lingria/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There were reports that as many as 100,000 people had been waiting in the online queue when tickets went on sale. Scenes of supporters taking over the Milano Centrale train station before embarking on the 100-mile journey south had been going viral.</p> \n<p>If any of them were suffering with Istanbul Syndrome, they did not infect the players. Milan were in control from kick-off, any nerves lasting only as long as it took for Olivier Giroud to open the scoring with a nutmeg of Andrea Consigli after a quarter of an hour. It was the Frenchman again who grabbed the next goal before Franck Kessié made it 3-0 within the first 36 minutes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b21f829ebbb815dad0d4fd7ef38112509403f6e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b21f829ebbb815dad0d4fd7ef38112509403f6e/0_0_3217_2202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring their second goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring their second goal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniele Mascolo/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There was no danger here of a comeback, no chance of history repeating. This is a different team in a different time, a side born from the actual pandemic that arrived in Europe two years ago.</p> \n<p>Milan were seventh in Serie A on the day when Italian football was suspended in response to the first Covid-19 outbreak. They had just lost at home to Genoa and Stefano Pioli, the manager hired six months earlier to replace a struggling Marco Giampaolo, was not expected to last beyond the end of the campaign. Behind the scenes, Ralf Rangnick was being lined up to succeed him.</p> \n<p>But Pioli made himself unsackable when play resumed in the summer, leading Milan on a run of nine wins and three draws. He has cited a 5-0 defeat to Atalanta in December 2019 as the turning point, leading to conversations with the club’s directors who went out and signed Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Simon Kjær. Yet his own continued involvement would not be confirmed for another seven months.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/22/giroud-double-in-win-at-sassuolo-helps-fire-milan-to-first-serie-a-title-in-11-years\">Milan seal first Serie A title in 11 years but Pioli claims his medal was stolen</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What a pivotal decision it was by Milan to stick with him. Finishing second last season was already a major achievement – Pioli restoring Milan to the Champions League for the first time in seven years. He has kept the club moving forward with a blend of expert man-management and timely tactical tinkering, adjusting his formations to exploit the development of individual players along the way.</p> \n<p>His first Milan team was designed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/16/hernandez-goes-solo-in-style-of-george-weah-to-take-milan-a-point-from-title\">to liberate Theo Hernández</a>, the standout talent he saw in the squad he inherited in 2019, giving the full-back freedom to roam and create. Since then, there have been ongoing evolutions: adapting the attack with the arrivals of Ibrahimovic and then Giroud and the midfield in response to Hakan Calhanoglu’s departure and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/sandro-tonali-keeps-milan-title-dream-on-track-verona-serie-a\">the rise of Sandro Tonali</a>.</p> \n<p>This season’s greatest tactical triumph might have been moving Pierre Kalulu, previously a full-back, inside to play in the centre of defence after Kjær was injured in January. But Pioli’s real triumph has been to help young players continue in their individual development, helping Fikayo Tomori to be more patient at the back and Rafael Leão more ruthless up front.</p> \n<p>For both of Pioli’s first two seasons, Milan had the youngest team in all of Serie A. Even now it is still, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OptaPaolo/status/1528453994481434629\">according to Opta</a>, the youngest to win Italy’s top division since it went to three points for a win in 1994.</p> \n<p>The presence of a handful of veteran leaders in the squad has been essential. Ibrahimovic barely played in the second half of this season, struggling with a persistent knee injury, but described this as “the most satisfying” of all the trophies he has won, since he had been able to contribute to in other ways, serving as a “pilot” guiding young players on to the right flight path.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83ea85ab0d74753603d4d4d671e028b7b4b2131c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83ea85ab0d74753603d4d4d671e028b7b4b2131c/0_0_5285_3523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zlatan Ibrahimovic smokes a cigar during the trophy ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zlatan Ibrahimovic smokes a cigar during the trophy ceremony.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Giroud may be less vocal but his contributions on the pitch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/07/why-milan-serie-a-title-bid-belongs-to-big-brother-olivier-giroud\">have been essential</a>. His two goals on Sunday allowed him to finally break the ‘curse’ of Milan’s No 9 shirt, becoming the first player to reach double figures while wearing it since Pippo Inzaghi in 2009. As the saying goes in Italy, though, “you don’t count goals, you weigh them”. The Frenchman’s habit for showing up at the most important moments has been crucial. His goals this season had turned around a derby against Inter in January, sunk Napoli in March, and set Milan on the way to reversing a 1-0 deficit against Lazio in April.</p> \n<p>In a title race decided by two points, those strikes have made all the difference. But then again, so have Leão’s 11 goals and eight assists, Junior Messias’s contributions from the bench and Mike Maignan’s outstanding saves. Even on Sunday, the Frenchman did make one astonishing reflex stop from a Davide Frattesi header.</p> \n<p>This has been a triumph of the collective for Milan – extending beyond even the players or the coaching staff. This title-winning side could not have come together without the shrewd recruitment decisions made by Paolo Maldini and Ricky Massara. They have built a title-winning squad with only the fourth-biggest wage bill in the league, knowing when to make the difficult decisions and not overreach to keep hold of Gianluigi Donnarumma or Calhanoglu. Maldini’s name alone has been an asset. Would Tomori or Hernández have joined without that added appeal of getting to work with a man described by the Englishman as “the best defender of all-time”?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SerieA_EN/status/1528450305658167297\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">11 years later.. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/acmilan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@acmilan</a> are Champions of Italy🇮🇹✨<br>In Reggio Emilia 🔴⚫ lift the trophy up to the sky 🏆🙌🏻<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MILANSCUDETTO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MILANSCUDETTO</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SerieA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SerieA</a> 💎 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeAreCalcio?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WeAreCalcio</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/EyQb45Oleq\">pic.twitter.com/EyQb45Oleq</a></p>— Lega Serie A (@SerieA_EN) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SerieA_EN/status/1528450305658167297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 22, 2022</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Milan were not supposed to win the title this season, not officially at least.

Cases, usually small clusters or isolated infections, are sometimes diagnosed in other countries, including the UK where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/08/first-ever-case-of-monkeypox-recorded-in-the-uk\">first case was recorded in 2018</a> in an individual thought to have contracted the virus in Nigeria.</p> <p>There are two forms of monkeypox, a milder west African strain and a more severe central African, or Congo strain. The current international outbreak appears to involve the west African strain, although not all countries have released such information.</p> <p>According to the UK Health Security Agency, early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills, as well as other features such as exhaustion.</p> <p>“A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, including the genitals,” the UKHSA says. “The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.”</p> <p>Most patients recover from monkeypox in a few weeks.</p> <h2><strong>How is </strong><strong>it spread?</strong></h2> <p>Monkeypox does not spread easily between humans, and requires close contact. According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/transmission.html\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, it is thought that human-to-human transmission primarily occurs through large respiratory droplets.</p> <p>“Respiratory droplets generally cannot travel more than a few feet, so prolonged face-to-face contact is required,” the CDC says. “Other human-to-human methods of transmission include direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, and indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated clothing or linens.”</p> <h2><strong>Where have recent cases been found?</strong></h2> <p>Monkeypox cases have been confirmed in recent weeks in at least 12 countries where it is not endemic, including the UK, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Italy, the US, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, Israel and Australia. </p> <p>While some cases have been found in people who have recently travelled to Africa, others have not: of the two Australian cases to date, one was in a man who had recently returned from Europe, while the other was in a man who had recently been to the UK. A case in the US meanwhile appears to <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/news/massachusetts-public-health-officials-confirm-case-of-monkeypox\">be in a man who recently travelled to Canada</a>.</p> <p>The UK is also experiencing cases of monkeypox, with signs that it is spreading in the community. So far 20 cases have been confirmed, with the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/07/patient-treated-for-monkeypox-in-isolation-at-london-hospital\">reported on 7 May</a> in a patient who had recently travelled to Nigeria. </p> <p> Not all of the cases appear to be linked and some have been diagnosed in men who self-identify as gay or bisexual, or men who have sex with men. </p> <p>The World Health Organization said on Tuesday it was coordinating with European health officials.</p> <h2><strong>Does this mean monkeypox is sexually transmitted?</strong></h2> <p>Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, says the latest cases may be the first time transmission of monkeypox though sexual contact has been documented, but this has not been confirmed, and in any case it is probably close contact that matters.</p> <p>“There is no evidence that it is a sexually transmitted virus, such as HIV,” Head says. “It’s more that here the close contact during sexual or intimate activity, including prolonged skin-to-skin contact, may be the key factor during transmission.”</p> <p>The UKHSA is advising gay and bisexual men, as well as other communities of men who have sex with men, to look out for unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, in particular their genitalia. “Anyone with concerns that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit,” the UKHSA says. </p> <h2><strong>How </strong><strong>concerned should we be?</strong></h2> <p>The west African strain of monkeypox is generally a mild infection for most people, but it is important those infected and their contacts are identified. The virus is more of a concern among vulnerable people such as those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant. Experts say the rise in numbers and evidence of community spread are worrying, and that more cases are to be expected as contact tracing by public health teams continues. It is <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10824815/Monkeypox-fears-prompt-STI-clinics-bring-social-distancing-BACK.html\">unlikely, however, that there will be very large outbreaks</a>. Head noted that vaccination of close contacts could be used as part of a “ring vaccination” approach.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61520228\">It emerged on Friday that the UK had bolstered its</a> supplies of a vaccine against smallpox, a related but more severe virus that has been eradicated. <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox\">According to the World Health Organization</a>, “vaccination against smallpox was demonstrated through several observational studies to be about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox”. The jab may also help to reduce the severity of illness.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/monkeypox-virus-infection-case-symptoms-live-uk-b2083515.html\">The vaccine</a> has already been offered to high-risk contacts of confirmed cases, including some healthcare workers, in the UK, although it is unclear how many have been vaccinated.</p> <p>A UKHSA spokesperson said: “Those who have required the vaccine have been offered it.”</p> <p>Spain has also been rumoured to be looking to <a href=\"https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2022-05-19/spain-moving-towards-purchasing-monkeypox-vaccine/67220\">buy supplies of the vaccine</a>, and other countries, such as the US, have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/bioterrorism-response-planning/public-health/vaccination-strategies.html\">large stockpiles</a>.<br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/may/23/the-big-idea-have-we-been-getting-sleep-all-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T11:30:33Z","webTitle":"The big idea: have we been getting sleep all wrong?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/23/the-big-idea-have-we-been-getting-sleep-all-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/may/23/the-big-idea-have-we-been-getting-sleep-all-wrong","fields":{"headline":"The big idea: have we been getting sleep all wrong?","trailText":"Eight hours a day is a myth. Embracing our individual sleeping patterns could be the key to a better night’s rest","body":"<p>‘Sleep: those little slices of death, how I loathe them”; “sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days.” Quotes like these, somewhat dubiously attributed to Edgar Allan Poe and Thomas Edison, nevertheless reflect our society’s difficult relationship with sleep. Attitudes are changing, but there remains a lingering disdain and suspicion. We know we need it, but resent the fact that we have to do it, and are sometimes misled about how to get it.</p> <p>What we can be sure of is that sleep is critical for good health. It helps us form memories and solve problems, allows tissue growth and repair, promotes metabolic health and removes toxins from the brain, including amyloid beta which is linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Insufficient and disrupted sleep is now known to result in altered emotional responses such as irritability, anxiety, loss of empathy, impulsivity and a reduced sense of humour. Cognitive performance also takes a hit, leading to a loss of attention, concentration, communication, decision making, creativity, and the ability to multitask. Finally, poor sleep affects physiological health, leading to an increased risk of stroke, heart attack, infection, cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes and mental illness. Hopefully this encyclopedic list will convince you that insufficient sleep is so much more than the inconvenience of feeling tired at the wrong time. It should also prompt the question: so what is “good sleep”?</p> <p>We are regularly told that the “ideal” night of sleep consists of eight uninterrupted hours. But this belief is wrong in so many ways. Sleep is like shoe size. One size does not fit all, and these kinds of edicts cause confusion and anxiety for many. The truth is that how long we sleep, our preferred sleep times and how many times we wake during the night vary both between people and in the same person as they get older.</p> <p>Most young and middle aged people (18 to 64 years) sleep between seven and nine hours each night, but some perfectly healthy individuals may sleep six or even 11 hours. After 64, the average amount of sleep is between seven and eight hours, but the full range can be between five and nine hours. So, sleep shortens as we age. We see the same variety with sleep timing. Your “chronotype” refers to whether you are a “lark” (10% of the population), “owl” (25% of the population), or in between (sometimes called “dove”, representing most of us, at 65% of the population). This is greatly influenced by your biological (circadian) clock. But these clocks change with age. As teenagers and young adults, people tend to have later chronotypes, then move earlier in their middle and older years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Don’t take sleep apps too seriously and certainly don’t worry about a poor ‘sleep rating’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What about waking up in the middle of the night? For some reason we have decided that a single episode of sleep without waking (“monophasic” sleep), is normal. But this is almost certainly not the normal state for most of us. Multiple studies have shown that sleep in humans and other mammals often doesn’t come in a single consolidated block. Instead, sleep can occur in two episodes (biphasic sleep) or even multiple episodes (polyphasic sleep), separated by short periods of being awake. It seems that our 24/7 society, the use of artificial light and a reduction in the time available for sleep at night has encouraged us to squeeze sleep into a single episode.</p> <p>Critically, studies have shown that if we wake at night, sleep is likely to return, if it is not sacrificed to social media, worrying or other alerting behaviours. Remember, this may even represent an “ancestral” pattern of sleep. If you do wake, stay calm, and if you stay awake, don’t remain in bed getting increasingly frustrated. Leave the bed, keep the lights low and engage in a relaxing activity such as reading or listening to soothing music. Then return to bed when you are ready for more sleep.</p> <p>Recently, people have been turning to apps to monitor – or perhaps police – their sleep. But these are too often sources of misinformation. They come in a variety of different forms, but generally measure a combination of movement, sound, heart and breathing rates, skin conductance and temperature. They can be useful in telling you roughly when you went to sleep, how many times you got up in the night and your total sleep time. This data is then combined by some form of patented algorithm to extract a so called sleep rating. But measures of the different stages of sleep (REM v NREM, for example) or “sleep quality” are difficult to assess, and may as a result be profoundly misleading. It’s telling that no sleep apps are currently endorsed by national sleep academies or sleep specialists. Don’t take them too seriously and certainly don’t worry about a poor “sleep rating”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/02/could-we-make-ageing-a-thing-of-the-past\">Could we make ageing a thing of the past?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given all of its benefits, you still might want to know whether you are getting good sleep or not. Well, it’s not actually that difficult to tell. If you feel you can do what you need to do during the day without significant tiredness, you are probably fine. If, on the other hand, you’re dependent on another person to get you out of bed; if you get up late on free days and especially when you’re on holiday; if you take a long time to wake up and feel alert; if you feel sleepy and irritable during the day and want to have a mid-afternoon nap; if you feel the need for caffeinated or sugar-rich drinks – these may be signs that you’re not prioritising good sleep sufficiently. More seriously, if family, friends, or work colleagues comment that you are more irritable, less reflective and more impulsive, or if you become aware of decreased productivity, increased worry, anxiety, mood swings or depression, lack of sleep could be partly responsible. You may need to take steps like drinking less alcohol, eating more healthily, exercising or seeking ways to reduce stress, so that you naturally get better sleep.</p> <p>But remember: sleep is dynamic, and everyone has different sleep patterns. Do not be browbeaten and bullied by strident commands that you “must” do this or that. Take possession of your sleep, understand it, embrace it and – above all – enjoy it.</p> <p>• Russell Foster is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/life-time-9780241529300?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Life Time: The New Science of the Body Clock</a> (Penguin Life).</p> <h2><strong>Further reading</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/at-days-close-9781474624916?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">At Day’s Close: A History of Night-time</a></strong> by A Roger Ekirch (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, £10.99)</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.krygerbooks.com/\" title=\"\">Sleep in Art: How Artists Portrayed Sleep and Dreams in the Last 7,000 Years</a></strong> by Meir Kryger (Kryger, £27)</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/what-do-dreams-do/sue-llewellyn/9780198818953\" title=\"\">What Do Dreams Do?</a></strong> by Sue Llewellyn (Oxford, £29.99)</p> <p>• This article was amended on 24 May 2022 to correct a misspelling of the author Edgar Allan Poe’s name, from Edgar Allen Poe.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/blog/2022/may/23/premier-league-2021-22-review-gripes-of-the-season","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T11:30:32Z","webTitle":"Premier League 2021-22 review: gripes of the season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/23/premier-league-2021-22-review-gripes-of-the-season","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/may/23/premier-league-2021-22-review-gripes-of-the-season","fields":{"headline":"Premier League 2021-22 review: gripes of the season","trailText":"Bending the Covid rules, drug use in the stands and social media disgraces all stuck in the craw this season","body":"<h2><strong>Crypto-wibble and non-fungible nonsense</strong></h2> <p>An argument for cryptocurrencies, the blockchain and non-fungible tokens is that they may one day democratise finance, and place wealth in the hands of those who previously had little access to resources. An alternative argument is that it’s all a Ponzi scheme where all but a select few will lose their shirt. Recent crashes in the crypto market suggest the latter is the more likely. Still, there’s money to be made in the interim, and football’s unrelenting lust for get-rich-quick schemes makes it an ideal breeding ground for crypto-wibble. It’s become ubiquitous. VAR in Serie A is sponsored by a crypto exchange, Manchester City signed up and then hurriedly binned a crypto partner that had no digital footprint, Paul Pogba flogged “dragon eggs” and then John Terry got in a bit of lumber for shilling NFTs that included official logos he didn’t have permission to use.</p> <p>Whenever a footballer signs up for social media, the immediate suspicion now is that they will soon enough start flogging an NFT. And so it proved with Son Heung-min just the other week. Meanwhile, clubs have freely got into bed with crypto companies, some of which purport to offer buyers the chance to “be more than a fan”, to use the strapline of Socios, which allows fans to buy “virtual tokens”, and has a linkup with Lionel Messi. One day, when the full glory and scope of the metaverse has been realised, all this may make sense. For the moment, crypto appears football’s latest trousering of cash and hanging of the consequences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Super League’s continuing legacy</strong></h2> <p>This time last year, football was counting the fallout of the failed launch of the European Super League. Vengeance was in the air. The fans, the smaller clubs, even Boris Johnson’s UK government wanted to make those who tried to steal the game pay for their betrayal. And yet, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus, the three clubs who unrepentantly tried to keep the show on the road, have faced little censure from Uefa, legal proceedings eventually declared null and void. Uefa has instead made the Champions League a safer environment for the super club, its eight-game, Swiss-system group-stage will decide little but more TV revenue. And its redrawing probably means five Premier League clubs will get to join the pre-Christmas, non-competitive jamboree as a means to plump up the numbers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as plans for an independent football regulator in the UK gathered pace, to curb excesses and smooth the trickle-down, the Premier League coughed out this piece of self-interest classicism: “The Premier League recognises and accepts the case for reform and for a strengthened regulatory system across football … but we will continue to maintain that it is not necessary for there to be a statutory-backed regulator.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d25ac8dcba1b0851765f9cf3a8e8e95af7247fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d25ac8dcba1b0851765f9cf3a8e8e95af7247fb/0_0_3500_2262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United fans protest against the Glazer family in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"646\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United fans protest against the Glazer family in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Swinging the Covid lead</strong></h2> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic was near-disastrous for football as well as a genuine global tragedy. That still didn’t prevent clubs squabbling in self-interest when there were – or were not – outbreaks of coronavirus within squads. It barely helped that the football authorities’ rulings on such matters were opaque, leaving a system that could be readily played. Arsenal withdrew from the north London derby in January, with only one confirmed Covid case in the camp. Injuries, Afcon and Granit Xhaka’s suspension had reduced Mikel Arteta’s squad to the bare bones. The game was eventually rescheduled for May, when Tottenham won 3-0, Antonio Conte dryly noting: “Arsenal were good to postpone a game in an incredible way with Covid … I didn’t forget this.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/23/premier-league-2021-22-review-signings-of-the-season\">Premier League 2021-22 review: signings of the season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Similarly, just as Newcastle prepared to enter the January transfer market, they had games with Southampton and Everton called off. By the time those matches were played, they were flush with £100m of new signings and sauntering into mid-table. The rules were eventually tightened but sharp practice had already left a bad taste.</p> <h2><strong>Anti-social media</strong></h2> <p>Complaining about the behaviour of football fans on social media has become a perennial, largely hopeless cause, but this season saw new frontiers of rage and shame opened up. Newcastle’s purchase by a majority Saudi Arabian ownership saw yet another club’s fans mobilised, ready and willing to defend the activities of ultra-rich people whose cash pays for supporters to live out their football dreams.</p> <p>Even when those activities include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/21/death-of-dissident-jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman\">the murder of a journalist</a>, involvement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/un-condemns-attacks-by-yemen-rebels-and-saudi-led-coalition\">in a humanitarian disaster in Yemen</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/saudi-arabia-executes-men-in-one-day\">execution of a record number of 81 people</a> in a single day, a corner of social media was willing to defend Riyadh. Similarly, certain Chelsea fans claimed victimisation of Roman Abramovich, dismissing any evidence of the relationship with Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/uk-imposes-sanctions-on-roman-abramovich-over-clear-links-to-putin\">that led to him being sanctioned</a> after Russia invaded Ukraine. Not that Newcastle and Chelsea fans are alone. Every club has at least one keyboard warrior willing to abandon decency and credibility because of football loyalties.</p> <h2><strong>It’s a hell of a drug</strong></h2> <p>It turns out that the Euro 2020’s final’s coked-up, pissed-up, flare-up-the-bum bonanza of stupidity was not the last straw but instead the prelude to a season pockmarked by fans acting like brainless idiots. Affix here the requisite caveat that it is some, by no means all, who believe that Danny Dyer in the Football Factory is a design for life. In partial mitigation, fans had been largely locked out of stadia for almost 18 months, so a release of pressure was inevitable. But the sight of long queues for the cubicles in the gents, of lads hoofing fat lines off any available flat surface are now common, entirely anti-social at what are family events.</p> <p>Cocaine and booze makes for a heady cocktail of foolishness that surely is a factor in some recent insurrectional scenes like those at the City Ground last Tuesday, Northampton last Wednesday and Vale Park and Goodison last Thursday. Flares being launched and clubs’ inability/refusal to stop pitch invasions don’t help, either.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2022/may/23/everyday-review-deafinitely-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T11:29:36Z","webTitle":"Everyday review – witchy rituals and a search for safety","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/23/everyday-review-deafinitely-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/may/23/everyday-review-deafinitely-theatre","fields":{"headline":"Everyday review – witchy rituals and a search for safety","trailText":"Deafinitely Theatre’s evocative and tender show was inspired by real stories of abuse against deaf women and non-binary people","body":"<p>In British Sign Language, the sign for a witch is fingers held above your nose, moved down in an elongated curve to draw a beak.

It feels like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/22/nap-pods-and-rooftop-parks-how-silicon-valley-is-reinventing-the-office\">a startup incubator airlifted from Silicon Valley</a>, bolted on to a refurbished relic from London’s industrial past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b6171b85aee741ebea0e51cffbbff902c499cbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b6171b85aee741ebea0e51cffbbff902c499cbd/0_0_8102_4975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rough and tough … The Herzog & de Meuron-designed RCA building in Battersea, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"614\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rough and tough … The Herzog &amp; de Meuron-designed RCA building in Battersea, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iwan Baan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since its foundation in 1837, the RCA has been dedicated to design and fine art, but this new 16,000 sq metre building heralds its “transformation into a STEAM-focused postgraduate university” (the A for art now sandwiched between the government-approved subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics). As it celebrates its 185th anniversary, the college is expanding its programme into computer and materials science, robotics, advanced manufacturing, data science and intelligent mobility, keen to cement its place as “the launchpad for the world’s creative leaders,” as vice-chancellor Paul Thompson puts it.<br><br>The shift has a financial incentive. As state funding of higher education has been slashed – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/12/ballet-dancer-could-reskill-with-job-in-cyber-security-suggests-uk-government-ad\">artists told by Tory chancellor Rishi Sunak they might like to retrain in cyber</a> – the RCA, like many other institutions, has been forced to become more entrepreneurial. Since Thompson took over in 2009, he has grown student numbers from 950 to more than 2,300, with overseas students now making up the majority, each paying £29,000 a year. The student body will soon increase to 3,000, while the MA courses are being cut from two years to one, accelerating turnover.<br><br>Efforts have also been directed to winning lucrative research contracts, with the college’s materials science centre recently <a href=\"https://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/rca-awarded-grant-by-uk-research-and-innovation-to-lead-the-textiles-circularity-centre/\">scooping £5.4m to investigate textiles in the circular economy</a>. The Treasury coughed up £54m for the new building, but only on the proviso that the college produces a steady pipeline of 20 new start-up companies a year. In funders’ eyes, the RCA is less an art school than a factory for forging the new creative economic pistons of UK plc. The irony wasn’t lost on the contemporary art students when they were recently kicked out of their studios early, just weeks before their final deadline, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CdYcux0owsN/\">to make way for an event honouring Sunak himself</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be4ffaf0e5f2e0d5f636159d1e44240bdf67fb03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be4ffaf0e5f2e0d5f636159d1e44240bdf67fb03/0_0_7251_4836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The RCA’s new Battersea building.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A refurbished relic from south London’s industrial past … the RCA’s new Battersea building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iwan Baan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chancellor’s largesse was toasted in “the hangar”, a double-height space at the heart of the building, conceived as a covered street for exhibitions, events and the end-of-year show. The rolled asphalt of the road extends indoors, polished to a glossy terrazzo finish, while a mezzanine level provides views on to the action below. But it seems more designed for fundraising events than the needs of student exhibitors: the brick walls are off-limits for hanging work.<br><br>Similarly, where once the sculpture department enjoyed a messy yard, where toxic resins could be cast and molten iron poured, the workshop floors now spill on to a courtyard to which the public will be granted access, complete with a coffee shop where passersby can sit and enjoy the creative spectacle. “Opening up the college” sounds like a nice idea on paper, but the attendant health and safety implications mean that students won’t actually be allowed to make work out here. “They have ample space in the new workshops,” says Thompson. “So they shouldn’t need to work outside.”<br><br>The architects have clearly taken their visual cues from the RCA’s brutalist 1960s home in South Kensington (where some departments remain), designed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/13/obituary-ht-cadbury-brown\">HT Cadbury-Brown</a>, but the management might do well to remember the loose-fit culture that created it. As critic Ian Nairn wrote: “This building is meant to be used and worn and thumbed over and hugged, like the family’s big woolly dog.” Now, there is more of a managerial sensibility at play – also evident in the college’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2012/nov/13/royal-college-art-175-anniversary-dyson-building\">Dyson building</a>, built in 2012, which Thompson described as his “swanky art factory” – the desire to show off artistic activity sometimes trumping its practical needs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1bc729b4766f9c10e5a5605f7cdaecf33002522\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1bc729b4766f9c10e5a5605f7cdaecf33002522/0_0_7535_5026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The ‘hangar’ at the Royal College of Art’s new Battersea building will be open to the public.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A covered street for exhibitions … The ‘hangar’ at the Royal College of Art’s new Battersea building will be open to the public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iwan Baan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, in the main, Herzog &amp; de Meuron have provided versatile bones for whatever future comes next. The workshops are copious and magnificently equipped, the open-plan studio levels ample and robust. A protective 100mm concrete “play layer” has been cast on to the floor of the sculpture studios on the first floor (after recurring incidents of severed pipes and cables in the previous building), while a sturdy steel hanging grid hovers overhead. Perforated brick screens cover the windows for privacy, although they make the space feel dingy, with all the lights switched on in the middle of the day. The floor above, for Contemporary Art Practice, is a brighter place, with fully glazed walls that lead on to the long, continuous balcony, and studios demarcated with “sacrificial” timber dividers, capable of taking a good beating.<br><br>Finally the lofty top floor, flooded with daylight from the gigantic north lights, looks ideal for painting studios. Oddly, it is home to Innovation Design Engineering and Design Products. The students have yet to move in, but the modular cubicle studios suggest a place of desk-based work rather than the kind of activities that might usefully occupy the six metre-high volume. The painting students across the street are meanwhile clamouring for more space, with up to six people currently occupying studios originally intended for two.</p> <p>There is no such overcrowding in the new “robotics hangar”, which connects the studio building with the research tower (to which MA students are forbidden, for confidentiality reasons). Here, there’s a vast netted space for drones, along with a water tank for submersibles, while the intelligent mobility lab next door features three large bays, allowing vehicles to be driven in off the street. “The public will be able to look in and see a snazzy concept car,” says Thompson. Several floors above are dedicated to research, with AR and VR visualisation labs, and the<a href=\"https://www.rca.ac.uk/business/innovationrca/\"> InnovationRCA</a> startup hub, culminating in a penthouse level for conferences. It’s painfully fitting that the sweeping views across London are mostly reserved for external guests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"83c1ce3847de7083e34ece8a7b43816ea3c62536\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83c1ce3847de7083e34ece8a7b43816ea3c62536/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Weston studios inside the Royal College of Art’s new design and innovation campus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Weston studios inside the Royal College of Art’s new design and innovation campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iwan Baan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The research produced in this tower will tackle everything from the climate crisis to ageing populations, artificial intelligence and the future of cities, all central to the RCA’s new five-year strategy: “to use interdisciplinary thinking to solve global issues”. It is laudable stuff, but the college might start by addressing issues closer to home.<br><br>The last few years have seen the RCA rocked by student protests and staff strikes, even before the turmoil of the pandemic. Complaints have ranged from lack of access to facilities to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/may/20/art-students-seek-to-take-university-to-court-over-heartbreaking-clear-out\">valuable work being destroyed in a botched clear-out</a>, while the high proportion of academic staff on casual contracts <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/54501/1/why-are-the-royal-college-of-arts-staff-on-strike\">led some to call it</a> “the Sports Direct of higher education”. The college recently conceded to some staff demands, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/mar/13/treated-like-cash-cows-international-students-at-top-london-universities-withhold-29000-fees\">many students remain dismayed by their experience</a>.<br><br>“I feel like I’ve been taken for a ride,” says one overseas student, who moved to London with their partner, both quitting their previous jobs. “People make a lot of sacrifices to come here, but there’s a complete lack of regard for the student experience. Everything is a fight, from trying to book one of the limited workshop slots, to accessing the studios at evenings and weekends. It’s an endless battle with the senior management, just to get the things we have already paid for.”<br><br>Others talk of the extreme lack of communication, the byzantine complaints process, and how slow the college has been to return to pre-Covid operations.<br><br>“They have accepted far too many students and it’s falling apart,” says one second-year. “I’ve never experienced an institution where all the students are so angry all the time. It’s really exhausting. They are just treating us like cash machines.”<br><br>Thompson rebuts the complaints. “It’s all about balance,” he says. “There are some students who want more space and longer opening hours, but if you asked the others if they wanted to pay extra for it, they would say no.” He says that the RCA has now appointed a new head of student experience who will work to address further concerns, and that students are being compensated for damaged work and teaching days lost to strike action.<br><br>But a spokesperson for the student union doesn’t hold out much hope: “It won’t be an easy fix. There is an underlying discrepancy between the day-to-day mechanisms of how students learn and create, and the RCA’s decision-making body that is more concerned with public perception and having a voice in the UK economy. The new building represents this kind of ‘marketable creativity’ – it feels less about student needs than making the college more attractive to business interests.”</p> <p>Thompson denies that student needs have been deprioritised. “Student experience is something we take really, really seriously. During the covid years it’s not been easy, for any university or any student. The proof of the pudding is in the reception we’ve had for this building from the students that have moved in so far.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"crosswords/crossword-blog/2022/may/23/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-the-states-of-the-usa","type":"article","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T11:21:24Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crosswords for beginners: the states of the US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2022/may/23/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-the-states-of-the-usa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2022/may/23/cryptic-crosswords-for-beginners-the-states-of-the-usa","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crosswords for beginners: the states of the US","trailText":"Continuing our series for those tempted or daunted by cryptics, another collection of abbreviations","body":"<p><em>In the example clues below, I explain the two parts of each one.

Also, here, the setters’ names tend to link to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/meet-the-setter\">profiles of the individuals behind the pseudonyms</a>.</em></p> <p>Any reasonably familiar set of abbreviations is going to catch a crossword setter’s eye as a useful way of indicating part of a word. The entertainment industry means that British solvers are more likely to have come across abbreviations used for the 50 states than they are, say, Bolivian departmentos. Here are some that a beginner should keep an eye out for.</p> <h2>California = CA</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9d0b99c5e4669041730a1242532e4bbeb180dd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9d0b99c5e4669041730a1242532e4bbeb180dd5/0_1286_5410_950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Golden Gate Bridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"176\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Golden Gate Bridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Staying with the entertainment industry, “California” in a clue often indicates CA in an answer. Sometimes, setters might combine it with another state. Two examples, both from Pan:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/28674#8-down\">8d</a></strong> Drink from California and Virginia (4)</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/28627#6-across\">6a</a></strong> Shrub found in Colorado and California (4)</p> </blockquote> <p>In the first we combine CA and VA for the drink, CAVA, and in the second CO and CA for the shrub, COCA.</p> <h2>Rhode Island = RI</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1650a98fcc48514f6a5d29723ed483e6e44d448a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1650a98fcc48514f6a5d29723ed483e6e44d448a/0_1167_5700_1421/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newport County, Rhode Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"249\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newport County, Rhode Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image Source/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You don’t have to be a big state to figure in crosswords. Texas is certainly large and much discussed but, unless the setter has a burning urge to include Pope Innocent XI in a puzzle, the TX abbreviation is not much help to anyone.</p> <p>By contrast, here’s tiny Rhode Island in a clue from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/apr/10/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-nutmeg\">Nutmeg</a> …</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27105#20-down\">20d</a> </strong>Opening agency, fellow leaves for Rhode Island (7)<br>[ <strong>wordplay</strong>: synonym for “agency” with abbrev for “fellow” replaced by abbrev for “Rhode Island” ]<br>[ OFFICE with one F replaced by RI ]<br>[ <strong>definition</strong>: opening ]</p> </blockquote> <p>… for ORIFICE.

Rather a lot, it turns out – especially if that landowner is Anne Lister. The “first modern lesbian”, as she is considered by some, has been an inspirational figure ever since her diaries, detailing affairs with women, were decoded and published in the 1980s. But, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/25/uncompromisingly-gay-sally-wainwright-on-turning-gentleman-jack-into-a-global-icon\">Sally Wainwright</a>’s rollicking period drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/10/gentleman-jack-series-two-review-one-of-the-greatest-british-period-dramas-of-our-time\">Gentleman Jack</a> – in which Lister is played by the inimitable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/07/suranne-jones-year-in-tv-vigil-airlifted-into-submarine-gentleman-jack\">Suranne Jones </a>– word of the Yorkshirewoman’s radical ways has spread like wildfire, upending many women’s lives in the process.</p> <p>As the show’s second series concludes, a new documentary, Gentleman Jack Changed My Life, is taking a closer look at the show’s most devoted fans. For some, Jones’s depiction of Lister as a remarkably assertive woman has given them the confidence to come out to friends and family members; for others, the show has helped them make sense of their sexuality after years – or decades – of confusion.</p> <p>Yvonne, who is 64 and from Blackpool, is one of the women whose lives were irrevocably changed by Gentleman Jack when the show debuted in 2019. From the moment she noticed the “woman-on-woman involvement” in the trailer, she says, her “antennae went up. I just thought it was because I like strong women and I love period dramas. So I was like, ‘I’ve got to watch this.’” In the past she had been a fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/20/the-l-word-box-set-review\">The L Word</a> and loved the lesbian historical fiction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/20/sarah-waters-on-20-years-of-tipping-the-velvet\">Tipping the Velvet</a> author Sarah Waters, but it was only when rewatching a Gentleman Jack scene in which Lister and her partner, Ann Walker, declare their love for each other on a clifftop, that Yvonne began to suspect her fascination with the subject matter might run deeper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b8605db8aaec438c9458a41411de0c0144baf83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b8605db8aaec438c9458a41411de0c0144baf83/0_286_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yvonne in Gentleman Jack Changed My Life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I feel more centred, more me than I’ve ever felt’ … Yvonne in Gentleman Jack Changed My Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screenhouse/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I thought, ‘You’re getting too interested’ – this questioning came in.” Underneath the YouTube video was a link to another woman’s coming out story. “It could have been my life. It was like a ceiling fell in and I just couldn’t pretend any more. I thought, Oh my God, Anne Lister, I hate you – because she kept drawing me in.”</p> <p>The documentary follows Yvonne as she comes out to her adult children, whose reaction she describes as “incredible – they took it in their stride, really.” More shocking for them, she says, was the fact that their typically very private mother had taken part in the documentary. Yet although she is nervous about the broadcast – “I have no desire to be on screen, I’m like a rabbit in headlights!” – Yvonne is optimistic that the film will have a positive impact on others. “I hope it helps somebody, and that they don’t have to hate themselves or go through the turmoil this can bring.”</p> <p>For 35-year-old Sami from Manchester, another of the documentary’s subjects, the idea that Gentleman Jack was a period drama rooted in historical fact made all the difference. “I thought, ‘Wow, she had the guts to do this in that day and age.’ That resonated – just to be me.” Having come out to her mum in her early 20s, the lawyer had subsequently gone back into the closet, leaving her mother believing her daughter’s sexuality was “just a phase”. Not normally one for committing to watching a TV show – “I’m quite hyper, so for me to sit down and watch a full series it would have to be quite good!” – Sami became hooked. Discussions with her mum about her sexuality had been “explosive over the years”, she says, but the show, which they watched together, gave Sami the confidence to assert herself. “It allowed us to start talking about these uncomfortable issues. I don’t think my mum is 100% [onboard], but I feel more able to talk to her about it now, whether she likes it or not.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"786c453854e84b8e6822e4a81686657fe2590e02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/786c453854e84b8e6822e4a81686657fe2590e02/0_178_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sami, right, with her mum, Hazel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m more able to talk to her about it now, whether she likes it or not’ … Sami, right, with her mum, Hazel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screenhouse/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chichi is in her early 20s and had already come out to her mum before Gentleman Jack aired. But the show gave her the impetus to tell her dad, and later her grandparents – an announcement the film chronicles to heartwarming effect. Already aware of Lister’s significance thanks to a Sue Perkins documentary from 2015, and a one-off BBC drama from 2010 – Chichi was eagerly anticipating Wainwright’s version. Despite having watched numerous queer dramas before, it was Gentleman Jack that really changed her perspective on coming out. Whereas other shows tended to be niche – many of them crowdfunded or only available on YouTube – the fact that this show clearly had a broad target audience in mind felt validating: it was “mainstream on the BBC at a peak time on Sunday, which was amazing”. Chichi thinks the period drama element also helped – because nobody lives like Lister any more, her story and the setting have become strangely inclusive, making it “accessible for everyone to relate to in their own way”.</p> <p>The fact that Gentleman Jack is set in the 1800s felt significant for other reasons, too. Before watching the show, Chichi had been unsure whether to come out to her grandparents. “We were so close and I thought I don’t want to rock the boat,” she says. But the reaction of Lister’s loved ones in the show, despite the intolerant times they lived in, motivated Chichi to be fully transparent. “I loved how the relationship Anne has with her aunt was depicted, because she was always so supportive, and I thought, ‘I really want that.’ If her aunt could be that supportive back then, there is hope.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c233d2a6250286927d79266eb72b6eccef75891e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c233d2a6250286927d79266eb72b6eccef75891e/13_0_3719_4649/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chichi.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘If she could do it back then, I can definitely do it now’ … Chichi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Chichi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lister’s strength also felt contagious. Seeing that level of self-possession on screen “helped me feel more comfortable with myself and care less about what people think. Anne Lister was so unapologetically herself at a time when everyone was against her – if she could do it back then, I can definitely do it now. She was such a strong person,” says Chichi.</p> <p>Yvonne agrees that it was the show’s basis in reality – coupled with Lister’s ability to know herself in a world that had “no language” for her desires – that proved most inspirational. “You can’t comprehend that somebody lived that life unashamedly back then. That boggled my mind,” she says. One thing that stood out to Yvonne, who is a Mormon, was the way Lister dealt with the conflict between her attraction to women and her faith. She cites a scene in which Walker worries such desires are “evil”. “Anne Lister stood and said, ‘I am made perfectly in the way God intended me to be, I’m not apologising for that.’ That was what went right through my soul. And I thought, ‘She’s right – whatever’s going on with me, this is how God intended me to be.’”</p> <p>Gentleman Jack hasn’t just allowed these women to better understand themselves, it’s also helped them make like-minded friends. “If you ask someone if they like Gentleman Jack, you can tell a lot from their reaction,” says Sami. “Are they accepting? So I’ve used that as a tester – that’s worked well.” Yvonne, meanwhile, says the show has opened up a whole new world for her, having met other Gentleman Jack devotees from across the globe at the Anne Lister birthday week, a celebration in Lister’s home town of Halifax.</p> <p>Yvonne is still reeling from the transformative effect Gentleman Jack has had on her life. “It’s so weird because I was so embarrassed. I was thinking, at my age, this is ridiculous, you should have known this years ago. But it was like a puzzle piece slotting into place. I feel more centred, more me than I’ve ever felt. And it’s taken a programme to jolt it out of me.” Such realisations make for an incredibly heartening documentary, and they are proof that progressive, representational TV remains vital. “I’ve come a long way since the first series,” says Sami. “I just wish it had come along earlier.”</p> <p>• Gentleman Jack Changed My Life is on BBC One on 24 May at 10.40pm.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/may/23/liverpool-sign-fabio-carvalho-from-fulham-for-5m-plus-add-ons","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T11:13:32Z","webTitle":"Liverpool sign Fábio Carvalho as Thiago races to be fit for Paris final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/23/liverpool-sign-fabio-carvalho-from-fulham-for-5m-plus-add-ons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/may/23/liverpool-sign-fabio-carvalho-from-fulham-for-5m-plus-add-ons","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool sign Fábio Carvalho as Thiago races to be fit for Paris final","trailText":"Liverpool have confirmed Fulham’s attacking midfielder Faábio Carvalho will join them on 1 July but are sweating on Thiago Alcântara’s fitness for Saturday’s Champions League final","body":"<p>Liverpool have confirmed Fulham’s attacking midfielder Fábio Carvalho will join them on 1 July but are sweating on Thiago Alcântara’s fitness for Saturday’s Champions League final against Real Madrid.</p> \n<p>Nineteen-year-old Carvalho is expected to sign a five-year contract with the Anfield club and will cost £5m plus add-ons.

On the player front Fred, Cristiano Ronaldo and David de Gea escape with their reputations relatively intact. The summer recruits Jadon Sancho and Raphaël Varane have struggled to fit in, which is quite difficult in such a poor team. Ole Gunnar Solskjær could not get much of a tune out of the squad and Ralf Rangnick has arguably been worse. England’s Harry Maguire and Marcus Rashford have endured a miserable time. Maguire has looked off the pace and was dropped for the April defeat by Arsenal. Rashford has come off the bench more times than he has started in the league, resulting in four goals in 25 appearances. Even the catering at Old Trafford is not up to scratch. The BT Sport presenter Jake Humphrey tweeted a photo of his offering – scrambled egg and mash potato – to rightful derision. Good luck, Mr Ten Hag.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Norwich’s recruitment</h2> <p>When a team finish bottom, you know something has gone wrong. Few expected Norwich to stay up but ending with 22 points will hurt. Teemu Pukki has 11 goals but their second-top scorer in the league is Josh Sargent with two, which he scored in a 3-0 win over Watford. The director of football, Stewart Webber, has received plenty of criticism for his recruitment strategy. Their most creative asset, Emi Buendía, was sold over the summer and not replaced, despite the club bringing in 11 first-team signings. Few had Premier League experience and the Chelsea loanee Billy Gilmour never looked like fitting into the system. Daniel Farke was sacked in October; Dean Smith has overseen a slight improvement and will be confident of bringing them back up. He will hope the players, like the hierarchy, will learn from their mistakes.</p> <h2>Premier League ownership test</h2> <p>“The Premier League has now received legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United Football Club” is possibly the least reassuring sentence of the season. Some have accused Saudi Arabia of buying Newcastle as part of a sportswashing campaign but surely that cannot be true. Can spending £25m on Chris Wood really make the world forget about the awful human rights record in the country or the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi? Could the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/13/newcastle-kit-sharing-saudi-arabia-colours-sportswashing-amnesty\">supposed new away kit design</a> that would invite Newcastle fans to splash out on a Saudi Arabia national team replica with a different badge really make the country seem more acceptable? Yes, it can. “If it is true that Newcastle United is changing its away kit to match Saudi Arabia’s national colours, it exposes the power of the Saudi dollar and the kingdom’s determination to sportswash its brutal, blood-soaked human rights record,” Felix Jakens, Amnesty International UK’s head of campaigns, said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8701a484f0a0529b491680b84b88989d48e2fb24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8701a484f0a0529b491680b84b88989d48e2fb24/0_0_1907_1322/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yasir al-Rumayyan, the chairman of Newcastle, and Amanda Staveley, a part-owner, look on from the stands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yasir al-Rumayyan, the chairman of Newcastle, and Amanda Staveley, a part-owner, look on from the stands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Watford</h2> <p>Roy Hodgson slammed a group of his players for failing to stand up and be counted in their relegation battle. “Perhaps I’m left to reflect that some of the players suggested to me as the ones who would resolve the club’s parlous situation weren’t, in fact, able to produce the performances that they’d been billed as being capable of,” Hodgson wrote in his programme notes before the 5-1 loss against Leicester. Hodgson is not alone in the Watford dressing room. Ben Foster said: “You just don’t really know what you’re going to get from us, to be perfectly honest. We’ve got too many players who are happy to put it in for an hour, 70 minutes, but then probably fall off and happily let it go in the last 20 minutes.” When your manager and goalkeeper are happy to call you out for abject failure, maybe it is time to take a long hard look at yourself and soon realise why you are a Championship player.</p> <h2>Romelu Lukaku</h2> <p>The Belgian returned to England to prove Chelsea and the Premier League wrong after being cast aside by the Blues earlier in his career and deemed surplus to requirements at Manchester United in 2019. Forty-seven league goals and a Serie A title at Internazionale meant Thomas Tuchel came calling with a £97m cheque. Sadly for Lukaku he has never looked like the striker Chelsea need to help them challenge Manchester City and Liverpool. He has started 16 Premier League matches and come off the bench 10 times<strong>,</strong> a sign of his status in the squad. Lukaku has 13 cup starts, making him very much a second-string option in a team without a prolific striker – Mason Mount is the top scorer in the league with 11, three ahead of Lukaku. If Lukaku stays, he or Chelsea will need to change, otherwise it could be another forgettable spell in England for the striker.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/may/23/the-people-making-a-difference-the-man-who-made-blokes-strip-off-and-feel-good-about-themselves","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T11:00:33Z","webTitle":"The people making a difference: the man who made blokes strip off and feel good about themselves","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/23/the-people-making-a-difference-the-man-who-made-blokes-strip-off-and-feel-good-about-themselves","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/23/the-people-making-a-difference-the-man-who-made-blokes-strip-off-and-feel-good-about-themselves","fields":{"headline":"The people making a difference: the man who made blokes strip off and feel good about themselves","trailText":"Paul Goddard wanted to help ‘pretty average’ men realise they can be sexy, so put together a ‘dad bod’ calendar. Now it’s his turn for a treat","body":"<p>Paul Goddard was susceptible to peer pressure growing up. “To try and fit in I’d commit crimes with the other guys who were older than me,” he says. “Shoplifting, stealing cars. I was a bit of a turd, to be honest.” He grew up in Newton Heath, Manchester, a post-industrial community <a href=\"http://www.uklocalarea.com/index.php?lsoa=E01005256&amp;amp;q=Newton+Heath&amp;amp;wc=00BNGC\" title=\"\">that ranks</a> highly in the nationwide index for deprivation. “I didn’t have much choice,” Goddard says. “Commit crime to be one of the boys, or sit alone in my room all day?”</p> <p>Goddard, who is now 39 and works in promotions and marketing in Manchester, struggled with his mental health throughout his teens. His father wasn’t around and he lacked a male role model. “There was this demon inside me,” he says. “I hated the world. No one was there for me. It made me into a pretty bad person for a while.”</p> <p>When he was 15, he had his first panic attack. “I was smoking some weed, and I panicked. I fell through a glass table and went out cold. I still have a scar.” For the next year and a half, he felt depressed almost every day. “I’d ring ambulances all the time,” Goddard says, “because I thought I was dying. Everyone could see I was a mess.”</p> <p>His is not a story of sudden reversal. He worked on his mental health for many years, and in his early 30s, slowly started to feel more settled, partly because his career in security for films and TV programmes helped build his self-esteem. “It did loads for my confidence,” he says. “I put my focus into becoming a better man and being more stable mentally.”</p> <p>Goddard started to think about why so many people struggle with their self-worth, and about how he felt about his body. The year before, he had been going to the gym regularly and felt really good about himself. But then he injured his wrist while boxing, and wasn’t able to train any more. He gained weight, and began to feel worse. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We all feel pressure from social media,” he says. “Men have to have a six-pack and a tan.” In September 2021, Goddard was walking down the street when an idea popped into his head. “I thought, why not do a dad bod calendar, to raise awareness of mental health?” He is himself the proud owner of a dad bod, he says. “I do have a bit of a belly. I’d say I’m pretty average.”</p> <p>The next step was to recruit some willing dads to his initiative. Understandably, persuading men to strip off for the camera was a tall order. He put a post on Facebook, and men initially volunteered, but as the shoot approached, they got cold feet and backed out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If someone said, ‘I’m going to get my duds out,’ we’d all say, ‘Do it!’ </p> <footer> <cite>Paul Goddard</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eventually, he managed to corral enough men, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CWD-tbGLxIX/\" title=\"\">God Bods 2022</a> was shot in the basement of a central Manchester bar.</p> <p>“I wanted it to look seedy,” says Goddard. He was the project manager, photographer, editor and designer, as well as a model. “We had men from all different walks of life,” he says. “A married gay couple. Some brothers. A pipe fitter. A construction manager. Someone who works in a museum. A proper mixed bag.</p> <p> We all just went for it – a load of naked guys in a basement.

They can still feel sexy and appealing, even if the world doesn’t see them that way.”</p> <p>Barry Lester was one of Goddard’s models. “The reason I got involved is because I’ve suffered with my own mental health,” he says. “I felt really proud. It gave me so much confidence.”</p> <p>The success of the calendar has inspired men to share their experiences regarding body image. “Guys reach out to me and ask what they can do to boost their confidence levels,” Goddard says, “or to deal with their anxiety. I always tell them to get professional help.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d8cab8bdf169804f100062c5a6f34bf9a7ca44d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d8cab8bdf169804f100062c5a6f34bf9a7ca44d/0_342_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goddard with his new camera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goddard with his new camera, courtesy of Canon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goddard is hoping to set up a mental health initiative called Petal of the Mind, and to film and share content on social media to raise awareness.

With the problem largely eliminated, Wolff finally had cause for optimism.</p> \n<p>“Can we fight for another world championship? Well we bet we can,” he said. “We just need to have a car able to finish first and second. We have reasons to believe we can get there. If you look at the odds they are against us but motor racing is a different ball game. We saw on Sunday that Ferrari did not score a lot of points although they should have, so we are absolutely pushing flat out to bring us back into the game.</p> \n<p>“I have seen a car that reminded me of the race cars of previous seasons.

Wherever he goes from here – expect him to feature frequently in transfer-gossip bulletins over the summer, with his former club Tottenham <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/03/christian-eriksen-could-be-missing-link-in-tottenhams-revived-attack\">among possible suitors</a> – Eriksen will always have a place in Brentford folklore.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Luis Díaz</h2> <p>As if Jürgen Klopp’s fabled attacking juggernaut at Liverpool possibly needed new angles, new lines of attack, along came Luis Díaz in January to provide them. “We believe he has everything needed to fit into our way and adapt to the Premier League, both physically and mentally,” said Klopp after securing the Colombia international from Porto for an initial €40m. Díaz’s four Premier League goals and three assists barely tell the story of just what a threat his presence on the left of Liverpool’s attack poses. He has also been pivotal to Liverpool’s cup successes, notably in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/03/villarreal-liverpool-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\">comeback at Villarreal</a>, in unstitching Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final and in the opening half-hour of the final, when Chelsea didn’t know how to deal with him. Had he joined at the start of the season, that quadruple may well have become a reality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5c3914d4647c0c424a8aab751068d5ba8585b3c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c3914d4647c0c424a8aab751068d5ba8585b3c9/0_133_2996_1798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Díaz runs at the Spurs defence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Díaz runs at the Spurs defence – the Colombian has made a formidable attack even more feared.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Dejan Kulusevski</h2> <p>Perhaps only Newcastle, newly backed by Saudi millions, did better transfer business in January than Tottenham, whose two headline mid-season arrivals from Juventus, Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski, acclimatised instantly and have been instrumental in a strong second half of the campaign. Kulusevski has been full of verve and industry in a wide attacking position, complementing and fortifying the lethal front pairing of Son Heung-min and Harry Kane and providing eight assists in only 18 matches. Tottenham are expected to sign the Swede this summer on a permanent deal. Kulusevski had felt stifled at Juve whereas he has praised Antonio Conte, the Spurs manager, for “letting me make mistakes and be me, letting me play without pressure”. Tottenham under Conte aren’t yet where they want to be but Kulusevski epitomises what they’ve got right so far.</p> <h2>Marc Cucurella</h2> <p>Mid-table sides and players can be overlooked in end-of-term roundups but Brighton’s progress to a highest-ever league placing deserves recognition. Graham Potter’s side were quietly excellent in the closing weeks and their Spanish wing-back epitomised their development. Signed for £15m from Getafe on deadline day in August, Cucurella has been an instant hit, winning Brighton’s supporters’ and players’ player of the year awards. A consistently tricky and skilful outlet on the left, Cucurella has deserved more than his one, magnificent goal this season (in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/brighton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_medium&amp;utm_source=Twitter\">mauling of Manchester United</a>) – though a failure to convert stylish football into goals is a team-wide problem. There is room for some improvement defensively but the interest of richer clubs – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/18/manchester-city-make-brighton-left-back-marc-cucurella-a-summer-transfer-target-guardiola\">Manchester City</a> and Chelsea have been linked – comes as no surprise and he may well add to his one Spain cap.</p> <h2>Marc Guéhi</h2> <p>Crystal Palace, like their great rivals Brighton, have enjoyed a season of incremental yet significant mid-table improvement, with Patrick Vieira imposing a distinctive new style. Creatively, they’ve been strengthened by the signing of Conor Gallagher on loan from Chelsea, but at the back their permanent signing from Stamford Bridge, Marc Guéhi, has perhaps been their most important addition. “The club is taking a really exciting direction,” the defender said on his arrival for £18m in July, and Guéhi has helped them down that path with a string of composed, commanding performances, deservedly earning an England call-up in March and the club’s players’ player of the season award. Vieira has shown sufficient faith in the 21-year-old to have given him the armband when needed, making Guéhi Palace’s youngest captain for 10 years when he led them out against Watford in February. Guéhi epitomises the more upbeat mood around Selhurst Park this season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac156b2c1c1df34230c5e5bec5812ac770d69993\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac156b2c1c1df34230c5e5bec5812ac770d69993/0_61_1281_769/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marc Guehi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marc Guéhi has performed with maturity and tenacity in Palace’s defence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Obrien/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Aaron Ramsdale</h2> <p>Arsenal’s failure to secure fourth place made it easy to dredge up the old tropes about their flakiness and inconsistency, but amid all the frustration their improvement at the back is worth flagging up. Ben White in central defence has been an excellent addition but behind him Aaron Ramsdale in goal has been crucial. The £24m signing from Sheffield United is a more assertive, confident presence than his immediate predecessors and his ability with the ball at his feet has enabled Arsenal to play out of defence more effectively. The ease with which he supplanted Bernd Leno as Mikel Arteta’s No 1 has also put him firmly in the England picture. “I have the self-belief that, yes, I could hold down the position [of England No 1],” he said in October. Few would argue.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/may/23/ukrainian-court-sentences-russian-soldier-to-life-in-prison-for-killing-civilian-vadim-shishimarin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T10:29:46Z","webTitle":"Ukrainian court sentences Russian soldier to life in prison for killing civilian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/ukrainian-court-sentences-russian-soldier-to-life-in-prison-for-killing-civilian-vadim-shishimarin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/23/ukrainian-court-sentences-russian-soldier-to-life-in-prison-for-killing-civilian-vadim-shishimarin","fields":{"headline":"Ukrainian court sentences Russian soldier to life in prison for killing civilian","trailText":"Vadim Shishimarin shot dead Oleksandr Shelipov as he rode his bicycle in village in Sumy region during early days of invasion","body":"<p>A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/russian-soldier-will-accept-punishment-ukraine-war-crime-vadim-shysimarin\">trial related to war crimes</a> carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion.</p> \n<p>The verdict was delivered on Monday by the judge Serhii Ahafonov in a packed courtroom, with dozens of Ukrainian and foreign television cameras crammed into the small chamber.</p> \n<p>The judge said although Shishimarin cooperated with the investigation and expressed remorse, the court could not accept his claim he did not mean to kill Shelipov when he fired at him. “The murder was committed with direct intent,” he said.</p> \n<p>Shishimarin, wearing a grey and blue hoodie, listened to the judge deliver his long verdict with his head bowed from inside the glass box for defendants.

The attack led the Russian soldiers to disperse and Shishimarin ended up stealing a car with four other soldiers.</p> \n<p>When they saw Shelipov riding a bicycle and speaking on his mobile phone, one of the other soldiers told Shishimarin to shoot him, for fear he would give away their positions. Shishimarin fired three or four shots at Shelipov from his Kalashnikov.</p> \n<p>“I was ordered to shoot, so I opened fire on him and he fell. We carried on driving,” he said in a video interrogation released by Ukraine’s SBU security services.</p> \n<p>Shishimarin pleaded guilty to the crime, but his lawyer argued that his client was following an order and did not have intent to kill. Shishimarin also apologised to the wife of the victim.</p> \n<p>“The court cannot recognise the sincerity of his repentance,” Ahafonov said in his verdict.</p> \n<p>Shishimarin was whisked away from the court after the hearing in the back of a police van. He has 30 days to launch an appeal.</p> \n<p>Speaking outside the courthouse, Shishimarin’s lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov said he would challenge the verdict. “This is the most severe sentence and any level-headed person would challenge it,” he said. He added that he believed “societal pressure” had influenced the court’s decision.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor Andriy Syniuk said the ruling was “lawful and justified”.</p> \n<p>It is the first in a number of war crimes cases that Ukraine prosecutors want to try as quickly as possible.

However, Ukraine has made swift justice a priority, partly as a warning to Russian troops still occupying parts of the country that they may face justice for any crimes they commit. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In an <a href=\"https://meduza.io/feature/2022/05/18/mne-ego-ne-otdadut-prosto-skazali-nikak\">interview</a> with the Russian independent news outlet Meduza, Shishimarin’s mother, Lyubov, claimed her son was a caring and kind young man who had joined the army partly because there was a lack of opportunity in their home town, and partly to help support the family after his stepfather was killed last year.</p> \n<p>She said her son called in late February and said: “Mummy, I won’t have a telephone for a week, I have to give it up.

Is he ill or going insane? Are we pushing him into a corner where he will see no other way out to save face than to accelerate the conflict into a total war?</p> <p>We should stop this obsession with the red line, this endless search for the right balance between support for Ukraine and avoiding total war. The “red line” is not an objective fact: Putin himself is redrawing it all the time, and we contribute to his redrawing with our reactions to Russia’s activities. A question like “Did US intelligence-sharing with Ukraine cross a line?” makes us obliterate the basic fact: it was Russia itself which crossed the line, by attacking Ukraine. So instead of perceiving ourselves as a group which just reacts to Putin as an impenetrable evil genius, we should turn the gaze back at ourselves: what do we – the “free west” – want in this affair?</p> <p>We must analyze the ambiguity of our support of Ukraine with the same cruelty we analyze Russia’s stance. We should reach beyond double standards applied today to the very foundations of European liberalism. Remember how, in the western liberal tradition, colonization was often justified in the terms of the rights of working people. John Locke, the great Enlightenment philosopher and advocate of human rights, justified white settlers grabbing land from Native Americans with a strange left-sounding argument against excessive private property. His premise was that an individual should be allowed to own only as much land as he is able to use productively, not large tracts of land that he is not able to use (and then eventually rents to others). In North America, as he saw it, Indigenous people were using vast tracts of land mostly just for hunting, and the white settlers who wanted to use it for intense agriculture had the right to seize it for the benefit of humanity.</p> <p>In the ongoing Ukraine crisis, both sides present their acts as something they simply had to do: the west had to help Ukraine remain free and independent; Russia was compelled to intervene militarily to protect its safety. The latest example: the Russian foreign ministry claiming Russia will be “<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/12/europe/finland-leaders-join-nato-intl/index.html\">forced to take retaliatory steps”</a> if Finland joins Nato. No, it will not be “forced”, in the same way that Russia was not “forced” to attack Ukraine. This decision appears “forced” only if one accepts the whole set of ideological and geopolitical assumptions that sustain Russian politics.</p> <p>These assumptions have to be analyzed closely, without any taboos. One often hears that we should draw a strict line of separation between Putin’s politics and the great Russian culture, but this line of separation is much more porous than it may appear. We should resolutely reject the idea that, after years of patiently trying to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations, Russia was finally forced/compelled to attack Ukraine – one is <em>never</em> forced to attack and annihilate a whole country. The roots are much deeper; I am ready to call them properly metaphysical.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>One is never forced to attack and annihilate a whole country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Anatoly Chubais, the father of Russian oligarchs (he orchestrated Russia’s rapid privatization in 1992), said in 2004: “I’ve reread all of Dostoevsky over the past three months. And I feel nothing but almost physical hatred for the man. He is certainly a genius, but his idea of Russians as special, holy people, his cult of suffering and the false choices he presents make me want to tear him to pieces.” As much as I dislike Chubais for his politics, I think he is right about Dostoevsky, who provided the “deepest” expression of the opposition between Europe and Russia: individualism versus collective spirit, materialist hedonism versus the spirit of sacrifice.</p> <p>Russia now presents its invasion as a new step in the fight for decolonization, against western globalization. In a text published earlier this month, Dmitry Medvedev, the ex-president of Russia and now the deputy secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, wrote that “the world is waiting for the collapse of the idea of an American-centric world and the emergence of new international alliances based on pragmatic criteria.” (“Pragmatic criteria” means disregard for universal human rights, of course.)</p> <p>So we should also draw red lines, but in a way which makes clear our solidarity with developing countries. Medvedev predicts that, because of the war in Ukraine, “in some states, hunger may occur due to the food crisis” – a statement of breathtaking cynicism. As of May 2022, about 25m metric tons of grain are slowly rotting in Odesa, on ships or in silos, since the port is blocked by the Russian navy. “The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that millions of people are ‘marching towards starvation’ unless ports in southern Ukraine which have been closed because of the war, are reopened,” Newsweek <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/odesa-ukraine-war-food-starvation-un-black-sea-1704508\">reports</a>. Europe now promises to help Ukraine transport the grain by railway and truck – but this is clearly not enough. A step more is needed: a clear demand to open the port for the export of grain, inclusive of sending protective military ships there. It’s not about Ukraine, it’s about the hunger of hundreds of millions in Africa and Asia. <em>Here</em> should the red line be drawn.</p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, recently said: “Imagine [the Ukraine war] is happening in Africa, or the Middle East. Imagine Ukraine is Palestine. Imagine Russia is the United States.” As expected, comparing the conflict in Ukraine with the plight of the Palestinians “offended many Israelis, who believe there are no similarities”, Newsweek <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/russia-sergei-lavrov-compares-ukraine-palestine-putin-israel-1706810\">noted</a>. “For example, many point out that Ukraine is a sovereign, democratic country, but don’t consider Palestine as a state.” Of course Palestine is not a state <em>because Israel denies its right to be a state</em> – in the same way Russia denies the right of Ukraine to be a sovereign state. As much as I find Lavrov’s remarks repulsive, he sometimes deftly manipulates the truth.</p> <p>Yes, the liberal west is hypocritical, applying its high standards very selectively. But hypocrisy means you violate the standards you proclaim, and in this way you open yourself up to inherent criticism – when we criticize the liberal west, we use its own standards. What Russia is offering is a world without hypocrisy – because it is without global ethical standards, practicing just pragmatic “respect” for differences. We have seen clearly what this means when, after the Taliban took over in Afghanistan, they instantly made a deal with China. China accepts the new Afghanistan while the Taliban will ignore what China is doing to Uyghurs – this is, <em>in nuce</em>, the new globalization advocated by Russia. And the only way to defend what is worth saving in our liberal tradition is to ruthlessly insist on its universality. The moment we apply double standards, we are no less “pragmatic” than Russia.</p> <ul> <li><p>Slavoj Žižek is a cultural philosopher.

As Thiel <a href=\"https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian/\">wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics. Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women – two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians – have rendered the notion of “capitalist democracy” into an oxymoron.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rubbish. If “capitalist democracy” is becoming an oxymoron, it’s not because of public assistance or because women got the right to vote. It’s because billionaire capitalists like Thiel are drowning democracy in giant campaign donations to authoritarian candidates who repeat Trump’s big lie.</p> <p>Not incidentally, the 1920s marked the last gasp of the Gilded Age, when America’s rich ripped off so much of the nation’s wealth that the rest had to go deep into debt both to maintain their standard of living and to maintain overall demand for the goods and services the nation produced.</p> <p>When that debt bubble burst in 1929, we got the Great Depression.</p> <p>It was also the decade when Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler emerged to create the worst threats to freedom and democracy the modern world had ever witnessed.</p> <p>If freedom is not compatible with democracy, what is it compatible with?</p> <p>Last Tuesday night, Doug Mastriano, a January 6 insurrectionist and Trump-backed big lie conspiracy theorist, won the Republican nomination for governor of Pennsylvania (the fifth largest state in the country, and the biggest state that flipped from 2016 to 2020). Mastriano was directly involved in a scheme to overturn the 2020 election by sending an “alternate” slate of pro-Trump electors to the electoral college – despite the fact that Trump lost Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes.</p> <p>If Mastriano wins in November, he will appoint Pennsylvania’s secretary of state, who will oversee the 2024 election results in one of the most important battleground states in the country.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the major annual event of the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) – the premier convening organization of the American political right – was held this past week <a href=\"https://www.cpachungary.com/eloadok\">in Budapest</a>.</p> <p>That’s no accident. The Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán and his ruling Fidesz party have become a prominent source of inspiration for America’s anti-democracy movement. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser, describes Orbán’s agenda as that of a “Trump before Trump”.</p> <p>Orbán has used his opposition to immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, abortion and religions other than Christianity as cover for his move toward autocracy – rigging Hungary’s election laws so his party stays in power, capturing independent agencies, controlling the judiciary and muzzling the press.</p> <p>He remains on good terms with Vladimir Putin and has refused to agree to Europe’s proposed embargo of Russian oil.</p> <p>Tucker Carlson – Fox News’s progenitor of white replacement theory – broadcast his show from Budapest. Trump spoke remotely.

It insults every sentient person by minimizing the significance of commandeering the bodies and lives of half the population – and re-inserting government power into every family. And it misleads every reader of Alito’s words by suggesting that a court has the power to shape how future lawmakers and judges will build on its decisions and the reasoning underlying them. Alito’s hollow promise brings to mind similar assurances in notorious cases like <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/98/case.pdf\">Bush v Gore</a>, is inconsistent with <a href=\"https://constitution.org/1-Constitution/cmt/cardozo/jud_proc.htm\">how the judicial process works</a>, and wouldn’t offer any solace to anyone who might become pregnant or whose miscarriage might be treated as a <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/05/roe-abortion-miscarriage-crime-murder-prosecution/\">crime scene for police to investigate</a>.</p> <p>The foolishness of the argument that there’s nothing to see here other than the future of abortion law is underscored by some of what is said in its support. <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-memes-of-dobbs-leak/id1549624070?i=1000560389305\">We’re told</a> not to worry about the future of decisions like <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep388/usrep388001/usrep388001.pdf\">Loving v Virginia</a>, ensuring the right to marry someone of a different race than your own because, after all, Justice Clarence Thomas is in an interracial marriage.

To be sure, Amar’s argument echoes that of the Alito draft, which cites Parrish and says, in effect, “<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21835435-scotus-initial-draft\">nothing to see here</a>, we did the same thing before” when we rolled back the liberty of contract line of decisions in 1937.</p> <p>Justice Alito and Professor Amar are simply wrong: profoundly so. That so-called (and quite misleadingly labeled) <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/franklin-roosevelt-tried-packing-supreme-court\">“switch in time that saved the nine”</a> was <em>nothing like</em> the switch that Dobbs would represent. The 1937 “switch” was no sudden politically driven turnabout but was in fact the culmination of <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3093&amp;context=dlj\">long-simmering movements in legal and economic thought</a> – movements that were reflected both in scholarship and in judicial opinions from the earliest days of the 20th century in places like Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’ dissent in <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep198/usrep198045/usrep198045.pdf\">Lochner v New York</a> insisting that “the 14th amendment does not enact Mr Herbert Spencer’s social statics,” movements that represented the growing conviction that the “freedom” to work at low wages and in miserable conditions was an illusion lacking both moral and legal foundations and one that simply helped perpetuate economic inequality and the exploitation of relatively powerless, not-yet-unionized workers by wealthy and powerful <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/American-Constitutional-Law-University-Textbook/dp/0882776010/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1NTOWNXGCXM0O&amp;keywords=9780882776019&amp;qid=1652991986&amp;sprefix=9780882776019%2Caps%2C38&amp;sr=8-1\">corporations</a>.</p> <p>Indeed, it is noteworthy that West Coast Hotel v Parrish<em> – </em>the<em> 29 </em>March 1937 decision that is usually marked as the pivot point in the great constitutional upheaval – was handed down by <em>precisely the same set of nine</em> <em>justices</em> as the nine who had rendered a decision pointing in the opposite direction less than a year earlier, on 1 June 1936, in <a href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep298/usrep298587/usrep298587.pdf\">Morehead v New York ex rel Tipaldo</a><em>. </em>One justice of the nine, a moderate Republican named Owen J Roberts, who had been rethinking his position on the underlying legal theories, had foreshadowed his shifting views by writing a landmark opinion upholding milk price regulation, <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/291/502/#tab-opinion-1934246\">Nebbia v New York</a>, by a 5-4 vote in 1934 – less than two months after the court had upheld a state mortgage moratorium law by a 5-4 vote in <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/290/398\">Home Building &amp; Loan Ass’n v Blaisdell</a>, a decision clearly foreshadowing the 1937 repudiation of Lochner’s legacy by reconceiving the meaning of the constitution’s clause forbidding all state impairments of the obligation of contracts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dobbs would represent the crude payoff to a partisan political program to take over the federal judiciary</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That history is important to keep in mind if one is to understand the depth of the error made by those who seek to compare the 2022 tsunami that Dobbs would represent with the gradual shift in current represented by the 1937 movement away from liberty of contract to protection of workers and consumers. The head-spinning and altogether untimely switch in the supreme court’s abortion jurisprudence that Dobbs would represent – if the decision the court announces late this June or early July is in substance what the leaked Alito draft indicated it would be – will reflect not the steady maturation of a long-developing jurisprudential movement but the crude payoff to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/opinion/trump-judges-federalist-society.html\">a partisan political program to take over the federal judiciary</a>, one beginning with Ronald Reagan’s presidency and the rise of the Federalist Society, and advancing with supreme court appointments made by Republican presidents all of whom lost the popular vote (George W Bush, appointing <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CHRG-ALITO/pdf/GPO-CHRG-ALITO.pdf\">Justice Alito</a> and <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CHRG-ROBERTS/pdf/GPO-CHRG-ROBERTS.pdf\">Chief Justice John Roberts</a>; Donald J Trump, appointing <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-115shrg28638/pdf/CHRG-115shrg28638.pdf\">Neil Gorsuch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-115shrg32765/pdf/CHRG-115shrg32765.pdf\">Brett Kavanaugh</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/nomination-of-the-honorable-amy-coney-barrett-to-be-an-associate-justice-of-the-supreme-court-of-the-united-states\">Amy Coney Barrett</a>), and made in <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SCOTUS-Report-Final.pdf\">circumstances of dubious legitimacy</a>.</p> <p>Professor Amar <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-memes-of-dobbs-leak/id1549624070?i=1000560389305\">treats as laughably naïve</a> the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/05/reversals-usually-expand-rights-alitos-ruling-would-deny-them/\">observation</a> by ACLU national legal director and Georgetown law professor David Cole that, although “Parrish took away some rights of business owners … its real effect was to expand rights protections for millions of Americans subject to exploitation by powerful corporations.” Amar’s rebuttal? <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-memes-of-dobbs-leak/id1549624070?i=1000560389305\">He says</a>, and I’m serious here, that it’d be equally legitimate to say that “Dobbs’ real effect would be to expand rights protection for millions of innocent, unborn Americans … unborn humans, subject to extermination by society.”</p> <p>It’s hard to know where to begin in unraveling that alleged parallel. Suffice it to note that the status as rights-bearing persons of embryos and fetuses <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1104019.Abortion\">remains a matter of profound sectarian controversy</a> in America and throughout the world while no such controversy attends the status as rights-bearing persons of the array of workers whose rights, at least under laws designed to limit economic exploitation if not directly under the constitution itself, were indisputably expanded by virtue of the Parrish decision and the overturning of the Lochner line of cases.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The  radical change in law and society that Dobbs would represent has no parallel in the history of the supreme court</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps no less important is the indisputable fact that, although there remain <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rehabilitating-Lochner-Defending-Individual-Progressive/dp/022600404X\">a few commentators</a> who continue to think that Lochner<em> </em>was rightly decided and Parrish was wrong, there is a nearly universal consensus, certainly covering the ideological spectrum on the current supreme court, that the “rights” protected by Lochner and the other decisions that Parrish<em> </em>tossed into the dustbin of history were not constitutionally sacrosanct, and that inequalities of bargaining power prevented the common-law baseline that Lochner<em> </em>treated as immune to legislative modification from having any special constitutional status. At the same time, the notions of personal autonomy and bodily integrity that provide the constitutional foundation for the substantive “liberty” at stake in cases like Roe and Casey are almost universally accepted as real, although deep disagreements remain about whether, to what degree, and from what point in fetal development the protection of the unborn fetus can properly trump that <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2265091\">liberty</a>.</p> <p>The upshot is that the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/05/16/how-alitos-draft-opinion-on-abortion-rights-would-change-america\">radical change in law and society</a> that Dobbs would represent truly has no parallel in the history of the supreme court or in the history of the United States. As David Cole <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/05/reversals-usually-expand-rights-alitos-ruling-would-deny-them/\">writes</a>, the “proper analogy is not Brown overruling Plessy, but a decision reviving Plessy, reversing Brown, and relegating Black people to enforced segregation after nearly 70 years of equal protection.” For, as Jamelle Bouie <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/13/opinion/overturning-roe-democracy-equality.html\">rightly observed</a>, “equal standing is undermined and eroded when the state can effectively seize your person for its own ends – that is, when it can force you to give birth.” Whether or not one compares that compulsion and forced labor to literal enslavement, as I did in my <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1339866\">1973 article</a> on Roe v Wade, attempts to minimize the huge retrogression this would represent must be dismissed as little more than shameful efforts to camouflage the carnage the supreme court of the United States is about to unleash both on its own legitimacy and, even more important, on the people in whose name it wields the power of judicial review.</p> <ul> <li><p>Laurence H Tribe is the Carl M Loeb University Professor of Constitutional Law Emeritus at Harvard University, the author of numerous books and articles, a distinguished supreme court advocate, and holder of 11 honorary degrees</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/23/royal-mint-issues-5-coin-to-mark-prince-william-40th-birthday","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T10:11:23Z","webTitle":"Royal Mint issues £5 coin to mark Prince William’s 40th birthday","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/royal-mint-issues-5-coin-to-mark-prince-william-40th-birthday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/royal-mint-issues-5-coin-to-mark-prince-william-40th-birthday","fields":{"headline":"Royal Mint issues £5 coin to mark Prince William’s 40th birthday","trailText":"It is first time second in line to throne has appeared alone on an official coin","body":"<p>An engraving of the Duke of Cambridge, firm of gaze and strong of jaw, will appear on a new £5 coin struck by the Royal Mint to mark his 40th birthday.</p> <p>The design, unveiled ahead of his milestone on 21 June, also incorporates his royal cypher featuring the letter W and the number 40, created by designer and engraver Thomas T Docherty.</p> <p>An inscription on the edge reads: “HRH The Duke of Cambridge.”</p> <p>It is the first time the second in line to the throne will appear alone on an official coin.

Whether you view the Gunners’ season as a failure or one of improvement, there is no doubt that this has been the one where Saka, despite his tender age, has become the club’s talisman. There are few players in the league, perhaps the world, with the Ealing-born winger’s poise and balance, and the beauty of his dribbling off the right flank is that he is just as happy to drive to the byline on his right foot as he is keen to cut inside on his left. Saka is intelligent on the pitch, eloquent off it, and Arsenal are lucky to have someone so fiercely loyal to the club. What is frightening is how much better he could become, especially if Arsenal invest in a proper striker and a right-back capable of overlapping and creating more space for Saka.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Dejan Kulusevski, 22 (Tottenham)</h2> <p>The only non-Englishman to feature here, Kulusevski has qualified for this list despite arriving from Juventus only in January. Since then, he’s racked up as many assists (eight) as Kevin De Bruyne has managed all season, and alongside Spurs’ other mid-season addition, Rodrigo Bentancur, has been a key reason why the club made a late dash for the top four. Rather than blistering pace or a dazzling array of skills, what stands out with Kulusevski is tactical nous and excellent decision-making – choosing the right pass under pressure – which Antonio Conte values deeply. Tottenham are expected to make his loan permanent this summer for €30m, which feels cheap for a player who quickly became a fan favourite, supporters showing their love for the Swede with a chant based upon Abba’s Gimme!

Operating mostly off the left wing this season, though with the ability to play almost anywhere, Foden makes very difficult things look very easy, and seems to glide around world-class opponents at will. Wearing a perma-grimace – which seems to suggest that he always expects more from himself and his teammates – Foden’s passing completion verges on 90%, which is outrageous considering how progressive and brave he is with the ball. His best performances have probably come in the Champions League but without his nine league goals, including a rasping equaliser at Anfield and winners at Brentford and Everton, City would not be champions.</p> <h2>Conor Gallagher, 22 (Crystal Palace)</h2> <p>Thomas Tuchel has confirmed he wants Gallagher in Chelsea’s squad for next season, and it’s easy to see why. There have been numerous sensational all-action displays on loan at Palace, where he oscillated between a No 6 and a No 8 role and set the tone for Patrick Vieira’s high press with his energy, winning duels he had no right to win and snuffing out danger at source. Goals are only part of his game, but his screamer against Everton – curled in off the bar from outside the box after he won back possession high up the pitch – encapsulates his all-round game, and Gallagher put forward his nomination for First Touch of the Season to set up a strike against Watford, killing a cross stone dead and shimmying past Hassane Kamara in one glorious swoosh, before lashing into the top corner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"67da278ba1138aa254adc864148fb87e91adbd56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67da278ba1138aa254adc864148fb87e91adbd56/0_0_4860_3233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conor Gallagher of Crystal Palace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conor Gallagher’s performances on loan at Crystal Palace have impressed Thomas Tuchel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Micah Crook/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ryan Sessegnon, 22 (Tottenham)</h2> <p>If Kulusevski has been a revelation since his first day in a Spurs shirt, Sessegnon has been a slow burner. His Tottenham career appeared to be over when on loan at Hoffenheim last season but under Conte, particularly since the turn of the year, he has quietly transformed himself into one of the team’s most important players. As a left wing-back, the former Fulham starlet has pocketed Mohamed Salah and Saka in crucial clashes recently, and his man-of-the-match display against Burnley means he edges out Palace’s Marc Guéhi and Aston Villa’s Jacob Ramsey for the final spot on this list. With Sessegnon comfortable in a 3-4-3 and 3-5-2, it would be a shock not to see him make his England debut next month in the Nations League to put himself in contention for the World Cup.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2022/may/23/politics-mp-staff-mental-health","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T10:00:54Z","webTitle":"‘We can’t switch off’: MP’s staff member reveals mental health pressure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/23/politics-mp-staff-mental-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/may/23/politics-mp-staff-mental-health","fields":{"headline":"‘We can’t switch off’: MP’s staff member reveals mental health pressure","trailText":"An anonymous worker shares their experience, as study shows half of UK MPs’ staff have clinical levels of psychological distress","body":"<p>A survey of nearly 200 staff working for various MPs, the first of its kind in the UK, has found that almost half met the medical threshold for psychological distress – more than twice the level in the general population.</p> <p>An anonymous worker has shared their experience while trying to serve the public:</p> <p>No one working for an MP expects sympathy. We are, after all, a part of the much-loathed “Westminster bubble”, tarred with the same toxicity our bosses experience for their political affiliations. We are vociferously proud that we contribute to the democratic process, and hopefully we make real differences to the lives of constituents. But staffing for MPs is in dire straits.</p> <p>The days often start the same: working through an inbox filled with abuse, pictures of maimed children in war-torn countries, constituents in desperate need of help, and whatever else the issue of the day happens to be. The phone rings and a distressed voice on the end of the line is contemplating suicide. Or perhaps it’s a victim of childhood sexual abuse relaying details of their awful experiences and seeking support for their mental health.</p> <p>Listening to, and trying to solve, problems you have no expertise in takes its toll. We aren’t trained for this. We don’t have accreditations or people to guide us. At the end of the day, we can’t switch off. Politics never sleeps, so you best be available 24/7.</p> <p>It never used to be this bad. I’ve been around for over a decade and major crises used to come around occasionally. A few late nights with all hands at the pumps and we could weather the storm. The past few years have been different. Brexit, Covid, Afghanistan, Ukraine and the cost of living crisis have dominated a parliamentary staffer’s every waking moment. The unending pressure has got to most of us. Many of my colleagues have moved on or fallen foul of stress, anxiety or depression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed—morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>When things start to go wrong, perhaps from burnout or an argument with a boss who is equally struggling under constant pressure, relationships start to break down.

Parliament can be slow to adapt, held up by tradition and process. But we now have a Speaker who cares about staff and MPs in key roles who understand what we are going through. The time is right to make parliament a leader in employment practices: making HR and mediation available, providing relevant training and making sure offices have the capacity – and capability – to look after their staff.</p> <p>With close to 3,500 parliamentary staff in Westminster and dotted around the UK, we are an integral part of what MPs do.

Whether or not to stand was one of the hardest decisions I have ever made. There was a lot of discussion with my family and those closest to me. My sister had been murdered so we had to ask ourselves the question – would I be safe?</p> <p>I decided to run because I wanted the best for the people who I live near, shop alongside, play sports with and whom I’ve worked with since Jo’s death to keep our community strong and united. I would never have asked for their trust at the ballot box if I thought that winning would cut me off behind a wall of security. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jul/02/labour-candidate-kim-leadbeater-wins-batley-and-spen-byelection\">Since I won</a> I’ve managed to stay accessible while taking all the advice the police and parliamentary security team have offered me.</p> <p>When another MP, Sir David Amess, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/david-amess-last-act-two-year-plot-ali-harbi-ali\">was murdered</a> last October, Channel 4’s Dispatches asked me to talk to my colleagues on all sides of the House of Commons to discover just how serious the threats to them – and to the fabric of our democracy itself – really are. What I learned was shocking. Not just because of the nature of abuse and threats MPs receive every day, which can be truly appalling, but the sheer scale of them.</p> <p>I listened as colleagues reeled off the threats of death, violence, sexual assault and attacks on their families as if they were reading their shopping lists. Dispatches spoke to more than 60 MPs for the programme, and nearly all said they had received abusive or threatening messages, three-quarters said they had received a threat of physical harm and one in three of the female MPs said they had been threatened with sexual violence.</p> <p>We cannot, we must not, normalise this. It doesn’t just “go with the job”. I know that it has already driven some really good MPs – most of them women – to leave public life altogether. And we can never know how many talented young people are now being put off politics as a career.</p> <p>This is not just about those elected to parliament. Nobody is suggesting that MPs are alone in being subjected to this avalanche of hatred and intimidation. I worry desperately about the staff in our offices, many of them young, who have to read the emails and letters and who so often shield their bosses from the contents of them. They get no training in how to identify a genuine and dangerous threat from the keyboard warriors who get a kick out of threatening violence that they’ll probably never carry out. Our parliamentary and constituency workers get no extra pay for handling this filth and it’s down to individual MPs to make sure they are offered support and, if necessary, counselling.</p> <p>Since Sir David’s murder there are important steps under way behind the scenes to address some of these problems. It saddens me, after all the promising conversations that followed my sister’s murder, that we have waited this long, but nevertheless I welcome it wholeheartedly.</p> <p>Like people in every walk of life, those of us in politics have to work in the world as we find it, communicating both online and in person. But that doesn’t mean we have to shrug our shoulders and accept that world as it is. After all, we are elected to parliament to change things for the better and to help protect all our citizens from harm. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/16/a-torrent-of-abuse-victims-pin-hopes-on-uk-online-safety-bill\">online safety bill</a> should bring important changes. But if we want to defend our democratic values and encourage vigorous, passionate debate that is free of abuse and intimidation, we cannot do it by tighter security measures and legislation alone.</p> <p>As MPs, we need to look at our own behaviour, the language we use and the example we set. We need to be better at explaining what we do and encourage a greater understanding of how politics works and why it matters – in schools and in the community more widely.</p> <p>Proper support and protection for MPs is not just about our own personal safety. Our democracy may be well-established but it is not invulnerable. Just as we defend democratic values abroad when they are threatened, we must defend them at home as well. It has to be a collective effort in which everybody has a part to play.

By April, volunteers based in Philadelphia were mailing seeds donated by seed companies to smaller distribution sites across the country – including the one in Adeeb’s house. Her basement was transformed into a seed hub. Her students began mailing out the seeds and even planting gardens in their elderly neighbors’ back yards.</p> <p>They received about 140 seed varieties, said Adeeb, but she quickly noticed a problem. They “were not necessarily foods that our Bipoc communities were requesting. They’re not things that people eat,” she said. There were no collards, okra, or bok choy.</p> <p>So Adeeb and her students began talking to their neighbors, and then with farmers across the country, to figure out which seeds were culturally meaningful to them – and where to buy them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bb4de24649e19bee51b3c38867f4d8d0ea25b28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bb4de24649e19bee51b3c38867f4d8d0ea25b28/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of hand holding flowers in grass\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adeeb examines the flowers in her garden in Taymen Field in Upper Malboro, Maryland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dee Dwyer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The resulting alliance of Bipoc growers became <a href=\"https://ujamaafarms.com/home\">the Ujamaa Cooperative Farming Alliance</a>. Ujamaa means “cooperative economics” in Swahili and takes its name from one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa, a wintertime holiday celebrating community.</p> <p>The alliance is working not only to provide the seeds its neighbors want but it is also tracking down old or rare varieties of seeds to grow. </p> <p>“The mission of Ujamaa is to recover and reclaim our culture or heritage, steward it and make sure that it’s available to future generations,” Adeeb said. She wants to support growers of color to have more agency over their food and develop more resilience for future crises.</p> <p>In February, Ujamaa <a href=\"https://ujamaaseeds.com/\">opened its catalog</a> to orders. With collections dedicated to Caribbean, Native American, Latin American, Asian, African and southern seeds, the alliance hopes to raise funds to continue its free seed distribution efforts and support growers.</p> <h2>‘The most amazing link to our history’</h2> <p>Growing up Adeeb heard lots of stories about food – “my family has been farming since 1710 in this country” – but the one she heard most often was about a watermelon that grew so successfully her great-great-uncle’s daughters didn’t have to leave home to work.</p> <p>Most Black girls had to work as maids after slavery, Adeeb said, but “the number one most dangerous place for a Black child to be was in the home of a white family”. Because their parents were successful farmers, Adeeb said, “the girls were not abused”.</p> <p>She asked her 90-year-old cousins to describe the watermelon – the color of its rind, the taste of its fruit – and tracked it down. When she finally got a packet of the seeds, she said, “I cried, I cried, I cried, I still cry, that we found this most amazing link to our history.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b4a1a7cbec39731990dee01c49870ef5e09a0bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b4a1a7cbec39731990dee01c49870ef5e09a0bc/0_0_5569_3963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four woman talking in a field\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adeeb in her garden with farmers (from the left) Kathy Anderson, Karen Bowlding and Lyfe Love at Taymen Field.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dee Dwyer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fb8a05d2b19bf7c054fa08e06c9d54564f48043\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fb8a05d2b19bf7c054fa08e06c9d54564f48043/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A farmhouse seen in the distance under a blue ky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adeeb’s garden in Maryland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dee Dwyer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adeeb, a retired teacher who has always centered food in her work, wants to keep spreading awareness of the importance of these cultural and historical links to food.</p> <p>After setting up Ujamaa, she invited the Experimental Farm Network’s Kleinman to join its board and asked him, as she asks everyone, to consider which seeds were culturally important to his ancestors.</p> <p>Kleinman knew immediately: grains. “I’m eastern European, Jewish primarily, and I know that one of my great-grandfathers was a miller and a baker back in Romania.”</p> <p>At the time there were laws against Jews owning farmland, he said, so “it was grains, it was milling and baking that gave him and his siblings and his parents the resources that they needed to cross the ocean and give my family a new life – and save us from the Holocaust that was coming just a couple decades later”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da0f8ed7b7c83c55578d92663a715d4aceecaacf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da0f8ed7b7c83c55578d92663a715d4aceecaacf/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman stands in front of an open SUV truck holding a potted herb\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bonnetta Adeeb holds the herb borage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dee Dwyer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b450fd2499f11509b4c846783d343bfe8830a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b450fd2499f11509b4c846783d343bfe8830a62/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman checking a red tractor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adeeb checks on her tractor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dee Dwyer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the hope of sourcing more “culturally relevant seeds” themselves, the Cooperative Gardens Commission began buying seeds that communities were asking for instead of relying solely on the donations of seed companies.</p> <h2>‘Food is not a privilege; it’s a right’</h2> <p>Within a year of the Ujamaa Cooperative Farming Alliance starting, Adeeb’s students had installed 50 gardens in their communities.</p> <p>The alliance has partnered with farmers across the US – from Oregon and Washington to Kentucky and North Carolina. Some of them are growing seeds mailed directly from Adeeb or her students, while others have been growing plants for years that they are now contributing to Ujamaa’s seed library.</p> <p>Sonya Harris plants Ujamaa’s seeds at the <a href=\"https://www.bullockgardenproject.org/\">Bullock Garden Project</a> in New Jersey, which stocks school gardens with vegetables. The project operates largely in low-income neighborhoods where communities turned to the gardens for food in the early days of the pandemic. Harris, who met Adeeb at the first gatherings of the Cooperative Gardens Commission, wants to help people develop food sovereignty by growing their own food from seed. “Food is not a privilege; it’s a right,” she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0ff0be7e748b7611ff1c0be780550422da6d90eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ff0be7e748b7611ff1c0be780550422da6d90eb/1621_379_2953_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of a yellow flower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A buttercup in Adeeb’s garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dee Dwyer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harris is also keen to connect children to plants with difficult histories. “I am big on reclaiming cotton,” she said. She wants to show children the reality of the plant – how sharp the crop was that children their own age were expected to harvest – but also how their ancestors developed the plant.</p> <p>“When we talk about the plants that made the money for the slave holders, I feel that that seed belongs to the African people and the Indigenous people. The people whose land it was stolen from and the stolen people who had to take care of it,” Harris says. “Why is there this shame to grow a crop that we developed?”</p> <p>By teaching Black children to grow cotton, Harris says she wants to inspire the future growers of this plant – who might find a way to help it survive drought or long winters, whatever the climate crisis brings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/ng-interactive/2022/apr/14/climate-crisis-food-systems-not-ready-biodiversity\">Our food system isn’t ready for the climate crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tomia MacQueen, another grower in Ujamaa’s alliance and founder of Wildflower Farm in Pennington, New Jersey, is using the network to help her find the turnip greens that her grandmother grew up eating.</p> <p>Raised in Detroit, MacQueen thinks a lot about access to healthy and culturally appropriate foods in cities.

For the combination of flavours (grassy beans and sharp cheese), but also for the group activity and concentration required to get the beans out of their velour-lined pods and matched with the right amount of cheese. Some people really apply themselves to the task and double pod each bean, getting the bright-green disc out of the opaque skin with a nail. I don’t mind the slightly bitter outer coat, especially if the beans are small.</p> <p>For many Italians, eating <em>fave e pecorino</em> is not only a traditional part of 1 May, the <em>festa dei </em><em>lavoratori, </em>whether at home, in a restaurant or sitting on a rug in the park, but a habit while broad beans are around. We were brought some the other evening in an osteria (also a plate of salami and some fried dough balls), which, in that hungry moment, tasted like heaven.</p> <p>A variation on the fave e pecorino theme is the first of three salad suggestions this week: broad beans, soft butterhead or little gem lettuce, pecorino and mint. You can use fresh or frozen broad beans for this, but either way, you need about 300g. It is worth double-peeling half of them for this salad, even if they are quite small. The best way to do this is by putting them in a sieve and then the sieve in a bowl and covering the lot in boiling water. After 30 seconds, pull out the sieve and run it under the cold tap, after which the bean skins should pop off if you squeeze one end hard enough (although be careful to shoot them into a bowl, not across the kitchen). The other half can keep their opaque coats on.</p> <p>In a bowl, mix all the beans with a couple of washed and dried little gem or large butterhead lettuce leaves, a good amount of extra-virgin olive oil, a pinch of salt, a handful of ripped mint leaves and thin slices, or potato peeler curls, of pecorino. Of course, if you want to add lemon or a bit of vinegar, you can. I love this salad with roast chicken, and also stuffed into a split focaccia or pitta pocket, maybe with some ricotta.</p> <p>Lemon is vital for the next idea, artichokes and parmesan. Using a sharp knife, trim two large or four small, tender, purple artichokes and stems of all of their tough parts. Cut in four, then slice each quarter very thinly before tossing with lemon juice, which stops them discolouring and also adds a nice amount of acidity. Arrange the artichoke slices on a plate, then top with thin slices of parmesan (again, a peeler is useful here). Thanks to the cheese and lemon, you probably won’t need more salt, but taste to make sure. I have been told several times that writing “drizzle”, “zigzag” and “top with” are all extremely annoying descriptions for olive oil, so instead finish with extra-virgin olive oil – and plenty of it. Again, great with roast chicken, or frittata.</p> <p>The third idea is inspired by the way Romans serve a variety of chicory (called puntarelle) with anchovy dressing, but using frizzy endive instead and adding croutons.<strong> </strong>Pull apart a head of endive, wash, dry and break the leaves into small pieces. For the dressing, mix six tablespoons of olive oil with a minced clove of garlic, three anchovy fillets and a tablespoon each of lemon juice and red-wine vinegar (taste and adjust). I use a mini blender to make the dressing, but a pestle and mortar is an even better way, because the pounding results in a great texture. Alternatively, mince the garlic and anchovies with a sharp knife and shake them with the other ingredients in a jam jar.

It’s produced by conservative news website the Daily Wire, which is diversifying into movies in a bid to take on Hollywood’s so-called liberal bias. </p> <p>Shut In is not for the squeamish; this is a Christian values movie with an unusually high quota of nasty bits. Rainey Qualley plays single mum of two Jessica, a recovering addict not long out of rehab. Jessica is moving out of the rural farmhouse she inherited from her grandmother, too broke to pay the taxes. The script is at pains here to paint pre-siege Jessica as shrill and unlikeable, constantly snapping at her adorable four-year-old Lainey (Luciana VanDette). Then Jessica’s junkie ex Rob (Jake Horowitz) shows up and for reasons not altogether plausible locks her in the larder with a 3g wrap of meth. Rob has brought along his drug buddy Sammy (Gallo) – and just in case you’ve missed Gallo’s intense, mean glower, we are quickly told that Sammy is a convicted paedophile. So for much of the movie Jessica is locked in a larder, desperate to escape and chipping away at the floor tiles to save her kids and find some redemption.

The report is expected to criticise the leadership of senior figures in Downing Street over social gatherings held in breach of Covid restrictions.</p> <p>Dr Ashley Weinberg, an occupational psychologist who carried out the study, said the 49.5% of MPs’ staff suffering from distress was “far higher” than in comparable jobs. It is twice the level experienced by the population at large, according to the study, and higher than the 40% of MPs deemed to be under similar strain during the 2009 expenses scandal.</p> <p>Weinberg measured aides’ anxiety using a screening tool called the General Health Questionnaire-12, which is widely used to measure psychological distress. Almost three-quarters of MPs’ aides said the job was “emotionally draining”, while one in five described it as “harrowing”. Nearly half said parliament could do more to support them in their roles.</p> <p>Parliamentary aides likened their roles to an “unofficial emergency service” as they field an “unrelenting tide” of often-desperate calls and emails from members of the public. They felt under-resourced and ill-equipped to deal with the growing workload.</p> <p>Weinberg found a “palpable” concern among staff over their safety, with almost one-fifth of workers saying they felt in danger for themselves or colleagues. One said: ‘The office is unsafe. It has no windows and we are frequently approached by aggressive members of the public when in the office.”</p> <p>About a dozen staff had experienced bullying or harassment, the report found, with one aide saying: “I enjoy working with colleagues as a result of solidarity from the bullying many in the team face from the MP.”</p> <p>Thomas Fairweather, an executive member of the working group, said staff feared the pressures would intensify as the cost-of-living crisis was felt more keenly by constituents.</p> <p>He said: “Staff are too used to the horrible, sickening feeling that coming down the line there will be another huge influx of people in desperate situations, needing help in ways that teams are not trained for. With more suitable training, resources and changes to fix the wellbeing problem, we could do so much more.”</p> <p>The report recommends the introduction of greater support for MPs’ staff, including mandatory training for coping with suicidal constituents. It also endorses the launch of a mediation service to address grievances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Staff who work for MPs are employed directly by the MPs, rather than by any one political party or the House of Commons.

They live in Colchester with their two dogs","body":"<p>As a teenager, Alan was the first to admit he didn’t know anything about girls. In 1974 he went to sixth form in his home town of Chingford. When he arrived at his history class, the teacher sat him next to twin girls. Although they’d been at the same school for years, it was very big and they hadn’t met before. “One of them was Janet,” he says. “She turned around and gave me a great big smile and I was smitten straight away.”</p> <p>Although Janet thought him “very interesting and knowledgeable”, she also found him irritating because “he butted in all the time”. They got to know each other better when they starred in a performance of The Mikado together. “I was playing Yum-Yum and Alan was playing Ko-Ko,” says Janet. “He was talented and he had a beautiful voice. He was also very friendly and kind to other people doing the show.”</p> <p>At the end of term, Janet suggested Alan come to see her new puppy. “I thought it was a signal but he didn’t get the hint,” she laughs. “She could have gone out with any boy in school,” says Alan. “It never occurred to me that she would like me.”</p> <p>Over the summer, Alan went to work in a local factory. One day he heard the doorbell, followed by his dad shouting to him from downstairs. He rushed down, bare-chested, to find Janet there. “She described it as a DH Lawrence moment, where Lady Chatterley sees the gamekeeper,” he says, laughing. “Bearing in mind it was 1974, it was very courageous of her to come round.”</p> <p>Janet asked if he’d like to go to a church youth-group event with her and he agreed. A few days later they walked her dog in Epping Forest. They soon became an official item.</p> <p>When they returned to school in September, nobody believed they were together. “My dad was a docker and my mum was a cook and cleaner. Her parents were very middle class, a teacher and a clergyman. People thought we’d last three weeks,” says Alan. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01e57de8fcf1141ff32bee0395c80a3484d74da1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e57de8fcf1141ff32bee0395c80a3484d74da1/0_170_1455_873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan and Janet in 1988\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘He asked every year until I said yes’ ...

In 1980, they moved to Kent and had three children: in 1982, 1984 and 1986. After their third child was born, Alan made the decision to become a Methodist minister. He went to college for theological training and was ordained in 1991. They moved around for many years because of his work, living in Ilford, Cornwall, West Bromwich and Pembrokeshire. </p> <p>Janet taught for many years before changing career to become a Methodist deacon in 2005. “In 2013, I set up a day centre for the homeless in Clacton-on-Sea that I run,” she says. They moved to Colchester the same year and now have six grandchildren and two dogs.</p> <p>In 2018, Alan was diagnosed with stage 4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma and took a year off work. “Janet was looking after me and still running the day centre,” he says. “I’m in remission but I will never be fully cured because I was in the advanced stages when it was discovered.” </p> <p>Alan loves his wife’s determination. “Janet knows what’s right and wrong and she’ll always do the right thing. She has a really strong sense of justice. She always tries to see the upside of things.”</p> <p>Janet, for her part, appreciates her partner’s honesty. “Sometimes it gets him into trouble but I admire it. He has a great sense of humour and he makes me laugh. In the evening, Alan likes to play guitar and he always sings my favourite song just before he comes up to bed so I know he’s coming,” she says. “I love that he’s always there to help people, whatever the situation.”</p> <p><em>Want to share your story?

After winning the world cinema grand jury prize at the Sundance film festival this year it is screening at Cannes, and in many ways it is easier to say what it is not than to define what it is. It is not a wildlife documentary, nor a table thumping call to action; it is not a family drama nor a political film – and yet it contains elements of all these, woven into a poetic and beautiful tapestry. The events depicted are less important than the overall feeling.</p> <p>Much of that is to do with the Indian capital’s role in the film: a scruffy, belligerent character, integral to the story. “Anyone who lives in Delhi knows that you are constantly surrounded by this grey sensorium,” says the film’s director, Shaunak Sen. “This fabric of greyness, this mood, this tone, where the sky and the clouds and the buildings just sort of mesh into each other has fascinated me for some time. The sun is this diffuse blot and the air that you’re breathing in, the whole ecological bubble you are in, feels hostile to your sense of sustenance.</p> <p>“And the feeling that the air-conditioning system of Spaceship Earth is going awry is very strong in the city. So the starting point wasn’t so much a story as a texture.”</p> <p>Sen has made his home town central to his work before: his 2015 first feature, Cities of Sleep, examined the nature of insomnia as told through the city’s informal shelters and the underclass that often need somewhere safe and warm to spend winter nights. This time he became inspired while being regularly stuck in Delhi’s perennial traffic, and looking up from his car. “I’d see these tiny, lazy black dots gliding around. These were black kites, and it’s one of those things where once you start thinking about them you can’t stop noticing them.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk0DTl_drtw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bk0DTl_drtw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The first experts Sen spoke to were brothers Nadeem Shehzad and Mohammad Saud: and the director knew he had his subjects. They narrate the film with spoken thoughts. They have loved birds since they were infants and have been treating black kites for nearly 20 years via the organisation they founded, Wildlife Rescue.</p> <p>While both are passionate about the birds, fitting in animal hospital duties amid their daily toil takes its toll. Saud seems happy to keep doing what he’s doing, but Nadeem yearns to see the world beyond their district of Wazirabad and wants to pursue studies in America.</p> <p>“One shouldn’t differentiate between all that breathes,” says Saud, in one of many ruminations, and the very idea of breathing is fundamental to every theme the film touches on. Delhi’s chronic air pollution problem wraps itself around so many aspects of their lives. Saud’s young son has a worrying cough, people were wearing face masks in the city way before Covid hit, and the family’s air purifier seems permanently stuck on red because the filters need changing.</p> <p>The brothers’ problems keep mounting: the meat grinder for the kites’ chum is on the fritz (as is their freezer), the city is becoming engulfed in sectarian protests over a divisive citizenship law, seen as targeting Muslims like them and they must still contend with all the other travails a working family has to on a daily basis. All the while the kites keep dropping from the sky. “Delhi is a gaping wound and we’re a tiny Band-Aid on it,” says Nadeem.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Let’s face it, [Cannes] is the place, in terms of status and recognition</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sen says it was both the stoic work ethic mixed with their insightful nature that made them ideal subjects for the project. “They were not typical documentary subjects as they were also interlocutors in terms of form and narrative, and they understood how we were trying to balance this noble act of bird rescue with the quotidian existence they lead. It was far more collaborative than traditional documentary dictums suggest.”</p> <p>If this all sounds like too much chin-scratching, pensive stuff, the film also has touching and amusing moments, sometimes veering into farcical. The bird treatment is mainly done in a hot, claustrophobic basement that instantly excited Sen. “As soon as I saw that garage, I knew it had to be central to the documentary,” he says. “This dingy, cinematic basement that makes soap dispensers, filled with all kinds of junk and metal-cutting machinery and industrial decay; then you have these magisterial birds being tenderly cared for by these guys. It’s fascinating.”</p> <p>And in the brothers’ young helper, Salik, they find a perfect counter-energy and an endearing scene stealer. Everyone knows someone like Salik – a little brother, a cousin, a nephew, a colleague, a pal – asking innocent and baffling questions about nuclear war and American wrestling at inopportune moments.</p> <p>At one point a bird swoops in and steals Salik’s glasses but all he does is smile. But then later he genuinely ponders, “why the glasses?” In one beautiful scene where he’s riding in the back of a tempo (a three-wheeled goods truck) he suddenly reveals he has a baby chipmunk in his shirt pocket, like an adorable <em>desi</em> Newt Scamander from the Ministry of Magic.</p> <p>Sen is overjoyed to be going to Cannes, saying: “Let’s face it, this is the place, in terms of status and recognition,” and adds that he is looking forward to the event as much as a cinephile as a director. “The film-maker in me is honoured, and the film buff in me is ecstatic!”</p> <p>Closeups of the imperious birds – often felled, ironically, by paper kites flown by kids, who glue broken glass on to the strings for aerial battles – is intercut with news and social media footage of Muslim areas being razed by Hindu zealots, including an extremist thug climbing up a mosque and tearing down the Islamic crescent atop one of its ornate minarets. It’s a tale of tragedy slowly befalling man and beast.</p> <p>Sen very much captures Delhi’s duality in this paean to his home town, its people and its creatures, in flight and plight.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/may/23/reform-cycle-to-work-scheme-rishi-sunak-urged","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T09:41:59Z","webTitle":"Reform cycle to work scheme so it can be used by lower-paid, Sunak urged","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/reform-cycle-to-work-scheme-rishi-sunak-urged","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/may/23/reform-cycle-to-work-scheme-rishi-sunak-urged","fields":{"headline":"Reform cycle to work scheme so it can be used by lower-paid, Sunak urged","trailText":"Business and cycling groups say bike-buying scheme is often out of reach to those who need it most","body":"<p>Business and cycling groups have urged the government to reform its <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/commuting/article/trav20100212-Cycle-to-Work-Schemes-Essential_Information#:~:text=In%201999%2C%20as%20part%20of,a%20deduction%20from%20their%20earnings.\">cycle to work scheme</a> so it can be used by lower-paid and self-employed workers, arguing they are often the people who need it the most.</p> <p>Introduced more than 20 years ago and since used by more than a million people, the scheme allows users to pay for a bicycle and accessories in instalments taken from their salary on a tax-free basis, thus saving them between 25% and 40%.</p> <p>But longstanding rules mean it is not available to people earning minimum wage, or close to it, or who do not pay tax on a pay-as-you-earn salaried basis.</p> <p>In a letter being sent on Monday to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, groups including the Federation of Small Businesses, the Co-op and British Cycling, have called for this to be changed, arguing that amid rising prices those on lower incomes are most in need of the chance to save money on travel.</p> <p>“The least well paid in our communities are feeling the effects of soaring inflation to a greater extent than those on higher wages, with the rising cost of commuting only adding to their concern,” the letter says.</p> <p>“They often have no option to do their job from home and are forced to commute to a place of work. The cycle to work scheme has the potential to open up equitable access to cycling and provide a cost-effective solution for many workers within this group. The scheme is a proven mechanism at getting more people cycling, and we believe those on the lowest incomes should benefit too.”</p> <p>People who are self-employed represented more than 13% of the UK labour market, the letter added, a proportion that was expected to grow, and were also unfairly excluded, it added.</p> <p>Data collected by the Cycle to Work Alliance, made up of the five biggest bike providers under the scheme, including Halfords and Evans Cycles, shows it has become more in demand because of changing travel patterns during the Covid crisis, especially for key workers.</p> <p>At the peak of the pandemic, from March to September 2020, alliance members recorded a 60% rise in people using the scheme against the same period in 2019, with even steeper increases for staff from the London ambulance service and Metropolitan police.</p> <p>Expanding the scope of the scheme would help deliver the government’s commitment to get more people cycling, the letter argued, and to prevent post-Covid travel patterns from becoming more car-dominated.</p> <p>Currently, the scheme does not allow people to sign up if the contributions from their salary for the bike would take them below the minimum wage, even if a switch to bike commuting might still mean a net saving.</p> <p>The alliance has pledged that if the change was made, retailers would ensure applicants had properly calculated the cost, and were told if their net salary would now be below the minimum wage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed—morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The change is backed by Labour.

After the knockbacks and political fights over who should pay for such an ambitious scheme, the actual physical work – above and below ground – would take only a relatively short 13 years.</p> <p>The feats of engineering required quickly grabbed public imagination – mainly positively. The first official building work was in May 2009, when piles were driven into the ground at Canary Wharf, and excavation started for one of the first huge box-stations. Less popular was the demolition of the Astoria music venue in the heart of the West End, as Tottenham Court Road was cleared for redevelopment.</p> <p>Even at that point, Crossrail’s future was not secure – but the following year’s election of a Conservative-led coalition preaching austerity led only to a cut to its budget, down to just over £15bn. Infrastructure spending was largely deemed the more acceptable kind by successive chancellors, and by 2012 the most significant part of the works began: the tunnelling of the central section under the capital.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/elizabeth-line-services-ready-to-roll-crossrail\">‘These stations are like cathedrals’: Elizabeth line services are ready to roll</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8286b82c3f9e6978faea1754c8cf55bc65e0722d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8286b82c3f9e6978faea1754c8cf55bc65e0722d/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Construction workers on the Crossrail construction site at Tottenham Court Road tube station 27 October 2009\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Construction workers on the Crossrail construction site at Tottenham Court Road tube station 27 October 2009</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Construction workers on the early Crossrail construction site at Tottenham Court Road tube station 27 October 2009.

Bond Street, it would later transpire, was about 18 months behind the plan. And yet only in summer 2018 did Crossrail bosses admit they had blown the budget and the schedule, just months before the official opening.</p> <p>As Christian Wolmar, author of Crossrail: The Whole Story, puts it, those involved – and observers like himself – had “drunk the Kool-Aid”, as senior management either played down or ignored the problems. “My epiphany was a visit to Paddington in June 2018 when I saw 500 people in orange suits still at work – the platform doors were nowhere to be seen, the escalators were in bits,” he says. “The idea that they could have done the testing in six to eight weeks is incredible.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c27d130bd04b07abdc0c409bd7a414efe926f9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c27d130bd04b07abdc0c409bd7a414efe926f9d/0_0_5398_3599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A look inside a finished train, February 2022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A look inside a finished train, February 2022</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A look inside a finished train, February 2022.

The £15bn railway would eventually become a £19bn railway, in painful increments as fresh delays and overspends were announced. Hopes for an opening in 2019 gave way to a possible start in 2021. Bosses were replaced and TfL took sole charge of the project.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7fcd138253b1a688cdc55678a8057fcfb741eb4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fcd138253b1a688cdc55678a8057fcfb741eb4c/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Work in Whitechapel east London, November 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Work in Whitechapel east London, November 2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Work in Whitechapel, east London, November 2019.

He wasn’t wrong. Liverpool had their feathers ruffled and more, going behind in the 27th minute as Ethan Pinnock finished a smart move involving Ivan Toney. The futuristic little Community Stadium almost rattled out of its foundations and didn’t stop shaking. A few moments later Diogo Jota headed home to make it 1-1. When Mohamed Salah gave Liverpool the lead with his 100th goal for the club the expectation was that Klopp’s side would gain control. Brentford had other ideas, throwing caution to the wind and bombarding Liverpool’s penalty area until, finally, Vitaly Janelt equalised. It felt like a cup tie. A deflected Curtis Jones strike sent the away fans into raptures in the 67th minute and, when Salah went clean through 10 minutes later, a 4-2 victory looked inevitable only for the Egyptian to loft over wastefully. On came Yoane Wissa to seal a famous draw with a feather-toed finish over Alisson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7aa2de8fc3b14a7c291c26cee39beb1d43ba59c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7aa2de8fc3b14a7c291c26cee39beb1d43ba59c/0_0_3998_2665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brentford’s Yoane Wissa scores to make it 3-3 against Liverpool in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brentford’s Yoane Wissa scores to make it 3-3 against Liverpool in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/03/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool 2-2 Manchester City (3 October 2021)</a></h2> <p>When the final whistle sounded on a thrilling match at Anfield it was clear the two rivals were streets ahead in the Premier League. Pep Guardiola’s side showcased their suffocating control in a gripping first half in which Liverpool had Alisson to thank for not coming in a goal down. Whatever Jürgen Klopp gave his team at half-time, it worked. They flew out of the traps, with Salah cutting through midfield to lay on Sadio Mané for the Reds’ first. City responded like champions with the brilliant Phil Foden finding space where there appeared to be none and smashing into the far corner with unerring accuracy. Cue <em>that</em> solo goal from Salah, in which he picked up the ball in a position that appeared to pose no threat before bamboozling Bernardo Silva and Aymeric Laporte with dazzling footwork and firing across Ederson with his weaker foot to make it 2-1. Incredible. Still, City kept coming and when Kevin De Bruyne made it 2-2 with a deflected strike the away end erupted and the goal felt justified for City’s first-half display alone. This was drama of the highest quality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/04/west-ham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham 3-2 Chelsea (4 December 2021)</a></h2> <p>The Hammers twice came from behind in a riveting encounter that made clear David Moyes’s side were not going to be easily pushed out of the European places. For Thomas Tuchel this was evidence that Chelsea would struggle to keep pace with Liverpool and Manchester City. Having led through a Thiago Silva header, they struggled to control the game, with Michail Antonio’s running power dragging Chelsea’s defence out of shape and exposing Édouard Mendy, who had an afternoon to forget. Mendy first gave away a penalty as he struggled to control the ball – and his feet – and he later palmed a deflected Arthur Masuaku cross into his own net to gift West Ham a deserved win. Between these moments, Mason Mount scored a sublime side-foot volley to make it 2-1 and Jarrod Bowen equalised with a now customary crisp strike with barely there backlift.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aeed7889db65902ae010138c8095e6e5409dc848\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeed7889db65902ae010138c8095e6e5409dc848/0_91_4565_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jarrod Bowen celebrates scoring West Ham’s second goal against Chelsea in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jarrod Bowen celebrates scoring West Ham’s second goal against Chelsea in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/26/manchester-city-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City 6-3 Leicester (26 December 2021)</a></h2> <p>This was a ridiculous match in which City raced into a 4-0 lead inside 25 minutes. Perhaps the home side had been so good that they fell asleep in the second 45 because three goals inside 10 James Maddison-inspired second-half minutes meant the score read 4-3 after 65 minutes. But like firefighters responding to an alarm call, Guardiola’s side leapt out of bed and adopted rescue mode, quickly restoring order and making fans at the Etihad Stadium wonder whether it had all been a fever dream. This was a throwback Boxing Day encounter – one that wouldn’t have been out of place had it taken place on <em>that</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/dec/22/theknowledge.sport\">bizarre day of festive football in 1963</a>.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/everton-crystal-pakace-premier-league-match-report\">Everton 3-2 Crystal Palace (19 May 2022)</a></h2> <p>The scenes at the end. My word! Goodison hadn’t witnessed a pitch invasion – and match – like this since the Great Escape against Wimbledon in 1994 when, similarly, they were 2-0 down in the first half and required a three-goal comeback to secure their top-flight status. Michael Keane sparked the comeback by driving home on 54 minutes, provoking a guttural Goodison roar. Then Richarlison, a talismanic figure in the survival fight, fired a deflected shot past Jack Butland to level. A plume of blue smoke erupted as genuine hope drifted up from the stands. When Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored the winner with a delicious diving header in the 85th minute Everton fans were delirious. They streamed on to the pitch in their thousands when the final whistle went. Goodison, the Grand Old Lady who has seen so much drama, shook with relief and delight. Best of all, the match wasn’t televised so those who were there will feel they have a genuine folktale to tell.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/23/peter-dutton-to-lead-liberals-as-nationals-consider-replacing-barnaby-joyce-over-net-zero-stance","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T09:28:18Z","webTitle":"Nationals could dump Barnaby Joyce over net zero stance with Peter Dutton set to lead Liberals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/peter-dutton-to-lead-liberals-as-nationals-consider-replacing-barnaby-joyce-over-net-zero-stance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/peter-dutton-to-lead-liberals-as-nationals-consider-replacing-barnaby-joyce-over-net-zero-stance","fields":{"headline":"Nationals could dump Barnaby Joyce over net zero stance with Peter Dutton set to lead Liberals","trailText":"Sussan Ley or Jane Hume likely to be deputy Liberal leader as Coalition continues to grapple with election fallout","body":"<p>The National party will spill its leadership positions next Monday as the Liberals debate whether Peter Dutton’s deputy should be Jane Hume or Sussan Ley.</p> <p>As the Coalition continues to grapple with the fallout from Saturday’s election rout amid conflicting views about how to reposition in response, Anthony Albanese was sworn in as Australia’s 31st prime minister before leaving for Tokyo and his first meeting with Joe Biden and key regional allies.</p> <p>Before departing for Japan, the new Labor prime minister sought confidence and supply assurances from crossbenchers and confirmed he would shortly appoint a new departmental head, rather than work with the former Liberal party adviser and Scott Morrison appointee, Phil Gaetjens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/mark-mcgowan-accuses-travelling-press-pack-of-bullying-anthony-albanese-and-reporting-lies\">Mark McGowan accuses travelling press pack of ‘bullying’ Anthony Albanese and reporting ‘lies’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back in Canberra, the Nationals were jostling ahead of a leadership spill.

The show is kaleidoscopic in focus, lurching feverishly from one scene to the next. This feels like the dramaturgy of motherhood – a series of interrupted moments, seen through the distorting lens of sleep deprivation. The company’s characteristic movement and music have also been reborn. Helen and Abbi’s bodies move through the playful choreography of infancy: crawling, reaching, exploring. Becky Wilkie’s compositions are laced with nursery rhyme themes, while Seales’ versatile cello soundtrack swerves from soaring heights to thrumming anxiety.</p> <p>But it’s not just a show for mothers, or those who think they may want to be mothers. RashDash look at caring in its many forms, whether for those who have just entered life or for those approaching its end. And in short, often funny vignettes, the company touches on multiple attitudes towards motherhood, from the ambivalent to the contentedly child-free. All this is framed by the societal pressures of gendered roles and expectations, which prove hard to shake off even for parents who are committed to equality.</p> <p>Oh Mother runs the risk of collapsing under the weight of everything it’s attempting to explore – a criticism that the show itself wittily anticipates.

I left with the possibility that I had found a missing piece of the jigsaw. Something that might just make my depression and anxiety bearable. Shame it had taken me 65 years to get there.</p> <p>Even now, several days later, I am struggling to understand quite what happened to me. All I can do is offer up my best impressions based on what I remember, as well as on what I don’t, as thankfully I left my audio recorder running throughout the session. Together they may approximate to what for me was a remarkable truth.</p> <p>I’d spent the first 20 minutes of my session talking to <a href=\"https://www.breathguru.com/breathwork/alan-dolan/\" title=\"\">Alan Dolan</a>, aka the Breathguru, about his practice. What he did and how he’d come to be doing it for the past 20 years. Then he’d asked me if I was ready to begin. All I needed to do was to follow his instructions and to keep breathing into my abdomen and exhaling gently, as if fogging a mirror. The connected circular breath.</p> <p>First I lay down on the grey sofa of the unremarkable King’s Cross flat Dolan uses when he is in London – his normal base is in Lanzarote, where he runs retreats. Dolan arranged a cushion under my head to make sure I was comfortable and gave me a pre-session briefing. He would be touching various pressure points from time to time; if any area felt particularly sensitive, I wasn’t to worry. It was just some old feelings that had been stored in the body being processed. My bullshit radar, which was already quite high, ratcheted up another level or two. Me and the New Age have seldom been on nodding terms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eec7af295fc09c81698c16e0f04e08a0b60b09a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eec7af295fc09c81698c16e0f04e08a0b60b09a9/0_511_4918_6862/717.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Dolan, left, leads John Crace in a breathing workshop.\" width=\"717\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Breathguru … Alan Dolan, left, leads John Crace in a breathing workshop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Just close your eyes and do nothing,” Dolan said. That was more like it. I could manage that. “Now just notice how things are feeling. Notice the sofa.” He then threw in a question that took me off guard. If miracles were possible, “What would I like to bring more of to me in my session?” I wasn’t to answer, but to think about it.</p> <p>I did so for a moment before realising it was a no-brainer. I’d come to see Dolan because I was both curious and desperate. For the last year, I’ve been haunted by nightmares and every morning I wake up in a state of acute anxiety. I feel like I’ve failed before the day has even started and sometimes it can take several hours before I feel mentally strong enough to get out of bed. It’s no way to live. If miracles were possible, I just wanted my anxiety to stop. If only for a little while.</p> <p>We returned to the mechanics of keeping my mouth open throughout the inhale and the exhale. This is different to other breathwork techniques, such as the method championed by James Nestor in his best-selling book Breath. It was surprisingly difficult to remember, especially when breathing out. I eventually got into a good enough pattern and at this point Dolan said he was going to make a short invocation. Neither I nor my audio recorder picked up exactly what he said. All I caught were the words “sacred space ... guidance ... support” and “I dedicate this session to all sentient beings”.</p> <p>Again, I could feel myself resisting. Couldn’t we just be getting on with this without the hippy stuff? As if he could read my mind, Dolan said that it was fine to be thinking negative thoughts. They were bound to come up. The trick was to acknowledge them without dwelling on them too much. To let them pass through my mind. I gave myself a talking to. Dolan wasn’t doing this for his benefit. He almost certainly had far better things to be doing on a bank holiday afternoon than see me. So the least I could do was keep my negativity in check.</p> <p>“That’s very good,” Dolan said, as he rechecked my breathing and started applying pressure to various areas of my body. When he touched the top of my left thigh and the groin, I winced. He encouraged me to listen to the sounds of the room and to be aware of my surroundings. And here’s where it starts to get seriously weird. Because when I play back the recording, all I can really hear is the noise of the traffic and the police sirens outside on the Pentonville Road. But at the time, everything felt perfectly silent and still. There was just me, my breath and Dolan instructing me it was safe for my body to tell its truths.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My head felt too heavy to lift while my body had become part of the sofa</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What I now know from the recording was only a few minutes later but on the day felt like an age. I became conscious that there was yogic music with a woman chanting playing in the background. Weirdly, I had no recollection of it having started. Somehow it felt as if it had always been playing. What was even stranger was that I found it almost comforting. Normally that sort of thing sets my teeth on edge. But now I was in a state of deep relaxation. My head felt too heavy to lift while my body had become part of the sofa.</p> <p>“Start breathing through the nose again,” Dolan instructed, as he gradually brought me round from the blissed-out trance in which I could happily have remained for the rest of the day. It was several more minutes before my body didn’t feel like a dead weight and I could raise myself into the sitting position. “You did well,” Dolan said. “You were very open. Very intuitive. You can read other people well. What you really need to learn is how to protect yourself.” “Mostly from myself,” I thought. Even so, I felt absurdly proud. As well as totally seen.</p> <p>Dolan had one last surprise. He asked me to imagine my feet were connecting with the ground some five storeys below. That I was putting down roots and was in touch with the Earth’s gravitational pull. I swear that as I went through this visualisation I could feel my feet getting hot. Almost unbearably so. So hot, I had to lift them off the ground to cool off. My spiritual hocum meter was going to have to be recalibrated.“How was that?” Dolan asked.</p> <p>“Wow,” I replied, fumbling for speech. “I feel deeply relaxed.” Though that scarcely began to describe how I felt.</p> <p>“Perfect,” he replied. “Then my work is done.”</p> <p>Mine might just be starting. Dolan had asked me what miracle I wanted and he hadn’t just delivered respite from my anxiety. He had taken me to an altered state of consciousness. One that could be attained through just a few minutes of connected breathing.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I was first diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/depression\" title=\"\">depression</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/anxiety\" title=\"\">anxiety</a> in the mid-1990s, though in hindsight it had dogged me through much of my adult life – not least in my 20s when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/27/i-was-a-heroin-addict-and-had-given-up-on-myself-then-suddenly-briefly-i-felt-a-desire-to-live\" title=\"\">I medicated with heroin</a>. An act of profound self-harm, punctuated with numerous overdoses. After I cleaned up with the help of Narcotics Anonymous, my mental health improved considerably for about 10 years; but around the time I turned 40 things began to seriously unravel. I started getting severe regular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/panic-attacks\" title=\"\">panic attacks</a> and I became totally dissociated. The outside world didn’t feel real and my conversation had become monosyllabic. I felt as if I was falling apart.</p> <p>I was referred to a superb psychiatrist who had me admitted to hospital where I remained for more than a month as we waited for the antidepressants to take effect. Eventually I was allowed out, and some months later I returned to work. Ever since my mental health has at times been a struggle, despite having been in therapy for more than 30 years. I started before my first breakdown, along with exercising regularly and adjusting my medication as required under the guidance of my shrink.</p> <p>But nothing I’ve tried has ever been foolproof, and there have been long periods when life has been a white-knuckle ride. Trying to remain at work, keeping the show on the road when inside I’m falling apart. It is not always possible though. Last year, during the second lockdown, the panic attacks and sense of despair became so intense that I could no longer cope and I was again admitted into a psychiatric institution. There I gradually improved enough to be allowed home but not so much as to feel any sense of normality again.</p> <p>You could say I was ready for someone like Dolan. But I’ve tried all sorts of other coping mechanisms – alongside the meds, the group therapy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/29/get-fit-without-busting-gut\" title=\"\">exercise</a>, and nothing has really worked. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/yoga\" title=\"\">Yoga</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/meditation\" title=\"\">meditation</a> should have been a shoo-in but I could never make the time or fight off my own inner sense of ridiculousness at the thought of doing them. So I can’t avoid the irony that something that most people would agree was far further out on the alternative therapies scale has been the one that has proved effective. Or that I came across it by chance and that it worked despite my psyche’s best attempts to sabotage it.</p> <p>Work it undoubtedly did, though. As it has for many of Dolan’s other clients, from Russell Brand and some anonymous Hollywood A-listers to ordinary people like you and me. Since my one-to-one with Dolan, I have been using <a href=\"http://app.breathguru.com/\" title=\"\">the Breathguru app</a> to guide me through breathwork at home. It hasn’t been as powerful as my original session, but Dolan assures me that this is quite normal. It is just a matter of finding 10 spare minutes every day and putting it to practice.</p> <p>All that is needed is you, your breath and a pillow for your head to access a moment of profound calm.

So Salah spun his man then, while absorbing a shove from Phil Foden, rolled studs over the ball to take him outside the next. Bernardo Silva was later found in lost property. Even then only a cross looked on, so Salah swayed inside, enticing Aymeric Laporte to follow, before dipping outside to snap an expert’s finish into his favourite far-post side-netting. It was a goal that only he could score, the skill, speed and composure an act of audacious impossibility, like painting a fresco on a rollercoaster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LFC/status/1512836486818787333\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Simply special from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MoSalah?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MoSalah</a> against Manchester City ✨ <a href=\"https://t.co/GLq4F0Bohz\">pic.twitter.com/GLq4F0Bohz</a></p>&mdash; Liverpool FC (@LFC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LFC/status/1512836486818787333?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://youtu.be/8Y4IXH-thHU?t=94\">Mateo Kovacic (Chelsea v Liverpool)</a></h2> <p>It seems a long time since Kovacic was either the bloke who came on for Jorginho or the bloke for whom Jorginho came on because, revitalised by Thomas Tuchel, he is now Chelsea’s most reliable midfielder. He remains an infrequent scorer, but bagged a beauty when Liverpool visited the Bridge and quickly went two goals up. There seemed little danger when Caoimhín Kelleher punched away Marcos Alonso’s free-kick, but just outside the box, Kovacic back-pedalled, then indulged in a little feet-adjusting skip before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCenGKkj3YQ&amp;ab_channel=Movieclips\">channelling his inner Daniel LaRusso</a> to send a joyous crane-kick arcing into the net off the post, earning the rich, rare reward of a Gary Neville goalgasm. Moments later, Chelsea were level, and one of the season’s best games ended all square.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://youtu.be/gyo-fh-mVWg?t=73\">Andriy Yarmolenko (West Ham v Aston Villa)</a></h2> <p>When Russia invaded Ukraine, Yarmolenko felt extreme stress. “I had to rest,” he said. “I was just thinking about my family and my people.” Three weeks later and with West Ham needing a goal, David Moyes reintroduced him and, as he loitered about the penalty spot, Saïd Benrahma booted an aimless cross straight at him. So Yarmolenko stunned it brilliantly with his right foot, delivering it to where he knew his left would be once he’d spun his man. Then, in the same, fluid movement, he kipped into a sensational finish, poking a half-volley with the outside of his left and into the far corner. Overcome with emotion, Yarmolenko spent the next few minutes rubbing tears from his eyes. He wasn’t the only one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1503365935750651910\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ukraine soccer star Andriy Yarmolenko teared up after scoring for West Ham.<br><br>Once his team&#39;s won Aston Villa, the forward told media that it was &quot;impossible&quot; to train amid Russia&#39;s war. &quot;I was just thinking about my family and my people,&quot; he said.<br><br>Video: West Ham United/Twitter <a href=\"https://t.co/Lb3GwPrerA\">pic.twitter.com/Lb3GwPrerA</a></p>&mdash; The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1503365935750651910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 14, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://youtu.be/hF7RSffysjI?t=95\">Christian Eriksen (Chelsea v Brentford)</a></h2> <p>This hasn’t been a vintage season for goals. That means we can pack lists like this with the ones that made us cry. Eriksen’s cardiac arrest was a moment of collective trauma that left an entire continent fearing the worst. But by February he was back, and when Brentford visited Stamford Bridge in April, the teams were tied 1-1 with 54 minutes gone. Kristoffer Ajer headed clear, Bryan Mbuemo turned Hakim Ziyech and, with Eriksen cleverly angling his run into the middle, forcing N’Golo Kanté, the last man, to go towards the ball, Brentford were in. Immediately, the square pass arrived, and though Eriksen would have been forgiven for snatching at the chance, he stayed calm to lift it over Édouard Mendy’s dive and into the roof of the net for the most cathartic of goals. After that his team scored twice more, recording a famous win.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qvai6AQc9ec?t=29\">Marc Cucurella (Brighton v Manchester United)</a></h2> <p>Given how freely their defence concedes them, goals against United shouldn’t count for the purposes of this list. But Cucurella’s finish was another feel-good moment Since joining Brighton, the Spaniard’s wholehearted style and hairdo have won him many admirers, but in 35 appearances he hadn’t scored. That was until Alexis Mac Allister controlled a throw superbly, bending in a low cross that Leandro Trossard retrieved and cut back for his desperately beseeching teammate, who then roofed a glorious finish before breaking down in tears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OfficialBHAFC/status/1523230726988173313\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;He SMASHED it home!&quot; 🎙️💥 What a moment for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cucurella3?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Cucurella3</a>. 🥺 <a href=\"https://t.co/ghSSJ7nmmP\">pic.twitter.com/ghSSJ7nmmP</a></p>&mdash; Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OfficialBHAFC/status/1523230726988173313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 8, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>“Me and my family we have had our bad moments,” he explained. “To come here is difficult, a new country a new league and a new language.

Workers are organizing independently, citing the similar framework of the Amazon Labor Union, which is not affiliated with traditional, established labor unions.</p> <p>“We organized ourselves. With the same instinctive teamwork we use every day to break pallets, work the load, bag groceries, and care for our customers, we joined together to look out for each other and improve our workplace together,” workers wrote in an announcement <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TraderJoesUnite/status/1525546070088065028\">letter </a>to Trader Joe’s CEO, Dan Bane.</p> <p>The union organizing announcement is the latest among a wave of union campaigns at corporations that have previously staved off unionization, including at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/starbucks-union-organizing-drives-across-us\">Starbucks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/09/amazon-union-organization-staten-island\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/business/rei-union-new-york.html\">REI</a>, and union elections filed at Target and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/4/23056187/apple-second-store-union-election-petition-retail#:~:text=Employees%20at%20Apple's%20Towson%20Town%20Center%20store%20in%20Maryland%20have,the%20second%20to%20do%20so.\">Apple</a>.</p> <p>Trader Joe’s was one of several employers that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/labor-unions-trader-joes-workers-coronavirus-us\">pushed back</a> on organizing efforts and complaints from workers about its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/business/trader-joes-unionization-coronavirus.html\">calls</a> for hazard pay.</p> <p>Early in the pandemic, Bane sent a company-wide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/labor-unions-trader-joes-workers-coronavirus-us\">memo</a> to all employees <a href=\"https://twitter.com/msainat1/status/1246518465722224641\">expressing </a>opposition for unionization within the company. In their announcement, workers cited the company-wide letter, arguing that the company has slashed wages and benefits for workers since then, and they see unionizing as the only way to protect themselves from further cuts.</p> <p>“We’re organizing because it feels more and more like we don’t have a say in decisions that the company makes, decisions that directly impact our day-to-day lives, and the health and wellbeing of us and our families,” said Tony Falco, a worker at the Trader Joe’s store in Hadley, Massachusetts.</p> <p>Jamie Edwards, a crew member at the Trader Joe’s in Hadley, explained they became interested in organizing a union in the beginning of the pandemic, when workers were not allowed to wear protective equipment initially because of concerns from management that it would scare customers, and other safety concerns expressed by workers were dismissed. Edwards said when CDC guidelines changed, mask policies and caps on the number of customers permitted in the store were not enforced.</p> <p>Edwards, who is non-binary, also noted they had to show legal paperwork to change their nametags from their dead name.</p> <p>“I want customers to know this is an effort to give the crew members a say in the way the store is run and to make this company live up to the image that attracts them to the store in the first place,” said Edwards.</p> <p>Maeg Yosef, an employee at the Trader Joe’s Hadley location for 18 years, said when she first started then, she didn’t think workers at the store needed a union, but that has changed overtime as benefits have been chipped away, pay has stagnated, and safety issues have gone unaddressed.</p> <p>“I’ve watched so many crew deal with work related injuries and chronic pain, and have been hurt myself. I’ve seen crew members lose their health insurance during cancer treatment,” said Yosef. “Over time it became clear to me that the company was not taking care of us in the same way it once had, and it was time to do something about it. That something is a union.”</p> <p>She argued that Trader Joe’s reputation as an amazing place to work no longer reflects reality. Yosef noted that Trader Joe’s corporate has yet to respond to the union organizing announcement, but their store manager has promised not to delay the election process in any way.</p> <p>Trader Joe’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/23/people-are-under-pressure-the-shop-staff-paying-for-strangers-groceries-or-turning-a-blind-eye-to-theft","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T09:00:57Z","webTitle":"‘People are under pressure’: the shop staff paying for strangers’ groceries or turning a blind eye to theft","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/23/people-are-under-pressure-the-shop-staff-paying-for-strangers-groceries-or-turning-a-blind-eye-to-theft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/23/people-are-under-pressure-the-shop-staff-paying-for-strangers-groceries-or-turning-a-blind-eye-to-theft","fields":{"headline":"‘People are under pressure’: the shop staff paying for strangers’ groceries or turning a blind eye to theft","trailText":"As prices rocket, supermarket workers tell of customers unable to pay at the tills, fighting over discounts and ‘forgetting’ to scan everything from fabric softener to baby food","body":"<p>Last week, during his shift overseeing the self-scan section of a large supermarket in London, James let a woman walk out with three multipacks of children’s yoghurts. He had randomly checked her shopping and found that among the items she hadn’t scanned and paid for were the yoghurts, as well as some pouches of baby food. He felt horrible, he says, to have quickly run through his own judgments of how “worthy” he considered her to be – that she was young and had three children under five with her, that she was holding Healthy Start vouchers, which allow people on universal credit and other benefits to buy nutritious food, that the rest of her shopping was healthy with no junk food or alcohol, and that she was really embarrassed and upset. “I couldn’t bring myself to take these four or five items off her so I let it go,” he says. “It wasn’t a huge loss to the company. It wasn’t like they were luxury items. I just said: ‘Don’t worry, but next time someone else might not let it slide.’” He knows he could have been sacked for it. “I’d just have to feign ignorance or stupidity if I got caught.”</p> <p>At another supermarket, in a town across the country, Alexander watched as a young couple found they couldn’t pay for their shopping at a checkout close to his. They had spent more than £100, paid for some of it in cash, and tried to put the rest on a credit card – not unusual, he says, but the card was declined. “For the next half an hour, they took over the checkout, which we had to close, and somebody had to stand with them while they were making phone calls, presumably to locate some money or fix a problem with the card,” he says. The woman, who was pregnant, was getting more and more distressed and broke down in tears. “It was sad to see. If a credit card doesn’t work, most people have another card, but clearly they had no means of paying.” Eventually they left without half of their shopping.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/uk-inflation-soars-to-highest-level-in-more-than-40-years\">Inflation has hit a 40-year high of 9%</a>, partly driven by food prices rising at the highest rate since 2011. Then there’s the increasing cost of other essentials – housing, energy, petrol, phone and broadband bills. People – and disproportionately those in the poorest households – are being squeezed, and those who work in supermarkets are seeing it every day. Last week, Andy Cooke, the new chief inspector of constabulary, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/officers-should-use-discretion-over-stealing-to-eat-says-uk-police-watchdog\">police officers should use their “discretion</a> – and they need to use discretion more often” when dealing with crimes of poverty, particularly stealing to eat. Then the policing minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/dont-let-people-off-if-they-steal-food-in-desperation-minister-tells-police-kit-malthouse\">Kit Malthouse said</a> police officers should “not be ignoring these seemingly small crimes”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e22385df600e74995c034656d14a4e1aa0ceb64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e22385df600e74995c034656d14a4e1aa0ceb64/0_111_5262_3157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cashier scans food at the checkout.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The poorest households are being squeezed, and those who work in supermarkets are seeing it every day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PhotoAlto/James Hardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it isn’t just stealing. Supermarket workers tell of watching people put products back that they can’t afford, or make difficult choices about what to buy. There are many more, not obviously struggling people making small changes: cheaper sausages over the premium range, own-brand deodorant over the heavily marketed brand name. “People are putting back things such as strawberries, and they’re buying bananas,” says one man who works at a large Tesco. “Cherries are £15 a kilo and they’re not really getting sold. Before, you’d see people come in for bread and milk and get a few little bits. Now it’s bread and milk and they’re done. There’s a lot less ‘luxuries’ being bought.”</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, John Allan, the chair of Tesco, said the supermarket was seeing “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/tesco-chairman-energy-windfall-tax-john-allan\">real food poverty for the first time in a generation</a>” and reported that customers were asking checkout staff to stop scanning their shopping when it reached £40 because they didn’t want, or couldn’t afford, to spend more. Lila, who works for a supermarket on the south coast, also says more people are asking her to stop putting items through when the total reaches £40 or £50. “Then they’ll take the alcohol or confectionery out and swap it for bread,” she says. It’s not as if they put their priority items first, she says, more that “people don’t realise how much prices have gone up until they get to the till and then they’re like: ‘Oh, wow.’ It’s definitely changed the way people are shopping – they’re thinking: ‘Do I need this?’” One of Lila’s customers immediately put the total into a spreadsheet on her phone. “She said: ‘I have to do this now or I’ll forget, and it’s really important.’”</p> <p>Even at the higher-end supermarkets, the higher prices have been noted, even if their customers are not particularly affected by them. “Sometimes, when I give them the bill at the end, I feel slightly guilty,” says Kay, who works on the checkout at Waitrose. “I just say, ‘Oh God, it’s really bad, isn’t it?’ And they go ‘yeah’, but most of them can afford it. They could shop somewhere else if they couldn’t afford it.” She has noticed an impact on the older people who use the supermarket for convenience. “We get to know the regulars and you do notice that they’re not putting so much in a basket.” And the staff now shop there less, she says, “including me. We get quite a good discount, but I’ve started shopping at Lidl and Aldi, whereas I would have [shopped at Waitrose] before. I have noticed the prices of things I would normally buy, which are another 30p or 50p higher.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef893ddcf7dd6ce6f39c7ab3afb217c7f979367a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef893ddcf7dd6ce6f39c7ab3afb217c7f979367a/0_150_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘People are putting back things such as strawberries, and they’re buying bananas.

There’s a lot less luxuries being bought.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grace Cary/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thefts have increased, she says, and the supermarket has started to employ a security guard, but she adds it’s not so much struggling customers slipping something extra into their bag without paying for it, as experienced shoplifters taking products such as meat, alcohol and razor blades to sell on. The picture is different elsewhere. One supermarket worker I speak to says that that morning, an elderly woman had claimed she had already paid for a bag of oranges which she had half-hidden in her trolley, but couldn’t produce a receipt. “There was a bit of concern as to whether the lady had dementia, and so might have forgotten,” he says, but after talking to her – and checking with their colleague on the checkout where she claimed to have paid – the staff believed it was more likely she had intended to take it without paying.</p> <p>Nick works nights at a big supermarket, stacking shelves and restocking freezers. He has always found empty packets, their contents taken, hidden at the backs of shelves or under bags of frozen peas, “but lately it seems to have increased. Since the turn of the year, I’m finding more and more.” Before, it might have been an opportunistic thief taking something such as jewellery or accessories from the supermarket’s clothing department and dumping the tag somewhere in store, but he says, “that seems to have stopped. Now, it’s everyday products.” In the past few weeks, he has found empty packets of denture adhesive and pain relief medicine such as Voltarol, “which suggests it’s pensioners who are doing it”. Paracetamol has been taken “even though it’s only about 20p”. Baby clothes are another thing commonly stolen, he says. “Last weekend, I found tags from baby socks.”</p> <p>Supermarket workers tell of people getting to know the time when items get reduced and using physical force to get to them. “My colleague normally does them, and there might be 10 or 12 customers around her,” says Alexander. “She has had to shout at them to stand back because she has found it oppressive, and it seems to be getting worse.”</p> <p>At the large supermarket where he works in London, James has seen the same. In the past couple of months he has seen the number of people queueing double, and waiting at 3pm on a Sunday by the big doors to the warehouse for the trays of reduced items to come out, particularly meat. “There will be people waiting for whichever poor soul has got to put them out and he doesn’t even get to the fridge,” he says. “Before he gets there, people are ripping the trays off him. There’s less shame in it – not that there should be any shame in it, but people are caring less about how it looks.” There are the regulars who have long waited for the yellow-stickered items, but now there are more people “elbowing in on their patch. It gets a bit territorial.” He remembers people pushing to get to the reduced trays of strawberries, and the manager having to call the security guard to keep people back.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Packets of precooked meat, in a world where some families can’t afford to put the oven on, are another regular item that customers ‘forget’ to scan</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There has been a change in atmosphere, James says. Customers are ruder and more aggressive. He doesn’t know if it’s a hangover from the stressful days of lockdown shopping, when people were fearful and navigating new rules, or if the cost of living is taking its toll – probably both, he says. “They’re a lot more short with you, more dismissive of you as a person.” He thinks supermarket workers, even though most are on little more than the national minimum wage themselves, are experiencing people’s anger at the rising prices. “You’re in a uniform, they don’t see you as a person, they see you as an extension of this company you work for, so people shout at you.” Customers annoyed that a product is no longer on special offer will shout at him, he says. “Fuses of people are short. People are under pressure.”</p> <p>Many customers that he recognises have been coming in later, which he has put down to them working longer hours. The other thing he has noticed – perhaps because parents are at work for longer – is an increase in children, about 11 or 12 years old, doing small basket shops. “They always pay in cash, and quite a few times they run short. They’re about 50p short and they’re like: ‘Can you take this off?’” he says, of children asking to put things back that they have already scanned. He carries a cash float, usually coppers and small change other customers have left, and – after checking with his boss – often pays for their items.</p> <p>Theft, James says, “is massively up” since the beginning of the year, probably by about half. Some of this is down to experienced shoplifters, he says, “the people who try to leave with a vacuum cleaner or a TV, or walk out with a trolley full of fish; the ones in the nice cars and nice clothes. They’re not the ones in need.” But it’s rare the police come out, he says – the shoplifter will be banned from the store, but he will see them back again in a few weeks. “The police won’t really come out for anything other than violence. Usually nothing happens [to shoplifters] and for certain people, that’s a risk worth taking.”</p> <p>What James has seen, though, is a rise in “genuine people struggling who are not ‘shoplifting’, but conveniently not paying for all of their shopping,” he says. He can spot them – they look guilty when they’re paying – and they’re mortified when they’re caught. At each shift he works, he says there are at least two or three incidences of this. “People ‘forget’ to scan expensive items, such as boxes of washing powder, things that don’t need an approval [unlike alcohol].” Packets of precooked meat, in a world where some families can’t afford to put the oven on, are another regular item that gets “missed”. The typical customer, he says, tends to be a fairly young mother who “hasn’t scanned a big bottle of Comfort, yet she’s only got 10 items, so it’s a bit of a ‘happy accident’. When you point out it hasn’t been scanned and you scan it, they’re like: ‘Oh, I didn’t realise it was that price – I’m not going to take that now.’ Then I feel bad because this lady’s gone without fabric softener because she can’t afford it – but then she did try to shoplift.</p> <p>“It’s difficult, and I try not to judge anyone because it’s hard for people. You can tell which people are brazenly trying it on, and which people are struggling. Whichever way, it doesn’t really matter because you still have to do what you’ve got to do.” Except for the occasional time when he doesn’t.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Names have been changed</em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/may/23/millions-of-dollars-are-flowing-into-us-cricket-but-is-there-a-market-for-the-sport","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T09:00:57Z","webTitle":"Millions of dollars are flowing into US cricket.

But can cricket really establish a foothold where others have failed?","body":"<p>Whenever the subject of cricket in the United States comes up, the same old questions are asked.</p> <p>From the unlikely scenario of American kids swapping their NFL football for a cricket bat, to quizzical looks about the financial viability of the game in North America, skeptical eyebrows are usually raised.</p> <p>Granted, there have been enough false dawns over the years to deflate even the most fervent of Stateside cricket followers – yes, they do exist – yet with the advent of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Cricket\">Major League Cricket (MLC) in 2023</a>, this time could well be different.</p> <p>So different, in fact, that MLC is set to receive <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/media-deals/2022/05/19/major-league-cricket-funding-120-million-expand-us\">further investment of $120m</a> put together by a wide range of investors. To add to that, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), one of the most successful and valuable Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises, are also plowing their money and reputation into the Twenty20 competition by taking control of a team in Los Angeles.</p> <p>The question many would ask is: Why?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/15/cricket-american-dream-usa-icc-status\">The Spin | Cricket’s American dream remains as USA welcomed back into ICC fold | Emma John</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Well, KKR CEO Venky Mysore is adamant now is the time to invest in North American cricket. The businessman, who spent a large portion of his professional career in the United States, has seen a similar investment in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) pay dividends.</p> <p>Millions across the world – particularly in India – have tuned in to see star performers like Andre Russell roll out for the CPL’s Trinidad Knight Riders. That’s a sure sign, according to Mysore, that a foray into the already heavily saturated US sporting market would be worth it, from an Indian perspective alone. </p> <p>A sudden sporting transformation won’t happen overnight (“10 to 15 years”, according to Mysore) but cricket in the US now has a plan and the IPL powerhouse of KKR want in.</p> <p>“My philosophy of how to build a franchise is based on two pillars,” Mysore says. “One is your brand, and the other one is your fanbase. And so if you have a two-month slot for a competition, how do you keep your brand alive all year round? </p> <p>“My vision when I took over KKR, was that we could acquire assets around the world, which are very similar, and we build expertise in building a franchise, and making it successful and building a model there. But the next challenge was how can we take that model and replicate it around the world under the mother brand of Knight Riders? That’s what we have done in the CPL and we will do in the United States.</p> <p>“On my wish list is to have a common group of sponsors who will participate with us wherever we play as Knight Riders, so that’s where MLC fits into the whole scheme of things.”</p> <p>The Knight Riders are far from the first team to employ this policy. It has served Manchester City, the Premier League team who have affiliate teams all over the globe, very well indeed. </p> <p>Few IPL franchises have been able to follow KKR’s lead and it remains unclear if others will take a chance with MLC, who have a number of American based sports investors to help with transition.</p> <p>“There is a commonality in terms of how we built our model, our colors and our logo and the brand of cricket we play,” says Mysore. “Fans in India are able to relate to our other teams.”</p> <p>On paper, the signs for MLC are encouraging. Cricket specific stadiums are planned. The most recent announcement is for one in Orange County, California, and other potential west coast venues include Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area. </p> <p>The $120m investment in MLC, which is set to start with six franchises, will primarily be dedicated to building premier cricket-specific stadia and training centers to help develop a new generation of US-born players.</p> <p>The project may be coming at just the right time too, after years of missteps and false dawns: the United States was named as a co-host with the Caribbean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/16/usa-west-indies-cricket-world-cup-hosts-t20\">for the 2024 T20 World Cup</a>. Meanwhile, cricket could make its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/10/icc-prepares-bid-for-crickets-inclusion-in-2028-los-angeles-olympics\">return to the Olympics in 2028</a> – in Los Angeles. Success, of course, isn’t guaranteed and neither is a return on some vast investment across the board unless. But Mysore is confident MLC will be sustainable. </p> <p>“It’s the NFL model, where you own part of the league,” he says. “So there’s a lot of other revenue that will flow through. I make more money from the CPL in Trinidad from licensing and merchandise than most IPL teams make in India.”</p> <p>Huge swathes of expat Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, English, Australians and South Africans in the US need no introduction to the grand old game. But, the multimillion dollar question is whether kids from the middle of America even know all this is happening while the NFL and NBA juggernauts keep on rolling. </p> <p>“I think the short answer is no,” says Michael Naraine, who teaches sports management at Brock University in Ontario. “I mean, the easy answer is cricket is going to stay in the urban centers for a while. And when you talk to MLC, and you talk to other stakeholders in the US, this idea that we were going to proliferate these properties in major urban centers where there’s lots of expats – Philadelphia, New York, Miami, San Francisco – makes sense in the grand scheme of things. </p> <p>“I think there’s opportunity, but we can’t be too facetious or naive about the situation that magically some kid in Missouri is going to pick this up. It’s a long-term play possibly culminating [with a US presence] in the Olympics in 2032. If kids are seeing Team USA spring a shock on NBC, they could start thinking about being a cricketer. “</p> <p>Naraine points to how ice hockey has gained footholds in places where the sport was not traditionally popular. Five-time NHL All-Star Auston Matthews is a good example: he grew up in Phoenix but was hooked on his local team, the Coyotes, growing up and is now one of the league’s best young players.</p> <p>“Phoenix only started their franchise in 1996 so 20 years on and they have their own MVP’s being produced,” says Naraine. “That’s how long it’s going to take for this thing to happen.”</p> <p>A Twenty20 win for the United States team at the end of last year over Ireland was seen as a watershed moment for the game here – a triumph over a full member of the ICC. It was the kind of moment which persuaded English World Cup winning bowler Liam Plunkett to head across the Atlantic and take up a player/coach role in Philadelphia. The 37-year-old, whose wife is from the area, is slated to play for the Philadelphia franchise. Crucially, cricket in the US will also use the vastly experienced player to help work with potential stars of tomorrow.</p> <p>“I feel like it’s a startup company and I want to help build cricket over here,” says Plunkett, one of 30 pro-players signed up by MLC. “I was in Houston a few weeks back with the major league guys, and there’s a lot of talent. With everything on the horizon, this definitely feels like a professional set-up now.”</p> <p>Mysore agrees that the potential is there. “The US is the number one media market in the world. And you’re taking the number two most watched sport in the world,” he says. “There’s enough people in the diaspora who are hungry to consume cricket content, that’s for sure. I’ve always maintained, though, that for us to be able to scale the product in the US, you have to get the average American sports fan interested in T20 cricket. There’s no doubt it will be difficult to do – but there are ways to go about it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/may/23/teal-independents-who-are-they-how-did-they-upend-australia-election","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T08:59:04Z","webTitle":"Teal independents: who are they and how did they upend Australia’s election?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/teal-independents-who-are-they-how-did-they-upend-australia-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/teal-independents-who-are-they-how-did-they-upend-australia-election","fields":{"headline":"Teal independents: who are they and how did they upend Australia’s election?","trailText":"What does historic move of voters away from the two major parties mean for the future of Australian politics?","body":"<p>There was a historic move of voters away from the two major parties in Saturday’s Australian election, and towards independent and Greens candidates who campaigned primarily on a stronger response to the climate crisis.

It was established by the Melbourne philanthropist Simon Holmes à Court in 2019 and provided funding to independent candidates who made climate action, political integrity and gender equality the main planks of their campaign – and who could match Climate 200’s contribution with their own fundraising.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v23/index.html?key=1rT99on3Dr98_Qi-mWPLfOLn46Yo8-bTy-uXoa30xJuw&amp;location=docsdata\" data-alt=\"Decline in vote for major parties\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v23/index.html?key=1rT99on3Dr98_Qi-mWPLfOLn46Yo8-bTy-uXoa30xJuw&location=docsdata\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Steggall comfortably retained her seat in Saturday’s election. That much was expected, but there was also a spectacular upheaval across formerly rock-solid Liberal seats in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.</p> <p>In Sydney, two more electorates on the leafy north side of the harbour – North Sydney and Mackellar – were won by the independents Kylea Tink and Sophie Scamps, a local GP. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/liberal-mp-dave-sharma-faces-heat-from-independent-in-wentworth-climate-showdown\">Wentworth</a>, which covers Sydney’s eastern harbour suburbs and Bondi beach, also fell, to the independent Allegra Spender, the daughter of the designer Carla Zampatti and John Spender, a former Liberal shadow minister in the 1980s. The electorate is the wealthiest in the country, and was previously represented by the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.</p> <p>In Melbourne, Monique Ryan, another doctor, won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/josh-frydenberg-pleads-with-unhappy-liberal-voters-to-stick-by-him-as-pressure-in-kooyong-grows\">similarly blue-blood seat of Kooyong</a> from the now former treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, who would have been the favourite to lead the Liberal party following its national defeat had he held the seat. Zoe Daniels, a former journalist with the ABC, won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/a-new-dynamic-in-goldstein-teal-turbulence-sweeps-wealthy-melbourne-seat\">bayside seat of Goldstein</a> from the prominent backbencher Tim Wilson.</p> <p>And in Western Australia, Kate Chaney, the niece of another former Liberal minister, Fred Chaney, is all but certain to claim victory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/could-a-climate-of-change-eject-the-liberals-from-the-perth-blue-ribbon-seat-of-curtin\">in the seat of Curtin</a>.</p> <p>Campaigns in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/scott-morrison-forced-to-clarify-net-zero-commitment-amid-coalition-division\">more than 20 seats were loosely characterised as teals</a> (not all used the colour, or took money from Climate 200), but any wins beyond Steggall holding her seat would have been considered implausible only months ago – for five to succeed constitutes a political earthquake.</p> <p>Other than their policies, the teal successes had several things in common. First, they were focused on inner-urban, prosperous seats, held mainly by Liberals on the moderate wing of the party. The campaigns ruthlessly highlighted the moderates’ inability to influence the direction of the Liberal party – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/scott-morrison-forced-to-clarify-net-zero-commitment-amid-coalition-division\">even more so its National party coalition partner</a> – on climate action. Second, they were the product of months if not years of grassroots organisation, which worked to select credible, professional candidates and provide a small army of committed volunteers. And third, almost all those candidates were women, who effectively channelled anger at the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-05-23/election-2022-morrison-women-vote/101089978\">perception Scott Morrison’s government had ignored or belittled them</a>.</p> <h2>How well did the Australian Greens do?</h2> <p>Adding to the independent triumphs, the Greens recorded their most successful electoral result, adding at least two lower house seats in Brisbane to the one they already held in Melbourne. Max Chandler-Mather won the seat of Griffith from Labor’s Terri Butler – the party’s environment spokesperson, who would have become the minister had she won – thanks to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/how-knocking-on-90000-doors-delivered-queensland-labor-heartland-to-the-greens\">massive and long-running community-led campaign</a>.</p> <p>In the adjacent seat of Ryan, in Brisbane’s western suburbs, Elizabeth Watson-Brown defeated the sitting Liberal MP. The Greens also retain hopes in the seat of Brisbane, previously held by the Liberals, but are more likely to lose out to Labor in a close three-way battle.</p> <p>The Greens also strengthened their presence in the Senate, gaining a seat each in Queensland and New South Wales, with a strong possibility of a third in South Australia, which would take their representation to 12 in the 76-strong upper house.</p> <p>The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, who was returned easily in his electorate of Melbourne, described it as “a Greenslide”. “This result is a mandate for action on climate and inequality. Our vote went up because we said politics needs to be done differently,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What does this mean for the parliament?</h2> <p>It is not clear whether Labor will gain the 76 seats needed to govern in majority, although the party’s strong result in Western Australia makes that the most likely result.</p> <p>If it falls short, Albanese will need to secure the support of some members of the crossbench to pass legislation. That will either involve negotiating with the teal independent candidates, the three Greens MPs, other independent MPs, or some combination thereof.</p> <p>Even if Labor secures the numbers for majority government, the teal MPs will be able to shape legislation in the lower house, which could involve strengthening Labor’s climate offerings.</p> <p>The Greens will have those same levers to pull, as well as potentially holding the balance of power in the Senate. They have listed their priorities as placing a ban on any new coal or gas developments and adding dental care to the country’s universal Medicare scheme.</p> <h2>What does this mean for the Liberal party?</h2> <p>With the exception of Wentworth, which was held briefly by the independent Kerryn Phelps following Turnbull’s exit from politics, it is the first time any of the seats have been out of Liberal hands.</p> <p>The seats targeted by independent campaigns – leafy wealthy suburbs packed with private schools in Melbourne, rich harbourside postcodes in Sydney and the most upmarket suburb in Perth – were the power base of the moderate wing of the Liberal party. After Saturday’s election, that has been destroyed.</p> <p>On election night, the South Australian senator Simon Birmingham, the most senior moderate left in the Liberal party, said the party was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/senior-liberals-say-party-must-address-women-problem-and-regain-centre-after-election-loss\">losing its base and needed to return to the centre.</a> “It’s a clear problem we are losing seats that are heartland seats, that have defined the Liberal party for generations,” he told the ABC. “There is clearly a big movement against us and a big message in it. We need to heed the message.”</p> <p>But others in the Coalition have drawn the conclusion that it needs to move further to the right. The National party leader, Barnaby Joyce, has already suggested his party may <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/23/barnaby-joyce-signals-nationals-could-drop-support-for-net-zero-emissions\">drop support for the target of net zero emissions by 2050</a>, which was reluctantly conceded by his party in the leadup to the Glasgow climate summit.</p> <h2>Are all independent MPs teals?</h2> <p>No, the teal independents will be joined on the crossbench by Dai Le, who ran a grassroots campaign to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/kristina-keneallys-loss-in-western-sydney-seat-a-predictable-result\">defeat the Labor frontbencher and former NSW premier Kristina Keneally</a> in the Sydney seat of Fowler. Keneally had been parachuted into the previously safe seat in the ethnically diverse and less well-off south-western suburbs, despite living in a privileged enclave on the other side of the city.</p> <p>The independent member for Indi in regional Victoria, Helen Haines, was also re-elected. Haines succeeded Cathy McGowan as the independent candidate in the seat at the previous election. McGowan’s campaign model, built around having kitchen table conversations with the electorate, was the template for many of the new grassroots independents who translated the model from the country to the city.</p> <p>There are also two other long-term independents: Andrew Wilkie, who has represented the Tasmanian seat of Clark since 2010; and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ih1EuMLspY\">idiosyncratic Bob Katter</a>, who has been the member for Kennedy in Queensland since 1993.</p> <p>Haines and Wilkie have progressive voting records; Katter conservative.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/23/bq-kingfisher-inflation-diy-demand-sales-covid","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T08:31:05Z","webTitle":"B&Q owner Kingfisher ‘managing inflation’ as DIY demand continues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/23/bq-kingfisher-inflation-diy-demand-sales-covid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/23/bq-kingfisher-inflation-diy-demand-sales-covid","fields":{"headline":"B&Q owner Kingfisher ‘managing inflation’ as DIY demand continues","trailText":"Retailer launches £300m share buyback as it retains most of sales increase during Covid pandemic","body":"<p>B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher has said it is managing inflationary pressures amid “resilient demand” for DIY despite the cost of living crisis in the UK and other markets.</p> <p>The retailer, whose other UK brand is the hardware trade supplier Screwfix, said sales had remained at elevated levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic, and that it was confident enough about its outlook to launch a £300m share buyback.</p> <p>During the first coronavirus lockdowns Kingfisher’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/22/b-and-q-owner-profits-soar-as-covid-creates-generation-of-diyers-kingfisher\">sales soared as customers were mainly stuck at home</a> but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/01/why-can-i-visit-a-diy-shop-but-not-a-museum-this-total-lockdown-is-failing\">DIY stores were permitted to stay open</a> to allow people to carry out essential maintenance.</p> <p>In a trading update on Monday, Thierry Garnier, the Kingfisher chief executive, said the company had retained a “significant proportion of the increased sales during the pandemic”.</p> <p>Like-for-like sales in the February to April quarter were 16% above the same period in 2019 at £3.2bn, although they dropped back by 5.8% overall compared with the boom in 2021.

Nights such as the collapse at Real Madrid seem to eat into Guardiola’s soul, his eyes betraying their horror. The accusation is that his players are unable to think for themselves in moments of pressure.</p> \n<p>In recent months, Guardiola has gone public with his defence of City, kicking against other clubs.

Klopp reached the middle of May on the brink of a quadruple, Liverpool having developed a fresh taste for domestic cup competitions. The return of Virgil van Dijk helped, as did the forward line finding form again, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/21/thiago-alcantara-liverpool\">flourishing of Thiago Alcântara </a>in midfield. Plus astute transfer business in the shape of Luis Díaz and Ibrahima Konaté.</p> \n<p>But amid all that, the key is Klopp. Liverpool’s owners have handed the keys to someone whose humanity, man-management and will to win pull fans, players and suits along with him for the ride. Liverpool are not a team of supreme classicists, artistic like Guardiola’s City; they thrill instead by attacking and defending in waves. A previous accusation was that Klopp’s unabated pressing game tired out his players but the use of his squad this season has been exemplary.</p> \n<p>“These are the days, my friends,” sing Liverpool fans. And Klopp is staying on for more of them, contracted until 2026.</p> \n<h2><strong>Thomas Frank</strong></h2> \n<p>Stepping beyond those two modern greats, perhaps only one other manager has been an unqualified success. Even then, as Brentford finished in mid-table, some pointed to signing Christian Eriksen in January, when the team were struggling against relegation, as some form of cheat mode. And yet it was Frank’s expertise that took his fellow Dane to west London.</p> \n<p>Contacts and risk-taking are a significant part of football management, and Frank’s previous relationship from national youth level with Eriksen meant the former Tottenham and Internazionale player chose Brentford as the place to rehabilitate after his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 last June.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9637bc5ba8fb1e402b793a9735171f80603d10c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9637bc5ba8fb1e402b793a9735171f80603d10c/290_3_2402_1617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Frank\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Frank has guided Brentford to safety in their first season top-flight season since the 40s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Keene/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Frank’s hard-working team, who press the opposition to distraction, have been an ideal platform for Eriksen, but they had been making waves all season, beating Arsenal on the opening night, and running Manchester City close at Christmas. Frank is highly personable, willing to answer questions on everything and no respecter of the elite. He is competitive in the extreme, and you will be hard-pressed to find a match where he felt his team didn’t deserve to win, though he is also no fantasist.</p> \n<h2><strong>Graham Potter</strong></h2> \n<p>Potter is a slow-burning success, perhaps more suited to the less pressurised environment of Brighton than the type of elite club he is now linked with. He also has the straight-backed humility certain pundits look for in a future England manager.</p> \n<p>The reason he will be linked with higher-tariff assignments is the fine job he continues to do at Brighton. Had the club been able to source a goalscorer they would be a seriously dangerous proposition and not gone on the run of nine draws and three defeats that snaked from September to December. Late-season wins over Arsenal, Spurs and then a glorious 4-0 pounding of Manchester United took them happily to mid-table, and those famous victories were each a product of Potter’s careful game management and preparation.</p> \n<p>Holding on to Yves Bissouma, Marc Cucurella and Leandro Trossard may be problematic but Potter has established Brighton in the Premier League. Should a higher calling come, he would be sorely missed.</p> \n<h2><strong>Eddie Howe</strong></h2> \n<p>There was a curious sight last Monday at St James’ Park, that of the local journalists ending the final home match of the season by applauding the manager, who in turn called the Tyneside pack “part of the team”. This is not the usual practice at Premier League clubs, though Howe’s rescuing of Newcastle, lifting them from the relegation zone to mid-table, undoubtedly made hacks’ lives a little easier. The second choice to Unai Emery has done very well.</p> \n<p>Spending a record £100m of Saudi cash in the January transfer window undoubtedly helped as Howe’s team lifted the post-Mike Ashley gloom. Bruno Guimarães is a signing the Premier League elite regret not making, and who knew Joelinton was such an adept midfield ratter? As at Bournemouth, though, Howe has made the team greater than the sum of its parts, remnants from Steve Bruce’s and Rafa Benítez’s regime also performing to a high level.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b05bd64d32cde2762f9293464488331864397f16\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05bd64d32cde2762f9293464488331864397f16/0_0_3907_2924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Howe shouts instructions to Joelinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Howe shouts instructions to Joelinton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Howe’s initial refusal to answer questions on Saudi Arabia, parroting a mantra that he concentrates on football, was unconvincing.

earlier today</a>, the markets response to the election of an <strong>Albanese Labor government</strong> was expected to be “muted”... and so it was.<br><br>Actually stocks could hardly have been more inert. For the day, the <a href=\"https://www2.asx.com.au/\">ASX200 benchmark</a> ended up just 0.05%, or 3.3 points, to 7148.9. <br><br>The <strong>Australian dollar </strong>perked up a bit, rising half a US cent to nudge above 71 US cents.</p> <p>On the homefront, literally, the <strong>property market</strong> had a relatively quiet week with auction activity down more than 40% on the previous week as the election discouraged sales.<br><br>Still, of the 2879 tracked auctions, the combined capitals’ preliminary clearance rate slipped to its lowest level so far this year, to 62.9%, <strong>CoreLogic </strong>said, citing preliminary figures. This ratio will likely sink further as numbers filter in later this week.</p> <p><strong>Melbourne</strong> and <strong>Sydney</strong> typically dominate auction sales, with the clearance rate of the former at 61.9% and the latter, 61.7%.

a swathe of other disposable items to follow suit in a bid to stop billions of bits of plastic litter entering the environment over the next 20 years.</p> <p>The state environment minister, James Griffin, said the ban, which comes into force on 1 June, is the first step in a plan to rid the state of many single-use plastic items and packaging which make up 60% of all litter in NSW.</p> <p>“I think all of us can see the impact plastic pollution is having on our environment,” Griffin said on Monday.</p> <p>The ban on lightweight single-use bags will be followed by a ban on more problematic plastics, such as cutlery and plates from November.</p> <p>“Single-use plastic is used by many of us for just a few convenient minutes, but it remains in our environment for many years, eventually breaking into microplastics,” Griffin said.</p> <p>Stopping the supply of plastic would help prevent it becoming litter or going into landfill, he said.</p> <p>“I encourage everyone to choose to go plastic-free as often as they can.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6879e407c1922d8a5ccd242960942852050c14df\"> <img

says.</p> <p>Labor picked up four seats in WA with double-digit swings across a number of electorates.</p> <p>McGowan said it would be good for WA to have more MPs on the government side in the new parliament and that should also be reflected in the ministry.</p> <p>“I do think they need to have strong representation from Western Australia,” the premier told reporters on Monday.</p> <p>“There’s lots of ambition and there’s lots of talented people and not everyone who wants a role can get it. That’s the reality.”</p> <p>“I just urge them to have strong representation from WA.”</p> <p>McGowan said he believed the Coalition government’s stoush with WA over border closures at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic was a “big factor” in the election result in the west.</p> <p>In particular, he singled out the commonwealth’s decision to intervene in support of mining magnate Clive Palmer’s court challenge of the border rules.</p> <p>“It was a terrible decision. It was bad for health, it was bad for the economy and it was stupid,” the premier said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-05-23T02:51:33.784Z\">at 3.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-628aeae18f08e35126bac184\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ben-smee\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-05-23T02:37:01.283Z\">3.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Queensland Liberal National party senator James McGrath sent a post-election email to his supporters calling members of Labor and the Greens “window lickers” and comparing the party’s election showing to a cowpat.</p> <p>One party member described the missive as “bizarre”, amid concerns from a dwindling number of progressive liberals that the LNP won’t recognise the imperative to pivot to respond to a historically poor vote in Brisbane’s inner-city and suburbs.</p> <p>McGrath said he was “gutted” for departing MPs Trevor Evans and Julian Simmonds, who suffered primary vote swings of more than 10% in their inner-Brisbane seats.</p> <p>McGrath wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I’m not going to slice up some kiwi fruit with passionfruit onto a cowpat and tell you it is a chocolate pavlova.</p> <p>Last night was bad.

A line of black Comcars snaked down the drive, as Albanese’s senior team – his “gang of four” interim ministry of Richard Marles, Penny Wong, Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher – popped out with their families in tow. </p> <p>A snap-snapping of camera lenses from the ropeline of photographers restrained behind a velvet cord on the edge of the room, as the incoming ministers entered: Marles, to be acting PM during Albanese’s visit to Tokyo for the Quad meeting, in a pink tie; Chalmers, the proud Queenslander, in a red tie and clutching a large red Bible. </p> <p>A slight stumble over Albanese’s name from the MC of the event – “Anthony Albany”, before quickly correcting himself – as the incoming PM entered the room, beaming as he shook hands with the governor general, David Hurley. </p> <p>“Congratulations,” Hurley whispered to each minister as they signed their official paperwork. </p> <p>An interim ministry of five: PM Albanese, Marles as minister for employment, Wong as minister for foreign affairs, Chalmers as treasurer, and Gallagher as minister for finance, women and attorney general. </p> <p>Walking out for an official photo on the front steps of Government House, Albanese hugged his ministers in a tight embrace. </p> <p>“Hey Mike, is my tie straight?” Albanese joked, as a line of photographers snapped their portrait. </p> <p>To a photographer kneeling on the ground for a shot from below, Albanese quipped: “We want you to go high, not low.</p> <p>“I’ve lost 20 kilos but still,” he said, gesturing to his stomach. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element

At the time he could have had no idea that, on the final day of the campaign, Liverpool would have already won two domestic cups, booked their place in the Champions League final and still be in contention for the title.</p> <p>Recently voted the Football Writers’ Association player of the season for a second time, the Egyptian has again been pivotal in his side’s successes and celebrated his 100th goal for Liverpool in September, achieving his century in fewer top-flight games than any player in the club’s history. That was just another of numerous personal goalscoring milestones the Egyptian would record in a season that concluded with him sharing the Golden Boot. Salah’s consistency is all the more impressive given that his future at Liverpool remains uncertain and he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/liverpool-contract-talks-with-mohamed-salah-stall-over-wages\">yet to agree to extend a contract</a> that expires at the end of next season. He has said he wants to stay at the club and fans will be hoping the hierarchy acquiesce to his financial demands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Bernardo Silva (Manchester City)</strong></h2> <p>One of any number<strong> </strong>of Manchester City players who could have been included on this shortlist, Silva agitated for a move last summer, stating he wanted to be closer to his family after the isolation of lockdown. While City would have almost certainly coped, they must be delighted there were no acceptable bids. Silva has had a phenomenal season, scoring in league wins against seven different sides, while providing four assists and creating double the number of “big chances” that went untaken.</p> <p>Capable of playing either side or in the middle, Silva is a wonderful dribbler and passer with a keen eye for goal. He made club history by winning three consecutive City player of the month awards in September, October and November. This form was rubber-stamped with a man-of-the-match performance capped by two goals against Watford in the first week of December. In a league campaign where City had little or no margin for error, Silva also scored crucial, match-winning goals against Leicester and Aston Villa, but has again hinted he would be open to a return to his native Portugal before his contract expires in 2025. He has done himself few favours by increasing the already large price tag that put off potential suitors last summer.</p> <h2><strong>Son Heung-min (Tottenham)</strong></h2> <p>The scorer of 23 goals, none of which have come from the penalty spot, Son cut a forlorn if slightly amusing figure as he sulked on the bench after being taken off with 18 minutes to go during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/12/tottenham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Tottenham’s recent rout of Arsenal</a> so he could be rested. Son’s largesse clearly did not extend to gifting this season’s Golden Boot to Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. Two goals on the final day of the season meant he shared the award with the Egyptian and his performances for Spurs this season earned him a player of the season nomination.</p> <p>Not just a scorer of goals but a scorer of crucial goals, only two of Son’s strikes this season have come in Tottenham defeats, against Arsenal and Southampton while he has also contributed seven assists. The South Korean has thrived under the management of Antonio Conte, having scored only one goal for each of the four months Nuno Espírito Santo was in charge. He will be left pondering the goalscoring heights he could have scaled had Conte been appointed during the summer.</p> <h2><strong>Jarrod Bowen (West Ham)</strong></h2> <p>The £21m West Ham paid Hull for Bowen in January 2020 looks more of a bargain with each appearance the 25-year-old makes for David Moyes’s side. During a season in which the previously maligned London Stadium has finally come to resemble a proper football ground, Bowen has done more than most to get fans out of their seats. In terms of bare statistics, he has chipped in with 12 top-flight goals (matching his xG) and 10 assists, while his tireless running and ability to cut inside from the right and find half-spaces has prompted calls for an England call-up and sparked rumours of a potential summer move to Liverpool, who don’t sign too many duds.</p> <p>Almost ever-present in a side that have played 55 matches in all competitions this season, Bowen is humble, hard-working, preposterously fit, rarely injured or suspended and boasts a saccharine sweet left foot. He has been instrumental in taking West Ham from the relegation battle they fought and won in his first half-season at the club to back-to-back qualifications for Europe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40e2155d34f0f9e4c7e444b3d19b737d7bab44f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40e2155d34f0f9e4c7e444b3d19b737d7bab44f9/0_0_2341_1557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jarrod Bowen scores West Ham’s second goal against Manchester City at the London Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jarrod Bowen scores West Ham’s second goal against Manchester City at the London Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Holly Allison/TPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Marc Cucurella (Brighton)</strong></h2> <p>While the man voted Brighton’s player of the season might not be an obvious contender for this shortlist, Cucurella has been a highly conspicuous Premier League presence this season and not just because of his trademark big hair.

This should be news to no one. Yet when my mum said it, having taken the baby from me so that I could – finally – shower off myriad effluences, I felt it in my bones. Even though my husband has been at home on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/apr/26/shared-parental-leave-scrap-deeply-flawed-policy-say-campaigners\">shared parental leave</a> and has been doing all the cooking and laundry, and half the feeding (a luxury few can afford), I calculate that each newborn needs at least three, possibly four, adults to bring things up to a level beyond “just about coping”.</p> <p>And yet the situation if you’re in a heterosexual pairing is that, after two weeks, most men go back to work and their partners are home alone with a baby in an endless cycle of feeding, sleeping and defecating, trying to time it so that they can actually exit the house and see another human being before the next circle of hell begins.</p> <p>“What’s it like?” a friend asked me, of motherhood. “It’s like a tornado crashing through the middle of your life,” I said, “so you wake up in Oz and everything’s in Technicolour. But also, you’ve been crushed by a house.”</p> <p>Thank heavens, then, for grandparents, and if you’re lucky enough to live close to them (and they are willing to help) you have won the childcare lottery. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/17/grandmothers-may-be-more-connected-to-grandchildren-than-to-own-offspring\">love one has for one’s grandchildren</a> is in some ways purer, less complicated, a grandmother recently told me, and certainly less guilt-ridden. At the root of it is the Darwinian knowledge that you would step in if anything happened to the parents, she said. Not so long ago, women regularly did not make it through childbirth alive, after all.</p> <p>Likewise, anyone who brings you food in the early weeks takes on god-level status. Where hunter-gatherers used to be, instead there’s a website called <a href=\"https://takethemameal.com/\">Take Them a Meal</a>, which allows friends to coordinate the logistics. Fidelity to humanity’s tribal, mutually supportive origins may have been all but obliterated by the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism, but we do have online deliveries. Hence cheese platters sent by friends in Brooklyn and Somerset, and fruit and champagne courtesy of my sister-in-law in New Zealand. My aunt Teresa, meanwhile, has been trekking over once a week with a full meal that she has prepared. The first week that we came home from hospital with our preterm baby, she brought us a full roast chicken dinner with lemon pudding for after, complete with a little jam jars of gravy and cream respectively. I could have cried (I did cry).</p> <p>So I understand why new parents – mothers especially – have confided in me that they have found themselves fantasising about communes (and not in a sexual way, that’s what got us all in this mess in the first place). Our fragmented society makes childcare a lonely and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/18/childcare-costs-rishi-sunak-spring-statement\">expensive business</a>, especially when you’ve gravitated to a city. I was born into a shared co-operative house containing eight adults, two of whom were East German defectors sleeping on the living room floor. My mother said it was great to have other adults to talk to. For many, days on maternity leave seem to stretch out endlessly, and friends say it can feel like you’ve achieved little while your partner has been at work. (The book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/05/booksforchildrenandteenagers.familyandrelationships\">What Mothers Do</a>: Especially When it Looks Like Nothing is brilliant at taking such beliefs to task.) So many women spending so much time alone with their babies without family support could <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=mums+alone&amp;journal=jcm\">exacerbate postnatal depression</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/12/boris-johnson-rights-working-women-employment-bill\">Under Boris Johnson, the rights of working women have become a feeble joke | Angela Rayner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though we live far from our extended families, I have been bowled over by the love and kindness we’ve received, such as my mother-in-law picking up last-minute sleepsuits that didn’t swamp our premature baby. My thoughts have turned to immigrant women, some of whom have emailed me about their experiences, trying to make it through without their family networks. In some cultures it is the norm, postpartum, for the woman to take to her bed to feed the baby while a deluge of relatives descend to care for her. I’ve also been thinking of the new parents who were robbed of contact with their families during the pandemic, but who say they at least found solace in the cocoon they were able to form at home thanks to fathers working from home.</p> <p>The proverb “it takes a village to raise a child” is often cited to new parents, but in much of the west we seem to have turned our backs on childrearing as a collective endeavour. It is instead the business of individuals, who must shoulder the burden in their atomised units, subject to the twin forces of extortionate childcare and pathetic paid paternity-leave provision.</p> <p>Yet the traditional heterosexual nuclear family <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/\">is on its way out</a>: among my friends are gay couples who have conceived thanks to surrogacy or IVF, blended families, co-parents, single parents and women in traditional marriages who are basically single parents and will continue to be so once they inevitably divorce their husbands. Perhaps it’s time to dismantle it even further or, rather, expand our understanding of it.

We list reasons why this should be avoided","body":"<p>Pensions experts are warning over-55s against using their retirement savings to see them through the cost-of-living crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/uk-inflation-soars-to-highest-level-in-more-than-40-years\" title=\"\">Inflation soared to 9%</a> in April as a result of the escalating price of food, fuel and transport, putting a squeeze on finances for many households. Those able to access their pension pots could be tempted to take out money to cover immediate costs, but this comes with the risk of having significantly less income in the future.</p> <p>“As the cost of living squeeze continues to tighten, inevitably more people will be tempted to take more from their pension, or to start taking an income sooner than they’d planned, even if they’re still working,” says Steven Cameron, a director at Aegon, one of the UK’s largest pensions providers.</p> <p>Legal &amp; General said it had seen an increase in investors withdrawing from their funds this year compared with last and was “monitoring closely” whether this was due to the rising cost of living. In the first four months of last year, 5% of pension customers made an ad hoc withdrawal; this year, 18% did. “It is inevitable that with the cost-of-living crisis biting, people will be more likely to access their savings earlier and then draw down at higher rates,” says Emma Byron of Legal &amp; General Retirement Solutions.</p> <p>Since reforms made in 2015 by then chancellor George Osborne, savers have had easier access to their retirement money after the age of 55. Instead of being limited to a 25% lump sum, they have been able to draw down as much as they want from their fund.</p> <p>Figures from HM Revenue and Customs show that in the last three months of last year, 428,000 people <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/personal-and-stakeholder-pensions-statistics\" title=\"\">had withdrawn a combined £2.69bn</a> from personal pension savings. Earlier this year Interactive Investor, the online trading platform, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/20/pensioner-poverty-alarm-as-older-people-raid-pension-pots\" title=\"\">its customers had withdrawn an average of £1,944 in January</a>, up 25% on the same month in previous years.</p> <p>Helen Morrissey of Hargreaves Lansdown said the increase in the energy price cap on 1 April was a landmark point after which the cost-of-living crisis became apparent to households.</p> <h2>Still working and invested</h2> <p>Pensions are there to ensure that you are financially secure for your retirement years. But investors who withdraw sums from their pot could see this future security threatened if they eat into their funds too early.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many people think you don't qualify for pension credit if you have savings or own your own home. Neither of these is true</p> <footer> <cite>Helen Morrissey, pensions analyst</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Withdrawing money early will reduce how much you ultimately have when you retire because you will lose out on potential for growth. </p> <p>For example, a person with £100,000 in their pot at 55 can, if they don’t pay in any more, expect to see it to grow to almost £165,000 by the time they reach 65, based on annual growth of 5%. But if they take £25,000 out at 55, bringing the pot down to £75,000, it could subsequently grow to only £123,000 – a potential loss of £32,000.</p> <p>Taking money out of a pension has implications for over-55s: they can take out a cash lump sum of 25% tax-free, but any money accessed after that will be taxed as income for that year.</p> <p>Withdrawing money may also have an impact on the amount you can continue to pay into the defined contribution pot, should you be in a position to top it up later.</p> <p>Under current rules, you can pay up to £40,000 into a pension and get tax relief on those contributions. However, taking out <a href=\"https://www.unbiased.co.uk/life/pensions-retirement/what-is-the-money-purchase-annual-allowance-mpaa\" title=\"\">a series of lump sums from your pension</a>, can trigger the Money Purchase Annual Allowance (MPAA), which reduces the amount that can be paid into a pension pot with tax relief to £4,000. The MPAA is also triggered by other scenarios – such as if you take the whole pension as a lump sum.</p> <p>Rebecca O’Connor of Interactive Investor has called for an increase to the £4,000 MPAA. “This would allow those aged 55-plus who have accessed their pension but are still working to contribute more and get more tax relief, allowing them to get their pension into as healthy a state as possible before they eventually retire,” she says.</p> <h2>If you have already retired</h2> <p>Many have planned their retirement based on steadily drawing down from their pot. But withdrawing money faster to deal with daily bills will change all that, says former pensions minister Steve Webb, who now works for pension consultants LCP.</p> <p>“You really don’t want to be doing that at the start of your retirement,” he says. “It is one thing doing it when you are 80 but doing it when you are 65 is quite different.”</p> <p>There are, however, ways to avoid dipping into pension pots.</p> <p>Pensioners on a low income may qualify for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit\" title=\"\">pension credit</a>, which Morrissey says is a “hugely underclaimed benefit”. Pension credit tops up the income of the poorest pensioners and can be a gateway to other benefits, such as help with council tax, utility bills and mortgage interest.</p> <p>“Pension credit is plagued by myths that prevent people from claiming it,” she says. “Many people believe you do not qualify for pension credit if you have savings or own your own home. Neither of these things is true, so it’s worth checking to see if you qualify.”</p> <p>There have already been calls for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61492789\" title=\"\">state pension to be increased</a> in the next budget, but this could come too late for many. Webb says: “Saying to someone who can’t afford their energy direct debit or who is cutting back on food shopping to ‘just wait till the autumn’ is unacceptable. We will see excess deaths because some people can’t afford to get by.” </p> <p>The 2015 reforms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/26/savers-response-to-pension-freedom-do-nothing-over-55s\" title=\"\">led to fewer people using their pension pot to buy an annuity</a>, because of the relatively low income they got for their savings.

I’ve already read it twice, yet still I feel that I could go back to it again some time quite soon. Healy is one of those very noticing artists, and the great pleasure of his deeply satisfying fourth book, which is about an old friendship that will shortly curdle, lies in small things: little details you may not notice the first time around; ambiguities that nag away at you. Then again, even on a first reading, it’s a stand-out: so funny and melancholy, so knowing and true. Frank and Giorgio, the two men at the heart of it, are brilliant, vivid creations, and the passive-aggressive scratchiness between them is so beautifully observed. It isn’t hard at all to imagine such frenemies as the stars of some future film or TV series, though personally I would be quite content if Healy would only give them another outing between hard covers.</p> <p>Frank (the standup comedian who is the book’s narrator) and Giorgio were friends as children, and on paper they’re very similar: both Irish in London, both gay and both single. But in adulthood, they’re not especially close, meeting up only every few months or so – until, one day, Giorgio calls Frank and tells him he has been hit by a bus. His wrist is broken. Could Frank look after him when he gets home? It’s worried Frank, not Giorgio, who asks this question, but almost immediately he begins to regret the offer. Giorgio is a nightmare patient, as demanding as a hotel guest, for all that it’s in his house that they’re staying. It’s almost sinister, the way he insists that Frank washes his hair or cuts up his dinner – and there’s something else, too. How is he making a living? In the bathroom, the soap is flashy – Frank would have to play three gigs to buy it – but his friend is getting letters from the benefits office. Nothing makes any sense, and trying to work it all out triggers Frank’s already quite bad anxiety.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4aded1eb893cb598c344ab5436b3f8eac36fb535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4aded1eb893cb598c344ab5436b3f8eac36fb535/0_0_2655_3683/721.jpg\" alt=\"A page from The Con Artists\" width=\"721\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A page from The Con Artists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Healy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Popular culture is overly populated with depictions of fraudsters and grifters right now, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/26/the-dropout-this-true-crime-story-aims-for-wolf-of-wall-street-energy-and-misses\">Elizabeth Holmes</a>, the biotech “entrepreneur”, to the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/the-tinder-swindler-simon-leviev-neflix-fame\">Tinder Swindler</a>, Simon Leviev – an obsession born, perhaps, of the fact that social media makes some cons so much easier to pull off; that each and every one of us has at some point fallen for an Instagram lie. Healy’s book speaks to this mood, I think; Frank will come to wonder if he knows his friend at all. But it’s a tender, intimate story, too, one in which long-repressed love and competitiveness bubble up as if from nowhere. I love the way Healy writes, his characters so ineffably droll, and their speech always so spare, and I love the way he draws, too – just enough detail in every frame to transmit character, mood, imminent jeopardy (it’s there in a shrug or a yell, the way they carry a bag or arrange themselves on a sofa). He can be hilarious, and if you are even slightly tired of the current craze elsewhere in the literary world for thinly disguised autobiography (out of which, having cleverly given one of his characters a false moustache, he gently takes the piss), then I think this minor masterpiece of a book might be for you.</p> <p>• <em>The Con Artists</em> by Luke Healy is published by Faber (£16.99).

They said that in areas with lots of unintentional feeding – trash bags on the curb, pet food left on a porch – coyotes can become unusually comfortable with their neighbors.</p> <p>On the afternoon of 3 May, one of those too-comfortable coyotes dragged a toddler off a porch, sending the two-year-old into critical care at a nearby hospital.</p> <p>The city of Dallas quickly blamed neighbors for making food accessible to the coyotes. In a Facebook post soon after the attack, the city’s animal services department said “residents were routinely handfeeding and petting” the coyote, but has walked back those claims in the weeks since.</p> <p>The neighborhood fought back, saying they had tried raising the alarm to no avail.</p> <p>“It was insulting,” Bickett said. “I don’t want to use the term ‘gaslight’ because I feel like it’s been worn out, but that’s exactly what it was.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"687a61a06b46c92a01adbbb3c65126ae319802e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/687a61a06b46c92a01adbbb3c65126ae319802e5/0_157_4443_2666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The pressure of urban development and deforestation have caused animal species to move towards urban areas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pressure of urban development and deforestation have caused animal species to move towards urban areas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeffrey Arguedas/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such an attack is exceedingly rare. Coyotes are skittish and secretive. They usually don’t want to be seen by humans, much less attack them.</p> <p>Yet the attack on the Dallas toddler, experts say, is the kind of thing that could happen anywhere. The city is scrambling to put together a plan that would help officials respond more quickly to aggressive wildlife while educating residents about how to live peacefully with their wild neighbors.</p> <p>•••</p> <p>White Rock Valley is an upper-middle-class neighborhood tucked between green spaces in north-east Dallas. Mid-century craftsman homes line the blocks, although in the past few years property flippers and new-build mini-mansions have brought construction to the neighborhood. White Rock elementary school, in the center of the neighborhood, butts up to a runoff creek with plenty of shade trees.</p> <p>It is perfect urban coyote habitat.</p> <p>Karin Saucedo is a Texas master naturalist and wildlife photographer who has researched coyote behavior for years. She also grew up in White Rock Valley, and had been spending more time there with her father recently.</p> <p>She had seen coyotes brazenly walking through her dad’s yard. She saw social media posts of residents concerned about the behavior of the local pack, and tried to respond with the tools she knows to use to keep both people and coyotes safe. She talked about removing food sources and “hazing”, or making loud noises and acting aggressively toward the animals to scare them away from humans.</p> <p>“But I don’t have a badge,” Saucedo said. “It’s a disaster waiting to happen.”</p> <p>It’s only when coyotes become comfortable around humans – often because they have found an easy food source – that they become aggressive. Sightings during the day or coyotes that approach people rather than running away are all signs of aggressive coyotes, says Sam Kieschnick, a Dallas-based urban wildlife biologist with Texas parks and wildlife department.</p> <p>“When a resource is available, they utilize it,” Kieschnick said. Especially in that neighborhood, he said, food was available for the local coyotes, so of course they stuck around.</p> <p>In 2018, Kieschnick was called to Frisco, Texas, a wealthy suburb of Dallas, <a href=\"https://streaklinks.com/BDQFouyxsSynZ2JgZA657pbP/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dallasnews.com%2Fnews%2F2019%2F01%2F15%2Ffrisco-s-recent-string-of-coyote-attacks-is-super-weird-by-urban-wildlife-standards%2F\">when several coyote attacks were reported there</a>. It was the first time he could recall ever hearing about a coyote attacking a person in the state. Several coyotes there were killed to eliminate the rogue pack.</p> <p>After the attacks, officials in Frisco wrote up a comprehensive urban wildlife management plan, with strategies to help people and their local fauna coexist.</p> <p>Authorities used a similar strategy in Dallas this month after the toddler was attacked. First, Dallas police and a biologist with the US Department of Agriculture killed four coyotes.</p> <p>Now, the city is drafting a coyote management plan focused on a hotline for reporting coyote sightings. There’s also a new focus on educating the public about what’s normal coyote behavior, what’s not, and how humans can safely live with the canine scavengers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df0a88a9f0c3085862f8618020381cadf6d0d33e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df0a88a9f0c3085862f8618020381cadf6d0d33e/0_0_3000_1985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A coyote runs on the sidewalk in Sacramento, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A coyote runs on the sidewalk in Sacramento, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xavier Mascarenas/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dallas Animal Services said 10 calls came in about coyote sightings in the neighborhood between the beginning of February and the attack on the toddler in early May. That’s fairly common. When trees are bare and coyotes begin moving more in springtime, sightings are not unusual.</p> <p>But things became more concerning for residents in recent weeks, especially when coyotes began following young children in the neighborhood rather than running away. Occasionally an animal services officer would come to the neighborhood, but when they left, the coyotes came back.</p> <p>“We did everything we knew to do,” Bickett said.</p> <p>•••</p> <p>In Chicago, biologists have been researching urban coyote behavior for more than two decades. The <a href=\"https://streaklinks.com/BDQFouyVlUh5mxDpxgr3FgfO/https%3A%2F%2Furbancoyoteresearch.com%2F\">Urban Coyote Research Project</a> there is one of the longest-lasting studies of the species.</p> <p>The city of Chicago has used that research to develop its own management plan for the species. Like Dallas’s effort, it starts with educating residents. Next, it encourages people who see coyotes to haze them. Finally, it discusses lethal removal options for overly habituated coyotes.</p> <p>Wildlife experts say the lethal option is only for the most extreme cases.</p> <p>“If someone is bitten, then there’s no debate. That’s the proper response,” said Stanley Gehrt, the principal investigator of the Chicago project and a professor of ecology at Ohio State University. “Obviously there’s a reason the animal behaved that way and if you don’t address that you’ll have to remove another animal down the road.”</p> <p>•••</p> <p>After the attack on the toddler, a Dallas city councilman organized a community meeting at the elementary school in White Rock Valley. Outside, blue ribbons wrapped around all the trees on the block in support of the child, who was still in the hospital. Inside, city officials tried to explain how the coyotes had become so bold and what the government was doing next.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6d6890bb931e67a4c0ff52e845c889dbcb3e1f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6d6890bb931e67a4c0ff52e845c889dbcb3e1f7/0_9_1732_1039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘It just takes one person, one neighbor to unintentionally feed a wild animal.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It just takes one person, one neighbor to unintentionally feed a wild animal.’<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natural History Library/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Residents like Bickett and Saucedo were there, too. Many wanted to hear an apology for pointing the blame at residents.</p> <p>“We knew we needed to protect our pets. What we didn’t know was that we needed to protect our children,” said Kathy Stewart, a 28-year resident of the neighborhood. “I want to know what changed.”</p> <p>For the biologists, the answer comes back to food. The city still says that “well-meaning animal lovers” may have been putting out food for the coyotes intentionally. Adam Henry, a USDA biologist who helped hunt the coyotes in Dallas, said some may have become used to finding food at the new construction sites throughout the neighborhood, and pointed to the doorbell footage showing a coyote grabbing a food delivery bag.</p> <p>“We’re seeing a dawn of a new creature,” Henry said. “They’ve gotten habituated to finding it on those front porches.”</p> <p>Bickett brushes aside the claims over the pandemic-era food delivery as part of the reason for more aggressive wildlife. She says if it had become a common practice for the coyotes, she would have seen it on other cameras, not just the one clip that was distributed to local TV stations.</p> <p>But Saucedo said that the coyotes she studies can become used to a new behavior after just one positive interaction with a human.</p> <p>“Once he realized he could get a reward on a porch, he’s going to be curious about any porch,” Saucedo said. “It just takes one person, one neighbor to unintentionally feed a wild animal.”</p> <p>At the meeting, many of the residents wanted to know why the city didn’t already have a plan for managing coyote behavior. They have been a part of the ecosystem for decades, and are often spotted in residential areas throughout the greater Dallas-Fort Worth area.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/08/coy-wolf-hybrid-toronto-canada-aoe\">Toronto’s mystery predator really is a coy-wolf – but not as we know it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/08/coy-wolf-hybrid-toronto-canada-aoe</p> <p>“Where the city is<strong> </strong>on its response is in the exact same place where every other community that has a wildlife problem starts out,” Henry said. “That’s how government works, any government. We’re always behind the curve.”</p> <p>“So White Rock Valley is the first community in Dallas to ever have this problem?” asked Kristy Feil, who has lived in the neighborhood for 19 years. “I mean, we’re the first?”</p> <p>The truth is, yes. The city officials couldn’t say definitively that in all of Dallas’s history there hasn’t been an attack, but violent coyote interactions are so incredibly rare that it’s not surprising it took so long for them to form a plan. Urban coyotes are, the vast majority of the time, out of sight and out of mind.</p> <p>“I’m starting to understand why we’re having more of an issue recently,” Feil said after the meeting. “There’s no one to blame. We’ve just got to figure out how to handle it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/23/frontline-workers-how-has-the-cost-of-living-crisis-affected-your-work","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-23T08:00:24Z","webTitle":"Frontline workers: how has the cost of living crisis affected your work?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/23/frontline-workers-how-has-the-cost-of-living-crisis-affected-your-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/23/frontline-workers-how-has-the-cost-of-living-crisis-affected-your-work","fields":{"headline":"Frontline workers: how has the cost of living crisis affected your work?","trailText":"We would like to hear from key workers about how the cost of living crisis has affected the communities they work in","body":"<p>We would like to hear from key workers, including firefighters, social workers, healthcare workers, carers, and police officers, about how the cost of living crisis has affected the communities they work in.</p> <p>In what ways have you noticed the cost of living crisis is making an impact on the community?</p> <h2><strong>Share your experiences</strong></h2> <p>You can get in touch by filling in the form below or contact us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/aug/12/whatsapp-sharing-stories-with-the-guardian\">via WhatsApp</a> by <a href=\"https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=447766780300\">clicking here</a> or adding +44(0)7766780300.
