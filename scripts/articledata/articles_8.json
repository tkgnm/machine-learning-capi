But Prof Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), has suggested it is unlikely to be used in the future.</p> <p>“It was a fantastic vaccine, and it still is a fantastic vaccine for the world … and the population which received AstraZeneca vaccines of course got very good protection from it,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday. “But the way that the taskforce has decided to purchase the vaccines, we are using mRNA vaccines now.”</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) confirmed to the Guardian that it had not placed further orders for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, and said the decision was down to a recommendation by the JCVI that mRNA vaccines – such as the Pfizer or Moderna jabs – should primarily be <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-statement-september-2021-covid-19-booster-vaccine-programme-for-winter-2021-to-2022/jcvi-statement-regarding-a-covid-19-booster-vaccine-programme-for-winter-2021-to-2022\">used for boosters</a>.</p> <p>“The results of the Cov-Boost trial conducted during the summer of 2021 provided good evidence that mRNA vaccines are the most effective option for the UK’s booster programme,” a JCVI spokesperson said, noting that the jabs provided a very good immune response regardless of which vaccine was used for previous doses.</p> <p>“Real-world data of vaccine effectiveness following the rollout of the booster programme support the results from the Cov-Boost trial,” they said.</p> <p>While the JCVI has previously advised booster shots with the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab can occur in exceptional circumstances, the DHSC has now procured supplies of the Novavax vaccine – <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-nuvaxovid-approved-by-mhra#:~:text=The%20vaccine%20has%20been%20approved,safety%2C%20quality%20and%20effectiveness%20standards.&amp;text=Nuvaxovid%2C%20the%20COVID%2D19%20vaccine,products%20Regulatory%20Agency%20(MHRA).\">approved by the MHRA in February</a> – which the JCVI has recommended should be offered to people who cannot have mRNA vaccines for clinical reasons, such as allergic reactions.</p> <p>The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab has had a bumpy ride since its first results were released in 2020, including concerns over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/02/covid-scientists-blood-clots-astrazeneca-covid-jab-vaccine-side-effects-pandemic\">rare blood clot complications</a>, misinformation – such as claims the jab has low efficacy in elderly people – and criticisms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/20/oxford-covid-jab-vaccine-astrazeneca\">over the design of the vaccine’s trials</a>.</p> <p>Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol and a member of the JCVI, said the committee could only advise on the deployment of vaccines that the government had decided to buy.</p> <p>He said an abundance of caution over the issue of blood clots in younger people was one reason the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab was not deemed suitable for the booster programme, along with public perception of the vaccine.</p> <p>“Obviously, the whole success of the vaccine programme hinges on there being a public buy-in to accepting the vaccine,” he said.</p> <p>The jab was also unlikely to be used for first and second doses, he suggested. “I think primary immunisation [has] pretty much stopped now, in the sense that anyone who wants a vaccine by now will have had it,” Finn said.</p> <p>In addition, the DHSC noted that those who cannot have an mRNA jab for their primary course could now be offered the Novavax vaccine.</p> <p>Simplicity matters, Finn suggested. “Operationally, the fewer vaccines you’ve got, the easier the communication, the easier the logistics,” he said, adding that this also goes for the autumn booster campaign.</p> <p>“The ideal scenario … would be to deploy the new Moderna bivalent vaccine – just give it to everybody eligible for a booster and just have one vaccine that everyone gets,” he said. “It’s just that we don’t really know yet whether we can match supply and demand to do that.”</p> <p>But Harnden told the Guardian that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine still had an important role to play in tackling Covid worldwide, noting that the UK had donated doses to the Covax global vaccine-sharing scheme.</p> <p>“[The jab] is a very effective vaccine that doesn’t have the same storage and transport issues that the mRNA vaccines have. So [it] is a very good vaccine for developing world where the temperature requirements can be more problematic,” he said. “JCVI are making recommendations on the choice of vaccines in the context of UK supply.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/16/more-profound-than-breaking-bad-goodbye-better-call-saul-the-show-like-nothing-else-on-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T16:40:13Z","webTitle":"‘More profound than Breaking Bad’: goodbye Better Call Saul, the show like nothing else on TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/16/more-profound-than-breaking-bad-goodbye-better-call-saul-the-show-like-nothing-else-on-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/16/more-profound-than-breaking-bad-goodbye-better-call-saul-the-show-like-nothing-else-on-tv","fields":{"headline":"‘More profound than Breaking Bad’: goodbye Better Call Saul, the show like nothing else on TV","trailText":"After 61 immaculate episodes, this cinematic, immersive drama ends today. It was visually beautiful, detail-oriented TV that became so much more than Vince Gilligan’s previous show","byline":"Stuart Jeffries","body":"<p>Farewell Saul Goodman: the star of the spin-off we never saw coming. When Jesse Pinkman drove off into the desert at the end of Breaking Bad’s final episode nine years ago, leaving behind a mortally wounded Walter White, the safe money would not have bet on Bob Odenkirk starring as the reptilian “Slipping” Jimmy McGill in a prequel that traced his mutation from small-time schlemiel into still more slimy attorney Saul Goodman. </p> <p>It was more likely that glamorous slacker meth-cook Jesse would drive off to adventures new. Instead, of course, Aaron Paul went on to voice Todd in BoJack Horseman, who is essentially a more lovable Jesse minus the crystal blue persuasion.</p> <p>Just as Frasier spun off improbably from Cheers, so Saul emerged from the corpse of Breaking Bad. Over six series, Better Call Saul evolved into a more profound and beautiful drama about human corruption than its predecessor. It mutated into something visually more sumptuous than Breaking Bad, while never, for a moment, losing its verbal dexterity and moral compass. </p> <p>A recent episode, for instance, included a virtuosic series of shots through the interiors of Saul’s apartment, unfolding like the interiors of a painting from the Dutch golden age. Sometimes, all plot development suspended for a few hypnotic moments, the camera would linger on a worn-out dollar bill caught on a cactus thorn, or on some abstract composition of a piece of metal foil blown about the desert.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20d34128243d081c479159b134ee163da6cd134c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20d34128243d081c479159b134ee163da6cd134c/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tina Parker as Francesca Liddy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tina Parker as Francesca Liddy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Very little TV has the confidence to take its time in this way. And the same is true of those long, wordless scenes of working men (they usually have been men) doing things, be it making cinnamon rolls in Omaha, springing an elaborate scam, building a meth lab underneath a laundry or, as Mike once calmly did, changing a window frame like a craftsman while holed up south of the border away from the drug thugs who wanted to kill him.</p> <p>There is, Vince Gilligan and his fellow creatives know, something soothing about watching someone do work they are proud of – manual, meticulous, informed work that proves the craft antidote to the daily grind (what late anthropologist David Graeber called “bullshit jobs”). Beyond the bullshit, there is, in Gilligan’s worldview, a respect for the work and for the honouring of it by its depiction on screen – even if that work is cooking pure meth or manipulating the legal system.</p> <p>Really, there is nothing on television at the moment that has dared to beguile us in these ways, nor has there been a show for a long time that switches back and forth between storylines, confident that the audience is savvy enough to keep up. How strange, perhaps even singular, to find a long-form drama that doesn’t insult our intelligence, but sets it to work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc94ee138abdd3d1b5549c0ea2fff04fcc120d75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc94ee138abdd3d1b5549c0ea2fff04fcc120d75/0_120_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All that is to say that, after 61 episodes of meticulous film-making, writing and acting (not to mention a mid-season heart attack on set for dear old Bob Odenkirk that made me, and doubtless other fans, worry selfishly that, just possibly, we’d never get to see an episode (called Saul Gone) that gave us closure on this story), Better Call Saul has been a nearly constant pleasure and a lesson in how television can be cinematic as well as immersive, epic as well as grittily focused on detail.</p> <p>For those reasons, for me at least, it has been one of those things that have become vanishingly rare in our non-stop bingearama of entertainment – appointment TV. Its final episode is, as a result, sweet sorrow. .</p> <p>From the get go, all that said, this wasn’t a promising premise. For Breaking Bad, Gilligan had the idea that Walter White’s journey from chemistry teacher to pork-pie-hat-wearing drug kingpin traced the dramatic arc from Mr Chips to Scarface. But Better Call Saul has no such character development: Saul has always been bad, even when he was upstart Jimmy. Or so we might suppose, right up to the last moments of this note-perfect finale – when we finally take our leave of the star of this unpredictable spin-off.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 17 August 2022.

They have prompted Russian tourists to flee Crimea in panic. There were queues on Tuesday outside the railway station at the regional capital, Simferopol.</p> \n<p>The defence ministry in Moscow said it was dealing with cases of sabotage and taking “necessary measures” to prevent further episodes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"248656dc-6eab-4123-b0b4-534a35e2f3c7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HUGsajB5bmg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking from the presidential offices in Kyiv, Podolyak said: “Our strategy is to destroy the logistics, the supply lines and the ammunition depots and other objects of military infrastructure. It’s creating a chaos within their own forces.”</p> \n<p>The adviser, often described as the country’s third most powerful figure, said Kyiv’s approach ran counter to Moscow’s use of blunt artillery power to gain territory in the Donbas region to the east, which has seen Russian troops destroy cities such as Mariupol and Sievierodonetsk in order to gain territory.</p> \n<p>“So Russia has kind of taught everybody that a counteroffensive requires huge amounts of manpower like a giant fist and just go in one direction,” he said, but “a Ukrainian counteroffensive looks very different. We don’t use the tactics of the 60s and 70s, of the last century.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dac650721aa09aea46ffb00012c5be20ae2cf09\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dac650721aa09aea46ffb00012c5be20ae2cf09/523_0_2938_1764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An infrared overview of Saky airbase after the attack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An infrared overview of Saky airbase after the attack.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxar Technologies/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the remarks could also be interpreted as an acknowledgment that Ukraine is struggling to amass the amount of men and military material required to sustain a full counteroffensive in the south of the country, which typically requires a superiority of three or more soldiers to one.</p> \n<p>Instead, Ukraine has tried to cut off Kherson, the one city held by Russia on the west bank of the Dnieper River, by damaging road and rail bridges using newly supplied western rocket artillery to the point where it is no longer possible for Russia to resupply its forces effectively.</p> \n<p>Podolyak asked for “50, 60, 80 more” MLRS (multiple launch rocket systems) on top of an existing arsenal of about 20, 16 of which are truck-mounted Himars supplied by the US. Three – the track-wheeled M270 – have come from the UK, with three more promised, which the adviser described as “very good”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4428da80a2488a88b554e5564b9cc01d159fe009\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4428da80a2488a88b554e5564b9cc01d159fe009/0_448_7209_4326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soldiers with an M270 system during a military exercise in Germany last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soldiers with an M270 system during a military exercise in Germany last month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christof Stache/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Helped by the long-range missiles supplied by the west, Podolyak added that Ukraine hoped to degrade the invaders’ strength through “lack of supplies and lack of ammunition” that “will make Russians fight like they did on the first months of the war”.</p> \n<p>In the early phase of the conflict a disorganised Russian military failed to capture Kyiv after the invading forces became clogged up in a series of traffic jams on roads leading into the city, making them vulnerable to Ukrainian infantry and anti-tank weapons.</p> \n<p>The presidential aide suggested that last week’s airbase attack could have been the work of partisans, but playfully dismissed any suggestion it could have been an accident, as had been suggested by Moscow in its immediate aftermath.</p> \n<p>Podolyak said Russians had “a different physics” if they believed the blasts the result of discarded cigarettes causing munitions dumps to explode, before going on to anticipate a repeat of such attacks behind the lines in the future.</p> \n<p>“I certainly agree with the Russian ministry for defence, which is predicting more incidents of this kind in the next two, three months. I think we might see more of those happening,” Podolyak said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"367026f4e3b983135452282a2ad4647b031c1a2c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/367026f4e3b983135452282a2ad4647b031c1a2c/0_336_2945_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rising smoke can be seen from the beach at Saky after the airbase attack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rising smoke can be seen from the beach at Saky after the airbase attack.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He also signalled that Ukraine regards the Crimean Bridge linking the occupied peninsula with the Russian mainland as a legitimate military target. “It’s an illegal construction and the main gateway to supply the Russian army in Crimea. Such objects should be destroyed,” he said.</p> \n<p>Although Ukraine has refused to take public responsibility for the attack on the Saky airbase, it has done so in private, and the incident has come at time when a string of Russian strategic targets have been hit deep behind the frontline.</p> \n<p>On Monday there was speculation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/putin-ally-yevgeny-prigozhin-wagner-group-dying-west-russians-third-world-scum\">Yevgeny Prigozhin</a>, a Russian businessman reportedly tied to the Wagner private military company, could have been wounded or killed in a Ukrainian rocket strike in the Donbas.</p> \n<p>Photos published by a Russian journalist of the man’s meeting with Wagner mercenaries in east Ukraine made the location of the base easy to identify.

He said some unnamed European countries were “under the illusion” that the Kremlin may seek talks in good faith.</p> \n<p>“Russian ears only open up when there is a giant military bat hitting the Russian head,” he said.</p> \n<p>He praised Britain’s role in supporting Ukraine so far, which in some respects had exceeded that of the US, and said he expected strong support to continue after Boris Johnson steps down as prime minister. “You became a giant – it’s hard to go back to being a midget,” he said.</p> \n<p>Johnson had offered “personal and emotional backing” to Zelenskiy in the “darkest day of Ukrainian history”, Podolyak said.

Like Babu, I too was a chief superintendent, and then served as a deputy police and crime commissioner (PCC) before retiring in 2014. We are now suffering the consequences of the actions of the worst home secretary in living memory, Theresa May, supported by her austerity boys George Osborne and David Cameron.</p> <p>Under the guise of reform, May hollowed out the police service. The loss of tens of thousands of officers and support staff stripped the service of vast experience, well-established processes and, most importantly, time. She stripped away the ability to investigate. Those left on the frontline, with no support behind them, are simply not able to undertake what is expected of them.</p> <p>As a deputy PCC, I witnessed this destruction first-hand. On Home Office instruction, the force’s property assets were sold off and cash reserves emptied; staff contracts were terminated and officer recruitment frozen. Gone were decades of experience and opportunities for progress. Protecting the frontline became all important to keep the facade that policing remained. Officers without training found themselves expected to do everything that the previous experienced support departments had done.</p> <p>In 2010, May also removed the requirement that chief officers serve in another force prior to their appointment. This had ensured decades of innovation, sharing of good practice and new blood. The result now is that most chief constables are internal appointments, doing things they have always done, with no experience of alternative methods.

These types of experiences do not generate confidence in the police. As you say, good policing requires a community-based approach.</p> <p>The regulation of police conduct in custody suites should be handled by the community. Conduct in custody suites, where there are on average 20 deaths each year and a disproportionate number of deaths of Black, Asian and minority ethnic detainees, is almost entirely self-regulated.</p> <p>We do have a statutory scheme for regulating police conduct in custody suites: the <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2021/whats-going-on-in-police-custody\" title=\"\">independent custody visiting scheme</a>, which facilitates unannounced visits by members of the local community to check on the welfare of detainees.</p> <p>The original proponents of custody visiting saw its purpose as the deterrence of misconduct by the police. But the scheme has been designed by the Home Office and the police so as to cause the least trouble to the latter. My findings from a PhD – published in 2018 as <a href=\"https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/regulating-police-detention\" title=\"\">Regulating Police Detention</a> – were that the scheme was not independent, had no effect on police misconduct and obscured the need for reform.

Philip is a pal and we were chatting about it, trying to find a way of drawing some attention. We came up with the idea of a sculpture of Mary, who is a symbol of purity, cleanliness and fruitfulness, floating down the river.”</p> <p>The Wye passes through the so-called chicken <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/14/tesco-chicken-deal-uk-favourite-river-wye-pollution\">capital of the UK</a>, where an estimated 20 million birds are farmed in the river’s catchment.</p> <p>Excrement from the birds is rich in phosphates and is spread on the land as a fertiliser to encourage crop growth, but the land can no longer absorb the amount of manure being spread along the Wye, and the runoff is plaguing the river with what campaigners call “pea soup” algal blooms.</p> <p>River plants are being suffocated, oxygen is taken from the water and fish such as brown trout suffer, as do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/20/its-like-pea-soup-poultry-farms-turn-wye-into-wildlife-death-trap\">kingfishers and other types of bird</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"188aafa50b8bc7b72be0670e3200923a9ded8178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/188aafa50b8bc7b72be0670e3200923a9ded8178/0_0_3750_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The vessel with the Brewardine bridge in the background.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The vessel with the Brewardine bridge in the background.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The voyage began at Hay bright and early on Monday when residents carried the sculpture down to the river and scattered rose petals over it from the bridge. Chatfield and keen local canoeist, Callum Bulmer, paddled the vessel – and pushed it through the shallowest parts.</p> <p>A trumpeter and saxophonist played Bridge Over Troubled Water from a bridge as the catamaran passed, and monks from <a href=\"https://www.belmontabbey.org.uk/\">Belmont Abbey</a> performed Gregorian chants in its honour on Monday evening. During its 75-mile week-long journey to Monmouth via Hereford and Ross-on-Wye, the statue will be accompanied by riverside church bells, by canoeists and wild swimmers.</p> <p>“It’s a very British sort of adventure,” said Chatfield. On Tuesday morning, he packed smoked salmon and beef sandwiches, a brolly and the lifejacket he wore when he was a crew member of the <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12103375.three-lost-as-sail-ship-sinks/\">Maria Asumpta,</a> the sailing ship that was wrecked off the coast of Cornwall in 1995. “But the message is important. It will appeal to people in different ways. Some may see something religious in it, others will focus on the environmental aspect. It was carved out of Scandinavian redwood by hand and we’re paddling by hand. I think there’s a lot of humanity in that. It can be a lot of things to a lot of people. If nothing else, it’s a nice statue floating down the river.”</p> <p>He then pushed off from a pebbly beach in the Herefordshire village of Bredwardine in front of a curious crowd, among them Angela Vevers, a retired teacher. “It makes me feel emotional watching,” she said. It’s very important to draw attention to what is happening to this river. We need to take action when we can, not be afraid to speak out even if by speaking out you offend some people.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f35cef9fa861ee4cbf2c684040f7b1e31b06ee8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f35cef9fa861ee4cbf2c684040f7b1e31b06ee8/0_178_5371_3224/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A detail of the redwood carving of Mary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail of the redwood carving.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lyndon Eatough-Smith, the trumpeter, said he had been moved by the sight of the statue passing under the arches of the bridge at Bredwardine. “She seemed to glow.” He lives close to the Wye. “You notice when it is in flood how dark and silty it is.”</p> <p>Naiya Goodwin, 13, added: “The river must be conserved. Future generations should be able to come here and swim as we have done this summer.”</p> <p>Rachel Jenkins, a psychiatrist who has organised the itinerary for the expedition, grew up on the Wye and was horrified when she returned after time away to see how polluted it had become. “I was shocked by the collapse in fish stocks and insect life,” she said.</p> <p>“Governments and agencies don’t seem to be able to get their act together and bring the farmers who are pouring stuff into the river to account. This may be a bonkers event but it is bringing people together.

This failed regime is long past its sell-by date, says economist Jonathan Portes","byline":"Jonathan Portes","body":"<p>“You could be an H2Owner.” That was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqPr4IZziQs\">the slogan</a>, to the sound of Handel’s Water Music, of the 1989 campaign to sell shares in the 10 water and sewage companies of England and Wales – not quite as memorable as British Gas’s earlier “Tell Sid” campaign, but almost as successful. Although water privatisation was extremely unpopular, with every poll showing that a substantial majority of people were opposed to the policy, that didn’t stop more than 2.5 million people applying for shares. The offer was nearly six times oversubscribed.</p> <p>The only surprise is that it wasn’t much more. Long before anyone talked about “magic money trees”, the Thatcher government offered one: this was free money to anyone who filled in the application form. The average gain to investors on the first day of trading was 40%, and over the next two decades the privatised water companies paid more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/england-privatised-water-firms-dividends-shareholders\">£57bn in dividends</a>, at the same time as running up large amounts of debt, the interest on which is effectively paid for by customers.</p> <p>So how did we get it so wrong? I mean me, not you. I was a very junior Treasury official working on the water privatisation project, responsible for securing value for money for taxpayers and water consumers. In retrospect, we utterly failed on both counts: the shares were sold well below their value so taxpayers lost out, and consumers have paid through the nose ever since. But this is not just hindsight. We knew what was going on, because water privatisation was never really about efficiency. In the short term, the overriding political priority was a “successful” sale – one where demand for shares was high – and where those who applied and who had, from previous privatisations, already come to expect a large premium, were not disappointed.</p> <p>That meant that the Treasury’s position, when arguing for a higher share price or for tighter regulation to restrain bills in the future, was exceptionally weak. The National Audit Office <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/pubsarchive/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2018/11/Department-of-the-Environment-Sale-of-the-Water-Authorities-in-England-and-Wales.pdf\">report</a> on the sale details how the forecast proceeds fell by more than a third over just three months, costing taxpayers £6bn or so in today’s money, as the Treasury was steamrollered by the combined forces of the water companies’ management, the Department of the Environment, No 10 and a huge army of investment bankers, accountants and PR consultants.</p> <p>In our (partial) defence, we hoped that this was a one-off transfer of wealth from taxpayers and consumers to shareholders, and that over the longer term, if we got the regulatory structure right, shareholder returns would return to something more like “normal”, as the Office of Water Regulation (Ofwat) found its feet and sought to defend the interest of consumers. But as we now know, we were wrong. Just this morning, the hapless chief executive of Ofwat, David Black, was on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1559472707644936193\">the Today programme</a>, claiming that Thames Water was penalised for excessive leaks. It was left to the indefatigable <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Feargal_Sharkey/status/1559475601563688965\">Feargal Sharkey</a> to put the numbers in perspective.</p> <p>Paradoxically, while the underpricing of the water and sewage companies helped fulfil Thatcher’s short-term goal of a successful sale that was lucrative for those who bought shares, it fatally undermined her long-term goal, which was to create a “shareholding democracy” that would parallel the way right-to-buy created a “property-owning democracy”. The problem was that few small shareholders could resist the temptation to cash out their large profits.</p> <p>So, as they sold their shares, the companies were bought up, mostly by private equity, institutional investors and large infrastructure firms from abroad. These investors spotted the combination of large investment programmes, effectively guaranteed returns, and a supine and underpowered regulator that lacked access to high-powered economic consultants and lawyers. The result is that companies have been loaded with debt that has permitted huge returns for shareholders. Meanwhile, regulators have allowed returns that have been high or higher than an average risky private company, yet investors have been exposed to no more risk than government bonds. As the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2beee56a-9616-11e7-b83c-9588e51488a0\">puts it</a>, 30 years on, “water privatisation looks like little more than an organised rip-off”.</p> <p>Where next? Here it’s worth engaging with an interesting but deeply <a href=\"https://capx.co/knee-jerk-nationalisers-have-no-idea-how-the-water-industry-actually-works/\">self-contradictory defence</a> of the sector by the head of the Centre for Policy Studies, Robert Colvile. He acknowledges upfront that the “water companies are essentially contractors. They are running the water network on behalf of the state, in a fashion agreed with the state, to targets laid down by the state.”</p> <p>Indeed – so why should directors get million-pound salaries and bonuses? Why should shareholders and bondholders get returns far in excess of those we offer to investors in government debt? His answer to this is that the “single greatest justification for privatisation is competition for capital”; by which he means that if water companies were in the public sector, their investment would be in competition with other priorities, from HS2 to hospitals, and the result, inevitably, would be underinvestment.</p> <p>This is helpful for two reasons. First, it’s more credible than other defences of privatisation. It doesn’t claim some mythical gains from the magic of competitive markets. Nor is it an economic argument. From a rational perspective, there’s no reason why the government can’t invest as much as is justified by the underlying economics. Instead, Colvile’s argument is political. It implies that governments, especially but not only Conservative ones, pursue stupid, self-defeating policies for short-term political reasons, so it’s worth consumers massively overpaying the private sector to secure the level of investment that is required, even if the public sector could, in theory, do it more cheaply.</p> <p>Second, this points to a potential way forward that could avoid both the upheaval of renationalisation and the continued reliance on a failed regulatory regime. At the moment, the water companies are simply permanent regulated monopolies. But if those operating the water companies are contractors delivering a public service, why not, as regulatory expert <a href=\"http://www.dieterhelm.co.uk/natural-capital/water/who-owns-the-water-companies/\">Dieter Helm suggests</a>, treat them as such, and force them to bid competitively for the right to operate?<strong> </strong>One thing we know for sure is that the current model, where companies face public sector levels of competition and risk, and get private sector levels of profits and return, has long past its sell-by date.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and a former senior civil servant</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/live/2022/aug/16/uk-real-pay-falls-record-3-inflation-job-vacancies-decline-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T15:04:01Z","webTitle":"UK real pay falls by record 3%, as job vacancies also decline – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/aug/16/uk-real-pay-falls-record-3-inflation-job-vacancies-decline-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/aug/16/uk-real-pay-falls-record-3-inflation-job-vacancies-decline-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK real pay falls by record 3%, as job vacancies also decline – as it happened","trailText":"UK wages adjusted for inflation decline at fastest rate in 20 years, while job vacancies fall, as average annual grocery bill is set to jump by £533 to £5,128","byline":"Julia Kollewe","body":"<div id=\"block-62fbb1068f08e18003939a81\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T15:04:01.992Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Closing summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our main story today: </p> <p>The real value of UK workers’ pay continued to fall at the fastest rate for 20 years in June as wage increases were outstripped by soaring inflation amid the cost of living crisis.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/august2022\">Office for National Statistics</a> said annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, strengthened to 4.7% in the three months to June against a backdrop of low unemployment and high job vacancies.</p> <p>However, the real value of workers’ pay packets dropped by 3% – the fastest decline since comparable records began in 2001 – after taking account of its preferred measure of inflation.</p> <p>Growth in average earnings including bonuses was 5.1%, although also failed to keep pace with the soaring cost of living.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/uk-wages-in-june-fall-at-fastest-rate-for-20-years\">UK wages in June fall at fastest rate for 20 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tomorrow, we’ll be getting the latest inflation figures for July, which are expected to show a further pick-up to 9.8% from 9.4% in June, a 40-year high.

That is also in the summer period when activity could be expected to be limited- resulting in low insolvency figures.</p> <p>It would be unsurprising if the situation was worsening for businesses and this was not merely a one month blip. High fuel prices, inflation, labour shortages, post Brexit difficulties with international shipping, uncertainty in capital markets, raising interest rates and geo-political uncertainty all pose difficulties for businesses.</p> <p>The increase in overall figures was largely caused by an increase in creditors voluntary liquidations (CVLs).

In one it is a case of the glass being half full, in the other half empty, <em>writes our economics editor Larry Elliott</em>.</p> <p>If you are a government minister you take the former view. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/nadhim-zahawi\">Nadhim Zahawi</a> said the unemployment rate of 3.8% has rarely been lower in decades and the chancellor is right about that.</p> <p>What’s more, the economy continued to create net new jobs in the three months to June, with employment rising by 160,000 over the quarter. Flash estimates suggest the pattern continued into July.</p> <p>With job vacancies at near-record levels, the labour market looks in good shape to withstand the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/12/uk-economy-shrank-in-three-months-to-june\">recession the Bank of England is forecasting for the UK.</a> The economy contracted slightly in the three months to June, but demand for workers remained strong…</p> <p>A glass half empty observer sees things differently, and would point to the slower pace of employment growth, evidence that job vacancies are past their peak and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/uk-wages-in-june-fall-at-fastest-rate-for-20-years\">record gap</a> between regular pay (unadjusted for bonuses) and the rate of inflation.</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macro, says demand for labour is stabilising just as the supply of workers is picking up. The increase in the size of the workforce is being driven by immigration, he notes, with the number of non-UK nationals either working or looking for a job rising by almost 250,000 in the past year.</p> <p>The domestic labour force is also likely to increase as people try to maintain their living standards at a time when cost of living pressures are intensifying, and this will lead to higher unemployment as a weakening economy leads to fewer job opportunities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/glass-half-empty-or-full-the-two-ways-of-viewing-latest-uk-jobs-figures\">Glass half empty or full?

The current assessment index weakened to -47.6, from -45.8, the lowest level since April 2021.</p> <p>Michael Schröder, researcher at ZEW and head of the ZEW financial market survey, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ZEW economic expectations decrease again slightly in August after a sharp drop in the previous month. The financial market experts therefore expect a further decline in the already weak economic growth in Germany. </p> <p>The still high inflation rates and the expected additional costs for heating and energy lead to a decrease in profit expectations for the private consumption sector. In contrast, the expectations for the financial sector are improving due to the supposed further increase in short-term interest rates.</p> </blockquote> <p>August’s ZEW reading only adds to the bad news out of Germany, said Carsten Brzeski, gobal head of macro at ING.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The long list of risks and challenges the German economy is facing makes a recession in the second half of the year almost inevitable. It’s not the most reliable leading indicator but the most timely one. </p> <p>The reasons for yet another disappointing data release out of Germany are clear: the almost never-ending long series of risks and challenges for the German economy has become even longer in recent weeks, with two recent additions: low water levels and a gas levy.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the survey reflects financial analysts’ views, which don’t always reflect business or consumer confidence. What the ZEW index has signalled better than other indicators in the past, however, are turning points. With this in mind, today’s ZEW reading does simply not bode well.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More generally speaking, the German economy is quickly approaching a perfect storm. The war in Ukraine has probably marked the end of Germany’s very successful economic business model: importing cheap (Russian) energy and input goods, while exporting high-quality products to the world, benefitting from globalisation. </p> <p>The country is now in the middle of a complete overhaul, accelerating the green transition, restructuring supply chains, and preparing for a less globalised world. And these things come on top of well-known long-standing issues, such as a lack of digitalisation, ageing infrastructure, and an ageing society, to mention a few. </p> <p>In the coming weeks and months, these longer-term changes will be overshadowed by shorter-term problems: high inflation, possible energy supply disruptions, and ongoing supply chain frictions. In recent days, these shorter-term problems have become larger as low water levels and the new gas levy have added to inflation and recession concerns.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yesterday, the German government announced a gas levy for households and businesses, which will come into effect in October. This surcharge was set at 2.4 euro cents per kilowatt hour. Current gas prices are around 17 cents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/julianHjessop/status/1559474022815043585\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">FYI, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZEW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ZEW</a> survey index of financial market sentiment towards the German economy fell another 1.5 points in August (to -55.3), slipping further into <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/recession?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#recession</a> territory<br><br>ps. similar picture for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/euro?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#euro</a> area as a whole (down 3.8 points, to -54.9)<a href=\"https://t.co/coE4vJbXBy\">https://t.co/coE4vJbXBy</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/J1o1MD60UD\">pic.twitter.com/J1o1MD60UD</a></p>&mdash; Julian Jessop 🇬🇧 🇺🇦 (@julianHjessop) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/julianHjessop/status/1559474022815043585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 16, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62fb629b8f08b32cd2007278\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T09:32:26.906Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ryanair to add 500 flights at Stansted for October half term</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ryanair said it will add more than 500 flights at London Stansted during the October half-term school holiday, after Heathrow extended its cap on passenger numbers.</p> <p>The Dublin-based airline said the extra flights at the Essex airport will have capacity for 100,000 passengers, and its chief executive Michael O’Leary had a pop at “hopeless Heathrow”.</p> <p>Heathrow announced on Monday that the limit of 100,000 departing passengers per day it introduced in July due to staff shortages will continue until the end of October.

For example, there appears to have been an increase in the employment of young people, much of it in food and accommodation. As these workers are paid relatively poorly, an increase in their numbers relative to more highly-paid workers who are retiring or otherwise leaving the workforce can drag down median pay. Moreover, annual pay increases are measured relative to a previous period when the exit from lockdown may have distorted the data. </p> <p><strong>Some groups of workers, notably in finance and insurance, experienced much higher pay increases than the norm, while others, such as those in arts and entertainment, fared much worse.</strong> </p> <p>Nevertheless the overall picture on pay is concerning, particularly as the big anticipated increases in energy prices are yet to work through. While a summer of strikes may push up pay of some highly organised workers, particularly in the public sector, this will do nothing for the vast majority of private sector workers who will be dependent on the state of demand for their particular services. </p> <p>The vast majority, however, will on the evidence of today’s figure at least keep their jobs for the time being.

High inflation means the buying power of workers’ take-home pay has been shrinking. For many workers, their pay packet is not stretching wide enough to meet the escalating cost of seemingly everything from food, energy and petrol.

Firstly, <strong>hiring demand is clearly falling</strong>, and that’s most evident from a decline in unfilled job vacancies – a trend that’s likely to continue, according to more up-to-date online vacancy numbers. That’s not to say firms are letting staff go – redundancy levels haven’t budged from their lows over recent weeks and unemployment doesn’t appear to be rising, even if the jobs market has stopped tightening.</p> <p>The second thing that stands out is that the number of people inactive – neither employed nor actively seeking a job – increased abruptly again last month. <strong>The vast majority of the increase in inactivity we’ve seen since the pandemic began (and indeed in recent months) is linked to long-term sickness.</strong> There are now more than 300,000 extra people that fall into this category compared to pre-pandemic, and the challenges in the NHS suggest this story unfortunately isn’t going to improve very quickly.</p> <p>The final takeaway is that <strong>the number of foreign nationals working in the UK jobs market has increased noticeably this year, having fallen earlier in the pandemic, though this is almost solely driven by non-EU workers.</strong> The number of EU nationals working in the UK is down more than 6% compared to the 2019 average.</p> <p>All of this presents a complicated picture for the Bank of England. Hiring demand is fading, but at the same time the skill shortages and labour supply issues that have plagued the jobs market for several months now are showing only limited signs of improvement. Inactivity remains high, even if migration – a key source of worker shortages through the pandemic – is showing some signs of bouncing back.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T07:44:16.182Z\">at 8.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62fb447e8f08044fa2af70f1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T07:27:29.004Z\">8.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK grocery price inflation hits 11.6%, highest since 2008</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Separate figures from the data company Kantar show that grocery price inflation in the UK has hit its highest level since 2008, reaching 11.6% over the past four weeks. Butter, milk, chicken and dog food have seen the biggest price rises.</p> <p><strong>The average household’s annual grocery bill is now set to soar by £533 to £5,128, the equivalent to £10.25 every week.</strong></p> <p>Faced with soaring inflation, people are increasingly turning to own-label value products which tend to be cheaper, with sales increasing by 19.7% this month.</p> <p>The figures also showed that supermarket sales rose by 2.2% in the 12 weeks to 7 August, the fastest growth the industry has seen since April 2021. The long spell of hot weather has led to a of 23% jump in mineral water sales and an 18% rise in ice cream sales. People have also been shopping for summer holidays, with sales of clothes such as shorts, sundresses, caps and swimming costumes up by 163%.</p> <p>Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As predicted, we’ve now hit a new peak in grocery price inflation, with products like butter, milk and poultry in particular seeing some of the biggest jumps. This rise means that the average annual shop is set to increase by a staggering £533, or £10.25 every week, if consumers buy the same products as they did last year.<br><br>It’s not surprising that we’re seeing shoppers make lifestyle changes to deal with the extra demands on their household budgets. Own-label ranges are at record levels of popularity, with sales rising by 7.3% and holding 51.6% of the market compared with branded products, the biggest share we’ve ever recorded.</p> </blockquote> <p>The German discount chain Lidl remains the fastest growing grocer, with sales up by 17.9% over the latest 12 weeks, raising its market share to 7%. Boosted by the popularity of its dairy goods and bakery lines, this is its highest rate of growth since September 2017. Aldi also performed strongly, and its market share increased by 0.9 percentage points to 9.1%. Together Lidl and Aldi have gained 1.8% of British grocery sales over this period, representing a £2.3bn annual shift in spending towards the discounters.</p> <p><strong>McKevitt said supermarkets are running fewer promotions than in the past.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People are shopping around between the retailers to find the best value products, but back in 2008 there was much more of a reliance on promotions. It’s harder to hunt out these deals in 2022 – the number of products sold on promotion is at 24.7% for the four weeks to 7 August 2022, while 14 years ago it was at 30%. Instead, supermarkets are currently pointing shoppers towards their everyday low prices, value-ranges and price matches instead.<br><br>Over the past month we’ve really seen retailers expand and advertise their own value ranges across the store to reflect demand. Consumers are welcoming the different choices and options being made available to them on the shelves, with sales of own-label value products increasing by 19.7% this month. As an example, Asda’s Just Essentials line, which launched this summer, is already in 33% of its customers’ baskets.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T07:54:25.315Z\">at 8.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62fb43058f08b32cd2007171\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T07:12:39.942Z\">8.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here’s our full story on the labour market stats:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/uk-wages-in-june-fall-at-fastest-rate-for-20-years\">UK wages in June fall at fastest rate for 20 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Meanwhile, about 16,000 workers at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairways\">British Airways</a> are to receive a pay rise worth as much as 13%, reversing cuts imposed during the Covid pandemic.</strong></p> <p>Union leaders said last night the deal arose after the threat of strike action earlier this summer by check-in staff, which resulted in a pay agreement that was being extended across the workforce.</p> <p>It is understood that the deal will apply to about 16,000 non-management workers across the company, including cabin crew, engineers and baggage handlers, helping to restore pay to 2019 levels after the airline cut staff wages when the pandemic grounded flights around the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/thousands-of-british-airways-workers-to-get-pay-rise\">Thousands of British Airways workers to get pay rise of up to 13%</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62fb42b58f08e57f945550fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T07:10:17.231Z\">8.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ONS said the number of people in full-time employment has gone up.

But bonus payments have been volatile lately and the MPC prefers to look at underlying pay growth, which rose strongly. Indeed, pay growth rose rapidly in every industry except for the public sector. </p> <p>Add in employment growth of 160,000 and it paints a picture of a very tight labour market. Combine this with soaring inflation, which is likely to have reached almost 10% in July, and we think a 50bps hike next month is now more likely than not.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is evidence that the labour market has begun to cool, he noted.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The number of job vacancies dropped by 19,800 in July, the first quarterly fall since June to August 2020. Indeed, much softer economic growth in the second half of the year, due to the cost-of-living crisis, will dampen demand for labour and ease some of the tightness in the labour market. However, we think the smaller pool of available workers will keep the labour market tight for at least the next couple of years.</p> <p>The tightness in the labour market was reflected in strong nominal pay growth. However, real total pay growth, which takes inflation into account, fell by 2.5%, suggesting that the cost-of-living crisis took a bigger toll in June. <strong>Real wages are likely to fall by around 3% in 2022, which would be the deepest squeeze on spending power on record.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62fb3d3d8f08b32cd200714f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T06:47:17.272Z\">7.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation at Lancaster University, a think tank for improving work in the UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ahead of next week’s energy price cap announcement, there is more bad news for workers as real wages fell by a record 3% on the year.

Since vacancies fell to an all-time low in April to June 2020, they have increased by 945,000 in a little over two years, the ONS said.</p> <p>Employment rose 73,000 in July to a record 29.7 million people, while the employment rate for people aged 16 to 64 dipped by 0.1 percentage points to 75.5% in the quarter to June.</p> <p>The economic inactivity rate was unchanged on the quarter at 21.4%. The increase in economic inactivity – people who are neither employed nor actively seeking a job – since the start of the coronavirus pandemic had been largely driven by those who were students and the long-term sick, the ONS said. In the latest three-month period, there was an increase in the number of people who were economically inactive owing to long-term sickness, which was largely offset by a decrease in those economically inactive for “other” reasons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ONS/status/1559420039404687360\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Headline indicators for the UK labour market for April to June 2022 show that<br><br>▪️ employment was 75.5%<br>▪️ unemployment was 3.8%<br>▪️ economic inactivity was 21.4%<br><br>➡️ <a href=\"https://t.co/NCz8Ddywix\">https://t.co/NCz8Ddywix</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/3F3O5XhFnh\">pic.twitter.com/3F3O5XhFnh</a></p>&mdash; Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ONS/status/1559420039404687360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 16, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The chancellor of the exchequer, Nadhim Zahawi said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today’s stats demonstrate that the jobs market is in a strong position, with unemployment lower than at almost any point in the past 40 years – good news in what I know are difficult times for people.

The motion will echo Tarry’s backing for workers demanding pay increases in line with inflation – the line Labour sources said had contradicted Labour policy.</p> <p>Tarry said Labour should take the opportunity at conference to show solidarity with striking workers. “Labour has a huge chance to show it’s on the side of working people,” he said.</p> <p>“But by firing shadow ministers like myself for standing on picket lines, Keir Starmer is in danger of driving a wedge between Labour and the millions of working people desperate for real relief in this escalating cost of living crisis. I am proud of our party’s historic links to the trade unions – it’s time all of our party were.”</p> <p>Starmer has told his frontbenchers that the party should not join picket lines and instead should focus on calling out the government to end the disputes.</p> <p>This week, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, reiterated the party’s position, which has come under fire from its own MPs. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, caused a rift in the shadow cabinet when she joined striking members of the Communication Workers Union in her constituency.</p> <p>The stance is likely to come under further pressure this week with another series of transport strikes by the RMT on rail and underground networks.</p> <p>Momentum will ask local parties to submit motions for conference that say Labour MPs have rights to stand with striking workers on picket lines, that Labour backs an “inflation-proof pay rise” as well as public ownership of utilities and the abolition of anti-trade union laws.</p> <p>Many constituency Labour parties had already submitted motions to conference before the launch of the Momentum campaign, and more are expected to do so in September. However, sources in the campaign said the motion was expected to get widespread union backing, which increases its chances of being debated on the conference floor.</p> <p>The proposed motion will say supporting workers on picket lines “sends a strong message about what workers can expect of a future Labour government” and calls for the party to “oppose real-terms pay cuts for workers and to support wage rises in line with and in excess of the current inflation level”.</p> <p>It also calls on the party to “commit to increasing taxes on corporate profits to bring inflation down” and for Labour MPs and frontbenchers to “show solidarity with striking workers by attending picket lines and vocally supporting strikes”.</p> <p>Any motion finally put to conference is likely to be subject to negotiations to propose an acceptable composite.</p> <p>Hilary Schan, a co-chair of Momentum, said: <strong>“</strong>Despite the lack of leadership from the top, the labour movement stands united. Over the coming weeks, Momentum activists will use every lever at our disposal to ensure our party fulfils its historic mission: for Labour to stand with labour.”</p> <p>Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association, said the union welcomed the campaign. “Britain urgently needs a pay rise, a cap on prices and profits and public ownership of utilities,” he said. “That’s why no ifs, no buts, Labour must support workers on strike demanding fair wage increases which keep pace with inflation.”</p> <p>Momentum insiders concede there are likely to be far fewer leftwing conference delegates voting on behalf of Labour members at this year’s conference, giving the leadership an advantage in weeding out unpopular motions.</p> <p>The change is down to a significant number of backers of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn leaving the party and more centrist members organising to win more internal local party elections for key positions.</p> <p>The relationship between Starmer and some unions has deteriorated over the last year, particularly with Unite, led by Sharon Graham. The Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union, whose members will strike this week, are not affiliated to Labour.</p> <p>One Labour source suggested the party had been vindicated in its decision to ask MPs to keep their distance from the RMT strikes, citing the potential backlash against the party after the RMT leader, Mick Lynch, voiced scepticism about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in an interview. He said the “EU also provoked a lot of the trouble in Ukraine” during the 2014 revolution, suggesting it was “not just that this stuff has sprung from one place”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/16/ukraine-hints-it-was-behind-latest-attack-on-russian-supply-lines-in-crimea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T14:56:41Z","webTitle":"Ukraine hints it was behind latest attack on Russian supply lines in Crimea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/ukraine-hints-it-was-behind-latest-attack-on-russian-supply-lines-in-crimea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/16/ukraine-hints-it-was-behind-latest-attack-on-russian-supply-lines-in-crimea","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine hints it was behind latest attack on Russian supply lines in Crimea","trailText":"While not formally confirming responsibility for mystery strike, Kyiv officials react with glee on social media","byline":"Luke Harding in Kyiv","body":"<p>Ukraine has hinted it was behind a series of mysterious and devastating strikes in occupied Crimea that destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase.</p> \n<p>Smoke billowed into the sky near Dzhankoi, a significant railway hub in the north of the peninsula used by the Russian military to transport troops and equipment to occupied Melitopol, which Moscow seized early in its full-scale invasion.</p> \n<p>Several explosions on Tuesday appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces.</p> \n<p>According to Russian media, a further blast took place at a military airfield in the village of Hvardeyskye, not far from Crimea’s regional capital, Simferopol.

The US-supplied Himars system previously used by Ukrainian soldiers to destroy bridges across the Dnieper River has a range of about 50 miles.</p> \n<p>Officials in Kyiv have suggested the Crimea strikes may be the work of partisans emboldened by Ukraine’s recent guided missile successes, or the product of disagreements within the Russian military. Either way, Russia’s southern bases and command posts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukeharding1968/status/1559457173968764928\">look suddenly vulnerable</a>.</p> \n<p>One former senior Ukrainian official, speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Ukraine had intelligence assets working deep behind enemy lines. Russia had previously assumed Crimea was beyond Kyiv’s operational reach.</p> \n<p>A promised Ukrainian counteroffensive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/question-of-time-ukrainians-determined-win-back-south\">to recapture the occupied southern city of Kherson has yet to happen</a>. Instead, Kyiv has hit Crimea three times in a week, in clinical and flamboyant style. Russia’s logistics and weapons dumps have been badly affected.</p> \n<p>The ministry of defence in Moscow said a fire had broken out in Dzhankoi but offered no explanation as to what might have happened. “The necessary measures are being taken to eliminate the consequences of sabotage,” the ministry said. So far, Russia appears to have responded with two missiles from Belarus which landed near the city of Zhytomyr.</p> \n<p>The latest Ukrainian strikes appear to have further spooked Crimea’s population, which until recently had suffered few consequences from Vladimir Putin’s war. Queues <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhereisRussia/status/1559530161971789825\">were reported outside Simferopol train station</a> of residents seeking to flee.</p> \n<p>Senior Ukrainian government aides expressed their glee on social media. Mykailo Podolyak, an adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the apparent attack was an example of “demilitarisation in action”. He posted on Twitter: “A reminder … Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves.”</p> \n<p>Air forces spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KpsZSU/status/1559508421522722816\">joked</a> that Russia “does not comply with fire safety”.</p> \n<p>Another presidential aide, Oleksiy Arestovych, tweeted a Photoshopped picture of himself relaxing on a sun lounger similar to the ones pictured last week in Ukraine’s apparent Saky attack.

Rosatom employees are at the complex, which Ukrainian technical staff continue to operate.</p> \n<p>“All Russian troops must be immediately withdrawn from the plant and neighbouring areas without any conditions,” Zelenskiy said. More than 40 countries have urged Russia to pull out and to withdraw heavy weapons from the facility, Europe’s biggest nuclear plant.</p> \n<p>One former senior employee, speaking anonymously, said the Russians had moved large numbers of armoured vehicles into the giant turbine hall of reactor No 1.</p> \n<p>They said the Russians were shelling the plant from surrounding villages and roads. Their apparent goal was to raise the stakes in negotiations with Kyiv and to put pressure on the international community, which would force Ukrainian concessions, they suggested.</p> \n<p>“The whole situation in the plant is dangerous but still not catastrophic,” the source said. “I still believe they [the Russians] are not crazy and they will not get to the point of disaster.”</p> \n<p>Four of the reactors were no longer working and in a state of cold shutdown, they said. The other two were operational but functioning at half capacity. Rosatom staff were liaising with Russian soldiers and advising them which areas could be “safely” shelled, they alleged.</p> \n<p>Asked if Ukraine was itself shelling the plant, as Russia had claimed, the source replied: “That is like believing the sun goes around the Earth. It’s absolutely impossible. It’s our plant, our territory and our people. The Russians are responsible for this.”</p> \n<p>About 50,000 people live in Enerhodar, the city in the Zaporizhzhia region next to the nuclear complex. Russian troops keep a low profile and have hung Russian flags over its main buildings, including the former headquarters of the SBU, Ukraine’s intelligence service.</p> \n<p>Many male residents had evacuated their wives and children to safer Ukrainian-controlled territory, the source said. Schools and kindergartens were closed. Shops that were empty during the early months of the invasion now had products, available to buy with Ukrainian hryvnias, they added.</p> \n<p>Over the past 10 days, explosions have rocked Enerhodar nightly, the source continued. One man walking his dog was killed by shelling in the first district – thought to be the only local casualty in recent months.</p> \n<p>“The Russians are actively using the territory around the town. I hear all these terrible sounds at night and during the day.

A graceful spin followed by an unambiguous planting of the heed right into Joachim Andersen’s startled face, the crisp, clear connection registering a top mark of 11 on our patented Yosser Hughes-o-meter. The act would also score highly at a Highland Games, come to think of it, given Andersen crashed to the floor in the 12 o’clock position like a perfectly tossed caber.</p> \n<p>Whether this sort of pub-car-park-infused carry-on will be embraced by the more milquetoast members of the newly popular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/15/the-fiver-tuchel-conte-handshake\">Nobody Likes To See It But They Do</a> movement, who recently coalesced around the lingering handshake between Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte, a brouhaha straight out of the quainter playground playbook, remains to be seen. We’re saying it’s fine to enjoy Nunez’s Begbiesque tendencies, and consume the pantomime fun in a relaxed state of High Amusement, but then The Fiver doesn’t have any kids, we neither think of them nor care. No skin in the game, you see. Same with the climate. Lovely weather we’ve been having.

Some online bampots took the whole situation so seriously that they sent abuse and death threats to Andersen, for the crime of doing nothing other than playing Liverpool’s record signing like a fiddle. “Have some respect and stop acting tough online,” countered the Palace defender, bossing the bedroom buffoons with similar ease. Thankfully, those inside the club have responded to their player’s meltdown with the requisite dignity. Virgil van Dijk has promised to “always back” his teammate, with the caveat that “he knows it should not happen again and hopefully it will be that way”, while Jürgen Klopp added that “he was provoked but that is not how he should behave. I will talk to him tomorrow”.</p> \n<p>With Liverpool’s title bid having got off to a worryingly slow start, Manchester City and Arsenal already careering off into the distance, the Fiver would pay good money to witness Klopp handing out that particular piece of beneficial advice, which will presumably be delivered via the medium of the quiet seethe, the most volatile and potentially combustible of all the seethes. But as things stand, Núñez will be kept out of public sight, set to work on building his strength while missing home games against Bournemouth and Newcastle, as well as next Monday’s crisis-baton derby at Manchester United. That showdown remains an appointment to view despite Núñez’s absence; after all, nobody likes to see big clubs thrashing about at the bottom of the table, but etc.</p> \n<h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> \n<p>“You probably don’t want to know as much about Jack Grealish as you do, but you’re going to anyway, because you can’t get him out of your mind” – Megan Rapinoe and Ada Hegerberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/16/when-megan-rapinoe-met-ada-hegerberg-euro-2022-everyone-was-late-to-the-party\">sit down for a chin-wag</a> on all things Euro 2022, women’s football and visibility in football.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8c521207ac25dea1ba1f79e58bfa065e7f877c1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8c521207ac25dea1ba1f79e58bfa065e7f877c1/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Here you go.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Here you go.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Picture Desk</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>FIVER LETTERS</strong></h2> \n<p>“Is it me or have commentators become obsessed with spewing out endless stats throughout their commentaries?

Mar-a-Lago home","byline":"Guardian staff","body":"<p>Trevor Noah took aim at the many excuses being invented by Donald Trump and his inner circle to explain why the former president had classified documents in his possession.</p> <p>Since the FBI search on his Mar-a-Lago residence, they have been “working so hard to invent new excuses for why this crime wasn’t a crime” and so Noah went through the “fresh shipment of excuses” one by one.</p> <p>Firstly, they tried to claim that “it was homework” and that Trump was merely taking documents back to continue working on them. “Everyone does take work home sometimes but not Donald Trump!” Noah said. “The man barely took work to work.”</p> <p>He added: “It’s not taking work home with you if you no longer have the job.” Noah went on to joke: “Like if you get fired from your babysitting job but you still go pick up the kid from school, that’s just kidnapping.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

classified documents when he was president, something Noah said was “completely made-up”.</p> <p>“These people are the same people who have spent the last 15 years saying Obama is basically the devil but then when they get into trouble they say, ‘It’s fine, we just did the same thing as the devil,’” he said.</p> <p>Trump’s latest attack on Obama also referred to him with his middle name, Hussein. “Everybody knows that it’s Barack’s middle name – it doesn’t sound nefarious any more, it just sounds like you’re his mom,” he joked.</p> <p>The next excuse was that Trump had a standing order that anything he took out of the White House was automatically declassified, something that Noah said is “super convenient” as “no one has heard about this rule until he got busted”.</p> <p>He continued with an example: “I didn’t cheat on you, I’d already broken up with you in my mind on the way to their house and then on the way home I decided to give you another chance.”</p> <p>Then it was claimed that it was accidental as he packed in a rush. “He was so busy planning the coup he didn’t think about packing, is that what happened?” asked Noah.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/16/owami-davies-could-be-near-west-croydon-where-she-went-missing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK

a number of potential sightings of Davies, officers have downloaded about 50,000 hours of CCTV and have viewed about 10,000 hours.</p> <p>DCI Nigel Penney, who is leading the investigation, said: “The search to find Owami Davies continues and we are conducting searches, appeals and extensive CCTV inquiries in order to trace and find her. I would remind people that even though detectives from specialist crime are investigating, this remains a missing person inquiry.</p> <p>“We are obviously very concerned for the welfare of Owami and it is possible she is in the local area and in need of help.</p> <p>“We have reports of someone of Owami’s description being seen in the Croydon area in the days after she was last seen on CCTV and we sincerely hope to find her safe and well.”</p> <p>Davies’s mother, Nicol Davies, has made appeals for help to find her daughter.</p> <p>Previously speaking to the PA news agency, Nicol Davies said: “It is obvious that someone out there has seen something, someone out there knows something, someone out there heard something.</p> <p>“I am begging, I am asking for the public’s help, from the people, to say if you know, if you have heard or seen her, or she passed you, please speak up. All we really want is to find her, all we really need is for her to come home or to know her whereabouts.”</p> <p>Officers have arrested five people – two on suspicion of murder and three on suspicion of kidnap. The most recent arrest was that of a 27-year-old man, on suspicion of kidnap on 6 August. All those arrested have been released on bail pending further investigation.</p> <p>Penney said the investigation into the missing student had already had an extraordinary amount of support from the local community.</p> <p>He added: “We are only concerned for your welfare and want to make sure you are OK.

But, said Fuentes La Roche, this was partly because Hay 2022 was “designed with around 20% lower event capacity in mind” because plans were drawn up the autumn before, when “the possibility of social distancing and attendance caps had to be considered”.</p> <p>Lizzie Curle, festival director at Capital Crime, which will be held in September, said festivals were “dealing with the psychological impact” of coronavirus, and people’s nervousness around the illness. To mitigate this, Capital Crime will be moving from its previous venue of the Grand Connaught Rooms in London to “fully aerated” tents in Battersea Park. Although the pandemic meant Capital Crime had to take two years off from an in-person event after its inaugural festival in 2019, Curle said the crisis “forced independent businesses like Capital Crime to get creative”.</p> <p>Leah Varnell, managing director at <a href=\"https://wayswithwords.co.uk/\">Ways With Words</a> in Dartington in Devon, said that “audience numbers were low across all events” at this year’s festival, something she has put down to the cost of living crisis.</p> <p>“The mood music seemed that ‘leisure’ activities had to be jettisoned due to the already felt increased cost of fuel/food,” she said, “and there was a palpable anxiety about how much more expensive life may yet become and for how long the cost of living pressures would be felt.”</p> <p>Varnell said Ways With Words faced a “serious discussion” about “whether the long 10-day festival is viable and whether a shorter weekend festival and standalone individual events” might be a better path going forward.</p> <p>“We are by no means out of the woods,” she added. “Speaking to other organisers of literary or summer festivals, they are considering pulling festivals and actively wrestling with the issue of viability. I would expect to see a significant number cancel and perhaps close over the coming months or year.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b07b7f65c1e0ee8fc9edc35024271304983a74b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b07b7f65c1e0ee8fc9edc35024271304983a74b/0_0_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dartington Hall in Devon, where Ways With Words festival is held.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dartington Hall in Devon, where Ways With Words festival is held.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Ramsay/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Book festivals are also taking cues from other industries. At a music festival, for example, ticket holders can see multiple artists for cheaper than it would cost them to buy individual concert tickets. On top of that, festival-goers spend full days together and find a sense of community with many things going on besides the musical performances. “Music festivals, I think, are brilliant,” said Curle. “They’ve been going for years, they’ve survived. Look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/27/its-everyone-coming-back-together-why-200000-of-us-couldnt-wait-to-get-back-to-glastonbury\">the success of Glastonbury this year</a>, it’s incredible.”</p> <p>Capital Crime, like most music festivals, is selling weekend or day passes rather than ticketing each event. “I think it’s the model that creates a sense of community, and in crime fiction there is such a strong sense of community among readers,” explained Curle.</p> <p>That community is important not just for readers, but for authors as well. Writer Ayisha Malik said festivals gave her the chance to meet other authors and discover new books. “For me, the discussions that take place in green rooms and festival dinners are just as important as the ones that take place on the panels,” she said. </p> <p>Author Patrick Gale, founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/oct/20/patrick-gale-why-started-north-cornwall-book-festival\">North Cornwall book festival</a>, said he often encouraged authors to stay the weekend for the festival, so they had a chance to connect with each other. He and his colleagues try to ensure the “festival environment has lots to offer besides the events themselves”.</p> <p>Despite uncertainty, a number of new festivals have launched in 2022 often helmed by local independent bookshops. Aware that traditional middle-class, white audiences for literary festivals are ageing, many new festivals have put an emphasis on attracting younger audiences and those from marginalised communities.</p> <p>Among the new events is <a href=\"https://www.brightonbookfestival.co.uk/aboutus\">Brighton book festival</a>, which was set up by Carolynn Bain, owner of independent bookshop Afrori Books, and Ruth Wainwright.</p> <p>“When you say the word ‘literary’ to many people, they immediately have an image of an old white man in a wing-backed chair,” the pair felt. “We made a conscious decision to not even call our festival a ‘literary’ festival because we wanted to make it clear from the outset that this was a festival for everyone.”</p> <p>While the cost of living crisis has ramped up in recent months, Bain and Wainwright said “there have been people struggling to meet the cost of living for decades”.</p> <p>“There are many in Brighton for whom a book festival has always been out of reach,” they said. “We started to engage those people. The forgotten people, families and individuals missing from book festivals up and down the country.</p> <p>Traditional literary festivals, they felt, “could risk waning interest for as long as they remain inwardly focused and push an image that many cannot connect with.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/13/free-books-fest-aims-to-give-excluded-readers-their-first-journey-with-a-book\">Free Books Fest aims to give excluded readers their first ‘journey with a book’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also targeting audiences who have previously been left out of literary festivals was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/13/free-books-fest-aims-to-give-excluded-readers-their-first-journey-with-a-book\">Free Books fest</a>, set up by Sofia Akel, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.freebookscampaign.co.uk/our-story\">Free Books campaign</a>. The two-day festival, held for the first time in April in Peckham, included a series of free events and a bookshop where people could “buy” free books.</p> <p>Akel said: “Creating the Free Books festival was about bringing literature into the heart of communities that we aim to serve, so that means putting community at the centre of everything – in essence, the festival was created with accessibility at the forefront, from the location which saw us reclaiming gentrified space, to the cost of events and books, which were given entirely free.”</p> <p>Literary festivals, said Akel, “can be exclusionary across many lines, but perhaps some of the more prominent ways this manifests is in terms of class and marginalised identities”. But events like Free Books fest and pop-ups put on by publishers such as #MerkyBooks, create “open, free and accessible spaces for book lovers and creatives”.</p> <p>She warned: “If literary festivals continue to cater only to very specific demographics and refuse to open them up, then their position is clear, and we’ll continue to see amazing organisations creating new, more inclusive and transformative spaces for lovers of literature.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/16/birmingham-garden-polinations-migraton-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T14:20:34Z","webTitle":"Birmingham to bloom into ‘magical’ garden with 11-metre trees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/16/birmingham-garden-polinations-migraton-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/16/birmingham-garden-polinations-migraton-plants","fields":{"headline":"Birmingham to bloom into ‘magical’ garden with 11-metre trees","trailText":"PoliNations urban oasis will focus on city’s stories of migration using vibrancy of plants as a metaphor","byline":"Jessica Murray Midlands correspondent","body":"<p>Birmingham city centre will be transformed into a “garden of magical proportions” next month as part of a celebration of cultural diversity in the UK through horticulture.</p> <p>Eleven-metre architectural trees will take over Victoria Square, which will also be filled with thousands of plants grown by more than 1,000 local people.</p> <p>Angie Bual, the creative director of the arts group Trigger Collective, which is creating the temporary garden, called PoliNations, said it was inspired by the fact that more than 80% of plants in UK city gardens come from overseas.</p> <p>“I’ve got a horse chestnut tree at the bottom of my garden that’s been there for hundreds of years, and that’s from Turkey.

When I left the house at 6am for the early reporting shift at the local paper, you wouldn’t have known anyone had slept in my house. The bed was perfectly made, the breakfast things cleared away, the bathroom mirror wiped clean and the hairdryer placed neatly in the drawer.</p> <p>Everything in my kitchen cupboard matched: white plates, cups and saucers, side plates and mugs, along with a six-place silverware set. The only deviation from this were the tall, speckled mugs I had for special occasions.</p> <p>There was a place for everything. Then I met the man who would become my husband. I should have known he’d spell trouble for my organised life when he told me his nickname was Mr Mañana. But I didn’t, and I packed up my things and drove 200 miles down the M1 to what would become our home.</p> <p>He had lived in this house in south-west London for about five years, and he liked “stuff”. He had knick-knacks from all the places he’d visited, little artefacts from India, a brass dancer from Malaysia, a wooden statue of a woman in traditional dress from Thailand, even a didgeridoo from Australia. It was a lot. It was tat. I had books and clothes, and a pristine white china dinner set. But, I loved the man, and so we combined what we had.</p> <p>I like order, it gives me clarity and helps me work. I still needed things to be in the right place, towels folded perfectly, clothes put away, coats hung up. He didn’t care. He’d leave things on the armchair, clothes next to the laundry basket, a single spoon beside the sink. It drove me mad, but the house was big enough for us to both have it our way.</p> <p>But then we had a baby, followed by two more. Motherhood, with its constant demands, gave me a deep understanding of the unfinished task.</p> <p>I remember one child-free woman telling me how easy it was looking after her niece, and how she couldn’t understand why her sister-in-law was drowning under housework. I’d smiled weakly, too tired to explain the incremental effects of pregnancy, childbirth, babies who don’t nap, breastfeeding, entertaining them, and then staring into one’s phone after they do finally sleep in the desperate hope of finding some semblance of one’s old self.</p> <p>I know now that is all very normal, but back then I thought it was a problem. Chaos reigned as I tried and failed to hold all the organisation together.</p> <p>The children brought with them the paraphernalia of babyhood, toddlerdom and primary school age. We didn’t have any help and, in the end, I realised I had a choice to make. It was the laundry, the nice white china, or it was my dream of becoming a published writer.</p> <p>I chose myself.</p> <p>My husband seemed to be having a much better time with the boys than I was, and I took a leaf out of his book – I embraced the chaos.</p> <p>I discovered that by letting things slide, I had more time to do the things that I really wanted. The house was clean, it just didn’t have the dictatorial level of organisation that I had previously lived by. Did it really matter if the toothpaste was left out? Would the toothpaste police come and get me? </p> <p>I had thought I could do everything. That’s how I was raised, to think that women could have it all. Slowly I came to understand that the men who had appeared to “have it all” had only done so because women had been doing half the work.</p> <p>No one was asking me to do any of the things I was doing, I was demanding it of myself. So, I stopped.</p> <p>I delayed putting the laundry away, occasionally sliding into bed under the mound of washed clothes, in favour of reading a book. I stopped organising the children’s toys, I let things stay on the kitchen counter instead of desperately trying to find a home for them.</p> <p>Saying yes to the mess allowed me to leave the house without making sure everything was perfect. It meant I could set off early on a Saturday morning, sit in a coffee shop and write, while my husband handled everything at home. I learned to ignore the spoon by the sink, and he started to notice the piling laundry. It’s amazing how powerful the pull of clean boxer shorts are to a man.</p> <p>I chose to play the long game. I could either write my book, or I could clean. I came to understand that the piles of papers, books, endless pieces of Lego, would still be there, but the opportunities I was being offered might not.</p> <p>With age, I’ve learned to care less about people’s opinions on the state of my home, discovering that my best friends are the ones who see me and not the dried-on Weetabix on the dining room table. I’m hoping that playing the long game will bring the kind of success that means I can pay someone to organise my life.</p> <ul> <li><p>Saima Mir is a freelance journalist and author of the 2021 novel The Khan</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/16/country-diary-a-stony-desert-in-the-heart-of-the-peaks-and-its-thriving","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T14:00:34Z","webTitle":"Country diary: A stony desert in the heart of the Peaks – and it’s thriving","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/16/country-diary-a-stony-desert-in-the-heart-of-the-peaks-and-its-thriving","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/16/country-diary-a-stony-desert-in-the-heart-of-the-peaks-and-its-thriving","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: A stony desert in the heart of the Peaks – and it’s thriving","trailText":"<strong>Longstone Edge, Derbyshire:</strong> A lot of work has gone into making this a place of infertile land yet abundant wildlife.

Here in the heart of Derbyshire, however, they feel immensely strange and wonderful.</p> <p>I’m thrilled to imagine how its owners and the Peak District park authority worked conscientiously at the quarry infill to create this stony desert. By dint of a countryside stewardship agreement – with my kind of livestock densities, three sheep on my last visit – it has locked High Rake into a steady state of infertility and wildlife abundance.</p> <p>Tree pipits, spotted flycatchers and redstarts were feeding in its boundary of young trees. Every single one of our footsteps evicted a comical multicoloured splutter of four grasshopper species – common green, field, meadow and mottled. The flowers were teeming with bumblebees of seven kinds, and beetles and hoverflies, and 10 species of butterfly.</p> <p>Pride of place belonged to the spined mason bee, <em>Osmia spinulosa, </em> a solitary bee that may have only one other Derbyshire site. It’s small and anonymous but for six trouser-legs of downward pointing ginger hairs, lozenge-like pale-grey eyes with darker marbling and an abdomen underside of velvety orange hairs with which it sweeps up pollen.

His case sparked a social justice movement that brought together long-haired hippy students, patent-leather-handbag carrying pensioners from California’s Korean churches and the wider Asian American community.</p> <p>Lee was accused of killing Yip Yee Tak, a gang leader shot dead in San Francisco’s Chinatown. He was arrested after some spectacularly numbnuts copwork (officers initially described Lee as Chinese American; he was born in Korea). The whole of Chinatown seemed to know the police had the wrong man; nevertheless, Lee was convicted on the eyewitness testimony of white tourists.

Lee claimed self-defence.</p> <p>What makes the film so engrossing is how much attention the film-makers give to Lee’s complicated life after prison; he was acquitted in a retrial of Yip Yee Tak’s murder and released in 1983. Lee wanted a happy ending – to lead a good life, make his community and supporters proud. But he struggled to adjust, battling demons and addiction. It’s a desperately sad story. Incidentally, in 1989 Hollywood made a drama inspired by Lee’s retrial called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Believer_(1989_film)\">True Believer</a>.

This is a set about being separated from and reunited with your family on either side of a long dark night of the soul. It’s also about Hello Fresh meal-kit deliveries and fighting for the last pasta in Sainsbury’s, for which Helm devises a particularly macabre metaphor.</p> <p>You’ve got to remember that many of these shows are being performed in poorly ventilated rooms – often dank underground catacombs or hermetically sealed Portakabins, unhealthily crammed with fringe-goers. Are they wiping tears of laughter from their eyes, or cascading sweat from their brow? This was why, when in 2021 we began to realise Covid might never disappear, many of us feared the fringe might struggle ever to bounce back. It is an almighty carnival of exchanged respiratory droplets and close-quarters social gathering. In its optimum form, it is a world apart, thank God, from those peak-Covid experiences we had of sitting glumly in little isolated islands of auditorium, hazmat-sealed from our fellow theatre-goers by clinical perspex screens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"451ccdbe40fbb0f566d5fedfb427590a09bd97f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/451ccdbe40fbb0f566d5fedfb427590a09bd97f0/0_908_3755_4598/817.jpg\" alt=\"Sikisa.\" width=\"817\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A whole show about partying … Sikisa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Tauss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/10/clownts-review-three-maestros-compete-in-a-celebration-of-anarchic-hilarity\">Julia Masli is an Estonian clown-comic</a> whose lovely show Choosh! traces an eastern European migrant’s journey to the US.

But so far, the virus is being kept at bay – and spoken about, onstage, mainly in the past tense. And there’s something cathartic in that. Here was the plague that laid waste to the performing arts, that kept comics, dancers, theatre-makers off the stage, sometimes driving them to new careers entirely. Comic Lauren Pattison’s show It Is What It Is recounts her experience working on the freezer aisle at Morrison’s to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/26/standup-comedy-class-divide-coronavirus-lockdown\">keep herself afloat when live performance was verboten.</a></p> <p>“Guys, what have we all been through?!” as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/02/comedy-gold-tony-law\">Canadian goofball Tony Law</a> would have it. To watch Law crack two supremely daft visual gags about lockdown (during which he forgot how to dress and took up falconry), or to watch Parris joke about “the single-use mask that you used all year”, or Josie Long styling out lockdown in disguise as a mafia boss under house arrest, is in some small way to slay the Covid demon. We were bowed, Edinburgh comedy is here to tell us, but we weren’t beaten!</p> <p>That’s certainly the vibe at <a href=\"https://assemblyfestival.com/whats-on/reuben-kaye-the-butch-is-back\">Aussie cabaret comic Reuben Kaye</a>’s fabulous late-night show The Butch Is Back. More than any other I’ve seen so far, Kaye’s set is about celebrating that the nightmare is (however temporarily) over, that we’re back in a room together and, crucially, giving Reuben Kaye our attention. For Helm’s Zoom gigs or Hawley’s drive-in comedy, read Kaye’s tour of (he practically vomits the phrase) “regional rural Australia”, where his brand of high camp, gender-twisting comedy rather struggles to find its natural audience.</p> <p>Such was the fate of Aussie comics forbidden from leaving their country. It happened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/12/three-things-with-rhys-nicholson-you-get-to-an-age-where-meat-thermometers-become-life-changing\">Rhys Nicholson</a> in reverse: his show recounts being marooned in New Zealand as the Covid curtain fell. But it is their fate no more! And in Reuben Kaye’s hour, quite the exploding glitter-cannon of pent-up entertainment, and cheered to the rafters by its closing-time crowd, you just have to savour this contingent moment of freedom-from-Covid: laughing with strangers in a claustrophobic room, as if it were – as it used to be – the most natural thing in the world.</p> <h2>Shows to take your mind off Covid-19</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2aa0af0ae4efe06d3794c81ba8fc8b9282cc2189\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2aa0af0ae4efe06d3794c81ba8fc8b9282cc2189/0_0_3838_2693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clown on the town … Frankie Thompson: Catts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clown on the town … Frankie Thompson: Catts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/frankie-thompson-catts\">Frankie Thompson: Catts</a><br></strong>This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/07/frankie-thompson-review-all-the-feline-feels-with-a-magnetic-performer\">talk-of-the-town clown-comedy</a>, a lip-sync, found-footage oddity about our feline friends, may be about anxiety – but at least it’s not Covid anxiety.<br>• <em>Pleasance Courtyard,</em><em> until</em><em> 28 August</em><em>.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/freddie-hayes-potatohead\">Freddie Hayes: Potatohead</a><br></strong>Freddie Hayes’ solo show, directed by Sh!t Theatre, about a humble spud who dreams of becoming a standup.<br>• <em>Pleasance Courtyard, </em><em>until</em><em> 29 August</em><em>.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/mat-ewins-danger-money\">Mat Ewins: Danger Money</a><br></strong>Reliably in your handful of purely funniest shows at any fringe, Ewins’ out-there, tech-heavy comedy could banish anyone’s blues.<br>• <em>Just the Tonic @ The Caves, </em><em>until </em><em>28 August.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/alasdair-beckett-king-nevermore\">Alistair Beckett-King: Nevermore</a><br></strong>Dotty and cerebral standup about the North Sea, cave paintings and professional bubble-blowers, from a comic with no firm grounding in the real world whatsoever.<br>• <em>Pleasance Dome</em><em>, until</em><em> 29 August</em><em>.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/crizards-cowboys\">Crizards: Cowboys</a><br></strong>Skippy-aye-ay!

Hundreds of fans were there, at Metronome in Nottingham, England, singing along to their songs. All of this might seem like a standard routine for bands, but for the three members of Panchiko, it was a marvel. “Having a show where people have paid their money and they really want to see us is really nice,” says Owain Davies, 40, who plays guitar in the band.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/12/the-huge-allure-of-the-micro-festival-supernormal-krankenhaus-field-maneuvers\">‘A gambler’s wet dream and an accountant’s worst nightmare!’: the huge allure of the micro-festival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“People knew the words to the songs, which is crazy,” says Andrew Wright, 40, who also plays guitar.</p> <p>Davies remarked on the joy of making eye contact with people at a gig like that. “When you play to nobody” – which they had done – “if you make eye contact with someone in the bar, they might not want to meet your gaze,” he says with a laugh.</p> <p>The last time Panchiko played a show was 20 years prior, in 2001, at a festival in a tiny town called Sutton-in-Ashfield, and there wasn’t much meaningful eye contact. Wright said they played “to people milling about, buying a hotdog and staring at you weirdly”.</p> <p>Panchiko disbanded not long after the 2001 show. The band members spoke occasionally but didn’t see each other often – mostly at friends’ weddings – until an internet mystery unexpectedly brought them back together in 2021. “It felt quite unbelievable then,” says Wright. “And I think the following has kind of grown exponentially even since then, and it feels even more unbelievable now, to be honest.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb169ce87c4cb3d0099d4cbebd7c53162be0fbb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb169ce87c4cb3d0099d4cbebd7c53162be0fbb1/0_0_1225_815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panchiko play Metronome in Nottingham, England in December 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Panchiko play Metronome in Nottingham, England, in December 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Platinum Morley/Courtesy of Panchiko</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2016, someone found Panchiko’s 2000 CD, titled D&gt;E&gt;A&gt;T&gt;H&gt;M&gt;E&gt;T&gt;A&gt;L, at a thrift store in the UK, but was unable to track down any information about them online. They posted to 4chan asking for help. From there, the songs and the search for their provenance spread online, “on Reddit forums, Discord channels, private chats and YouTube”, according to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/akvjmb/panchiko-band-death-metal-cd\">a Vice article on the global effort to find Panchiko</a>. It took four years before Davies, Wright and Shaun Ferreday, 40, who plays bass in the band, finally learned a dedicated group of internet sleuths were desperately searching for them.</p> <p>Shocked that they suddenly had fans wanting to hear their old band, the members of Panchiko gradually began to put more songs on <a href=\"https://panchiko.bandcamp.com/\">Bandcamp</a>, then Spotify, and then later on cassettes, vinyl and, of course, CDs. They started with D&gt;E&gt;A&gt;T&gt;H&gt;M&gt;E&gt;T&gt;A&gt;L and then began adding more. Davies had been keeping much of their music on CDs and minidiscs carefully tucked away in wallets for years (despite no longer owning a CD player), but there were some songs they had recorded that none of the band members even had any more – they had to ask around to see if any friends had them. “We had all this stuff and then there was an audience,” Davies says. “And then we weren’t having to make the stuff, we were just sort of finding things and presenting it to them: ‘Here you go, here’s something we did 20 years ago.’”</p> <p>D&gt;E&gt;A&gt;T&gt;H&gt;M&gt;E&gt;T&gt;A&gt;L, despite its name, is not death metal. The Panchiko song that inspired the album title was written in the late 90s, when nu-metal was enjoying mainstream success. The song, which opens the album, is gorgeously mellow with clear trip-hop influences. Warped strings glide by easily, punctuated by chopped-up spoken word samples, a looped melody played by keyboard chimes and electronic beeps. It’s gently moody with earnest vocals, conjuring a calmer version of Broadcast or Tricky. They hoped the mismatched title would be clever. “It seemed a good idea at the time to give it a title that would be the complete opposite of what was going to come out of the speakers,” says Davies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"180d28ccc694fa0dda6485fa9d87d91693500d96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/180d28ccc694fa0dda6485fa9d87d91693500d96/0_0_1853_1552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panchiko in their early days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"838\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Panchiko in their early days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Panchiko.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the earliest versions of Panchiko songs floating around the internet were ripped from the thrift store CD, which had begun to rot. Fans liked the added sound of the distortion. Panchiko have now included those versions on re-releases of the music, under titles like D&gt;E&gt;A&gt;T&gt;H&gt;M&gt;E&gt;T&gt;A&gt;L_R&gt;O&gt;T.</p> <p>Now they’re working on recording a new album and preparing for a US tour beginning in October, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CfKTpRxs5rw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">which is already partly sold out</a>.</p> <p>A few years before Panchiko recorded their first music, a band called Visual Purple was also going through a similar process in Canton, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Like Panchiko, Visual Purple broke up not long after recording their album, and now have also found a new following decades later. One key difference: the three members of Visual Purple were only 11 years old.</p> <p>“We just did it because it was fun,” says Kevin McGorey, now 37, the lead singer and guitarist for Visual Purple. “It was just kind of innocent. There was no self-consciousness to it at all.” At the time, he wasn’t thinking that in 26 years, his tapes would be selling out in multiple rounds of releases <a href=\"https://ginkgorecords.bandcamp.com/album/visual-purple\">on Bandcamp</a>. <a href=\"https://krecs.com/\">K Records</a>, the label founded by the Beat Happening frontman, Calvin Johnson, and whose logo was tattooed on Kurt Cobain’s arm, also distributed copies of the album, which immediately sold out.</p> <p>K Records posted on Instagram about the album, “and people were kind of freaking out”, says Shelley Salant, a musician who runs <a href=\"https://ginkgorecords.bigcartel.com/about-ginkgo-records\">a record label called Ginkgo Records</a>, which released the Visual Purple tape in March of this year. “You know, I see why people are freaking out. It’s really good. And it’s kind of amazing that it was made by an 11-year-old.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4843f1680d2ade0e8eed64c7ff9e42cfafefbfe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4843f1680d2ade0e8eed64c7ff9e42cfafefbfe5/121_430_1741_1045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Visual Purple in 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visual Purple in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Kevin McGorey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time they recorded their self-titled album, McGorey had already been playing guitar for two years. In third or fourth grade, he brought a guitar to school to play Lola for his class (“I was really into the Kinks,” McGorey says). His dad, Chris McGorey, said his teacher enjoyed it so much, he brought McGorey to the teachers’ lounge to do an encore for the faculty.</p> <p>Visual Purple was McGorey’s first band, with his friends Paul Rambo on bass and Matt Carlson on drums, and their biggest gigs were at the sixth-grade talent show and their Dare graduation ceremony (a photo of the Dare show serves as the cover image for the album), where they played nearly all original songs except for Pink Floyd’s Another Brick in the Wall (which one teacher tried to cut off, due to the anti-education lyrics, McGorey’s dad says).</p> <p>“I thought they were very original,” says Chris McGorey, a musician himself. Chris McGorey, who describes himself as “the George Martin for Visual Purple”, recorded the trio in 1996 with “one decent mic” and the four-track tape recorder he had previously used for his own projects. “I was extremely impressed that they were writing all their own material,” he says. “It was a raucous, joyful sound. Kevin was belting out vocals with no filter, straight from the pre-adolescent heart!”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Before, we had no connection with the fans. We didn’t even know they were there.</p> <footer> <cite>Shaun Ferreday</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2016, McGorey’s dad dug out the tapes (“I’m one of those people who keeps everything, in the hope that it might be able to be unleashed upon the world, at some point in time,” he says) and gave them to him. Then in 2020, during the pandemic, McGorey decided to put the songs on YouTube. Salant, a friend of McGorey’s, heard them and had the idea to release them as cassettes. There was no Visual Purple reunion gig tied to the release (McGorey still plays music professionally in Detroit, but Rambo and Carlson have moved away), but internet buzz spread, including a recommendation by <a href=\"http://www.cryptophasia.online/\">Cryptophasia</a>, a music newsletter written by Jenn and Liz Pelly, twin sisters and music journalists in New York City. The Pellys described Visual Purple’s music as “outrageously sick raw noise pop”.</p> <p>Visual Purple’s name and album title are a reference to Bill Nye the Science Guy, and the song titles are straightforward topics: Ghost, Sneakers, Fur Coat. On Glue, a wistful pop song reminiscent of Guided By Voices (a fact observed on the Bandcamp page description), McGorey describes a predicament: “I was just fooling around, but now I’m stuck with this glue / Glue is all over me / Glue get it off of me.” Noise, a song about the band itself and an irritated neighbor, starts strong with an intriguing melody on slightly warped guitar, before picking up speed with swishy drums and layers of grungy guitars. It sounds like it could fit comfortably on C86, the 1986 NME compilation that represented a pivotal moment in indie music.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YEDDGpFwGQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8YEDDGpFwGQ?wmode=opaque&list=PLU27pPiSh6wb2nVV1cefAp3xIxOAfcGl9\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Visual Purple’s album is slated for another cassette drop and may eventually see a vinyl release as well. But there’s no additional material coming – this was their one and only recording. “It’s not like they have another secret album,” Salant says. But McGorey has been playing music continuously in the decades since Visual Purple disbanded, most recently releasing songs under the name Vinny Moonshine, on a label called <a href=\"https://metaphysicalpowers.bandcamp.com/\">Metaphysical Powers</a>. And he’s gained inspiration for his current music career from releasing his oldest material. “People’s reactions to it seem to be genuine joy, so I like that,” McGorey says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecb8d394cd0ec40a6fb08421b808127cf3e1cf99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecb8d394cd0ec40a6fb08421b808127cf3e1cf99/0_40_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vinny Moonshine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vinny Moonshine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Rapnicki</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the members of Panchiko, there’s a similar sense of revelation that has come from connecting with fans in a way that would not have been possible when their music was originally released. “I think we’ve got more of a connection with the fans,” says Ferreday. “Before, we had no connection with the fans. We didn’t even know they were there. Because we know they’re there and we talk to them all the time, you care more.”</p> <p>“It’s a position that loads of people in bands would kill to be in,” says Wright. “And we don’t want to mess it up.”</p> <p>“We still realize it’s a privilege,” says Davies. “And we owe so much to these people who invest their time in liking what we do.”</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 16 August 2022 to correct a name that was misspelled. </p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/16/alex-aster-interview-lightlark-booktok-tiktok","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T13:32:30Z","webTitle":"‘More zeros than I’ve seen in my life’: the author who got a six-figure deal via ‘BookTok’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/16/alex-aster-interview-lightlark-booktok-tiktok","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/16/alex-aster-interview-lightlark-booktok-tiktok","fields":{"headline":"‘More zeros than I’ve seen in my life’: the author who got a six-figure deal via ‘BookTok’","trailText":"After she was dropped by her agent, Alex Aster turned to a books-obsessed corner of TikTok to gauge interest in her YA novel … and now it’s one of the most eagerly anticipated releases of the year","byline":"Alison Flood","body":"<p>Having finally published her first novel, Alex Aster was feeling disheartened. The book had tanked during the pandemic and she had been dropped by her literary agent. Then, on 13 March 2021, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@alex.aster/video/6939242279056035077\">she decided to take to TikTok, asking her followers</a> if they would: “read a book about a cursed island that only appears once every 100 years to host a game that gives the six rulers of the realm a chance to break their curses.” One of the rulers must die, the short video revealed, “even as love complicates everything” for the heroine, Isla Crown.</p> <p>Aster didn’t expect much, especially when she checked in a few hours later to see that her post had only clocked up about 1,000 views. Maybe the books world was right, she thought. Maybe there wasn’t a market for Lightlark, a young adult story she had been writing and rewriting for years, to no interest from publishers. The next day, however, she woke up to see her video had been viewed more than a million times. A week later, Lightlark had gone to auction and she had a six-figure deal with Amulet Books. Last month, Universal preemptively bought the film rights for, in her words, “more zeros than I’ve seen in my life”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I got lucky in how I pitched it. The TikTok algorithm is so finicky</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It hits shelves on 23 August, and BookTok – a thriving sub-community of avid readers on TikTok – is going crazy for this story which hits the sweet spot between the deadly competition of The Hunger Games, and the “romantasy” of Sarah J Maas’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/07/a-court-of-thorns-and-roses-sarah-j-maas-review\">A Court of Thorns and Roses</a>. It is gloriously overdramatic and passionate, just how BookTok likes it. Isla’s first meeting with Grim, the Nightshade ruler with a “cruelly cut face” and a voice “dark and striking as midnight” finds his “eyes all over her” and her skin feeling “inexplicably electric”. There are fireworks ahead for sure, and teen readers will love Aster’s intricate details about the different realms that make up the world – Wildling, Starling, Moonling, Skyling, Sunling and Nightshade. Isla, we learn, is a Wildling – one of a race that has “always been proud of their bodies … loved wildly, lived freely, and fought fiercely”. Their curse is an unfortunate one – to kill anyone they fall in love with – and to “live exclusively on human hearts”.</p> <p>“If you’re even glancing at TikTok, it’s easy to see that Lightlark is one of the most anticipated new books,” says Florentyna Martin, Waterstones’ head of children’s books. “Booksellers and reviewers are already enthusing about this new magical world.”</p> <p>“Ever since I saw Alex’s video on TikTok describing the plot, I knew that it would be the book for me and it is one of my most anticipated fantasy releases for this year,” says Emily Russell, who has 2.3m likes for her <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@emilymiahreads\">@emilymiahreads</a> account. Kate Wilson, who has 13.7m likes for her <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@kateslibrary?lang=en\">@kateslibrary</a> TikTok account, agrees. “I’ve seen a lot about it on BookTok already and think it has the potential to get really big on there – it looks like it has the perfect fantasy-to-romance ratio that people are looking for.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"327690ba77372fb34740fa595cf389333b664c98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/327690ba77372fb34740fa595cf389333b664c98/0_275_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aster: ‘I didn’t have a plan.

None sold. Her sixth book, Curse of the Night Witch, inspired by the Latin American myths she was told as a child by her Colombian grandmother, found a publisher but not huge sales. Her agent, frustrated with Aster’s focus on rewriting versions of Lightlark, dropped her.</p> <p>“I was back to square one again,” Aster says. “So I wrote Lightlark, this book that everyone told me wouldn’t break through in the saturated market. I wrote the book that I wanted to read, with everything I loved in there.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e18fe83493985ce2d5cf6f8f66465e1cb7c8de3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e18fe83493985ce2d5cf6f8f66465e1cb7c8de3a/0_0_1650_2475/667.jpg\" alt=\"‘Love complicates everything’ … the cover of Lightlark.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The perfect fantasy-to-romance ratio’ … the cover of Lightlark, as chosen by TikTok</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Publishers, again, said “no thanks”. “People were saying: ‘Oh, I really like it. But I don’t think it will sell,’” says Aster, who believes the book industry was slow to wake up to the power of BookTok. (No longer: every YA publisher worth its salt is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/08/lockdown-exploded-tiktok-books-revolution-booktok\">now working with “book influencers”</a> on the platform, after watching them send sales through the roof). “There’s such a big disconnect between the people making decisions in boardrooms and the readers who are hungry for these types of books,” Aster says.</p> <p>Aster already had a small name for herself on TikTok; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr334nExWg8\">she wrote the song Divine</a>, which took off on the platform during lockdown. But she had no real knowledge of BookTok when she posted her video about Lightlark. “I got lucky in how I pitched it,” she says. “TikTok is so finicky. If I hadn’t described it the right way, if I hadn’t picked the right sound … The way the algorithm works is if the first few people that see it like and share it, then it’s going to show it to more and more people.

And they’re like: ‘Oh, I can just make a video and get a six-figure deal.’ I wish it was like that. I wish it had been that easy,” she says. For Aster, BookTok is about the BookTokers – the reviewers who read a book, love it and send it viral – such as <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thecalvinbooks?lang=en\">@thecalvinbooks</a>; <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@moongirlreads_\">@moongirlreads</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@aymansbooks?lang=en\">@aymansbooks</a>. The latter is the handle of Ayman Chaudhary, who is particularly excited about Lightlark. “Alex perfectly laces together an intricate world [while] also giving us a heart-wrenching romance,” she says.</p> <p>Those TikTokers lured in by Aster’s storyline last March have followed her journey to a book deal, a movie deal and a recent unveiling of the book’s jacket in New York’s Times Square – a jacket voted on by BookTok itself. “I told my publisher I’m so grateful to BookTok. They are the reason I got this book deal and I wanted them to choose the cover,” Aster says. “I haven’t tried to mask the fact that I failed for so long. I didn’t have a plan. I just wanted to be a part of this community. And it led to big moments.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/16/crying-ceo-sacked-two-people-selfie-linkedin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T13:29:22Z","webTitle":"The ‘crying CEO’ sacked two people then posted a weeping selfie on LinkedIn.

The 32-year-old<strong> </strong>CEO of HyperSocial, a marketing agency, had just sacked two of his 17 employees and needed to choose between quietly helping the newly unemployed pair move on with their lives and turning their misfortune into self-aggrandising online content.</p> <p>You guessed it: Wallake chose option two. You see, no one really thinks about CEOs’ feelings. Wallake wanted everyone to know that chief executives are humans, too. They get hurt and feel pain just like mere mortals do. So, he snapped a selfie of himself crying and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bradenwallake_this-will-be-the-most-vulnerable-thing-ill-activity-6962886723617910784-_L4w/?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web\">posted it on LinkedIn</a>, along with an inspirational message about what a great guy he was.</p> <p>“This will be the most vulnerable thing I’ll ever share,” he wrote. “Days like today, I wish I was a business owner that was only money driven and didn’t care about who he hurt along the way. But I’m not. So, I just want people to see, that not every CEO out there is cold-hearted and doesn’t care when he/she have to lay people off.” Then he clicked “post” and sat back to watch the likes roll in.</p> <p>Quite a few likes did come in – but not at the same pace as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ceo-hypersocial-linkedin-crying-selfie-says-good-came-from-it-2022-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\">the backlash</a>. Rather than being floored by how “vulnerable” Wallake had been, the consensus seemed to be that the guy was a tone-deaf narcissist. The post went viral and the “crying CEO” <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/08/11/linkedin-users-mock-crying-selfie-ceo-who-fired-workers/\">quickly became a meme</a>.</p> <p>Internet detectives started mining Wallake’s online history and discovered that he had donated to the World Wildlife Fund in July to financially support a sea otter.

In recent years, however, it has become a cesspit of toxic positivity and a temple to cringe. There is a subreddit called <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/\">LinkedInLunatics</a> that catalogues “insufferable LinkedIn content”.</p> <p>It is not enough for people to be CEOs, entrepreneurs or middle managers any more; they also have to be inspirational thought-leaders. LinkedIn is now a self-help blogging platform for business types. As an aside, they all seem to be incapable of writing properly, using single-sentence paragraphs instead. This form of writing has been called “<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/why-are-these-posts-taking-over-your-linkedin-feed-because\">broetry</a>” – and it is brery brirritating.</p> <p>Amid all the cringe, there is a silver lining. Once upon a time, a man would be mercilessly mocked for crying in public. Wallake, however, was mocked mainly for the performative nature of his crying, rather than the crying itself.</p> <p>It has become a lot more acceptable for men to express emotion in public. Indeed, crying seems to be all the rage among male leaders – a quick way to express authenticity and prove you are not an unfeeling robot.</p> <p>Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York, shed tears during some of his daily <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/us/politics/crying-politicians-leadership.html\">Covid briefings</a>. <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-19/garcetti-state-of-city-la-address-coronavirus\">So did Eric Garcetti</a>, the mayor of Los Angeles.

Until you get shot in the head","byline":"Tom Regan","body":"<p>Skating of all kinds became a whole thing during the Covid lockdowns. As the pandemic put a pause on indoor socialising, parks became the new pubs – and what better way to escape shut-in misery than gliding around the green? In south London at least, it’s a passion that’s endured: every Sunday without fail, I’m greeted by a gaggle of boombox-toting skaters. Yet for game developer Roll7, this lockdown obsession seemingly took a less wholesome turn. If you ever thought that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater would be more thrilling as a blood-drenched deathmatch, then <em>this </em>is your game.</p> <p>Channelling the smudged colour palette of 80s comic books and the post-apocalyptic bloodlust of Mad Max, Rollerdrome is a giddying blend of murder and momentum. As in February’s brilliant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/04/olliolli-world-review-vibey-skater-game-roll7\">OlliOlli World</a>, from the same developer, forward motion feels sublime: performing mid-air grabs atop a ramp before dropping into a polished, gym-like court, the fluidity of your flow is entrancing. And then some other deadly derby competitor shoots you in the head.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXeOF_8ROlE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wXeOF_8ROlE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The premise is that in the near-future – 2030, to be exact – the world has gone to pot (hard to believe, I know), and with the suffering populace in desperate need of distraction, a new televised bloodsport arises in the form of the Rollerdrome. You’ll trick and twirl to avoid a hail of gunfire from a small army of AI enemies, hitting back with your own bountiful barrage of bullets. In a nice touch, performing tricks reloads your weapons, ensuring that you flip, grind and grab across each arena like your life depends on it. And what would a dual-pistol shooter be without bullet time? Rebranded here as Reflex time, the ability to slow the world to a crawl allows the ponytailed protagonist to rain down death mid backflip, with elegance that Max Payne could only dream of.</p> <p>Like all sports, your pregame mindset is crucial to on-court performance. Downtime between murder matches sees you roaming a suitably grimy locker room before tournament brackets, picking up everything from gameplay tips to snippets of story. You can even mess with your competition, should you choose, removing their crucial pre-game reminder notes, going through lockers and just generally being a bad sport. The paper-thin narrative does enough to justify the premise, but your real motivation is smashing that scoreboard.</p> <p>While simply surviving each arena unlocks the next stage to skate across, advancing to the next bracket requires a bit more graft. In a nod to the birdman Tony Hawk himself, level-specific challenges range from achieving a high score to killing goons in a specific way, or performing a gnarly trick off a specific part of the stage. Initially, Rollerdrome’s insistence on locking your progress behind these challenges feels like the right call, as it forces you to really master the fast-paced mechanics. By hour 10, though, forced replays of the same levels have become frustrating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e7d3da12db9eca6182d576b089f3b0e3867a952\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e7d3da12db9eca6182d576b089f3b0e3867a952/90_63_1605_963/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rollerdrome video game screenshot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A giddy gameplay trance … Rollerdrome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roll7</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As you edge your way closer to the finals, increasingly familiar-feeling arenas give way to the occasional behemoth-esque boss battle. In a nod to PS2 classic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/feb/06/shadow-of-the-colossus-review-sony-japan-studio-bigpoint-playstation-4\">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, you mount these mechanical monstrosities in order to take them out. As you wheel and weave your way through a sea of bullets and laser fire, a metallic arachnid’s legs become ramps, propelling you above its steel pincers until you can pump its weak spots full of lead.</p> <p>But by the time you hit the third of Rollerdrome’s four cups, courses veer from challenging to downright brutal. Forced to replay these relentless and thematically repetitive levels, that early motivating drive towards mastery is soon replaced by frustration.</p> <p>Rollerdrome is about getting lost in a giddy gameplay trance. As the hypnotic electro pulsed with each turn of the half-pipe and slow-mo bullets tapered out of a well-timed flip, I was grinning like a goon. Yet where OlliOlli World offered a bountiful buffet of levels to grind across, Rollerdrome’s stingy stage selection left me hungry. Much like a lockdown fad, Rollerdrome offers a thrilling way to pass an afternoon or few, but once you’ve got your kicks, only the dedicated will still be donning their skates.</p> <p>• Rollerdrome is released on 16 August; £24.99</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/16/why-arent-banks-passing-on-interest-rate-rises-to-customers","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T12:59:07Z","webTitle":"Why aren’t banks passing on interest rate rises to customers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/why-arent-banks-passing-on-interest-rate-rises-to-customers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/16/why-arent-banks-passing-on-interest-rate-rises-to-customers","fields":{"headline":"Why aren’t banks passing on interest rate rises to customers?","trailText":"Rates have gone up six consecutive times, yet very few savers are benefiting, researchers find","byline":"Rupert Jones","body":"<p>Millions of people are being short-changed on savings rates, with banks and building societies failing to pass on this month’s 0.5 percentage point interest rate rise, research has claimed.</p> <h2>What’s happened?</h2> <p>On 4 August, the Bank of England pushed up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-1-point-75-per-cent-in-biggest-hike-in-27-years\">interest rates by 0.5 percentage</a> points to 1.75% as the UK battles to prevent inflation running out of control. It was the sixth successive interest rate hike.</p> <p>In theory this is good news for the UK’s army of savers, who were the losers from years of interest rate cuts. Many will have been expecting to see the rates on their savings accounts climb – but the reality has all too often been very different.</p> <h2>So what’s the bad news?</h2> <p>Research issued on Tuesday found that as of 15 August, Britain’s banks and building societies had passed on the full 0.5 percentage point increase to just two out of 233 easy access savings accounts.</p> <p>As of that date, the only provider to pass on all of the increase was the West Brom building society, according to the study by the website Investing Reviews.</p> <p>Providers that had given their accounts some sort of boost – that is, they had passed on part of the increase – included Zopa, Tesco Bank, Atom Bank, Tandem Bank, Skipton building society and Gatehouse Bank, it said.</p> <p>In all, only 26 easy access accounts (11.2%) had seen any increase at all in the rate paid following the 4 August rise, the study said.</p> <h2>Do banks have to pass on interest rate rises?</h2> <p>Account providers are at liberty to do what they want with savings rates unfortunately. They might decide to pass on all, some or none of an interest rate rise (or reduction).</p> <p>One sliver of good news is that sometimes banks will wait a while before making changes to savings rates – maybe several weeks or even longer. So – taking a glass-half-full view – just because your account has not as of today had its rate increased does not mean you will not get an increase.</p> <p>One expert said: “To be fair, it is a little early to see savings changes … Some brands may only now be catching up to prior base rate rises.”</p> <p>Earlier this year, Rachel Springall at the financial data firm Moneyfacts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/what-does-uk-interest-rate-rise-mean-savers-borrowers-mortgages-houses\">said</a>: “As we have seen time and time again, there is no guarantee savings providers will boost their rates because of a Bank of England rate rise and, even if they do, it could take a few months to trickle through to customers.”</p> <p>On 23 January this year, more than five weeks after the Bank of England lifted the base rate from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/16/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-025\" title=\"\">0.1% to 0.25%</a>, the Guardian reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/23/hopes-shattered-as-banks-fail-to-pass-on-interest-rate-rise\">only four financial firms</a> had passed on the full rise to all, or nearly all, of their variable-rate savings account customers.</p> <h2>So some people have benefited from savings rate increases?</h2> <p>Overall, <a href=\"https://moneyfacts.co.uk/news/savings/all-average-savings-rates-rise-isas-see-notable-increases/\">according to figures</a> issued on Monday by Moneyfacts, the average easy access rate has risen to 0.7% and stands at its highest point in nine years. In August last year the average was 0.18%.</p> <h2>So why aren’t providers increasing savings rates?</h2> <p>Some experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/23/hopes-shattered-as-banks-fail-to-pass-on-interest-rate-rise\">have previously argued</a> that most of the big banks are uninterested in attracting savers’ deposits.</p> <p>Some will say the banks are relying on customer apathy. Some customers will quit in search of a better deal, if they can find one, but many others will not notice the change or will not get around to moving their money.</p> <h2>But rising interest rates are obviously good news for savers?</h2> <p>Yes of course, but unfortunately, even if the latest increase is passed on in full, rising inflation – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/uk-inflation-rise-petrol-diesel-prices\">currently 9.4%</a> and set to go higher – is eroding the value of people’s nest-egg cash.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/16/green-tories-pm-insulate-homes-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-liz-truss","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T12:44:33Z","webTitle":"Green Tories call for next PM to take urgent action to insulate homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/16/green-tories-pm-insulate-homes-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-liz-truss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/16/green-tories-pm-insulate-homes-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-liz-truss","fields":{"headline":"Green Tories call for next PM to take urgent action to insulate homes","trailText":"Fightback comes amid concerns race to replace Boris Johnson could lead to rollback of green policies","byline":"Peter Walker Political correspondent","body":"<p>A leading group representing green-minded Conservatives has called for the new prime minister to take urgent action to insulate more homes and scale up the installation of heat pumps to help poorer households with energy bills.</p> <p>The Conservative Environment Network (CEN), which has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/29/tory-mps-conservative-environment-network-green-net-zero\">support of 133 Tory MPs</a>, half the backbench parliamentary party, said its plan could be rolled out in parallel with measures to directly help with this winter’s fuel costs and would help move the UK towards its net zero goals, as well as saving people money.</p> <p>The CEN’s intervention marks the latest stage in a fightback by environmental Tories amid signs the race to replace Boris Johnson could lead to green measures being rolled back, and greater weight given to the voices of MPs opposed to such policies.</p> <p>Liz Truss, the clear favourite to become the next prime minister, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/1557798867940397056\">has criticised</a> the installation of solar farms on formerly agricultural land, and says she supports efforts to extract shale gas by fracking in areas where it has local support.</p> <p>Her rival in the contest, Rishi Sunak, has pledged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/20/rishi-sunak-accused-economic-illiteracy-pledge-block-onshore-windfarms\">tighten a de facto ban</a> on planning permission for new onshore wind schemes.</p> <p>The push against green measures has been led by Tory MPs and peers from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/08/tories-fighting-net-zero-plans-are-dragging-climate-into-new-culture-war-experts-say\">the Net Zero Scrutiny Group</a>, a relatively new body that argues against many environmental policies on the basis of the cost of living and energy security.</p> <p>The CEN’s proposals, billed by the organisation as “practical, industry-led solutions that the government could swiftly introduce”, would cost a total of £9bn over the next eight years, it said, notably less than what had already been committed to assist with energy bills.</p> <p>This would include a rapid expansion of an energy industry-led scheme to insulate fuel-poor homes, to do this for 500,000 households this winter, and a million a year by April 2023, including a commitment to long-term finance for the programme.</p> <p>The CEN said there were still 7m UK homes lacking easy-to-install measures, such as loft or cavity wall insulation, that could save people living in a typical semi-detached home about £500 a year on their bills.</p> <p>Another element would be a big expansion of a scheme to replace gas boilers with heat pumps, installing 775,000 a year by 2025, rather than the planned 90,000. This saves households an average of £225 a year and cuts their gas usage by 80%.</p> <p>A final recommendation would be for energy firms to be required to contact customers with advice on how to turn down the so-called flow temperature of gas boilers so they run more efficiently, with many running at unnecessarily high temperatures, wasting gas and increasing bills without any extra warmth.</p> <p>Philip Dunne, the MP for Ludlow and a supporter of the CEN, said there was a need for “urgent action to help households this winter. If we act decisively now, we can insulate hundreds of thousands of fuel-poor homes to lower energy bills permanently,” he said.</p> <p>“Financial support is only a one-year fix for this winter. Without a new national programme starting to fix the UK’s 19m energy-inefficient homes, families would be left exposed for longer and the taxpayer landed with a larger bill.</p> <p>“I urge the next prime minister to consider these practical, industry-led proposals to combat the gas crisis this winter.”</p> <p>While much of the focus in the Tory leadership race has been on energy bills and the cost of living, the suite of policies that will be implemented remain relatively vague.</p> <p>Sunak has talked in general terms about wanting more insulation, and has proposed measures to help households with bills, including a cut to VAT. Truss has said her “first port of call” would be tax cuts but has not ruled out extra help.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/aug/16/jeremy-paxman-step-down-university-challenge-host","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T12:43:11Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Paxman to step down as University Challenge host","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/16/jeremy-paxman-step-down-university-challenge-host","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/aug/16/jeremy-paxman-step-down-university-challenge-host","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Paxman to step down as University Challenge host","trailText":"Presenter was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease last year and has hosted the show for 28 years","byline":"Jim Waterson Media editor","body":"<p>Jeremy Paxman is stepping down as the presenter of University Challenge after 28 years.</p> \n<p>He has presented the quizshow since 1994 and will film his last series this autumn, with viewers seeing the final episodes next summer.</p> \n<p>Paxman, 72, announced last year that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, and he has spoken openly about how he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/21/jeremy-paxman-diagnosed-with-parkinsons-disease\">balanced his work life</a> with treatment for the illness.

Globally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">83% of farmland</a> is taken up by livestock, and many scientists and campaigners are arguing for an overhaul of meat and dairy consumption to free up more land for nature and reduce emissions. </p> <p><strong>What’s the trend on meat consumption in the UK?</strong></p> <p>There appears to be a slight downward trend in meat-eating but figures are still high. A report from last year found Britons have reduced meat consumption by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/08/cuts-uk-meat-consumption-doubled-health-researchers-food#:~:text=Britons%20have%20cut%20their%20meat,food%20strategy%20earlier%20this%20year.\">17% in the past decade</a> (although the authors note this study is based on how much people say they’re eating, and other data suggests people eat more meat than they think they do). The availability of plant-based alternatives – which have gone from being niche to widely available in most large supermarkets and restaurants – has driven this decline. This is a big win for the environment. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/07/plant-based-meat-by-far-the-best-climate-investment-report-finds\">report from</a> Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found investing in plant-based alternatives is one of the best way to cut emissions. From a health point of view, these highly processed alternatives could come with their own problems. Prof Lindsay Jaacks, personal chair of global health and nutrition at the University of Edinburgh, likens them to “nicotine patches”.</p> <p>There is no other country with similar levels of meat consumption to the UK which has successfully cut down. Across Europe, the politics of meat consumption is becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/21/the-greens-want-to-take-our-meat-away-europeans-go-to-war-over-their-dinner\">increasingly heated</a>, and globally, meat consumption is <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-meat-production\">higher than ever</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d98d6eec6b1132277dc101b4c88124f331756004\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d98d6eec6b1132277dc101b4c88124f331756004/0_74_4958_2975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peta Climate Change Protest, London, 7 Aug 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Peta climate change protest in London on 7 August 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Can’t you just provide people with information on the impacts of meat?</strong></p> <p>Not really. Dietary guidelines, for example from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/new-plant-focused-diet-would-transform-planets-future-say-scientists\">Lancet report, </a>do not change individual behaviour, <a href=\"https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-018-0729-6\">studies have shown</a>. This is because of the “meat paradox” – people understand and oppose what meat consumption does to the environment (and their health) but it doesn’t seem to impact how much they actually eat.</p> <p>Generally, food choices are intuitive and people are not thinking about the climate crisis when browsing supermarket shelves. Dr Filippo Bianchi, who researched meat consumption while at the University of Oxford, described food choice as being governed by our impulsive “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-encourage-people-to-reduce-their-meat-intake-without-them-even-realising-105762\">Homer Simpson brain</a>”, not our rational “Einstein brain system”.</p> <p><strong>What is </strong><strong>an effective way of getting people to cut down on meat?</strong></p> <p>A meat tax,<strong> </strong>or “sin taxes” would be <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00482-2\">most effective</a> yet almost all government subsidies promote meat consumption. In the UK, the best evidence of how this might work is the tax on the <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/soft-drinks-levy/#:~:text=We%20find%20that%20the%20sugar,kilo%20sugar%20tax%20would%20provide.\">soft drinks industry</a>. It mainly involved manufacturers reformulating products, and didn’t put the burden on the consumer. A meat tax would mainly incentivise manufacturers to put less meat in products (eg, a sausage might have 60% meat instead of 70%) but there is no government appetite for it. </p> <p>There are many reasons for this, including lobbying from interest groups saying it would damage the domestic farming sector. Neoliberal governments also have a tendency to believe the market will internalise health and environmental costs if better information is provided, and the government does not want to appear to be a “nanny state”, says Dominic Moran, professor of agricultural and resource economics from the University of Edinburgh. There is also concern the burden of taxes falls disproportionately on lower income groups. “But this isn’t inevitable,” says Moran.</p> <p><strong>What about cutting government subsidies for meat production?</strong></p> <p>Ending subsidies that support meat production could have a similar impact as a meat tax on the end product. There was a successful government-led initiative in Finland in the 1970s called the <a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/stare-hegsted-north-karelia-heart-disease/\">North Karelia Project</a>, which involved ending dairy subsidies and working with farmers to grow berries and rapeseed instead. The UK is now moving away from subsidising farmers to rear animals to creating space for nature on farms. However, there is a risk that we just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/22/put-out-to-pasture-britains-farmers-fear-surge-of-imports-from-australia\">import cheaper meat</a> from abroad to make up for it.</p> <p><strong>What about regulating adverts, similar to the tobacco industry?</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/26/uk-miss-net-zero-target-eco-friendly-farming-elms-scheme-delayed-report-aoe\">UK could miss net zero target if eco-friendly farming scheme is delayed, warns report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you make it easier for companies to advertise products that are better for the environment, you expose fewer people to products which are bad for the environment. Good in theory, but it would be really hard to work out what should be regulated because unlike tobacco, eating meat is not all bad for people, it’s just the quantity it is being eaten in. It would also be hard to know what needs to be regulated – would it just be processed red meat, or chicken too? What about organic?</p> <p><strong>What about labelling?</strong></p> <p>A <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013916521995473\">paper reviewing</a> environmental labels found they did encourage people to purchase more sustainable products. “Until eco-labels are mandatory, I don’t think we’ll see meaningful shifts in the carbon footprint of purchases in the UK,” says Jaacks. It is traditionally thought of as a consumer-facing intervention, but the biggest impact is that it’s likely to push manufacturers to make healthier food. Like regulating adverts, it would be difficult to work out what would be considered “good” and “bad” – for example is all red meat bad? Or do we differentiate between types of production of red meat?</p> <p><strong>How could supermarkets and restaurants help?</strong></p> <p>The way food is presented in supermarkets and restaurants can shift consumption at scale, studies have shown. Supermarkets could remove meat from the impulse buy section at the end (for example, replace meat-based with plant-based) and stop meat promotion deals. Keeping meat out of sight – such as putting it on lower shelves – also seems to work, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(18)30188-8/fulltext\">studies suggest</a>. Making sausages on supermarket shelves smaller caused a 13% drop in meaty purchases, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329317302549\">one study</a> found.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a6fe35df7cc189e509cae3786b64df0ce12981f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a6fe35df7cc189e509cae3786b64df0ce12981f/0_131_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A plant-based vegan burger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A plant-based vegan burger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Putting less meat on menus also means people eat less of it. A <a href=\"https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-017-0496-9\">study found</a> that reducing the amount of meat in restaurant meals by 28g made the average person consume less meat without reducing their enjoyment of their meal. According to research published in the British Medical Journal, interventions that alter the availability of food have “substantial effects on consumer selection” with no evidence of adverse effects.</p> <p><strong>What about in institutions such as</strong><strong> schools and universities?</strong></p> <p>In schools and universities, vegetarian meals could become the default option. This normalises the consumption of plant-based products and also has the power to change social norms, as well as convincing people who wouldn’t have bought meat alternatives that they actually like them. This is already happening in public sector universities, hospitals and care homes which have pledged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/school-and-hospital-caterers-vow-to-cut-meat-served-by-20\">cut the meat</a> they serve by 20%. Shifting consumer behaviour will <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00482-2\">impact other actors</a> in the food chain and could influence wider social and environmental systems.</p> <p><strong>What about reducing emissions from livestock?</strong></p> <p>There are many well-documented environmental and health impacts of eating meat. Researchers are hoping to address one of these issues: the emissions from beef production. A <a href=\"https://www.dsm.com/corporate/sustainability/our-purpose/minimizing-methane-from-cattle.html\">feed additive</a> that can be put in cow food could reduce emissions by 30%, according to researchers, and it has been <a href=\"https://www.dsm.com/corporate/news/news-archive/2022/dsm-receives-eu-approval-Bovaer.html\">approved for use in the EU</a>. Most often cows are bred because they fatten well, or produce lots of milk, but researchers are also looking to selectively breed cattle with lower methane emissions. According to research – which is still in its infancy – this could reduce emissions by <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03293-0\">17% in one generation</a>. “Relying on consumers to change what they eat in order to deal with the climate emergency sounds like a risky strategy, because what happens if they don’t? This is where technology comes in,” says Prof Mick Watson, a bioinformatician from the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh.</p> <p><em>• Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/16/most-damaging-farm-products-organic-pasture-fed-beef-lamb","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T12:26:53Z","webTitle":"The most damaging farm products?

Organic, pasture-fed beef and lamb","trailText":"Analysis: You may be amazed by that answer, but the area of land used for grazing is vast compared with the meat and milk produced","byline":"George Monbiot","body":"<p>Perhaps the most important of all environmental issues is land use. Every hectare of land we use for extractive industries is a hectare that can’t support wild forests, savannahs, wetlands, natural grasslands and other crucial ecosystems. And farming swallows far more land than any other human activity.</p> <p>What are the world’s most damaging farm products? You might be amazed by the answer: organic, pasture-fed beef and lamb. I realise this is a shocking claim. Of all the statements in my new book, Regenesis, it has triggered the greatest rage. But I’m not trying to wind people up. I’m trying to represent the facts. Let me explain.</p> <p>Arable crops, some of which are fed to farm animals, occupy 12% of the planet’s land surface. But <a href=\"https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/reports/fcrn_gnc_report.pdf\">far more land (about 26%)</a> is used for grazing: in other words, for pasture-fed meat and milk. Yet, across this vast area, farm animals that are entirely pasture-fed <a href=\"https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/reports/fcrn_gnc_report.pdf\">produce just 1% of the world’s protein</a>.</p> <p>Livestock farmers often claim that their grazing systems “mimic nature”. If so, the mimicry is a crude caricature. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13527\">A review of evidence from over 100 studies</a> found that when livestock are removed from the land, the abundance and diversity of almost all groups of wild animals increases. The only category in which numbers fall when grazing by cattle or sheep ceases are those that eat dung. Where there are cattle, there are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1994.08030629.x\">fewer wild mammals, birds, reptiles and insects on the land, and fewer fish in the rivers</a>. Perhaps most importantly – because of their crucial role in regulating living systems – there tend to be no large predators.</p> <p>We don’t think about large predators in the UK, because we’ve exterminated them. Efforts to bring back lynx and wolves have so far been thwarted by the objections of livestock farmers. In the United States, where big carnivores still exist, federal and state agencies wage war against them on behalf of cattle and sheep farmers, often with astonishing brutality. A federal body called Wildlife Services uses poisoned baits, snares and leghold traps and shooting from planes and helicopters to kill wolves, coyotes, bears and bobcats. Its agents have incinerated pups in their dens, or dragged them out and clubbed them to death.</p> <p>Perhaps its most controversial killing tools are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/26/cyanide-bombs-wildfire-services-idaho\">cyanide landmines</a>: spring-loaded canisters of sodium cyanide planted in the ground, that spray the poison into the faces of animals that trip them. They’ve killed a wide range of endangered species, dozens of domestic dogs <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/us/cyanide-bombs-animals-trump-administration.html\">and at least one person</a>. There are very few places – mostly parts of eastern and southern Africa – in which livestock farmers tolerate large predators, generally where tourism revenues are high.</p> <p>Even if we manage to ignore this crucial ecological issue, there’s still a massive problem. Many livestock farmers now claim to practise “regenerative grazing”. The minimum definition of ecological regeneration is permitting trees to return to formerly wooded lands. In the uplands of Britain, to judge by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/24/landscape-of-fear-why-we-need-the-wolf-rewilding-scotland\">the experience of deer managers</a>, this means a maximum of about one sheep for every 20 hectares (50 acres). They might as well not be kept at all. In the lowlands, the <a href=\"https://knepp.co.uk/home\">Knepp rewilding project</a> in Sussex <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/25/veganism-intensively-farmed-meat-dairy-soya-maize#comment-119748600\">shows how far production has to fall </a>to permit the return of trees and other wildlife: it generates just 54kg of meat a hectare. If, as many chefs and foodies and some environmentalists propose, meat were to come only from regenerative farms, it would be so scarce that only millionaires would eat it.</p> <p>In reality, the great majority of “regenerative” pasture-fed meat is nothing of the kind. It’s rebranded ranching, arguably the most destructive industry on Earth. In the US, livestock grazing is the <a href=\"https://thecounter.org/there-are-millions-of-acres-of-failing-rangelands-data-shows-bureau-land-management/\">primary reason for land degradation</a>. It has caused an invasive species called cheatgrass to sweep across North America, <a href=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/graminoid/brotec/all.html\">devastating ecosystems</a>. Cattle fencing excludes wild herbivores and stops migration. The supposedly-greener methods some ranchers call <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_fight_desertification_and_reverse_climate_change?language=en\">“holistic management”</a> or “planned grazing” are <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2013.12.001\">just as bad</a> for wildlife as <a href=\"https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/244566/local_244566.pdf\">conventional ranching</a>.</p> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.monbiot.com/2017/01/11/explanation-of-the-figures-in-grim-reaping/\">my estimates</a> suggest that some 4m hectares of hill and mountain are used for sheep farming. Almost all this land, much of which would otherwise <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.06.002\">support temperate rainforest</a>, is treeless, as tree seedlings are highly nutritious and selectively eaten by sheep. There are more trees for each hectare <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54311593\">in some parts of inner London</a> than there are in the “wild” British hills where sheep graze. The remaining vegetation is <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aab.12591\">badly degraded</a>.</p> <p>Four million hectares is 22% of the entire farmed area. It’s roughly equivalent to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/931104/structure-jun2020prov-UK-08oct20i.pdf\">all the land used</a> to grow grain in this country , and 23 times the area used for growing fruit and vegetables. But, in terms of calories, lamb and mutton supply <a href=\"https://www.monbiot.com/2017/01/11/explanation-of-the-figures-in-grim-reaping/\">just over 1% of the UK’s food</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d26c7df561d43145f6de6c75dee4d2b05c8b71a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26c7df561d43145f6de6c75dee4d2b05c8b71a9/0_30_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Animal Rebellion’s Occupy Smithfield action in 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Animal Rebellion staged a protest in London’s Smithfield meat market in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ollie Millington/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pasture-fed meat production, in other words, is the major cause of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eaTIe_TBZA\">agricultural sprawl</a>. People rail against urban sprawl: the profligate use of land for housing and infrastructure. But the world’s urban areas occupy <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/land-use\">just 1% of the planet’s land surface</a>, in comparison with the 26% used for grazing. Agricultural sprawl inflicts a very high ecological opportunity cost: the missing ecosystems that would otherwise exist.</p> <p>This is matched by the carbon opportunity cost of pasture-fed beef and lamb. Meat production has two kinds of global heating impact: its climate current account, which means the gases released by farming animals; and its climate capital account, which means the carbon dioxide the land could absorb if it were rewilded.

Dimbleby, the Leon restaurant chain co-founder and a respected voice in Conservative circles, believes a 30% meat reduction over 10 years is required for land to be used sustainably in England. Others go much further: Greenpeace, for example, say we must reduce our meat intake by 70%.</p> <p>“If we fail on this,” Dimbleby said, “we will fail to meet our biodiversity or climate goals in this country. We also have a huge opportunity to show thought leadership worldwide, and show them that this can be done, that we can farm sustainably and still feed people.”</p> <p>Dimbleby has authored two government-commissioned reports into the UK’s food system but the white paper that followed, published by Boris Johnson’s government in June, was widely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/10/defra-report-shows-no-stomach-for-bold-action-on-food-poverty-and-obesity\">criticised for watering down his key recommendations</a> and contained few new measures to tackle the soaring cost of food, childhood hunger, obesity or the climate emergency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/survey-data/giv-6562RTsIDRkuXje1/\" data-alt=\"Public views of policy proposals to curb meat consumption – graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/survey-data/giv-6562RTsIDRkuXje1/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“I wasn’t surprised at all,” Dimbleby said when asked about the omission of meat reduction policies in the government’s white paper. </p> <p>“It’s such a politicised area, it’s one that everyone globally avoids.

Even though the government wouldn’t be implementing a kind of Stalinist five-year plan, there would still be a combination of incentives and regulation.</p> <p>“The French used to call us roast beef, you know, and in the 19th century you’d get people who would go over to France and comment on how sickly they were, that English people were strong because they ate lots of beef. That continues today … The public are now actually incredibly supportive of some measures – the salt and sugar [tax] was a popular measure. But anything the government got involved in with meat, that was resisted.”</p> <h2>Post-Brexit production</h2> <p>The way we produce food and use land post-Brexit is due to change, with a land use strategy set to be published by the government – but stuck in the limbo of the Tory party leadership race. </p> <p>Farmers have faced a rollercoaster in their fortunes since the EU referendum. The paperwork involved with shipping produce to the EU has dampened exports, and the government has struggled to implement new subsidy regimes, which would pay farmers for conserving the environment, to take over from the loss of EU payments. Covid lockdowns further disrupted supply chains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/landuse/giv-6562CLN1ydnwlQh4/\" data-alt=\"UK land use – graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/landuse/giv-6562CLN1ydnwlQh4/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Rising fuel prices have resulted in a tripling of fertiliser prices, ever more erratic weather driven by the climate crisis has added extra volatility, and the impact has still to be felt of trade deals with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/15/uk-australia-trade-deal-what-does-it-mean-brexit\">countries such as Australia</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/15/uk-australia-trade-deal-to-include-15-year-cap-on-tariff-free-imports\">experts say</a> are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/18/green-groups-in-last-ditch-bid-to-block-uk-australia-trade-deal-brexit\">likely to let cheap but lower-standard food flood in</a>.</p> <p>The result is farmers crying out for clearer direction, at a time when the government is in disarray. Vicki Hird, head of farming at Sustain, a coalition of food and farming organisations, said: “This political upheaval will be hard to watch for UK farmers who face so many uncertainties … what they really need is a stable policy and no new shocks so they can plan ahead, knowing that an ambitious support system is on track, that regulations are clear and that they won’t be sold out under new trade deals. Our farmers need stability so they can have a viable business and plan their moves to climate- and nature-based farming.”</p> <p>Rural England has long been a Tory heartland, regularly returning “true blue” MPs from the shires, and at the 2019 election 46% of voters in rural counties voted Conservative and only 29% for Labour. But polling conducted before Johnson’s resignation by the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents nearly 30,000 landowners and rural businesses, found a sizeable swing of about 7.5%, from the Tories to Labour, putting the two main parties neck and neck in rural areas. The Liberal Democrats present another threat to rural Tory dominance; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/24/tories-lose-byelections-wakefield-tiverton-honiton-labour-lib-dems\">the rural seat of Tiveron and Honiton</a> was formerly a safe blue seat but turned yellow in the recent byelection. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/29/minette-batters-i-feared-farmers-would-be-used-as-a-pawn-in-trade-deals-and-thats-what-happened\">Minette Batters</a>, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, met Johnson in the days before the publication of his food strategy, warning him that he was in danger of losing the farming vote. </p> <p>Batters said she told Johnson farmers wanted to see a change in focus from nature recovery back to food production.</p> <p>“It is nice to deliver public goods but first and foremost we have to be supported to produce food. I made this point to the PM,” she said, adding: “Farmers have a statutory underpinning on trees and nature – but we would like to see one on food production otherwise it will be left behind – .”</p> <p>Batters <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/06/18/save-grasslands-not-egos-tree-planting-celebrities-told/\">said recently</a> that it is “criminal” to frame farming as meat versus trees and going vegan, adding that an “honest conversation” about grasslands and the carbon they store “hasn’t been allowed to happen”.</p> <p>But Dimbleby says there is limited truth in claims about pasture being good for the environment.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: “It may turn out that there is some new way of grazing with which we can sequester carbon in the long term but at the moment all forms of meat production are significantly carbon positive.”</p> <p>Some farmers argue that the land used for pasture, particularly that in the barren uplands, is useless for anything else due to the poor nutrient content of the soil. But this is the very land Dimbleby believes should be taken out of food production and rewilded. Taking just 5% out of production and restoring the lost landscapes they used to contain could be enough, he said.</p> <p>“One of the arguments people make about pasture is that land is not good for anything else,” he said. “But actually, even more than the actual direct carbon emissions from ruminants, the opportunity cost of the land they occupy is huge. We destroyed most of our rainforests 1,000 years ago in this country but most of that land has huge potential to store carbon. Almost all the land you took out of food production should be low-grade extensive pasture.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/16/tell-us-about-the-belongings-your-ex-left-behind","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T12:17:05Z","webTitle":"Tell us about the belongings your ex left behind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/16/tell-us-about-the-belongings-your-ex-left-behind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/16/tell-us-about-the-belongings-your-ex-left-behind","fields":{"headline":"Tell us about the belongings your ex left behind","trailText":"We’d like to hear from people about the items they kept after a break up and what they mean to them.","byline":"Guardian community team","body":"<p>Breaking up is hard to do.

It was with these works that the Bergen Philharmonic and chief conductor Edward Gardner rounded off their visit to Edinburgh, following their concert performance of Strauss’s Salome.</p> <p>In keeping with the general crowd-pleasing tenor of the programme the concert also featured pianist of the moment Víkingur Ólafsson who joined the orchestra in Schumann’s Piano Concerto with mixed success. Ólafsson’s limpid, free-flowing playing didn’t quite gel with the orchestral playing; the accompaniment feeling tentative rather than genuinely connected. The delicate, bell-like sonorities Ólafsson drew from the piano were exquisite but at times a more extrovert approach would have been welcomed to create a genuine dialogue between soloist and orchestra.</p> <p>The orchestra certainly felt more comfortable in the rest of the programme, yet throughout there was a certain element of constraint. In Ravel’s La Valse, famously described by the impresario Diaghilev as “not a ballet, but the portrait of a ballet”, theme emerges from a swirling mist, as if a spectral Viennese ballroom is being conjured in the concert hall. It is decadent and yet also grotesque; here the superficial glamour was rather more apparent than the latent menace.</p> <p>There was a similar sense of control not being relinquished in a generally excellent performance of Rachmaninov’s valedictory Symphonic Dances. There was plenty to admire: the disciplined, tightly controlled energy of Gardner’s reading; the warm, rich orchestral tone and some superb woodwind solos; but there was never the sense of being taken on an edge-of-the-seat ride. This was particularly apparent in the final movement where Rachmaninov hammers out the chant for the dead “Dies Irae” over a multitude of musical self-quotations, a real dance of death if ever there was one.

Helsinki is also studying a specific humanitarian visa.</p> <p>Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, has repeatedly said it is “not right” that tourists from Russia can holiday in Europe while its troops are killing in Ukraine, and Kallas, her Estonian counterpart, has called for an EU-wide visa ban.</p> <p>Other EU leaders, however, are not in favour. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Monday that only those who were responsible for or profiting from the war should be punished. “This is not a war of Russian citizens, but Putin’s war,” he said.</p> <p>EU rules require tourists from third countries to apply for a visa from the country they intend to visit, but allow them to enter the passport-free Schengen zone from any point and travel around it for up to 90 days in a 180-day period.<br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/16/millie-lies-low-review-michelle-savill","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T12:00:44Z","webTitle":"Millie Lies Low review – ingenious satire of career-faking on social media","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/16/millie-lies-low-review-michelle-savill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/16/millie-lies-low-review-michelle-savill","fields":{"headline":"Millie Lies Low review – ingenious satire of career-faking on social media","trailText":"Michelle Savill’s poignant film follows a would-be architect pretending to take up a prestigious New York internship without leaving her home town of Wellington","byline":"Phil Hoad","body":"<p>‘Sorry, I’m such a disappointment to you, Mum.” “We can’t all be appointments.” That’s the fumbling, poignant way of this debut comedy-drama from New Zealand director Michelle Savill, clearly a highly personal piece of work in its detailed character study of would-be architect and social-media blagger Millie, played in charmingly evasive style by Ana Scotney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/12/movie-stars-killed-brad-pitt-tom-cruise-meryl-streep\">Twilight of the A-list: has the 21st century killed off the movie star?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Millie has a hot ticket from Wellington to New York for an internship at a blue-chip architecture firm, but has a panic attack and disembarks before takeoff.

Savill excels at understatedly layering in backstory – such as the architecture-school security guard commenting on her plagiarism, or the Philippine folk dance she is forced to do by her mum (Rachel House) – that gradually reclines us into her deeper insecurities.</p> <p>Savill leaves the understatedness behind for a cringe-masterclass of a scene in which Millie both finds out about her boyfriend’s infidelity and finally drops her hoax. But it’s still only the beginning of the end in a personal reckoning that Savill shoots in a deceptively casual style, while dropping in mordant background details such as the huge scholarship poster at the airport with Millie plastered on it. It’s a testament to Scotney’s performance that Millie retains a perverse kind of integrity even as she dupes herself more than the people around her.

It once lived across the continent, but was restricted to Tasmania about 3,000 years ago. Dog-like in appearance and with stripes across its back, it was extensively hunted after European colonisation. The last known survivor died in captivity in 1936. Despite hundreds of reported sightings in the decades that followed, and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/02/the-obsessive-search-for-the-tasmanian-tiger\">some quixotic attempts to prove its ongoing existence</a>, it was officially declared extinct in the 1980s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a0bff75-96b2-4439-add8-955692d31062\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YylnjP6y6oA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The scientists aim to reverse this by taking stem cells from a living species with similar DNA, the <a href=\"https://animalia.bio/fat-tailed-dunnart\">fat-tailed dunnart</a>, and turning them into “thylacine” cells – or the closest approximation possible – using gene editing expertise developed by George Church, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and Colossal’s co-founder. New marsupial-specific assisted reproductive technologies will be needed to use the stem cells to make an embryo, which would be transferred into either an artificial womb or a dunnart surrogate to gestate.</p> \n<p>Pask said the partnership was the most significant contribution ever made to marsupial conservation in Australia as more than 30 scientists worked to accelerate the “massive grand challenge” of bringing the thylacine back from the dead.

Corey Bradshaw, a professor in global ecology at Flinders University, believed it was unlikely to be successful. ‘Even if you can do it [in the lab] - and I have my doubts about that - how do you create the thousands of individuals of sufficient genetic variation you need to create a healthy population?”</p> \n<p>Euan Ritchie, a professor in wildlife ecology and conservation at Deakin University, said other outstanding questions included whether the project could do more to help threatened species than existing conservation genetics.

A chunky frame of unprocessed cedar logs from the nearby forest supports a long snaking canopy, sheltering walls made of a patchwork quilt of 700 old windows and doors, reclaimed from buildings in the village. Inside, rows of shiitake mushroom crates donated by a local farm serve as shelving units, while the floors are covered with cast terrazzo made from broken pottery, waste floor tiles and bits of recycled glass, forming a polished nougat of trash.</p> <p>It is a fitting form for what is something of a temple to recycling. In 2003, Kamikatsu became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/no-waste-japanese-village-is-a-peek-into-carbon-neutral-future\">the first place in Japan to pass a zero-waste declaration</a>, after the municipality was forced to close its polluting waste incinerator. Since then, the remote village (with a population of 1,500, one hour’s drive from the nearest city) has become an unlikely leader in the battle against landfill and incineration. Residents now sort their rubbish into 45 different categories – separating white paper from newspapers, aluminium coated paper from cardboard tubes and bottles from their caps – leading to a recycling rate of 80%, compared with Japan’s national average of 20%. Villagers typically visit the centre once or twice a week, which has been designed with public spaces and meeting rooms, making it a social hub for the dispersed town. It even has its own recycling-themed boutique hotel attached, called <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jjwalsh/a-stay-in-japans-zero-waste-hotel-e3ce2ec6c8fa\">WHY</a> – which might well be your first response when someone suggests staying next to a trash depot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9121c861006f5fa33592237a53811a166d20ec67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9121c861006f5fa33592237a53811a166d20ec67/0_634_9504_5702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The hotel at the Kamikatsu Zero Waste Centre, Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hotel at the Kamikatsu Zero Waste Centre, Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: kojifujii/Koji Fujii.

Written by the architect and teacher Ruth Lang, it takes in a global sweep of recent projects that make the most of what is already there, whether breathing life into outmoded structures, creating new buildings from salvaged components or designing with eventual dismantling in mind. The timing couldn’t be more urgent. As Lang notes, 80% of the buildings projected to exist in 2050, the year of the UN’s net zero carbon emissions target, have already been built. The critical onus on architects and developers, therefore, is to retrofit, reuse and reimagine our existing building stock, making use of the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/03/dirty-secret-fossil-fuel-free-building-embodied-carbon-building-glass-steel-blocks\">embodied carbon</a>” that has already been expended, rather than contributing to escalating emissions with further demolition and new construction.</p> <p>While the urgency of the issue has been occupying the industry for some time – the Architects’ Journal leading the way with its <a href=\"https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/retrofirst\">RetroFirst</a> campaign – the topic recently made national headlines when Michael Gove, then communities secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/24/not-just-any-building-why-plans-for-ms-flagship-store-hit-a-raw-nerve\">ordered a public inquiry</a> into the proposed demolition of the 1929 Marks &amp; Spencer flagship store on Oxford Street. Whereas heritage conservation would once have been the primary reason to retain such a building, the conservation of the planet has now taken centre stage. Campaigners argue the development proposals would release 40,000 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere, whereas a low-carbon “deep retrofit” is eminently possible instead. They point to examples such as the <a href=\"https://rylands-manchester.com/\">former Debenhams in Manchester</a>, a 1930s building which is being refurbished and extended. To put the scale of the emissions in context, Westminster city council is currently spending £13m to retrofit all of its buildings, to save 1,700 tonnes of carbon every year; the M&amp;S demolition proposal alone would effectively undo 23 years of the council’s carbon savings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a5a2c2579cc2340fdfee9c5da847543103a92333\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5a2c2579cc2340fdfee9c5da847543103a92333/0_17_2853_3567/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Castle Acre water tower in Norfolk.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Castle Acre water tower in Norfolk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taran Wilkhu, Building for Change, gestalten 2022</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The retailer’s bosses might do well to thumb through Lang’s book for some inspiration, and see how creative reuse is not just crucial for the planet, but can be even more alluring than the promise of a shiny new-build. Along with office and retail refurbs, the projects include <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/949222/baoshan-wte-exhibition-center-kokaistudios\">a rusting steel factory in Shanghai reborn as a striking exhibition centre</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/965338/castle-acre-water-tower-tonkin-liu\">water tower in Norfolk that was cleverly converted into a panoramic house in the clouds</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/962522/childrens-community-centre-nil-the-playscape-waa\">a children’s community centre in a converted warehouse</a>, complete with a vertiginous new landscape that ripples its way around the building.</p> <p>The strategies on show range from the ad-hoc to the forensically planned. One German architect, Arno Brandlhuber, invited friends to bash out holes in the concrete walls of a former underwear factory near Potsdam using a sledgehammer, to create the windows of his <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/627801/antivilla-brandlhuber-emde-schneider\">gritty new weekend home</a> wherever they saw fit. In Barcelona, meanwhile, architects Flores &amp; Prats spent three months meticulously cataloguing every single door frame, mosaic tile and wall moulding of a 1920s workers’ co-operative, creating an inventory of components to reuse in their conversion of the building into a theatre. The duo compare their process to altering secondhand clothes: “You have to unstitch and so recognise the pattern used before, cut on one side to add on another,” they write. “We may have to sew some pockets, and so on, until the garment responds and identifies with the new user.” It is an exercise, they add, that “requires confidence and time until you get to feel it as your own”.</p> <p>The resulting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/16/sala-beckett-theatre-samuel-barcelona-what-where-flores-prats-roca-gallery\">Sala Beckett</a> is a spellbinding place, encrusted with the traces of its previous lives, creating a series of richly layered spaces that would have been impossible to make from scratch. It brims with one of retrofit’s chief free gifts, which so many new buildings struggle to conjure: character. Over the years, the co-op had hosted shops, a cafe, cinema and gym, and echoes of these functions are kept on in a kind of bricolage of fragments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"985af4f746c7e73e631c481f74eb9c5a7a4d6272\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/985af4f746c7e73e631c481f74eb9c5a7a4d6272/0_0_11462_5731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richly layered and full of character … Sala Beckett, Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richly layered and full of character … Sala&nbsp;Beckett, Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adria Goula/Courtesy of Flores &amp; Prats Arqs, Building for Change, gestalten 2022</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 44 doors and 35 windows retrieved from the project were carefully restored, repainted and relocated to different rooms, arranged in enlarged openings and in new combinations, “as if choreographed in a dance around the new building”, Lang writes. The architects term their approach “situational architecture”, allowing the space to surprise and guide its development, suggesting alternative uses and evolving into its new form. While other architects had proposed to demolish the building and start afresh, Flores &amp; Prats saw the social value in retaining the structure, beyond the environmental benefits alone. “You inherit it,” Ricard Flores said in an interview, “you use it because you like what you see and you think there is a treasure there. And not only as regards the material qualities. The social inheritance was as important as the physical inheritance.”<br><br>Similar principles guide the approach of French couple <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/16/lacaton-vassal-unflashy-french-architectures-pritzker-prize\">Lacaton &amp; Vassal</a>, the Pritzker prize-winning architects who work under the rallying cry: “Never demolish, never remove or replace, always add, transform, and reuse!” Their rehabilitation of postwar housing blocks in Paris and Bordeaux has set a new bar for low-energy retrofit, improving the thermal performance of the buildings while, crucially, allowing the existing residents to live there while the works are carried out.<br><br>From social housing to art centres, the pair always begin with a fastidious assessment of the existing fabric, asking how it could be improved with the bare minimum of resources. In the early 00s, when the French state was allocating €167,000 for the demolition and rebuilding of each apartment, they argued that it was possible to redesign, expand and upgrade three flats of the same size for that amount. They proved it, working with Frédéric Druot <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2013/04/16/tour-bois-le-pretre-by-frederic-druot-anne-lacaton-and-jean-philippe-vassal/\">to transform the 1960s Tour Bois-le-Prêtre</a>, by removing the old precast concrete cladding and wrapping the flats in a three-metre-deep layer of winter gardens, providing additional amenity space and a thermal buffer to the living spaces. As Anne Lacaton puts it: “Demolishing is a decision of easiness and short-term. It is a waste of many things – a waste of energy, a waste of material and a waste of history. Moreover, it has a very negative social impact. For us, it is an act of violence.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e3ffd8ff888da7423cd0caf1d53481c6cc7d1b55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3ffd8ff888da7423cd0caf1d53481c6cc7d1b55/0_0_3000_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harrow Arts Centre in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"756\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harrow Arts Centre in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Perry/Building for Change/ Gestalten 2022</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><br>It is a light-touch philosophy that can also be found in the work of London studio DK-CM, particularly in <a href=\"http://dk-cm.com/dkcmprojects/harrow-arts-centre/\">their masterplan for Harrow Arts Centre</a>, set in a Victorian school campus, which features in the book. Rather than decant the existing uses into temporary structures at vast expense, to enable the creation of new arts facilities, the architects carefully reorchestrated the site and developed a phased approach over six years. Architectural decisions were made according to how they would reduce overheads and minimise the environmental impact of construction and future maintenance, with a programme of strategic repairs and lightweight insertions – a design process with “more in common with surgery than construction,” says Lang.<br><br>The momentum for retention and reuse is catching on. No longer perceived as the last resort of economic necessity or a fringe eco-pursuit, refurbishment has become the desirable choice for progressive clients. This month, the London School of Economics unveiled the winner of its latest international competition, for a £120m “last set piece” addition to its campus.

A questionnaire asks him to grade, out of 10, his fears that something terrible will happen. He plumps for 10 then scrawls a smily face alongside it.</p> <p>He’s a professional comedian after all – or as he puts it, “professional neurotic”. Barnett’s shirt has its own <a href=\"https://thecomedystore.co.uk/\">Comedy Store</a>-esque laughing logo on the back, with red lips, heart-shaped tongue and bright white teeth. And Dos Santos’s play dives into the compulsion to make others laugh, from using humour as a defence mechanism to exerting control on your surroundings.</p> <p>Staged at a festival where comedy shows outnumber theatre, the play offers a closer analysis of joke-craft than the psychology of standup. It’s likely to influence audiences’ appreciation of the next act they watch – and invites them to unpick the structure of Dos Santos’s measured, slightly too neat script.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/16/i-want-to-do-things-ive-never-done-the-history-boys-samuel-barnett-on-his-new-one-man-show\">‘I want to do things I’ve never done’: The History Boys’ Samuel Barnett on his new one-man show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As if we were at a comedy club night, Barnett starts at a mic stand. The plot grows from a familiar culture-clash routine as he, a self-deprecatory, weak-chinned Brit, falls for an all-American doctoral student who, in one of Dos Santos’s best lines, looks “like the guy Michelangelo dumped David for when he got rich and famous”.</p> <p>The remarkable thing about Barnett’s performance is how he has mastered the delivery, timing and register of a seasoned observational comedian. He has an instant rapport with the audience and intuitively responds to an interjection from the crowd. In a series of gags, we see the comedian revel in his own ridiculousness, work up mock rage complete with throbbing neck vein, and fire off dry observations on his addiction to hook-up culture.</p> <p>Barnett undercuts it with just the right amount of fragility and Dos Santos’s script, which finds the standup rewinding and refreshing his material, sparingly reminds us that confessional comedians can be unreliable narrators. Separating the embellishments from the authenticity is part of the game here.</p> <p>As the swooshes of Max Pappenheim’s sound design shift between scenes, Matthew Xia’s adrenalised staging matches the wired feeling of a comedy club – although the standup’s colleagues are rather thinly drawn. The pace also matches the swiftness of the unpredictable casual sex encounters engineered by the app-addicted comedian, where he loses the control he finds at the mic.

But that’s the outside world and we concentrate on what we can influence and that’s our performance.</p> \n<p>“It was, especially with 10 men, a great performance. We put them under pressure, made them nervous, let them kick long balls. That’s something we have to learn from, keep going, but we want to win and we’ll look for that in the next game.</p> \n<p>“We put them under pressure, we took a lot of risk because we had to score the equaliser and were hoping to get the winner. But we should not come with 10 men, it should not happen.”</p> \n<p>Luis Díaz scored a superb equaliser for Liverpool four minutes after Núñez’s dismissal and Van Dijk believes the Colombia international has much more to offer this season. “Luis is a fantastic player,” he said. “It’s something we need and he provided that bit of special action and he can be so much better.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2022/aug/16/crown-paints-advert-complaints-misogyny-sexism","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T11:21:51Z","webTitle":"Crown Paints advert triggers complaints of misogyny and sexism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/16/crown-paints-advert-complaints-misogyny-sexism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/aug/16/crown-paints-advert-complaints-misogyny-sexism","fields":{"headline":"Crown Paints advert triggers complaints of misogyny and sexism","trailText":"Watchdog considering whether to investigate after receiving 215 complaints over Hannah and Dave ad","byline":"Mark Brown North of England correspondent","body":"<p>What was meant to be a lighthearted TV advert for paint has become mired in a misogyny and sexism row with 215 complaints made to the advertising watchdog.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEGNFIU9Iic\">Crown Paints advert</a> tells the story of Hannah and Dave who met at an illegal rave four years ago, have settled down and are expecting a baby.

A co-commission by the BBC, the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, and Hamburg’s NDR Elbphilharmonie, it was written in 2019 as a celebratory piece for the Tokyo Olympics the following year, though its planned multiple premieres were all initially shelved due to Covid and subsequent travel restrictions. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXcsRtOM3Qk\">first performance</a> finally took place in Hamburg last year. Tokyo, for which the world premiere was originally intended, has still yet to hear it.</p> <p>A large-scale piece lasting 25 minutes or so, it’s essentially a depiction of the three cities that commissioned it: structurally it flanks a slow central movement (Hamburg) with two contrasting allegros (London, Tokyo), each effectively dictated by its own pulse and individual time pattern. London is all about rhythmic disorientation as Turnage rings syncopated changes on a horn phrase that suggests a peal of church bells, though a lyrical soprano saxophone solo over undulating strings at the movement’s centre suggests the calm, steady flow of the Thames through the at times gleeful surrounding chaos.</p> <p>Olympic Tokyo, meanwhile, is even faster, more frenetic, harder edged – a city in a party mood, its jazzy edginess and ritzy percussive chatter never letting up. In Hamburg, by contrast, the pressures of time are less. Harmonies progress more gently, as fanfares reminiscent of Copland alternate with complex but luminous woodwind and string passages, often of remarkable beauty. The virtuosity of Turnage’s scoring was matched throughout by the precision and brilliance of the BBCSO’s playing.</p> <p>Its companion pieces were Vaughan Williams’s Tuba Concerto and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/28/elgar-where-to-start-with-his-music\">Elgar</a>’s First Symphony. Constantin Hartwig, tall, lanky and debonair, was the witty, if wonderfully refined soloist in the concerto and offered an arrangement of Paul McCartney’s Blackbird as an encore while outside the hot weather began to break and rain drummed loudly on the Albert Hall roof. Oramo, meanwhile, has long been an exceptional Elgar interpreter, and his performance of the First was by turns noble and volatile, deeply touching in the heartfelt adagio, and genuinely exultant at the end.

The cabinet was advised, and reasons were put forward for the move by the then attorney general, Christian Porter, as the government grappled with the awesome powers of the Biosecurity Act.</p> \n<p>As for the rest, it is hard not to pity Stephen Donaghue, the solicitor general, who has been tasked with getting to the bottom of one of the most bewildering political scandals in memory.</p> \n<p>For now, we know scant facts. We know that after health, Morrison gave himself responsibility for the finance portfolio in what appears to be a quick copy and paste job of the paperwork to the governor general, David Hurley (given that Porter and the then finance minister, Mathias Cormann, were unaware that Morrison had decided to extend his reach).</p> \n<p>Twelve months later, in an even more bamboozling move, Morrison decided he’d like to get his paws on Treasury and home affairs too – without, apparently, telling any other cabinet minister, let alone those whose portfolios he had decided to muscle in on.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The only portfolio other than health he advised some colleagues he had happily snatched was that of resources, which he took on in April 2021. Why? Because Morrison had an election to win and was unhappy that the resources minister, Keith Pitt, wasn’t giving him the political outcome he needed.</p> \n<p>He advised Pitt in mid-2021 he was shadowing him and had the power to make ministerial decisions. The “you do what I want or I’ll make myself the minister and do it for you” is certainly far from the chains of orthodoxy that have constrained ministers in the Westminster system until now.</p> \n<p>Morrison insists this was the only time he used the extraordinary ministerial powers he had gifted himself, and says that had he needed to use other “break glass in case of emergency” safeguards he would have disclosed the authority.</p> \n<p>Except he didn’t. In the one instance that Morrison did use his powers as resources minister to block the Pep-11 decision, he at no stage made public the ministerial arrangement, nor advised cabinet colleagues of the process.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/scott-morrisons-ministerial-meshuffle-why-did-he-do-it-what-was-happening-and-where-to-now\">Scott Morrison’s ministerial meshuffle: why did he do it, what was happening and where to now?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Morrison has been open about his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/18/we-dont-trust-in-governments-or-un-scott-morrison-tells-margaret-courts-perth-church\">disdain for government and for international institutions</a> and during his time in office showed contempt for the media and basic principles of transparency and accountability.</p> \n<p>The former New South Wales senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells accused him of destroying the institution of the Liberal party, among other things, saying: “It is his way or the highway –<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/scott-morrison-labelled-an-autocrat-and-bully-with-no-moral-compass-by-liberal-senator-concetta-fierravanti-wells\"> an autocrat, a bully who has no moral compass</a>.”</p> \n<p>The latest revelations show Morrison also had contempt for his colleagues and for the longstanding conventions that underpin Australia’s democracy.</p> \n<p>As the former home affairs minister Karen Andrews said, Australians were right to feel “betrayed” by the leader of the country.

Ambrose","body":"<p>Rapidly rising temperatures have led Wakehurst, which describes itself as “Kew Gardens’ wild garden in the country”, to take decisive action to future-proof its 535 acres in Sussex.</p> <p>Last year it created a new American prairie grassland, with 12 million seeds, 110 different plant species and more than 50,000 live plants sown into six acres of landscape, and now one year on the results are on display.</p> <p>“The reason for the prairie was to think about the future and this summer is a really good example of what we think that future will be, which is much hotter and drier,” Wakehurst’s head of landscape and horticulture, Iain Parkinson, told the Guardian.</p> <p>“We want to create landscapes at Wakehurst that move away from the conventional form of gardening, which requires lots of irrigation, weeding and mulching, to developing landscapes which are more resilient to the changing climate.</p> <p>“These are landscapes made from live plants that knit together and create a community of plants that will adapt to the conditions and, rather than just survive in summers like this, will actually thrive because those are the conditions they are more used to.”</p> <p>American gardening expert Larry Weaner, who has experience of restoring prairie grasslands in the US, has been working as a consultant on the biggest project at Wakehurst over the past

slowed progress.</p> <p>He said: “It is a bit of a slow burn as developing living plant communities can take up to five years. We are now in year three … We were expecting to see a little bit more diversity appear this year, we think the very hot and dry conditions have actually delayed some germination.</p> <p>“It’s not that these seeds won’t germinate but they are sitting dormant because the conditions have been very dry.

In time, those plants will diminish and the grasses start to appear.</p> <p>However, gardening staff at Wakehurst are already viewing the American prairie experiment as an opportunity to learn how the UK can adapt to drier, hotter summers.</p> <p>“There are big changes happening at Wakehurst because we can’t pretend that climate change isn’t happening,” Parkinson added. “We have to take action and undertake research, which will inform our decisions moving forward.</p> <p>“These [prairies] are really resilient landscapes that we are developing and we think this is how everyone will have to garden in the UK moving forward. We can’t rely on irrigating everything to keep it alive; we are going to have to change the way we garden and look at a wider palette of plants.</p> <p>“Certain trees are more susceptible than others, shallow-rooted trees for example, and some of our collections are struggling. It’s not just the hot summers, we are also seeing wetter, milder and windier winters.

Despite high levels of leakage, many companies are meeting these targets, which has led campaigners to question whether they are strict enough. For instance, Thames Water has 11,000 leaks across its system but is not falling below the regulator’s standards.</p> <p>Black said: “Thames Water are not in breach of their performance, by my understanding. There are risks of leaks across the networks.

Ofwat have prevented a lot of the investment needed and allowed companies to take huge profits and screw our rivers.”</p> <p>Christine Colvin, advocacy and engagement director at the Rivers Trust, said: “This drought highlights that the targets and timelines agreed with the water sector are not enough to ensure we are climate resilient for the long haul. Why are we now talking expensive inter-basin transfers when we’re leaking a fifth of our water supply?”</p> <p>Some MPs also believe that Ofwat needs to take firmer action against water companies. Philip Dunne, the Conservative MP and chair of the environmental audit committee, said the regulator needed to do more to restore public trust in water companies.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: “The performance of water companies is under the spotlight now more than ever before. Sewage pollution incidents and leaks wasting 20% of our mains water supply every day is eroding public trust. It is clear that there is much to do to make our water sector fit for purpose, particularly as the effects of climate change are likely to make water scarcity worse in the coming decades.</p> <p>“To lead to meaningful improvements, the boards of water companies must be encouraged to develop plans to manage water resources and treatment, and work with the regulators to ensure that these can be delivered.”</p> <p>Ofwat declined to comment further.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2022/aug/16/pushing-buttons-better-call-saul-would-make-a-great-game-why-hasnt-it-happened","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T10:53:19Z","webTitle":"Pushing Buttons: Breaking Bad meets GTA – and other shows I’d like to play","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/aug/16/pushing-buttons-better-call-saul-would-make-a-great-game-why-hasnt-it-happened","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2022/aug/16/pushing-buttons-better-call-saul-would-make-a-great-game-why-hasnt-it-happened","fields":{"headline":"Pushing Buttons: Breaking Bad meets GTA – and other shows I’d like to play","trailText":"Game adaptations don’t have to be terrible. But as Better Call Saul creator Vince Gilligan admits, bringing action from screen to console isn’t as easy as it sounds","byline":"Keza MacDonald","body":"<p>Welcome back to Pushing Buttons! This issue is going out on my birthday. Presents would be nice, but what I actually want is a week off to finally play Elden Ring. Only slightly more importantly, today is also when the finale of Better Call Saul airs in the UK, closing out a story that began with Breaking Bad’s first TV episodes in 2008. I will really miss this series – there is nothing in television quite like creator Vince Gilligan’s sumptuous shots and tight dark-comedic writing. I’ve often wondered why there’s been no Breaking Bad video game – especially because Netflix has shown a great deal of interest in the games, from buying studios to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/shoot-em-up-how-tv-fell-in-love-with-video-games\">bankrolling endless TV adaptations</a>. (Side note: did you know that Netflix subscribers get access to <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/netflix-subscribers-excellent-free-games-warning\">24 mostly excellent games for free</a>, including the sci-fi masterpiece <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/05/into-the-breach-review\">Into the Breach</a>? I didn’t, until last week.)</p> <p>I would have expected some drug-empire management game, maybe spliced with scenes from the show, or with scene-setting and dialogue from its writers. Or perhaps an interactive-movie tie-in along the lines of Charlie Brooker’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/01/black-mirror-bandersnatch-review-charlie-brooker-netflix-tv-of-tomorrow-is-now-here\">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a>, where your reactions send the story spinning off in different directions. It would be expensive, sure, but Netflix has never minded spending money.</p> <p>It turns out, as Gilligan said in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVpGPX_Lj64&amp;t=3047s\">podcast interview</a>, that there have<em> </em>been attempts at Breaking Bad video games – but none have come to fruition. Gilligan is not a gamer himself, but he talks about his vision for a Grand Theft Auto-style adaptation of the show that was pitched but never happened. Immense energy, effort and talent went into writing storylines for potential game projects, he says; at one point something was on the cards for PlayStation VR, but that never materialised, either.</p> <p>Gilligan has run into a problem that video game creatives know well: making games is absurdly difficult, expensive and time-consuming. I am reminded of a quote from Frank Lantz of the NYU Game Center, which opened a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/sep/05/was-that-a-reference-to-magritte-design-play-disrupt-review\">superb video game exhibition</a> at the V&amp;A in 2018: “Making a game combines everything that’s hard about building a bridge with everything that’s hard about composing an opera. Games are basically operas made out of bridges.” Creating something that met the extremely high production standards of Breaking Bad would take years and cost millions. No wonder Gilligan and co couldn’t get anything off the ground.</p> <p>This is why, historically, games based on movies and TV shows have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/29/movie-adaptations-video-games-terrible-crack-code\">as terrible</a> as movies based on games: they have to be made on constrained timescales and budgets, so that they can be released while the TV show or movie in question is still on air. I knew a few people who worked at EA Bright Light, the UK studio tasked with adapting the Harry Potter films into games for the Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3 in the 00s. Although those games sucked, it’s a miracle any of them were finished at all, given the insane pressure and compressed schedule developers had. Getting something remotely playable out the door in 11 months or less was a minor miracle.</p> <p>Time and money are difficult problems to solve, no matter how much creative talent at your disposal. The most successful game adaptations tend to be the ones that aren’t time-sensitive: ones based on Tolkien, or the Marvel/DC universes, or the 2020 interpretation of <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1398100/Orwells_Animal_Farm/\">Animal Farm</a>. But perhaps TV creators (and fans) are patient. After a few cheap tie-ins in the early 00s, South Park’s creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone refused to license out any more until they could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/07/south-park-matt-stone-trey-parker-stick-of-truth-video-game\">help make a game themselves</a>, and do it properly. It resulted in the well-received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/04/south-park-stick-of-truth-review\">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a> in 2014, after 5 years of development.</p> <p>Vince Gilligan tells us not to hold our breath for a Breaking Bad video game adaptation, but now that TV, books, film and games are getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/18/super-mario-brothers-karamazov-literature-begins-to-take-gaming-seriously\">friendlier with each other</a>, I wonder whether it might happen in another 5 years. We can wait. They’re only finally releasing <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/656030/The_Lost_Legends_of_Redwall_The_Scout_Act_1/\">games based on the Redwall novels</a> this year, for instance, and it’s been 25 years since I read those. (Relatedly: I have a <em>very </em>detailed hand-illustrated design document for an open-world Redwall adventure-RPG that I wrote when I was 11. If any developers fancy starting a bidding war for it, you know where to find me.)</p> <h2>What to play</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3469f87541fd639f5f3a590e8eec9159ea3aedf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3469f87541fd639f5f3a590e8eec9159ea3aedf4/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Game of Thrones the game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monarchic conundrums …Reigns: Game of Thrones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you want an example of how to make a game based on a TV series without a casual £10 million and half a decade to spare, look at <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/18/reigns-game-of-thrones-review-devolver-digital-nerial\">Reigns: Game of Thrones</a></strong>.

Sliding in and out of one another, cycles of white noise and hiss come and go, along with a deeper, sonorous note, sometimes quickening with a quiet pulse or jolting with staccato beats. A distant door slams with a bark, and dubs into delayed echo, and a metal ladder clatters and screeches on a concrete floor. Or is this a real door shutting somewhere in the building, and someone shifting a ladder in a distant room? Who knows how long I’ll have to wait for the sound to come round again, if it ever does, in <a href=\"https://goldsmithscca.art/exhibition/trevor-mathison/\">Trevor Mathison’s audio installation From Signal to Decay: Volume 1</a>, at the Goldsmiths CCA. There goes that door again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5716d8ef1aed63c582949d722342c76c3f1e484e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5716d8ef1aed63c582949d722342c76c3f1e484e/1831_0_4259_5326/800.jpg\" alt=\"Scottish weather moving in … From Signal to Decay: Volume 1 by Trevor Mathison.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scottish weather moving in … From Signal to Decay: Volume 1 by Trevor Mathison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Harris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A founding member of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/27/art.features\">Black Audio Film Collective</a> during the 1980s, Mathison has gone on to design the sound for numerous films, including several for fellow BAFC member <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr34c_-mCKA\">John Akomfrah</a>. Who is to say where the music begins and ends as it reverberates through the building, changing as we walk around Mathison’s exhibition? Mathison says he’s playing the building back to itself. The sounds creep down corridors and rise through the often under-utilised double height central gallery into the floor above. It shifts as we turn a corner, finding its own boundaries and edges as it meets other sounds from other speakers in the gallery’s spaces. The noise of the New Cross Road, with its dopplering sirens and grinding traffic, is fed straight from a microphone on the street along a corridor, and a muted orchestra joins the mix from a pair of speakers mounted next to a single-channel video in the next room. The silent film shows grey sea and sky, rain at a window, swell on the water, shining droplets on the camera lens, lowering clouds, Scottish weather moving in.</p> <p>Lengths of audio tape dangle from a rail. Numerous DAT and cassette tapes, with collaged photographs and text covers, sit in vitrines alongside notebook drawings and other materials culled from the Walthamstow-born artist’s 40-odd year career. Framed drawings, with intersecting circles and ellipses, with pivots and vectors and arrows and lattices of twirling wave forms appear to function as imaginary scores. I think of Joan Miró and Paul Klee, and the playfulness of John Cage’s notations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac23d01595c8b84a68ac40c006ac7761d550d4b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac23d01595c8b84a68ac40c006ac7761d550d4b7/445_999_6550_3323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pivots and vectors and arrows and lattices … From Signal to Decay: Volume 1.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"507\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pivots and vectors and arrows and lattices … From Signal to Decay: Volume 1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Harris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mathison’s scores might also relate to the artist’s hand movements as he moves his fingers and palms around the gold metallic plates of the <a href=\"https://www.landscape.fm/\">Landscape “touch based feedback instrument”</a> he often uses to create his soundscapes. Working between the analogue and the digital, Mathison’s process appears as much intuitive as it is structured, and uses his body as much as his ear. Other drawings, using graphite on a nubby artist’s paper, pick up the gravelliness of the paper’s texture, and Mathison creates fields of grey differentiated by changes in the amounts of pressure his hand applies. These drawings are also divided by occasional verticals and horizontals – one thinks of horizons and the corners of walls, and of the particles on electromagnetic tape. These drawings also echo the overall texture of Mathison’s soundscape, which has within it all kinds of shifts in depth, timbre and resonance, from which details arise, some scanned from radio broadcasts – a discussion of the Covid vaccination programme in Jamaica, snatches of church singing and reggae and gospel music, all emerging from the whistles and phasing of a radio dial as it scans the stations. Everything connects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4050f891aa0aa5577e126ed65cdf7aea21147b40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4050f891aa0aa5577e126ed65cdf7aea21147b40/2845_0_4369_5464/800.jpg\" alt=\"A space to make you slow down and linger … From Signal to Decay: Volume 1.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A space to make you slow down and linger … From Signal to Decay: Volume 1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Harris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everywhere is always a soundscape of some kind, if only you pay attention to it. Making a distinction between passive hearing and active listening, the composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/may/07/guide-contemporary-music-pauline-oliveros\">Pauline Oliveros</a> said that “to listen is to give attention to what is perceived, both acoustically and psychologically”. When Oliveros performed with a group of musicians in a subterranean concrete cistern in Washington State, the musicians felt that they were playing the space as much as they were their instruments. So it is in Mathison’s engrossing show, which is as much a sculptural as it is an auditory and visual experience. He makes you aware of space, and gets the sound from several different works, as well as the incidental sounds of the building and the world beyond, to all play their part. So it was, too, in Cage’s “silent” 1952 piano piece 4’33”, which redirects the audience’s attention to the space they occupy, to the sounds of the room (whether it is the air conditioning or heating system, outside noises or the bodies on their seats) that intrude.</p> <p>The lower floor of the CCA is the coolest spot to be in London right now. It is a space to make you slow down and linger, to sit and listen and move about, first attending to one thing, then another, to circulate between the rooms along with the sounds, performing your own delays and returns. Mathison has likened his work to the dub reggae recordings and performances of Jamaican sound systems, the innovations of performers and producers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/27/soundtrack-of-a-city-how-dub-reggae-shook-and-shaped-london\">King Tubby</a> and Lee “Scratch” Perry. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/21/edward-george-you-cant-have-afrofuturism-without-some-ambience-of-a-fascist-thinking-creeping-in\">Their influence on artists</a> such as Mathison – and Bahamanian artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/08/in-plain-sight-review-tavares-strachan-baffling-thrilling-visions\">Tavares Strachan</a>, who has said how much sound systems, dub and mixing have informed his work – as well as on later musicians and acoustic artists, is not to be underestimated. Both clamorous and quiet, Mathison’s show is an unexpected and thoughtful delight.</p> <ul> <li><p>Trevor Mathison: From Signal to Decay, Volume 1, is at <a href=\"https://goldsmithscca.art/exhibition/trevor-mathison/\">Goldsmiths CCA, London</a>, until 18 September.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/16/tomato-review-summerhall-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T10:35:59Z","webTitle":"Tomato review – fruity show is ripe for the Edinburgh fringe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/16/tomato-review-summerhall-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/16/tomato-review-summerhall-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"Tomato review – fruity show is ripe for the Edinburgh fringe","trailText":"Veering between danger and comedy, Chou Kuan-Jou’s exploration of sexuality has some potent ideas and clever mood shifts","byline":"Lyndsey Winship","body":"<p>Three semi-nude performers writhing around the stage in a tomato fight. It certainly sounds like the Edinburgh fringe. Chou Kuan-Jou’s Tomato has some qualities ripe for a festival: it’s short (30 minutes), creates a distinctive world, has some potent ideas in a rough form and is novel enough to stand out among a packed programme.</p> <p>Taiwanese choreographer Chou explores sexuality while sharing the stage with a tank full of tomatoes. “How to choose tomatoes …” starts the voiceover, as a man examines them for plumpness, firm flesh, the right number of leaves. On the other side of the stage, Chou in a silk robe, squeezing her own buttock. There’s some fleshy, messy sucking of juices. The metaphors aren’t far away.</p> <p>There are revelations of pleasure, the scratching of intense itches (while doing very little that’s actually explicit) and an edge of violence: a woman laid on the floor, face down, dress pulled up over her head, a man lurching towards her. Chou veers towards danger, pressing the blade of a sharp tomato knife flat against her thigh. She slides it along skin, holding her breath, a literal knife-edge of pain and pleasure. Then she comically puts the water spray between her legs, spritzing in short climatic bursts.</p> <p>There’s something very clever about the sudden shifts of mood. Is this woman’s experience enjoyable, exploitative, funny, sinister? As in real life, it depends on an ultra-fine tuning of sensation and context. This detail Chou does really well. The use of video, the broader attempt to turn all this round on the audience, is less well developed.

May we have more politicians like her","trailText":"We need more politicians who stand by their principles, even if it costs them everything","byline":"Robert Reich","body":"<p>On Tuesday, Wyoming Republicans determine the fate of Representative Liz Cheney, the putative leader of the anti-Trump forces in the Republican party.</p> <p>Six days after the 6 January 2021 attack on the Capitol – when no other Republican in the House or Senate was willing to rebuke Trump – Cheney charged on the House floor that “the president of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.”</p> <p>The next day, Cheney joined nine other House Republicans and 222 Democrats in voting to impeach Trump.</p> <p>So far, three of these 10 principled Republican lawmakers have lost their primaries. Two have won them. The remaining four are retiring.</p> <p>As vice-chair of the House of Representatives’ January 6 committee investigating the causes of that attack, Cheney has ceaselessly and tirelessly helped lay out the case against Trump during eight public hearings held in June and July, with more to come.</p> <p>In response, Trump has done everything possible to end Cheney’s career. He made sure House Republicans revoked her status as the third highest-ranking leader of the Republican caucus, and that Wyoming Republicans censured her.</p> <p>Trump also selected Cheney’s opponent in Tuesday’s Republican primary, Harriet Hageman – who has rallied behind Trump and amplified his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.</p> <p>Hageman has a commanding double-digit lead over Cheney. (According to some reports, Cheney has been reluctant even to venture into Wyoming to campaign, due to death threats.)</p> <p>If Liz Cheney loses her House seat, as seems likely, I hope she doesn’t disappear from public life. Although her views on countless substantive issues are the opposite of mine, I salute her.</p> <p>She has displayed more courage and integrity than almost any other member of her party – indeed, given the pressure she was under, perhaps more than any lawmaker now alive.</p> <p>The role Cheney has played raises a larger question about the meaning of representative democracy. Is it the responsibility of elected officials to represent the views of their constituents or their own principles?</p> <p>The question isn’t limited to Republicans. As the midterms draw closer, some Democratic operatives and pundits argue that Biden and the Democrats must move to the “center” to win.</p> <p>But where is the <em>center</em>? Halfway between democracy and fascism? And if Democrats must go there to win, what’s the point of winning?</p> <p>I call this the Dick Morris paradox.</p> <p>In early 1996, Bill and Hillary Clinton summoned pollster Dick Morris to the White House to make sure Bill Clinton would be re-elected.</p> <p>Morris’s advice to Clinton was to move to the center (“triangulate”) and say nothing in his re-election campaign except that the economy was terrific and would be even better in the second term.</p> <p>Whenever I ran into Morris slithering around the West Wing, I suggested he urge Clinton to advance some policies for the second term’s agenda – a hike in the minimum wage, universal pre-K, paid family leave, Medicare for all.</p> <p>Morris’s invariable response: “If Clinton pushes any of these, there won’t be a second term.”</p> <p>I said there was no point in having a second term without an agenda to do something important <em>in </em>the second term. He argued back that there was no use having an agenda <em>without </em>a second term.</p> <p>But if the only way to get or keep power is to say nothing to the public about what you believe or intend to achieve, or to mislead the public, what’s the point of having power?</p> <p>To Morris and most other political operatives, this question makes no sense. Politics is about getting and keeping power. Principles have nothing to do with it.</p> <p>To Dick Morris operatives, politicians have a responsibility to mirror whatever the public wants or believes.</p> <p>But what if the public has been lied to by a conman who tells them the last election was stolen? What if he has cynically exploited their bigotry, ignorance or distrust?</p> <p>Should candidates merely reflect what the conman has stirred up, as Hageman has done in Wyoming and other Republican candidates are doing with Trump’s “big lie” elsewhere?</p> <p>Or should candidates risk losing political power (or never gaining it) by standing on their own principles?</p> <p>The dilemma on the Democrats’ side is not nearly as dangerous for the nation, but it exists, nonetheless.</p> <p>Some of today’s Democratic candidates are moving to the so-called “center” because they’ve convinced themselves they must do so to gain or hold power, which is better than not having any.</p> <p>But is gaining or holding power more important than telling the public what one truly believes, and speaking truth?</p> <ul> <li><p>Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/saving-capitalism-for-the-many-not-the-few/9780345806222\">Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-common-good-9780525436379/9780525436379\">The Common Good</a>.

A few months ago, government-owned liquor outlets were deluged after offering hefty discounts for the first time: buy one, get one free, and 50% off on every kind of alcohol.</p> <p>The unprecedented discounts were being offered because shopkeepers had to deplete their stocks before the new policy came in.</p> <p>The AAP was poised to get out of the business of running off-licences and hand them over to private owners. The new shops were to be modern and well-lit, unlike the dingy hole-in the-wall shops where alcohol used to be sold, and they would be open until 3am. The legal drinking age was to be reduced from 25 to 21.</p> <p>The policy, however, quickly became a flashpoint between the AAP and the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which rules at the federal level from New Delhi.

The current holder of the position, Vinai Kumar Saxena, accused the AAP of “procedural lapses” – a euphemism for corruption – in the tendering process.</p> <p>The federal Central Bureau of Investigation, controlled by the BJP, began investigating the allegations.</p> <p>Faced with opposition, the AAP announced on 30 July that its policy was to be scrapped and the Delhi government would take control of the shops again.</p> <p>Overnight, the feast turned into a famine. Special offers were gone and there was no a drop of liquor to be had. Off-licences were shut while bars and restaurants had no alcohol to sell.</p> <p>Determined drinkers have been driving across the border into neighbouring Haryana state, which has a different policy.</p> <p>The context of the crisis is the political rivalry between the BJP and the AAP, which projects itself as an alternative to the BJP.</p> <p>This rivalry has led to frequent clashes in the past, particularly as the central-government appointed lieutenant governor has the final word on all decisions taken by the Delhi government.</p> <p>“Basically, this is all political and nothing to do with alcohol,” said a Delhi resident who did not want to be named. “The revenue from the awarding of licences generated a large amount of money for the AAP which it can use to fight the BJP in elections. The BJP wants to dry up the AAM’s funds, which is why it has attacked the new policy.”</p> <p>Subhash Brar (name changed), who was awarded a licence in Greater Kailash, said he was shocked at the U-turn, but understood the AAP’s reversal in policy.</p> <p>“It is faced with a CBI investigation, political pressure from the BJP and the fact that the lieutenant governor, the final authority, will take the BJP’s side. It made any fight futile,” he said.</p> <p>Until 1 September, Delhi is to be a dry city and even then, it is not known exactly how many off-licences will reopen.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/16/scott-morrison-five-more-secret-ministries-minister-portfolio-ministry-including-treasury-home-affairs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T10:02:39Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison secretly appointed to five ministries, including Treasury and home affairs, says PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/scott-morrison-five-more-secret-ministries-minister-portfolio-ministry-including-treasury-home-affairs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/scott-morrison-five-more-secret-ministries-minister-portfolio-ministry-including-treasury-home-affairs","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison secretly appointed to five ministries, including Treasury and home affairs, says PM","trailText":"Anthony Albanese says former prime minister oversaw ‘unprecedented trashing of our democracy’ as Morrison’s colleagues Ken Wyatt and Karen Andrews call for him to be held accountable","byline":"Josh Butler and Sarah Martin","body":"<p>The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says Scott Morrison was appointed to five additional ministries, including Treasury and home affairs, labelling his predecessor’s actions an “unprecedented trashing of our democracy”.</p> \n<p>The previous home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, has <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/scott-morrison-appointed-himself-to-five-additional-portfolios-20220816-p5ba8c.html\">called for Morrison</a> to resign from parliament following the revelations, but the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is standing by his former leader.</p> \n<p>Ken Wyatt, another former cabinet colleague, has criticised Morrison for not respecting cabinet as a “key instrument in the Westminster system”, but called for him to stay in parliament so he can be held accountable.</p> \n<p>“It is disappointing for our democracy,” Wyatt said. “I was just blown away, I had absolutely no knowledge of it.”</p> \n<p>When asked if he agreed with the calls for Morrison to resign, Wyatt said he needed to stay in parliament to be held accountable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/scott-morrison-defends-secret-portfolios-as-right-decision-in-unconventional-times\">Scott Morrison defends secret ministry appointments as ‘right decision’ in unconventional times</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“When somebody leaves parliament, you are fundamentally out of the system and you are not accountable,” he said. “I think for him to remain there and justify what has happened is important and I am interested to hear what the former prime minister has to say.”</p> \n<p>Former Liberal prime minister John Howard said on Tuesday night that Morrison should not resign because it would trigger an “unnecessary” byelection in a safe Liberal seat.</p> \n<p>Howard told ABC TV he believed “most people” wanted to “get on with the present and the future”.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think it’s something that is so reeking with principle as to require an unwanted, expensive, unnecessary byelection,” Howard said.</p> \n<p>Dutton said he did not agree with the call for Morrison to leave parliament and said the early days of the pandemic had required the government to make judgments about what was needed in a “difficult situation”.</p> \n<p>“It was a war-like situation and there was concern about what would happen,” Dutton said.</p> \n<p>In an explosive revelation following investigations from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Albanese said the former Liberal leader may have held those positions until the Coalition’s election loss in May.</p> \n<p>It came just hours after Morrison himself claimed he didn’t recall being sworn into any other ministry beyond health, finance and resources.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"efd4ccf7-312c-4fe0-9d9d-8c128924f4e2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vXiCXvd4cQ0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“It is completely extraordinary that these appointments were kept secret by the Morrison government,” Albanese said at a press conference in Canberra, after briefings from his department.</p> \n<p>“It’s undermined our democracy.

A number of variables were mentioned but one in particular was cited as the primary reason: “Raw meat-eating Afrikaners.”</p> <p>Agnew then reached for a collective noun for these brutish seamers who feast on biltong from the time they can chew. The Beeb’s statistician, Andy Zaltzman, whose father is South African, offered the term “herd”.</p> <p>Agnew and Zaltzman were being complimentary. They were admiring, not ridiculing, these impressive athletes. Overt strength on the sports field is a quality highly valued in the Afrikaans community. It is often cited as a contributing factor behind the success of the Springboks rugby team and the meat-munching trope is well worn around <em>braais</em> (South African barbecues) across the country.</p> <p>But here’s the thing. Any joke hinges on its context. And hearing two British men with very British accents talk about some of South Africa’s greatest fast bowlers in such glib terms was mildly infuriating. As a South African, I wasn’t alone.</p> <p>“I’ve heard it a thousand times before and yes, it does come across as a bit demeaning,” says Allan Donald, the alpha of the Afrikaans quicks who terrorised a generation of batters, taking 330 Test wickets at 22.25 runs apiece. “It still gets to me sometimes. It does diminish the skill and tactical nous that you have to develop to be a successful bowler.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ba0769e673557948e0034ca3fb1959809bc83d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ba0769e673557948e0034ca3fb1959809bc83d2/0_0_1251_750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allan Donald bowls Michael Atherton for a duck in Johannesburg in November 1999\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘You have to be physically fit to bowl fast’: Allan Donald bowls Michael Atherton for a duck in Johannesburg in November 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Naden/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No one could deny Donald’s genius with a ball. He could move it both ways, could hit any length at will and developed several slower balls throughout his two decades as a professional, including a 13-year stint at Warwickshire where he took 536 first-class wickets. Still, even he had to contend with the stereotypes.</p> <p>“My teammates on the county scene would ask me: ‘What do you guys eat down there?’ It felt simplistic. But I knew it was mostly meant in a good way. I chose to take it in good faith.”</p> <p>Not that Donald dismisses the theory out of hand. “You have to be physically fit to bowl fast,” he says, acknowledging that many of the South African bowlers of the past 30 years, including Fanie de Villiers, Morne Morkel and André Nel, for their power and poise through the crease. But that doesn’t account for the records of Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock and Kagiso Rabada. What’s behind their success?</p> <p>“You have to look at conditions, that’s the most important factor,” says Vincent Barnes, Cricket South Africa’s high-performance manager and a former slingy fast bowler whose best years were spent in the confines of the “non-white” leagues of apartheid South Africa. “The hardness of South African wickets, and the fact they don’t fall apart, allows us to develop fast bowlers from an early age.”</p> <p>Along with their skills, South Africans cultivate a deep appreciation for this primal craft on bouncy decks. According to Barnes, captains and coaches are more likely to give a young tearaway another spell after giving up runs in their first set. This same patience is not afforded to expensive spinners or probing medium-pacers.</p> <p>“It’s a mindset thing,” Donald says. “There is a South African mentality, across all cultures, that says: ‘You’re not going to beat me.’ We’re aggressive. It’s in the DNA. We want to be the main guy. It’s a rush knocking stumps out the ground and knocking guys on the head. Not everyone can do it. You feel invincible when you’re bowling with genuine pace.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/13/dean-elgar-england-style-can-go-two-ways-south-africa-cricket-bazball\">Dean Elgar: ‘England’s style can go two ways. It can go south quickly’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the country’s readmission to Test cricket in 1992, four South Africans – Steyn, Pollock, Ntini and Donald – feature in the top 10 wicket-takers for seam bowlers. England, with Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, have two. No other team has more than one. This is partly why opening batters have a lower average in South Africa than in any country that has hosted more than one Test. Unsurprisingly, the combined average of South African fast bowlers – 26.58 – is better than all their counterparts apart from Ireland’s, though they’ve played only three matches in this time.</p> <p>That average rises, though, to 31.04 when playing in England, worse than Australia, Zimbabwe, Pakistan and the hosts. It is no secret bowlers need to bowl a fuller length on softer pitches. Is that anathema to the macho South African ideology?</p> <p>“That was never an issue for me,” says Donald, who averaged 23.62 in England and bowled one of the most hostile spells ever seen against Michael Atherton at Trent Bridge in 1998. “Whatever length I bowled, I still wanted to hit it hard. I never had to temper my attitude or pace. I always maintained the energy on the ball. Nortje and Rabada might tweak their length, but they’ll still smash it with great intensity.”</p> <p>Besides undercooked beef, something else will fuel South Africa as they seek to end a run of three consecutive series defeats against England. “We always made it personal against them,” Donald says. “We were constantly reminded this was where the game started, that Lord’s was sacred. We often joked England was our Ashes. Beating them in their home meant the world to us. This current group will feel exactly the same.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our weekly cricket email, The Spin. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-spin\" title=\"\">To subscribe and get the full edition, visit this page and follow the instructions</a>.</strong></em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/16/asian-americans-gun-ownership","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T10:00:42Z","webTitle":"Asian Americans are buying guns in record numbers.

From 2015 to 2019, FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Report documented <a href=\"https://gunviolence.issuelab.org/resources/39258/39258.pdf\">37 justifiable firearm homicides</a> committed by Asian Americans. By contrast, more than 3,000 Asian Americans died in firearm suicides, homicides and accidental shootings during the same time period. Among Asian American youth, the firearm suicide rate rose by <a href=\"https://www.everytown.org/press/new-study-shows-young-children-have-increase-in-suicidal-thoughts/\">71</a>% over the last decade – the largest growth of any racial or ethnic group, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> \n<p>The National Rifle Association, meanwhile, has taken the pandemic as an opportunity to more <a href=\"https://vpc.org/how-the-firearms-industry-markets-guns-to-asian-americans-covid/\">aggressively market</a> guns to Asian Americans. Varun Nikore, executive director of AAPI Victory Alliance, said it’s opportunistic for gun manufacturers to court the group given the existing data linking rising gun ownership rates to firearm-related deaths.</p> \n<p>“They’re directly exploiting our pain and trauma by doing direct and targeted campaigns to increase the amount of gun ownership in communities that have not typically had it,” he said. “And they’re doing it just for profit.”</p> \n<p>Some gun rights activists, though, see the current surge as the dismantling of historical barriers, since Asians on the west coast were not always allowed to practice their second amendment rights. In 1923, California passed a law denying non-citizens the right to possess concealable firearms. That ruled out Chinese immigrants, a majority of whom were barred from naturalizing by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.</p> \n<p>Asian Pacific American Gun Owners Association, a non-partisan group formed last March amid a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, publishes educational materials regarding gun safety and usage in multiple Asian languages. Chris Cheng, a board member and winner of History Channel’s Top Shot competition, said that the civil unrest and relentless scapegoating over the past couple of years have pushed many Asians to arm up for the first time in their lives.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You’ve seen people get shot and killed by police.

Why doesn’t the government?","trailText":"The current crisis could drag half of UK households into fuel poverty, says shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband","byline":"Ed Miliband","body":"<p>The cost of living emergency facing the British people is not an inevitable, unalterable fact of life. We are told so often by government ministers that the pain and anguish the British people are facing is something we have to get used to, and all we can do is tinker round the edges. This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/energy-price-crisis-what-are-parties-and-tory-leader-hopefuls-proposing-labour-sunak-truss-starmer\">energy bill crisis </a>will devastate millions of families and could force <a href=\"https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2022/research/fuel-poverty-uk/\">more than half of British households</a> into fuel poverty. Unlike the Conservatives, Labour is not willing to stand by and allow that social catastrophe to happen. This is why Labour has proposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/15/keir-starmer-radical-plan-freeze-energy-bills-needed-cut-inflation\">freeze energy prices</a>.</p> <p>It’s important we understand the deeper lessons this moment teaches us. First, while some of the causes of this cost of living crisis are driven by global factors, its effects – who suffers, who pays and who government protects – are not predetermined. It is a deeply political decision: the Conservatives have opted to let families and businesses pay unsustainably high energy bills ​while oil and gas companies enjoy huge and unexpected profits.​</p> <p>The second lesson is that affordable energy should be a right for people across our society, and government must ensure that right. Whether a service is provided publicly or privately, there are duties of government that cannot be ducked. David Cameron accused me of “<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-24639879\">living in a Marxist universe</a>” when I proposed applying a cap to energy bills as Labour leader. He was dead wrong. Markets need rules to prevent exploitation. Governments must be willing to intervene when there is a profound risk to people’s economic security. Beyond this crisis, we need to bring fundamental reform to our failing energy system, which is currently delivering neither affordability nor security for our country.</p> <p>Third, we must draw the right long-term conclusions about energy policy. This is not, as some would claim, the first net-zero crisis. It is just the latest fossil-fuel crisis. Our job should be to ensure that it is the last. The undeniable truth is that while we remain dependent on fossil fuels, we are vulnerable to the geopolitics of energy. Petrostates, dictators and politicians such as Vladimir Putin are using energy as a weapon of war. Gas prices currently stand at <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2022/07/17/uk-offshore-wind-costs-4-times-less-than-gas-fired-thermal-generation/\">four times the price</a> of the cheapest renewables.</p> <p>There is only one reliable, sustainable long-term path out of this crisis. That is to get on, now, with the clean energy sprint Labour has been calling for month after month. We should be investing in homegrown onshore wind energy, offshore wind, solar, hydrogen and nuclear energy as well as a national mission to insulate homes.</p> <p>The fourth lesson goes well beyond energy policy. It’s important to recognise that the energy insecurity millions of people face is a consequence of their financial insecurity and our economic insecurity. We live in a country where <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62057301\">80% of people</a> have savings of less than £500. Twelve years of low growth under the Conservatives have left people, on average, much worse off.</p> <p>If the growth rates under the last Labour government had been maintained, average wages would be a staggering £7,000 higher by now. That is why Labour’s climate investment pledge is such an important commitment. Our plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/27/labour-promises-spend-28bn-year-tackling-climate-crisis\">invest £28bn</a> every year over the next decade will ​help to build new industries and create good jobs at decent wages to deal with the root causes of our economic weakness.</p> <p>The final lesson is about the battle lines of the next general election.<strong> </strong>A deep ideological failure runs through the Conservative party. Nowhere is this clearer than in the leadership contest between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss. As chancellor, Sunak had to be dragged kicking and screaming towards introducing a windfall tax. He only succumbed once the tax included a giant loophole. Meanwhile Truss has looked at this grotesque transfer of wealth from households to oil and gas giants and decided to come out against windfall taxes in principle, decrying them as a “<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/uk-news/truss-sunak-tory-energy-bills-b2144068.html\">Labour idea</a>”.</p> <p>These candidates are stuck in the dogma of the past, believing the state must stand back and let market forces run wild, whatever the consequences. They believe we should measure the success and security of our country by the balance sheets of BP and Shell, not the bank balances of the British people.</p> <p>This is now a central divide in British politics. The Conservatives, lurching from one failed leader to another, who show that they will stand up for the powerful vested interests rather than the British people. And Labour, ​who have bold policies that put working people first.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ed Miliband is the Labour MP for Doncaster North and is shadow business, energy and industry secretary</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/16/birth-endangered-red-panda-cub-uk-zoo-symbol-of-hope-little","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T09:51:29Z","webTitle":"Birth of endangered red panda cub at UK zoo a ‘symbol of hope’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/birth-endangered-red-panda-cub-uk-zoo-symbol-of-hope-little","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/16/birth-endangered-red-panda-cub-uk-zoo-symbol-of-hope-little","fields":{"headline":"Birth of endangered red panda cub at UK zoo a ‘symbol of hope’","trailText":"Father of Little Red died in June but mother, Tilly, gave birth last month after four-year breeding project","byline":"Jamie Grierson","body":"<p>When the protagonist of Pixar’s animated movie Turning Red morphs into a giant red panda, her chaotic transformation is anything but welcome.</p> <p>But at Paradise wildlife park in Hertfordshire, the birth of a real-life endangered red panda cub has been celebrated as a “symbol of hope”.</p> <p>The mother, Tilly, gave birth to the cub, named Little Red, on 16 July with the moment captured by CCTV at the zoo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee82bd4271858be4c463b6a274830ac4e43d841c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee82bd4271858be4c463b6a274830ac4e43d841c/526_54_1449_1810/801.jpg\" alt=\"Tilly, who gave birth to Little Red at the wildlife park in Hertfordshire\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tilly, who gave birth to Little Red at the wildlife park in Hertfordshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Everett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It has taken four years for Tilly to become pregnant and it is seen as a bittersweet moment after her breeding partner, Nam Pang, died of Addison’s disease a month before the cub was born.</p> <p>Interest in red pandas rose this year with the release of Disney Pixar’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/07/turning-red-review-pandas-and-pop-music-collide-in-solid-pixar-caper\">Turning Red</a>, in which Mei Lee, a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian student, transforms into a giant red panda when she experiences any strong emotion due to a hereditary curse.

The night was cold and windy, the sky prepped for a storm. For the first time in the history of professional English theatre, a woman was taking to the stage.</p> <p>“It must have felt extraordinary,” says Eve Pearson-Wright, from the husband-and-wife company Long Lane Theatre. Its new production, The Actress, explores the era. “These women – who have lived through the Puritan era – are suddenly witnessing one of their own, up there on stage, going toe to toe with the men.”</p> <p>Considered immoral and immodest, London’s theatres were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_theatre_closure_1642\" title=\"\">closed by the Long Parliament in 1642</a>, just after the start of the English civil war. They were reopened by Charles II in 1660, when two men were licensed to produce shows. One was William Davenant, a poet and playwright, the other Thomas Killigrew, a dramatist and theatre manager, who presented Othello on Vere Street. “During the Puritan era, Killigrew had been in France, where they had female actors,” says Andrew Pearson-Wright, the other half of Long Lane Theatre. “He must have seen what having women on stage could add to a story.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"35af1beb594be55ab4d067702250cb75272fa528\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35af1beb594be55ab4d067702250cb75272fa528/0_0_4159_5197/800.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of Margaret ‘Peg’ Hughes\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A portrait of Margaret ‘Peg’ Hughes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On that December night, when strong gusts were blowing thatch off nearby roofs, the woman on stage was playing Desdemona. But the finer details of her performance are lost. While historians tend to agree that this is the first recorded date on which a woman acted professionally, there is no consensus on who she was. </p> <p>Initial research for the play led the Pearson-Wrights to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hughes\" title=\"\">Margaret “Peg” Hughes</a>. “She was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/28/nell-gwynn-review-shakespeares-globe-gugu-mbatha-raw\" title=\"\">Nell Gwyn</a>-type figure, five years prior to Gwyn,” says Andrew. “She was glamorous and well painted and had an affair with the king’s cousin. She’d almost become this celebrity.”</p> <p>When Andrew started writing a play about the pioneer, he focused on Hughes, with Eve stepping into the role. But, diving deeper, they stumbled upon <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Marshall\" title=\"\">Anne Marshall</a>, a chaplain’s daughter, whom a handful of academics claim played the role instead. “She felt to me like an actor’s actor, from the parts she played and the way she was considered and written about,” he says. “Her sister became an actor, she married an actor – it felt like she’d been ingrained in the craft.”</p> <p>Hughes and Marshall performed at around the same time, but Andrew says historians aren’t certain who was first. In The Actress, Long Lane Theatre have tried to fill in the gaps. In their story, Marshall, a working-class woman who is painted less well and less often, is pitched by the show’s producer against Hughes, a confident, glamorous woman who is more in line with what the (male) audience wants to see.</p> <p>The view of the audience was central. For a woman in the 17th century, being an actor wasn’t just a question of choosing an unusual career; it was about your place in society and how you were willing to be seen. Acting and sex work were inextricably tied; women who acted were leered at and looked down on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were men who didn’t want to work with them, producers that wanted to exploit them. But they didn’t give up</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“In the restoration period, the audience would have a choice,” Andrew says. “They could watch the show at the front, or pay to sit in the dressing rooms and watch the women change. They were made to be looked at and exposed.” The overtly sexualised role of female actors feels relevant today, Eve says: “We keep making the point in the play that it’s the men who get to decide which women are remembered.”</p> <p>The couple have experience of creating theatrical stories that celebrate the underdog from historical moments. In 2018, they took to Edinburgh and later toured The Giant Killers, a show about a football team of mill workers in the 1870s, when the game was played only by the upper classes. They are reviving The Giant Killers <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/giant-killers\" title=\"\">at this year’s fringe</a>, alongside The Actress and a children’s show, <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/arty-s-ani-magination\" title=\"\">Arthur’s Ani-Magination</a>. To take all three shows to the fringe, they formed a repertory theatre of seven actors.</p> <p>Doing rep theatre has long been a dream for Andrew. As a child, he would visit his grandparents every summer in Pitlochry, Perthshire, and go to the theatre to watch the rep company. “That’s where I fell in love with acting,” he says. “It allows actors to perform roles you didn’t know were in their range.” It also makes good business sense, allowing them to stay longer in one place, with more to offer a theatre and an audience. Eve says: “When you work on a play, you become a family with the cast, then you disappear. The idea of creating rep is that we can build it further and stay with them for longer.”</p> <p>This delight in collaboration is woven into the way they tell this story of 17th-century drama. Rather than pitting Hughes and Marshall against each other, The Actress is an ode to both women. “It would have been so easy for them to give up,” Eve says. “There were men who didn’t want to work with them, producers that wanted to exploit them. But they didn’t give up. I like to imagine they fought for those opportunities. It’s in an actor’s nature to do that. And in doing so – in being tenacious – they didn’t just make a name for themselves; they made a life for others.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/actress\" title=\"\"><em>The Actress</em></a><em> is at Underbelly, Bristo Square, until 29 August</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/16/steve-grimmett-frontman-of-metal-band-grim-reaper-dies-aged-62","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T09:40:00Z","webTitle":"Steve Grimmett, frontman of metal band Grim Reaper, dies aged 62","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/16/steve-grimmett-frontman-of-metal-band-grim-reaper-dies-aged-62","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/16/steve-grimmett-frontman-of-metal-band-grim-reaper-dies-aged-62","fields":{"headline":"Steve Grimmett, frontman of metal band Grim Reaper, dies aged 62","trailText":"Part of the new wave of British heavy metal, Grim Reaper formed in 1979, with Grimmett joining in 1982","byline":"Laura Snapes","body":"<p>Steve Grimmett, the frontman of British heavy metal band Grim Reaper known for his piercing head voice, has died aged 62.</p> <p>The news was <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/russell.grimmett/posts/10159140004028379\">confirmed by his son Russ Grimmett</a> on Facebook: “We can’t begin to put into words the current feelings.

It drove me mad that I just didn’t have more time than that, but that was the driving force that kept me going.”</p> <p>They released another album, At the Gates, in 2019. “It’s about me very nearly dying when I lost my leg in Ecuador,” <a href=\"http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/musicians/grim-reaper-s-steve.htm\">Grimmett told Metal Temple</a>.

But you are wearing a kimono, as a Chinese. You are a Chinese! Are you?”</p> <p>Hanfu is a term for traditional Han Chinese dress. The woman asked why she was being yelled at and was told she was suspected of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, a catchall accusation used routinely by Chinese authorities against dissidents, journalists and activists.</p> <p>The video cuts out shortly after she is grabbed by officers and taken away.</p> <p>The woman said she had been queuing for food on a street famed for its Japanese restaurants when the officer approached. She said she was taken to the station and questioned for about five hours until 1am and that her phone was searched and her kimono confiscated. She said she was “educated” and told not to discuss the incident online.</p> <p>Suzhou police could not be contacted and are yet to comment publicly on the woman’s claims.</p> <p>The video was viewed by tens of millions and prompted heated discussion on Chinese social media, where nationalism has been on the rise. Hostility or unease towards Japan has existed within China for decades, over its brutal invasion and occupation of China and wartime atrocities such as the Nanjing massacre. Regular visits by Japanese politicians to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/japan-ministers-visit-controversial-war-shrine-as-south-korea-calls-for-end-to-historical-tensions\">Yasukuni shrine</a> also routinely prompt outrage in China and other Asian nations such as South Korea.</p> <p>In recent years, Japan’s government has grown more outwardly assertive towards Beijing’s expansionist behaviour in the region, in particular towards Taiwan. As it has more closely aligned with the US and other western allies, official and domestic Chinese anger towards Japan has grown.</p> <p>But online many commenters appeared to think the woman’s alleged treatment was over-the-top. Some urged people to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/31/china-is-powerful-now-beijings-aggressive-global-stance-sparks-wave-of-nationalism\">cool down the “ultra-nationalism”</a> or expressed concern about judging the clothes people wore.

That’s the tenor of the coverage following the attack on Salman Rushdie. So is it also our take when a comedian uses “extreme racism, sexism, homophobia and misogyny” onstage? That’s the question surrounding the cancellation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/14/jerry-sadowitz-edinburgh-fringe-show-cancelled-over-extreme-racism-homophobia-and-misogyny\">Jerry Sadowitz’s show</a> on the Edinburgh fringe, and – spoiler alert – I, a mere comedy critic, am not certain of the answer.</p> <p>What I do know is that this marks a watershed moment. Many of the earlier cancel culture v comedy furores have involved powerful acts (your <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fstage%2F2021%2Foct%2F07%2Fdave-chappelle-transgender-netflix-special-backlash&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7Cf3600bcd1b974ba2826308da7ee6ceaf%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637961827025792004%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=wkpeYLAVkf6AF6OALLqdPS5NI3u1j%2Ft5Xi23NenuldY%3D&amp;reserved=0\">Dave Chappelles</a>, Ricky Gervaises and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/04/jimmy-carr-condemned-for-joke-about-gypsies-in-netflix-special\">Jimmy Carrs</a>) not being cancelled at all. I’m being silenced, they yell, halfway through their Netflix specials.</p> <p>It’s a different story this time. Here’s a show that has been pulled hours before its performance, denying hundreds of ticket-holders their chance to see it, in response to complaints from audience and staff about Sadowitz calling Rishi Sunak a P-word and flashing his penis at the front row. The decision has caused much debate, with some critics, among them famous comedians, citing the need to defend free speech and artistic creativity and others insisting that Sadowitz has crossed a line, beyond which there’s no debate to be had.</p> <p>It’s important to note here that Sadowitz is a very different act from Gervais and Carr: low status, stubbornly niche, the connoisseur’s misanthrope. I dislike boorish comedy that punches down for kicks, and I appreciate it can be hard to spot the difference when an act only seems to be doing so – especially when they’re quoted out of context amid a hysterical media storm. But writing about the offensive comedy debate, Sadowitz has long been my go-to exemplar: if you’re as skilful as he is, if you take the pains he takes to contextualise the material, you can be as brutally unpleasant as you like without censure. That appears no longer to be the case.</p> <p>Is the Pleasance at fault, for booking him then being outraged at his “extreme” material? (His most famous opening line? “Nelson Mandela: what a cunt!”) What Sadowitz does is well known. He sets himself up as a hideous sad-sack of a human being, bitterly enraged at his own enfeeblement and the state of the world. Yes, the jokes are horrific, gasp-inducingly so. But the full package – a disturbo-charged portrait of hate and self-hate; an invitation to laugh at how deep into the gutter the human imagination can sink – is (when he’s on form, which he isn’t always) compelling. And, as distinct from Chappelle and Gervais, you’re not meant to admire this character’s opinions. You’re meant to be appalled by them.</p> <p>I don’t believe comedians should get a free pass (“it’s just a joke”) to be as abusive as they like. Yes, allowance should be made for context: this is a comedy show, and audiences at a Sadowitz gig have paid to be outraged. But comics should be receptive to trenchant criticism if this is their shtick. And venues have the right to book, and not book, who they want. And yet, within all that, I’d defend a space for comics like Sadowitz, performing one of humour’s age-old functions, as a safety valve for our darkest, most transgressive impulses.</p> <p>Easy for you to say, cis white male critic! – against whom racial slurs of the type Sadowitz used are seldom directed. I can see the point when the black British comedian London Hughes <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fglobal%2F2019%2Fsep%2F21%2Flondon-hughes-comedy-to-catch-a-dick-dont-hate-the-playaz&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7Cf3600bcd1b974ba2826308da7ee6ceaf%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637961827025792004%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=AHz5uiWoxUJT9XXpqeI7PcrKybUDIhODJZt8GZfFCEM%3D&amp;reserved=0\">tweets</a>: “Lol white male comics, if you can’t be funny without being racist or getting your dick out, then I dunno, maybe comedy just isn’t your thing?” (That said, perhaps Hughes plunges us further into insensitivity here by assuming Sadowitz identifies as a “white comic”. He is Jewish.)</p> <p>What makes defending Sadowitz hard, particularly for someone like me, is the consensus that certain words (the P-word, the N-word) cannot be used, under any circumstances, no matter the size of the quote marks, by white people. I’ve no argument with that, save to remark that it’s a fundamentalist position, and free speech is a nuanced thing. It’s always needed caveats and exceptions. Ban words outright, and we’re back where US comic George Carlin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jun/28/arrest-joke-history-gags-offensive-punters-cops-police-joe-lycett-sacha-baron-cohen-jo-brand\">got arrested</a> for his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyBH5oNQOS0\">Seven Words You Can’t Say on Television</a> routine (cocksucker, motherfucker, and the rest) in 1972. </p> <p>Carlin’s radar twitched at the sensitivity around those words, and he walked towards it. That’s what some comics do, Sadowitz among them. A comic also needs a radar for the changing times: what was funny to a lot of people in 1972, or 1990, may not be funny to a lot of people now. New and more mindful modes of comedy are emerging, in a new generation’s hands – and they’re exciting to watch and write about. Maybe Sadowitz should better tailor his act to these changing tastes and times? Or maybe (“I have never once,” as he wrote in response to the row, “courted a mainstream audience”) he doesn’t want to? It’s his choice. In the meantime, audiences and programmers should look a little harder at the small print before booking Sadowitz next time – or refusing to do so. The title of his cancelled show, after all?

His campaign kicks off this week with rallies in São Paulo and Belo Horizonte.</p> <p>Ironically, the most prominent victim of violence in recent years is Bolsonaro, who was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/06/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-far-right-presidential-candidate-stabbed\"> stabbed at a campaign event in September 2018</a>, just weeks before the election that brought him to power.</p> <p>He spent three weeks in hospital and was forced to undergo surgeries as a result of the attack, carried out by a lone assailant with mental health problems.</p> <p>The incident, though, did not temper his outlook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"767a56f1ecc42be61aa420579fd29b06e30a9182\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/767a56f1ecc42be61aa420579fd29b06e30a9182/0_52_1546_928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jair Bolsonaro during a March for Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, 13 August 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jair Bolsonaro during a March for Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mauro Pimentel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former army captain was already notorious for his love of weapons and his close links to the military, where he served for 15 years. One of his trademark moves is to make a gun with his thumb and index finger and he once joked he would like to “strafe” members of the Workers’ party.</p> <p>It was only weeks after taking power that his justice minister sought to reduce punishment for law enforcement officials who killed suspects while acting with “excusable fear, surprise or violent emotion”.</p> <p>The wording was removed from the eventual bill but under Bolsonaro’s watch congress has passed 20 different measures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/15/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-guns-easier-to-acquire\">making it easier to buy weapons</a>. In the first two years of his government alone the number of gun licenses issued in Brazil rose by 65% to more than 1m, according to the NGO Instituto Sou da Paz.</p> <p>Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper, has also spent much of the last year undermining the electoral system, repeating baseless claims about the reliability of Brazil’s electronic ballot boxes and insulting the judges who preside over the supreme electoral court, which organises the election and sanctions results.</p> <p>He has hinted at the possibility of closing congress and in May told evangelical voters that “Only God can remove me” – a comment that prompted fears of a Trump-like insurrection if the vote goes against him.</p> <p>“There is good reason to fear a possible Brazilian January 6 kind of situation,” said Nunes. “The conditions are there for this to happen.”</p> <p>Although Bolsonaro has the backing of many in the military, it is unclear whether the top brass would support any attempt to subvert the democratic process.</p> <p>Bolsonaro, though, is obviously preparing his supporters for action. Last week he told agricultural leaders, “Buy your guns! It’s in the Bible!”</p> <p>“He is doing it to focus attention away from the country’s real problems and frighten the opposition, as well as to keep his militant base charged,” said Felipe Borba, the coordinator of a political violence thinktank at Rio’s Unirio university.</p> <p>“It’s also done to prepare his side for a violent reaction if they lose.”</p> <p>Borba said Bolsonaro wants to accumulate chips for the high-stakes poker game that will come after the election, which will go to a runoff on 30 October if no candidate gets a majority on 2 October.</p> <p>A congressional inquiry into his disastrous handling of the pandemic – 680,000 Brazilians perished from the Covid-19 virus, more than any other country outside the United States – accused the president of nine offences, including crimes against humanity. He also faces charges related to his spread of fake news.</p> <p>If he loses, he could face jail time and those close to the president said he is terrified at the prospect. Borba believes the sabre-rattling is a tactic aimed “at gaining power in any possible amnesty negotiation for him and his family. He needs to show strength.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/09/brazil-election-bolsonaro-dictatorship-democracy\">Brazilians fear return to dictatorship as ‘deranged’ Bolsonaro trails in polls</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bolsonaro continues to trail in the polls with one study this week giving Lula <a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2022/pesquisa-eleitoral/noticia/2022/08/15/ipec-lula-tem-44percent-e-bolsonaro-32percent-no-1-turno-de-2022.ghtml\">a 12-point lead</a>, although the gap has narrowed slightly in recent weeks. </p> <p>Lula remains the favourite but Bolsonaro has the government machine at his disposal and has already increased the amount of monthly aid handouts given to 18 million of Brazil’s poorest families.</p> <p>Whether that will be enough to close the gap remains to be seen but political analysts said the incumbent can win only by taking votes directly from Lula.</p> <p>“If he keeps growing by consolidating votes from those who in theory should be voting for him, the kind of people who hate Lula more than anything and who were maybe not entirely happy with his government, then that won’t change the game,” said Vítor Oliveira, a political scientist with the Pulso Público consultancy.</p> <p>“He needs to take votes from Lula to win; there is no other way.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/aug/16/politics-scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-gas-ministers-dutton-qld-victoria-nsw-weather-covid-live-news-melbourne-sydney","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T09:04:35Z","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce says ‘nothing illegal done’ by former PM amid calls to resign – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/16/politics-scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-gas-ministers-dutton-qld-victoria-nsw-weather-covid-live-news-melbourne-sydney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/16/politics-scott-morrison-anthony-albanese-gas-ministers-dutton-qld-victoria-nsw-weather-covid-live-news-melbourne-sydney","fields":{"headline":"Barnaby Joyce says ‘nothing illegal done’ by former PM amid calls to resign – as it happened","trailText":"This blog is now closed","byline":"Mostafa Rachwani and Natasha May","body":"<div id=\"block-62fb55988f08b32cd20071f5\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T08:59:16.024Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">What we learned: Tuesday, 16 August</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And with that, we will close the blog for the day.

deputy premier <strong>John Barilaro</strong> for a lucrative New York trade job was not done “fully in keeping” with the code of ethics governing public servants in the state, a long-awaited report into the appointment had found.</p> \n  <p>The report by the former NSW public service commissioner <strong>Graeme Head</strong> was released today, following a press conference in which the premier, <strong>Dominic Perrottet</strong>, admitted to “fundamental errors” and “mistakes” during the hiring process.</p> \n  <p>Perrottet said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It’s very clear that mistakes have been made, not just at one point, but at various points along the recruitment process.</p> \n   <p>The fundamental issue here is the flawed recruitment process that has taken place.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Head report, commissioned by Perrottet after the Guardian revealed Barilaro had been appointed to the job after another candidate, the former senior public servant <strong>Jenny West</strong>, raised a series of issues with both the first and second recruitment process for the job.</p> \n  <p>Over the second, which eventually appointed Barilaro, Head found that the chief executive of the agency responsible for filling the role, <strong>Amy Brown</strong>, may not have been “fully in keeping” with the code.</p> \n  <p>He found a series of issues – including Brown having “involved” <strong>Ayres</strong> in “discussions about the composition of the shortlist” for the job, and arranging for candidates to meet with Ayres – were not “managed fully in keeping with the requirements” of the code of ethics.</p> \n  <p>Perrottet has agreed to a series of changes to the ministerial code of conduct, including the creation an 18-month buffer before former ministers can take jobs in a public sector agency that reported to them.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-16T04:43:52.087Z\">at 5.43am

Morrison has disputed this, saying he had no recollection of that, in his 2GB interview earlier. Let’s go through this.</p> \n  <p>An administrative arrangements order, dated 28 June 2021 and signed by both Morrison and the governor general <strong>David Hurley</strong>, sets out a small number of changes of responsibility among ministers. On that document, it notes that the prime minister had taken over administration of the “Social Security Act 1991, insofar as it relates to Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment and the Disaster Recovery Allowance”, and the “Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, insofar as it relates to Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment and the Disaster Recovery Allowance”.</p> \n  <p>The AAO shows that those powers were actually held by the home affairs minister previously – not the social services minister. The document also specifically says the social services minister has power over most of the Social Services Acts. The document doesn’t exactly prove that Morrison took on social services minister roles, just that he was given administration of one part of that portfolio’s legislation, which was actually previously a power of the home affairs minister.</p> \n  <p>Morrison told 2GB that he didn’t recall being sworn in as social services minister, but that he was “pursuing” such questions: “I’m happy if there are other (portfolios) to be out there.”</p> \n  <p>In an ABC Melbourne interview, the PM <strong>Anthony</strong> <strong>Albanese</strong> said he too was not aware of Morrison taking on social services, but flagged: “I’ll be receiving a briefing this morning shortly.

Manuel reported the harassment on her behalf to corporate HR, which resulted in the male co-worker’s removal from the store, but their manager was irate with Manuel for not reporting it to her.</p> <p>“They started messing with us. They started getting on top of us, writing complaints for any little thing,” said Manuel.</p> <p>The harassed co-worker was written up, suspended for a week, and then fired. On 1 July, Manuel was written up for taking a break too late while the store was short-staffed, and was fired when she returned to work on 8 July.</p> <p>“I was shocked. I went to my car and started to cry because I knew I had done the right thing, yet I was being fired and punished for it,” said Manuel.</p> <p>She has filed a complaint over her firing with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p> <p>“They want us to be quiet,” added Manuel. “I want people to know what’s going on, how they are exploiting us, and at the same time they’re saying something else in their promotions.”</p> <p>In 2020, a class-action lawsuit was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52284054\">filed</a> against McDonald’s in the US over systemic sexual harassment issues in restaurants, representing 5,000 women at more than 100 McDonald’s locations.

He quit his job after a manager who was sexually harassing him had snuck up on him in the break room and ejaculated on him.</p> <p>“That was my cue to leave McDonald’s, leave everything behind.

Three correctional officers were charged over the alleged assault of a detainee at Parklea in July. The three officers are due to face court later this month.</p> \n<p>In the US, MTC faces an ongoing lawsuit over the detention of a US citizen held in near-solitary confinement for 14 months. <a href=\"https://lccrsf.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021-10-14-AB3228-Complaint.pdf\">The complaint alleges</a> “solitary confinement is a form of torture” and notes the United Nations prohibits prolonged solitary confinement which can constitute torture.</p> \n<p>The lawsuit, filed in California, alleges that MTC was a company that “traffics in human captivity for profit”. The case remains active before the court. MTC did not respond to questions about the case.</p> \n<p>In 2015, the Arizona governor Doug Ducey cancelled MTC’s contract after a state department of corrections report into a riot at Kingman prison found the company had “a culture of disorganisation, disengagement and disregard for state policies”.</p> \n<p>A 2018 trial in Mississippi, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center, heard allegations the MTC-operated East Mississippi Correctional Facility was so “violent that it shocks corrections experts”.</p> \n<p>The case alleged prisoners were denied mental health treatment, overmedicated using tranquillising anti-psychotic drugs, and held in solitary confinement for “days, and sometimes weeks, without being permitted any out-of-cell time”. MTC denied the claims and the court <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/dockery-v-hall\">ultimately </a>found conditions at the East Mississippi prison had improved between the lodging of the case in 2013 and judgment in 2019, ruling in favour of the defendants.</p> \n<p>In 2019, MTC paid the state of Mississippi $5.2m to settle a bribery case without admitting wrongdoing. Mississippi alleged MTC defrauded the state by engaging in “a conspiracy scheme” involving “bribery kickbacks, misrepresentations, fraud, concealment, money laundering and other wrongful conduct”. The scheme allegedly involved paying bribes to state officials in exchange for contracts with the department of corrections.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily morning briefing newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download the free app</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/mar/17/make-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend?CMP=cvau_atom\">get our weekend edition</a> for a curated selection of the week's best stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/guardianaustraliagdn\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia\">TikTok</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_atom\">\"Full Story\"</a> in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Australian arm of MTC is wholly owned by two subsidiaries in Utah, where the company is headquartered.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said there would be “no degradation of services” provided to asylum seekers and refugees on Nauru who would “continue to receive health, welfare and accommodation support”.</p> \n<p>“Regional processing in Nauru continues to stand ready to receive new unauthorised maritime arrivals.”</p> \n<p>In March this year, Australia accepted New Zealand’s longstanding offer to resettle refugees from Nauru in New Zealand.

In one it is a case of the glass being half full, in the other half empty.</p> <p>If you are a government minister you take the former view. Nadhim Zahawi said the unemployment rate of 3.8% has rarely been lower in decades and the chancellor is right about that.</p> <p>What’s more, the economy continued to create net new jobs in the three months to June, with employment rising by 160,000 over the quarter. Flash estimates suggest the pattern continued into July.</p> <p>With job vacancies at near-record levels, the labour market looks in good shape to withstand the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/12/uk-economy-shrank-in-three-months-to-june\">recession the Bank of England is forecasting for the UK.</a> The economy contracted slightly in the three months to June, but demand for workers remained strong.</p> <p>That’s the upbeat way of looking at the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/latest\">latest jobs figures</a> from the Office for National Statistics. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says “by any metric the labour market is still very tight”.</p> <p>A glass half empty observer sees things differently, and would point to the slower pace of employment growth, evidence that job vacancies are past their peak and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/uk-wages-in-june-fall-at-fastest-rate-for-20-years\">record gap</a> between regular pay (unadjusted for bonuses) and the rate of inflation.</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macro, says demand for labour is stabilising just as the supply of workers is picking up. The increase in the size of the workforce is being driven by immigration, he notes, with the number of non-UK nationals either working or looking for a job rising by almost 250,000 in the past year.</p> <p>The domestic labour force is also likely to increase as people try to maintain their living standards at a time when cost of living pressures are intensifying, and this will lead to higher unemployment as a weakening economy leads to fewer job opportunities.</p> <p>Ultimately, the labour market data shows where the economy has been but doesn’t necessarily show where it is heading. Employment growth was healthy as the UK came out of lockdown. Annual regular pay growth has picked up to 4.7% as firms have struggled to find workers.</p> <p>The question is whether those days are now in the past, as the Bank of England certainly thinks. Threadneedle Street sees a protracted recession pushing the unemployment rate to above 6% by 2025. Judging by the most up-to-date evidence, that process has started.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/16/scott-morrisons-ministerial-meshuffle-why-did-he-do-it-what-was-happening-and-where-to-now","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T08:23:41Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison’s ministerial meshuffle: why did he do it, what was happening and where to now?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/scott-morrisons-ministerial-meshuffle-why-did-he-do-it-what-was-happening-and-where-to-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/scott-morrisons-ministerial-meshuffle-why-did-he-do-it-what-was-happening-and-where-to-now","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison’s ministerial meshuffle: why did he do it, what was happening and where to now?","trailText":"Who else knew?

But I’m one of the lucky ones; thousands of people in at-risk groups haven’t been so fortunate, and it’s about to get worse. Britain, despite being one of the centres of the outbreak, expects to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/10/uk-will-run-out-of-monkeypox-vaccine-in-10-to-20-days\">run out of vaccines</a> in the next couple of weeks, with no further deliveries planned until late September. </p> <p>This matters because it’s a race against time to prevent monkeypox becoming an endemic disease. At that point, we’ll be stuck with it, and it will continue to circulate at low levels indefinitely, with regular danger of outbreaks and possibly new and more dangerous variants. Even in the optimistic scenario that it gets no more severe, lives will be lost. And while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/lgbt-groups-unite-to-urge-uk-ministers-to-act-against-monkeypox\">LGBTQ+ groups have led the way</a> in demanding a stronger response, we know that the disease is particularly dangerous for several groups, including small children, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems.</p> <p>There’s plenty of blame to go around for this dangerous situation, not least years of damaging cuts to sexual health services on the part of the government. But one stands out: a pharmaceutical system that routinely places profits ahead of the protection of human life.</p> <p>As things stand, the sole supplier of the only approved vaccine for monkeypox is a Danish pharmaceutical company called Bavarian Nordic. In a case of almost unbelievably unlucky timing, the company’s <a href=\"https://healthpolicy-watch.news/exclusive-china-monkeypox-bavarian-nordics/\">bulk production line</a> has been closed for refurbishment. Even more ironically, the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/monkeypox-vaccine-supply-chain/\">company has millions</a> of doses in the freezer, but getting them into vials and ready to go isn’t a small job. The company is looking for other factories to help with this. But even when it does happen, the <a href=\"https://healthpolicy-watch.news/exclusive-china-monkeypox-bavarian-nordics/\">overwhelming bulk</a> of the doses have been bought by the US, with a trickle going to other high-income countries.</p> <p>The vaccine – known as Jynneos, Imvamune or Imvanex – was developed as a safe immunisation for smallpox, and was being kept on hold in case of a biological terrorist attack. It was funded, to the <a href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=5dde72b8aab4c09b5cdf3abf5f237789\">tune of $2bn</a>, by the US government, but like most medicines, it was patented. Bavarian Nordic, which holds the patent, dictates who can make the vaccine, how many doses are made, who gets to buy them, and at what price.</p> <p>Bavarian Nordic is far from the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world. Its revenues are a drop in the ocean next to the well-known pharma giants. In fact, in early 2021, the company <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.dk/20210202/danish-company-offers-to-help-with-covid-19-vaccine-production/\">offered to produce</a> Covid vaccines if only one of those bigger players would share their knowhow. The offer was not taken up.</p> <p>Now the shoe is on the other foot. Bavarian Nordic is reportedly looking into licensing its vaccine to other manufacturers, but details are confidential so far. As we saw with Covid-19, leaving production entirely to the market can be slow, opaque and unequal. It would be tragic to see this repeated with monkeypox. Africa is so far the only continent to suffer more than a couple of deaths from monkeypox to date, yet it <a href=\"https://time.com/6201442/africa-monkeypox-vaccines/\">hasn’t received</a> a single dose of vaccine so far.</p> <p>Covid-19 was the final proof for many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America that they couldn’t rely on the western-dominated pharmaceutical companies to provide them with medicines. Even when it was so clearly in all of our interests to stamp out Covid-19 everywhere, the vaccines were hoarded. Here in Britain, we were <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/world/rich-countries-have-received-more-vaccines-run-christmas-african-countries-have-all\">getting third and fourth</a> doses while many countries had still barely received any vaccines at all.</p> <p>In response, several southern governments ramped up their own research, development and manufacturing capacity, preparing for the next time. Some of these factories now have spare capacity and could be helping us – as well as themselves – to deal with monkeypox.</p> <p>To miss this opportunity to bring the situation under control would be unforgivable. Bavarian Nordic should openly share its knowledge<strong> </strong>and patents so we can expand vaccine production as quickly as possible worldwide. <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/bavarian-nordics-revenue-forecast-jumps-again-after-fresh-monkeypox-vaccine-order-europe\">Bavarian Nordic</a> will make a huge windfall, producing and selling as much as the company can manage. Its shareholders have already seen the <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/will-monkeypox-outbreak-boost-the-shares-of-some-companies-read-here-11659227706708.html\">price of their stock</a> triple. The company must now share the knowledge, so others can benefit and we can all reap the rewards of more advanced medical science in the future.</p> <p>This is particularly vital if we are to address the fact that many people in the world simply don’t matter in our profit-driven pharmaceutical model. Monkeypox has been endemic in a handful of African countries for years. Even though we had the medicines to deal with it, we didn’t do anything until an outbreak spread to the west. The monkeypox vaccine – like other medicines which could treat diseases primarily suffered in the poorest countries – <a href=\"https://healthpolicy-watch.news/exclusive-china-monkeypox-bavarian-nordics/\">isn’t even registered</a> in those countries where the disease is endemic. The medicines, it seems, exist simply to protect <em>us </em>from those diseases.

His opening season has included some memorable performances, especially of Strauss and Tchaikovsky, and so it was rather odd that for his first appearance with the orchestra at the Proms – Rouvali’s debut there, too – he should have opted for such an undemanding programme. Extracts from two of the most popular ballet scores – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/21/tchaikovsky-where-to-start-with-his-music\">Tchaikovsky’s</a> Swan Lake and Prokofiev’s Romeo and Juliet – were separated by a novelty, the European premiere of <a href=\"https://missymazzoli.com/\">Missy Mazzoli’s</a> violin concerto, Procession, in which <a href=\"https://jenniferkoh.com/\">Jennifer Koh</a> was the soloist.</p> <p>Koh gave the first performance of Procession in Washington earlier this year. Mazzoli describes it as casting the soloist as “a soothsayer, sorcerer, healer and pied piper-type character”, who leads the orchestra through “five interconnected healing spells”. These five “spells” form an arch, with the final one providing a resolution of sorts to the first, while the second, a homage to the patron saint of dance, St Vitus, is a scurrying moto perpetuo which suddenly seems to run out of steam, while the third is a disarticulated paraphrase of a hymn, O My Soul.</p> <p>There’s a feisty solo cadenza, and some beautiful passages in which solo-violin harmonics are suspended over chains of slowly descending scales from the woodwind. But the music constantly seems to be travelling towards a destination, a resolution, that it never reaches, and the narrative of its 20-minute journey is not quite eventful enough to justify the lack of that arrival.</p> <p>Koh played the concerto in a neat, yet almost understated way, and offered some equally self-contained Bach as her encore, but then many performances would have seemed understated alongside the high-definition Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev on either side of it. There were seven numbers from Swan Lake, including the obvious lollipops and some outstanding solo contributions from the Philharmonia’s principal oboe and trumpet especially, while the rampaging brass came to the fore in a lengthier sequence drawn from the three suites that Prokofiev himself extracted from Romeo and Juliet. It was all spectacular, even raucous at times, but Rouvali is surely a more interesting and searching conductor than he allowed himself to be with this choice of works.</p> <ul> <li><p>Available on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0019xl4\">BBC Sounds</a> until 13 August next year.

Everyone was late to the party’","trailText":"The Ballon d’Or winners come together to discuss England’s Euros triumph, next year’s World Cup and their teams’ sorority","byline":"Bryan Armen Graham","body":"<p>It’s been three years since Olympique Lyonnais acquired a majority stake in Seattle-based NWSL club Reign FC, forging an international sisterhood between women’s clubs unlike any model in professional sports.</p> <p>The partnership has brought some of the world’s best known players into the same organizational stable, including Lyon’s Ada Hegerberg (who won the Ballon d’Or in 2018) and OL Reign’s Megan Rapinoe (who claimed the trophy in 2019). Ahead of their clubs’ joint US tour, Rapinoe and Hegerberg sat down for an exclusive conversation with the Guardian to discuss their teams’ unique sorority, their impressions of England’s epochal Euro 2022 triumph and their hopes for next year’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.</p> <p><strong>What were your thoughts on Euro 2022 and how it seemed to penetrate English culture, not unlike the 1999 World Cup in the United States?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rapinoe</strong> My overarching feeling was like, everyone’s late to the party. This is not surprising to me at all. I feel like I’ve known that the level of play was going to be that [high]. I knew that the European teams, especially in the last five years with the rise of the club game, have been sensational. Of course this was going to be how it was going to go. We literally grow gardens out of cement every single time. Tell me one women’s tournament in the last 15 years that hasn’t exceeded expectations. Part of it is like: “Welcome, everybody, to the party. You’re extremely fucking late, but fine.” And I feel proud about that. Ada should feel the same and all the women’s players should feel the same because <em>we</em> did this. <em>We</em> did this. <em>We</em> put this into motion through literally sheer will, while also being the best players in the world.</p> <p>The way that the English players held themselves in this tournament, they just embraced the moment fully and didn’t fall into the narrative or didn’t allow themselves to be stressed out about it. You could just tell they stepped into themselves. And it’s yet another data point, justification, reason, a clear picture of why investing in women’s football is good business, first and foremost. It’s a proper money-making opportunity.</p> <p>So I feel so many different emotions. Just being as old as I am, it’s hard not to be jaded by some of this stuff, but progress moves at the speed that it does and I think being able to build on this is huge. And I’m just hoping that all of the main stakeholders can really take a look in the mirror and understand that it’s been them that’s been holding the game back, it’s not been us. I feel incredibly proud. I think all of the supporters should feel incredibly proud. I think this is a total watershed moment, this whole year, going from Champions League to what Barcelona did [setting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/world-record-crowd-watches-barcelona-brush-aside-wolfsburg-at-camp-nou\" title=\"\">multiple world attendance records</a>].</p> <p><strong>While the US women’s national team routinely draws large crowds, the NWSL has failed to capture the same audience. What is the next step for growing the club game in the United States to what we’ve been seeing lately in Europe?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rapinoe</strong> It has to come from a place of investment. It can’t just be a charity thing. That’s sort of willfully naive at this point. I think we’ve proven time and time again – whether it’s in the club game, in the international game, in friendlies and Euros and Champions League, whatever – it’s good business to invest in women’s football. And it’s also the right thing to do, but I think before it’s the right thing to do, it’s good business. We shouldn’t be trying to copy every single thing that men’s sports has, and I think that’s obviously a really easy trap to fall into. But I think when you actually invest in women’s sports: the energy is there, the culture around it is there, the fandom is there, but if I can’t figure out how to find the [video] stream … nobody is going to watch the game.</p> <p>So it’s investing around the streaming services, investing around the front offices, investing around the facilities for the players, the stadiums for the players, ticketing, marketing, all of that. That’s the only thing that’s missing. The players and the product on the field have never been missing. It’s just that we’ve been neglected and under-financed and under-invested in forever. Lyon’s a perfect example. Champions of Europe a million times, champions of France a million times. You have that success and now coupling that with maybe a sea change in the culture, especially after the World Cup in France, you’re seeing obviously massive returns. The Euros were just sensational, Champions League this year was absolutely sensational and you’re seeing bigger attendances around the world.</p> <p><strong>There is this unmistakable sense of momentum coming out of the Euros straight into a World Cup year. Aside from lifting the trophy, what would you most like to see out of next year’s tournament?</strong></p> <p><strong>Hegerberg</strong> I keep on scratching my head after every big tournament. You have the World Cup, you have the Euros and then we get back to club and then it’s like the whole momentum just fades away. And I think that’s a huge problem. Like I’m a player in Europe, obviously, and I’ve seen what’s been happening here and – it’s like Megan mentioned earlier – every tournament has been a success in terms of interest from your home country, on a world basis, the coverage. You have this insane momentum and then you have all these best players going back to their clubs and it’s like you kind of lose this momentum. And I think it’s a shame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e56261d8091189bd7babc3d48507ba158bfa37e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e56261d8091189bd7babc3d48507ba158bfa37e5/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Euros victory created a huge wave of interest in their home country.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Euros victory created a huge wave of interest in their home country.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dazn did an incredible job with the Champions League this year. You had some pretty powerful coverage. People actually got a good platform to see all of the best games. But the problem is our home leagues, basically. I feel like England, they’re very good at selling their league. They’re very good at marketing their league, but the other leagues, we’ve got to step up. The federations are in control of these leagues and they have a huge job to do in order to lift the whole product, with the clubs obviously, and kind of shake it up a little bit and start selling the leagues, start selling good football matches where you actually have the best players playing every weekend. And that’s the next step, especially in Europe. You have to get the momentum up the whole year round.</p> <p><strong>Rapinoe</strong> The only thing I would say about the World Cup next year, I would love to see the ball not be dropped. It’s absurd if it’s dropped again. That’s from the major stakeholders. That’s Uefa, that’s the federations, that’s Fifa, that’s Gianni [Infantino], specifically. It’s the Australian federation, everything. We know now that if you invest in this World Cup, it’s going to work. It’s just not even a fucking question. I would love to see people stop saying: <em>Wow, I think we have something here!</em> This is insane if you don’t invest in it. Whether that’s people are producing content or streaming services or sponsors or whatever it is. </p> <p>It’s like a literal gold mine and I just don’t understand. I mean, I do understand: it’s sexism and patriarchy. The major stakeholders, most all of them are men and white men. Them being able to stand up and say: “You know what, like we got it wrong. We’ve been getting it wrong. We’ve been sexist.” Because that’s really what it is. We haven’t invested despite all of the key metrics pointing that this would be an incredible [return on investment].</p> <p>You need to invest in the infrastructure around women’s sports, whether that’s streaming, branding, marketing, journalism, all of the things that help prop it up. I mean the men’s game, everybody talks about it all the time. I don’t want to know as much about LeBron James as I do, but I can’t not, because it’s in my face all the time. I’m sure in European football, with Canal+ and BBC Sport and all that, you probably don’t want to know as much about Jack Grealish as you do, but you’re going to anyway, because you can’t get him out of your mind. Stuff like that is really important.</p> <p><strong>Hegerberg</strong> This kind of coverage will help change the mentalities, will help raise a completely different generation into training different, training smarter, to put the same demands to six-year-old girls that you do with six-year-old boys, for example. I wish that we were taken as seriously as boys when we started playing. And I think that has a huge impact on the level and long term as well, because I think that the game only can get better. The way the girls read the game, technically, we’ve seen that it’s been a huge change in the tempo and physically. Changing mentalities with having better coverage and investment, it will also have a huge impact on the next generation and how they play in 15 years, and I think that’s very important because we’re here to also raise the level year in and year out.</p> <p><strong>You mention the quality of European sides, Megan. How is the US women’s system planning on keeping up with Europe when they’re so clearly on America’s heels?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rapinoe</strong> The game is growing exponentially every year. It’s a huge challenge for us. I think the football being played at the Euros was the best football in the world that we’ve seen ever. I don’t think that’s even a question. It’s a huge challenge for us. We do know how to win. We do have a winning culture here. We know what we’re up against. So I think, for me, honestly, it’s exciting. It’s exciting that so many teams are so much better. It’s exciting that the level of competition is what it is. I think that brings out the best in everyone. But yeah, we’ve got a tall order to keep not only obviously our No 1 standing but to keep ourselves world champions. I’m excited for it. I think if you’re not pushed and you’re not challenged and you’re not shitting yourself a little bit, like what’s the point?</p> <p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length</em><em>.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/16/anais-in-love-review-cerebral-eroticism-and-summery-thrills-in-french-adultery-farce","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T08:00:01Z","webTitle":"Anaïs in Love review – cerebral eroticism and summery thrills in French adultery farce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/16/anais-in-love-review-cerebral-eroticism-and-summery-thrills-in-french-adultery-farce","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/16/anais-in-love-review-cerebral-eroticism-and-summery-thrills-in-french-adultery-farce","fields":{"headline":"Anaïs in Love review – cerebral eroticism and summery thrills in French adultery farce","trailText":"Charming ‘bulldozer’ Anaïs sprints after emotional stimulants in breezy tale of graduate student who seduces her publisher’s partner","byline":"Phuong Le","body":"<p>An amusing snapshot of millennial restlessness, Charline Bourgeois-Tacquet’s droll debut is another addition to the recent crop of films where young women are always running on screen, a lot.

Surely this is premature?","byline":"Daniel Dylan Wray","body":"<p>There are many things you notice as you plow deeper into your 30s. It’s a transitional period with incredibly visible milestones: babies, weddings, houses, more babies. What gets added to people’s lives can feel loud and inescapable – but often what drifts away is less visible.</p> <p>For the last few years, I have felt the inescapable disappearance of music from my friends’ lives. Even people with whom I have longstanding relationships that were born from a shared love of music have simply let it go, or let it fade deep into the background. A 2015 study of people’s listening habits on Spotify found that most people stop listening to new music at 33; a 2018 report by Deezer had it at 30. In my 20s, the idea that people’s appetite to consume new music regularly would be switched off like some kind of tap was ludicrous. However, now I’m 36, it’s difficult to argue with.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/21/we-can-be-in-bed-by-1am-amazing-veteran-dj-annie-macs-new-clubbing-venture-hits-the-spot\">‘We can be in bed by 1am – amazing’: veteran DJ Annie Mac’s new clubbing venture hits the spot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The capacity to be amazed, overwhelmed or sucker-punched by music remains a constant presence and ecstatic joy in my life. It’s something I’ve experienced a million times but when it hits it still feels new. The late DJ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/andrew-weatherall\">Andrew Weatherall</a>, with his boundless curiosity, knowledge and passion for music, right up until his untimely death, is my personal benchmark and inspiration. I write about music for a living, and naturally I don’t expect others to maintain anywhere near the same level of interest – and not everyone reaches their 30s and gives up on music, as the success of BBC Radio 6 Music shows. Not that there’s anything wrong with tapping out, either – interests and priorities change. A parent with two kids under five has things higher up their to-do list than checking out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfXwm3jwVbI\">Jockstrap</a>. Gigs become less attractive when a small person screams you awake at 5am. I get it.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it’s a strange and alienating experience to have a fundamental part of your relationship with someone deteriorate. The shift is a subtle one; a sudden realisation that hits as the once regular conversation of “what are you listening to?” is seemingly replaced permanently by “what are you watching?” I’ve lost count of the amount of free +1 tickets I’ve had go unaccounted for; the seat next to me becoming a coat stand. I’ve not been able to give away free tickets to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nick-cave\">Nick Cave</a>, staggeringly expensive arena pop shows, or even entire festival weekend passes.</p> <p>It’s easy to chalk this up to simply getting older, as the rabid enthusiasm, naivety and passion of youth dwindles, but that has an ageist presumption baked into it. There may be more hurdles to committing to cultural discovery but people don’t become fundamentally less curious because they get older. Most people don’t stop discovering new books, films, podcasts or TV. Yet music seems to be something that more commonly slips away – or is even perceived as something you’re supposed to grow out of. Music is a key part of youthful identity formation: once your idea of yourself becomes fixed, perhaps by distinct markers like marriage and kids, the need for it slips away. Sometimes when I speak to people about going to gigs, festivals or raves, I see an almost pitying look wash over their face: “Really? You’re still doing that? Bless.” As if clinging on represents some childish refusal to let go of youth, the equivalent of a balding mod refusing to shave off their depleting feather cut.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0962d5a5d32172fc9ca7d25abc3378456b4f16c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0962d5a5d32172fc9ca7d25abc3378456b4f16c/0_0_4920_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No takers … Nick Cave performing in Austria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No takers … Nick Cave performing in Austria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannes Draxler/Fotokerschi.AT/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One similarly aged and child-free friend who admits to a dwindling passion for music says it’s a combination of going out less – and so music is no longer the centre of socialising – preferring to listen to podcasts, and having more options available across streaming. Another simply says it’s harder to muster that same level of excitement about anything, period, while one former consumer and maker of music happily admits that he now only really listens to three bands.</p> <p>This lack of interest in new music seems to coincide – or perhaps even feeds – huge surges in nostalgia around my age group: take the odd phenomenon of <a href=\"https://thequietus.com/articles/31167-indie-sleaze-mandela-effect\">so-called indie sleaze</a>, with its warped rose-tinted shutter glasses and desire to retroactively create something that didn’t exist. Objectionable as that particular fetishism is, it’s an interesting generational insight into how those staring down middle age recalibrate their relationship to music. Though I’m not begrudging anyone some nostalgia. The world can be an overflowing cesspit, and if using familiar music to ignite fond memories helps, then drink it up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor is there anything wrong with stepping away from the endless churn. I loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/22/pop-culture-art-love\">Emma Garland’s recent article</a> on deactivating her streaming accounts and giving up on endlessly chasing the zeitgeist (ie mediocre TV) simply because that’s what’s directing the conversation. Keeping up with new music can feel like an equally exhausting task bordering on the futile. I get numb from time to time too, and listening to albums can feel like going through the motions without absorbing anything. The sheer volume of culture makes it easy to feel as though we are trapped within a huge content-spewing factory working harder than ever to keep up with the production line. Stepping away from that madness makes sense.</p> <p>But this desertion of music that I have observed feels different – less a tactical retreat and more a mushrooming apathy or indifference. Trying to remain dedicated to music during these apparent wilderness years can be a lonely pursuit. Something you once associated with camaraderie, shared experience and collective memories becomes a one-way exchange. It’s still special, and for many people that’s how they prefer to enjoy music – and there’s always community to be found online, though it’s a thin substitute when you’ve known the real thing. While the thrill of falling in love with a record hasn’t dimmed, it’s dispiriting to know that you have a shrinking group of friends to share it with, as more people seemingly outgrow the one thing you never thought was possible to outgrow.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/us-lawmakers-to-meet-taiwan-president-as-china-tensions-simmer","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T07:01:27Z","webTitle":"China sanctions Taiwan officials and stages new military drills after US lawmakers’ Taipei visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/us-lawmakers-to-meet-taiwan-president-as-china-tensions-simmer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/us-lawmakers-to-meet-taiwan-president-as-china-tensions-simmer","fields":{"headline":"China sanctions Taiwan officials and stages new military drills after US lawmakers’ Taipei visit","trailText":"Beijing carries out ‘combat drills’ and acts against seven individuals for allegedly supporting Taiwan independence","byline":"Vincent Ni, Helen Davidson and agencies","body":"<p>China has sanctioned senior Taiwanese officials and<strong> </strong>staged a new round of military drills around Taiwan in response to a brief visit to the island by a delegation of bipartisan US lawmakers.

The state news agency Xinhua published a commentary after the lawmakers’ arrival on Sunday with the headline “US politicians should stop playing with fire on Taiwan question”.</p> <p>It called the visiting American lawmakers opportunists, thinking about their own political interests as November’s midterm elections draw near.</p> <p>“Those US politicians who are playing with fire on the Taiwan question should drop their wishful thinking,” the agency said. “There is no room for compromise or concessions when it comes to China’s core interests.”</p> <p>Taiwan’s government has accused Beijing of using Pelosi’s visit as an excuse to kickstart drills that would allow it to rehearse for an invasion.</p> <p>That decades-old threat was reiterated in a white paper published last week when China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said it would “not renounce the use of force” against its neighbour and reserved “the option of taking all necessary measures”.</p> <p>It added, however: “We will only be forced to take drastic measures to respond to the provocation of separatist elements or external forces should they ever cross our red lines.”</p> <p>Pelosi has stood by her visit but president Joe Biden said the US military was opposed to the trip by his fellow Democrat, who is second in line to the presidency after the vice-president.</p> <p>Congress is constitutionally an equal branch of government with lawmakers free to travel where they wish, and Taiwan enjoys bipartisan backing in divided Washington.</p> <p>The US switched diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.

Sometimes, it’s about a single night of hell; and sometimes it’s about a relationship that started out on a dating app and ended up in some hellish place – often because their significant other was still, secretly, on dating apps. Betrayal is a common theme, unsurprisingly, at a time when these apps have made the array of options for potential partners seemingly endless, and the ability to access them virtually immediate.</p> <p>I’ve been a critic of the dating app industry almost since its beginning, a role I never planned to take on. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/aug/12/tinder-10-years-dating-apps-podcast\">Tinder launched its mobile app</a> a decade ago this year, I had just started doing a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/social-media-internet-porn-teenage-girls\">story for Vanity Fair</a> on teenage girls and how social media was affecting their lives. I was at the Grove, a Los Angeles mall, talking to a 16-year-old girl, when she told me about a new app, Tinder. She showed me how she was on it, matching and talking with men in their 20s and 30s, and how some of them had been sending her sexual messages and nude images.</p> <p>The culture of dating apps that has evolved in the decade since then can be very rough, as anyone who has ever been on them (which includes myself) can tell you. The most outrageous and offensive sort of behaviour has been normalised. We’re talking about everything from demands for nudes to demands for sex; rude comments about someone’s appearance or communication style; and, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/mar/29/how-ghosting-became-phenomenon-in-modern-dating#:~:text=It%27s%20when%20you%27re%20going,Like%20a%20ghost\">ghosting</a>. None of what I’m saying here is news, although I was one of the first people to write about it, in Vanity Fair in 2015, in a story entitled Tinder and the Dawn of the Dating Apocalypse – a piece that got Tinder so mad that it infamously tweeted at me <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tinders-meltdown-on-twitter-over-vanity-fair-2015-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\">more than 30 times</a> in one night. </p> <p>And yet, despite the pushback that that story got, its revelations have now become commonplace, part of our general understanding of the disruptions dating apps have caused. After doing that story, I went on to further investigate the ways that dating apps are rife with sexism, racism and transphobia, as did many other journalists. And yet, dating app use has only increased over the last 10 years, especially <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/02/12/covid-pandemic-online-dating-apps-usage-tinder-okcupid-bumble-meet-group/\">during the pandemic</a>, which has seen a surge in the number of users and the hours they spent on these platforms.</p> <p>Some of the people who contact me say they do so because they feel as if there’s no one else they can tell – including the dating app companies themselves, which are notoriously slow to respond to complaints from their users (if they ever do), even complaints involving, distressingly, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/addressing-rape-in-four-minutes-or-less-dating-app-reps-left-unprepared-to-respond-to-assault-victims\">sexual assault</a>. There hasn’t been a lot of movement towards reform on these apps, and depictions in pop culture are often sunny and romanticised.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/aug/12/tinder-10-years-dating-apps-podcast\">Tinder turns 10: what have we learned from a decade of dating apps? – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My first impression of dating apps in that LA mall was that they were something dangerous for children and teens – which, clearly, they still are. Tinder doesn’t officially allow underage users to communicate with adults, but kids have been doing so since it was launched, and still do. Kids are on Tinder, Bumble, Grindr, Hinge and many other dating platforms – it’s easy to make a fake profile and sign on, and there are still <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/06/teens-minors-using-dating-apps-grindr/661187/\">no effective age checks</a>, despite calls for them from various quarters. Even an app specifically designed for teens aged 13 to 17, Yubo – which has millions of users all over the world – has been called out for <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10533847/Sex-abuse-fears-Tinder-teens-app.html\">inappropriate content and harassment</a>. </p> <p>Why do people continue to use these apps, if they’ve made dating such hell? (Even more hellish, I would argue, than it always was.) There are a few reasons for this, I think: one is that the dating app industry has overwhelmed the landscape of dating to the point where many people feel there is no other way to meet someone. They did this by making their apps seem easy, by promising love through just a few swipes. They did it by eliminating the need to put oneself out there in person.</p> <p>Another reason is that dating app users bear the same hopes as millions of gamblers who enter casinos every day, knowing full well that the odds are stacked against them, and that the house always wins. And so it is with dating apps, which, though they promise they’ll find their users lasting connections, offer no data to support this – in fact, data from outside sources suggests that most people on dating apps are <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/the-virtues-and-downsides-of-online-dating/\">not finding lasting relationships</a> or marriages through these platforms. </p> <p>But people keep on swiping, scrolling, swiping, sometimes for hours a day, as if they can’t stop – and many really can’t. These apps are designed to be addictive. “It’s kind of like a slot machine,” Jonathan Badeen, the co-founder of Tinder, and inventor of the swipe, told me in my HBO documentary, Swiped: Hooking Up in the Digital Age.</p> <p>Turning love into a casino game was never a very romantic idea, but it has proved very lucrative for dating app companies – though perhaps at our expense.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nancy Jo Sales is a writer at Vanity Fair and the author of American Girls: Social Media and the Secret Lives of Teenagers</p></li> <li><p>This article was amended on 16 August 2022.

It was like a family and they taught me it was important to pursue what gave you joy, no matter what other people think.”</p> <p>He took on that attitude of his skatepark elders after enrolling at Brixton music and media school <a href=\"https://rawmusicmedia.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Raw Material</a>. Romans-Hopcraft eventually became a tutor, teaching production while he used its studios to write his own tracks. “They gave me time and space to develop my craft, which is so hard to come by now with arts funding cut everywhere,” he says. “It really taught me the importance of giving back to the younger generations. If we don’t fight for them, everything we have will be uprooted.”</p> <p>After leaving Raw Material, he went on to work at Alford House youth club, in nearby Kennington, encouraging musical youngsters to develop creative independence. “If you really want to do something, you can do it yourself – you don’t need to wait for a label to sign you,” he says. “I’m living proof of that.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX5-ctxWzGg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UX5-ctxWzGg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It’s an ethos that he applied to the creation of Loggerhead when Covid first struck in 2020. Hanging out one day in a friend’s empty pub, he decided the cavernous space would be perfect to record in. A few days later, he had hired a mixing desk and invited his band down to jam. “We played through the night until 7am and came up with the riff for the single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX5-ctxWzGg\" title=\"\">Broken Homes</a>,” he says. “The next day I decided: we’re making an album. I’m gonna spend all my money and see what happens.”</p> <p>The noise complaints soon arrived, and the group were kicked out. Still, Romans-Hopcraft scoured his south London contacts and found another space one of them had set up farther afield – in Norway. A few flights, one month and 40 demos later, he had the bones of Loggerhead. Whittled down to just 12 tracks, the finished album is a powerhouse of unvarnished self-expression, veering from the soft melancholy of Calo Paste to the indignant anger of Times, featuring rapper Lex Amor and singers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/29/greentea-peng-i-have-no-interest-in-being-a-pop-star\" title=\"\">Greentea Peng</a> and Léa Sen.</p> <p>“This is a record about being alone in your head,” Romans-Hopcraft says. “It has a punk ethos but I don’t know what genre to call it. It’s just a diary of how I’ve been feeling; maybe the name Wu-Lu will become a genre in itself.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgAAQupQTW4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BgAAQupQTW4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The genre-splicing nature of Romans-Hopcraft’s sound enticed record labels, and he eventually signed with Warp. “I did it at this point in my career because I can take us all along with me now – my band and even my 14-year-old brother,” he laughs. “Just as my dad got me and Ben on stage when we were kids, I got him up and crowdsurfing at Glastonbury [where Wu-Lu performed on the William’s Green stage]. That’s what it’s all about.”</p> <p>Indeed, that Glastonbury show was a family affair. It featured brother Ben – later Childhood frontman and one half of the duo Insecure Men – on bass and their mother in the crowd. “That was actually the first time my mum has seen me play as Wu-Lu,” he says, smiling. “She was so proud backstage, telling everyone: ‘That’s my boy.’ She always told us kids that we can achieve whatever we commit to, and that’s why I just go with my heart. It’s gotten me this far – let’s see where we get to next.”</p> <p><em>Loggerhead is out now.

At the moment, each of them looks as though they might lose.</p> <p>Oz, a television stalwart better known as Dr Oz to millions of Americans, is <a href=\"https://www.politicspa.com/poll-fetterman-leads-oz-by-double-digits/110797/\">trailing his opponent</a> in Pennsylvania by double digits.</p> <p>Vance, a bestselling author and conservative commentator, is behind in his race in Ohio, an increasingly red state that many expected Republicans to win. So far the most notable point of his campaign was when Vance appeared to suggest women <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/jd-vance-slammed-suggesting-women-stay-violent-marriages-1727795\">should stay in violent marriages</a>.</p> <p>In Georgia, Walker, a former NFL running back, is running close against Raphael Warnock, the incumbent Democrat. But Walker’s campaign has been characterized by a series of gaffes, and this week, more seriously, his ex-wife recalled in a campaign ad how he once <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/us-elections-government/ny-election-2022-georgia-senate-herschel-walker-ad-20220809-z3xptizhr5ezvbocl34deqvcoe-story.html\">held a gun to her head</a>.</p> <p>The three men’s travails spell out a problem in selecting outsider, celebrity candidates. Each brings name recognition, but in some cases have been unexposed to the media’s glare.</p> <p>The Pennsylvania Senate race is looking particularly dire for Republicans. According to FiveThirtyEight’s <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/pennsylvania/]\">polling average</a>, John Fetterman, the Democratic lieutenant governor, holds an 11% lead over Oz. Among Republicans in Pennsylvania, just 35% say they are “enthusiastic” about Oz’s candidacy, according to a Fox News poll in July, and 45% of Republicans say they “have reservations” about the physician.</p> <p>Oz’s struggles are significant enough that the National Republican Senatorial Committee is considering diverting money away from Oz’s campaign “to seats that we feel we can win”, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/29/alarm-bell-gop-donors-oz-00048747\">Politico reported in July</a> – a dramatic move given the Senate seat was previously held by a Republican.</p> <p>Oz has decided to try his hand at politics after being a fixture on American television for two decades, initially as a medical expert on the Oprah Winfrey show, then as the host of several of his own shows, including The Dr Oz Show, Surgeon Oz, and Transplant!.</p> <p>His TV career brought him fame, but scrutiny, too. In 2014 a Senate panel <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2014/06/17/dr-oz-senate-panel-weight-scams/10701067/\">chastised Oz</a> for featuring quack medical products on The Dr Oz Show. The doctor had described various supplements as “magic weight-loss cure”, and “the No 1 miracle in a bottle”, the Senate panel noted, despite no evidence to support the claims.</p> <p>“I don’t get why you say this stuff because you know it’s not true,” Claire McCaskill, a Democratic senator, said at the time.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dr-oz-congress_n_5504209\">In response</a> Oz said of the products, which included green coffee extract: “I recognize they don’t have the scientific muster to present as fact, but nevertheless I would give my audience the advice I give my family all the time, and I have given my family these products.”</p> <p>If suspicions linger about Oz’s snake oil salesman past, another problem for the GOP is that serious questions have been asked about <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/does-dr-oz-live-in-pennsylvania-20211202.html\">whether Oz actually lives in Pennsylvania</a>. Oz was a longtime New Jersey resident before, he says, he moved to the Keystone state in late 2020 – specifically into a house owned by his wife’s parents.</p> <p>Fetterman has seized upon Oz’s residency status by <a href=\"https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/fetterman-recruits-reality-star-to-help-troll-dr-oz/\">recruiting Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</a>, from the TV show Jersey Shore, to troll Oz online.</p> <p>Walker’s campaign seems less doomed. He’s less than three points behind Warnock. But the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuwI-X072Ys\">retelling by Cindy Grossman</a>, Walker’s ex-wife, of how the Republican “held the gun to my temple and said he was going to blow my brains out”, probably horrified some Georgians.

Speaking about the rise in marriages that end in divorce, Vance said:</p> <p>“This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace.</p> <p>“Which is the idea that like: ‘Well, OK, these marriages were fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy. And so getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that’s going to make people happier in the long term.’</p> <p>“And maybe it worked out for the moms and dads, though I’m skeptical. But it really didn’t work out for the kids of those marriages.”</p> <p>Asked by Vice News why “it would be better for children if their parents stayed in violent marriages than if they divorced”, Vance said he was a victim of domestic violence.</p> <p>“I reject the premise of your bogus question,” Vance said.</p> <p>“As anyone who studies these issues knows: domestic violence has skyrocketed in recent years, and is much higher among non-married couples. That’s the ‘trick’ I reference: that domestic violence would somehow go down if progressives got what they want, when in fact modern society’s war on families has made our domestic violence situation much worse. Any fair person would recognize I was criticizing the progressive frame on this issue, not embracing it.”</p> <p>If the disagreeability, and general incompetence, of the celebrity candidates – all of whom have been endorsed by Donald Trump – has surprised many, it doesn’t appear to have shocked senior Republicans.</p> <p>Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader who has looked on as Trump has effectively taken over the GOP, is among those who seem to have admitted that some of the candidates would struggle in November.</p> <p>“I think it’s going to be very tight. We have a 50-50 nation,” McConnell said in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3593305-gop-tempers-expectations-for-senate-majority/\">an interview</a> on Fox News.</p> <p>“I think when this Senate race smoke clears, we’re likely to have a very, very close Senate still, with us up slightly or the Democrats up slightly.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2022/aug/16/prime-minister-sunak-truss-sport-in-schools","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Dear prime minister (Sunak or Truss): please sort out sport in schools | Emma John","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/16/prime-minister-sunak-truss-sport-in-schools","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/16/prime-minister-sunak-truss-sport-in-schools","fields":{"headline":"Dear prime minister (Sunak or Truss): please sort out sport in schools","trailText":"Lack of strategy from government means PE is being squeezed for time and investment is badly targeted","byline":"Emma John","body":"<p>Forget Santa.

Sport England has provided £13.5m towards training secondary school teachers in the subject and about 75% of schools have r<a href=\"https://www.sportengland.org/news/coronavirus-challenges-highlight-importance-physical-activity-and-sport-children\" title=\"\">eceived funding</a>.</p> <p>Last year the House of Lords formed a select committee to try to understand what was going wrong – why, a decade after London 2012, Britain’s young people were not the healthier, more active generation that successive governments had promised they would be. A number of experts were invited to give evidence including Lady Sue Campbell, director of women’s football at the FA. Campbell, who has repeatedly warned the government the Olympic legacy was being squandered, pulled no punches at this hearing either. Time for PE was being squeezed across the board, she said. That meant schools employed fewer PE teachers and after-school clubs suffered, too.</p> <p>“It has not been a lack of investment,” she said. “It has been a lack of strategy and a lack of managed implementation.” While there had been “a lot of money” going into primary schools there had been “very little monitoring and very little accountability”. In other words, much of the money was not being used in the right way or for the purposes it was intended.</p> <p>This was exactly what Campbell predicted would happen in 2010, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/nov/16/school-sport-funding-cuts\" title=\"\">when Michael Gove slashed funding</a> for the school sports partnerships developed during her leadership of the Youth Sports Trust. But why listen to a woman with a winning track record? At secondary schools operating within those schemes, the number of pupils playing sport for two hours or more each week increased from 20% to 90%.</p> <p>When the government ended the schemes it offered headteachers the “freedom to organise sport themselves” in lieu of actual support. Mo Farah’s former PE teacher, Alan Watkinson, was another to predict the outcome in an essay for the Smith Institute in 2013. Prioritising “individual endeavour and enterprise”, he wrote, “adds to an already overburdened workload for school leaders”. The vital task of “addressing the obesity timebomb” was being left entirely to chance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13df47767f96fc3d94a1a4018768c80dbee62a41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13df47767f96fc3d94a1a4018768c80dbee62a41/0_56_3000_2022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woodhill Primary School pupils play hockey as they celebrate the opening of its new multi-use sports facility in October 2014.

In February 2013 Ofsted called for a national school sport strategy that built on school sports partnerships; now a Lords committee is proposing a national plan for sport and recreation that includes similar recommendations for school strategy those who know their stuff have been proposing for a decade.</p> <p>Peter Keen, the head of UK Sport who oversaw Team GB’s goldrush at London 2012, sees the loss of the school partnerships scheme as 10 years of missed opportunity. “Its design features and philosophy put school sport at the heart of our thinking in terms of sport strategy and child development generally,” he says. “However we do it, we’ve got to get back to that dialogue and make the case again that physical literacy is essential for development.”</p> <p>Nick Pink, chief executive of England Hockey, agrees. “It’s been a real challenge for state schools in the last 10 years,” he says. “The lack of strategy at the top-line level has set us back – that’s why we’re seeing this challenge to the event legacy system, because it has to be backed up by good strategy.</p> <p>“UK Sport talk about winning well, the integrity of sport, but it also needs to be backed up by a PE in schools plan that provides the fundamental development skills children and young people need so they can continue a lifelong participation in sport.”</p> <p>Research into “physical literacy” has demonstrated its vital importance to a child’s development and future wellbeing; it can be argued it is as important as numeracy and the ability to read. But poor experiences in PE cause many to reject physical activity entirely, and the rift can take a lifetime to repair. The drop‑off rate for sport among teenagers remains high and campaigns to encourage people back – such as <a href=\"https://www.thisgirlcan.co.uk/\" title=\"\">This Girl Can</a> – are remedial measures for a problem that need not exist in the first place.</p> <p>Which is why one of the punchiest proposals in the committee’s report is to make sport a core subject in the curriculum. “It’s bizarre it isn’t already,” says Keen. “That’s not to deny many people’s experiences of PE at school wasn’t adequate and there are many, many things that should be changed about it.”</p> <p>Whoever becomes the next prime minister, this is the next sporting battle to be faced and resolved.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

An immigrant from the Dominican Republic with minimal acting skills, she managed by sheer force of will to become one of Hollywood’s brightest stars during the second world war years. Montez built her legend through a series of escapist fantasias that moviegoers, exhausted by the bleakness and sacrifice of the war, were all too eager to melt into.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/14/roles-for-women-before-the-hays-code\">‘Two out of five stories should be hot’: why pre-code cinema was a golden age for women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The leading lady’s story is carefully recounted in the new biography The Queen of Technicolor: Maria Montez in Hollywood, by photographer and author Tom Zimmerman. “It’s such a bizarre story, it started to intrigue me,” Zimmerman said to the Guardian. “Montez was just determined to become widely known.” Zimmerman’s book is the first full-length English-language biography of the Dominican actor.</p> <p>Montez achieved prominence by signing with Universal Pictures, at that time one of the smaller of the major Hollywood studios. Eager to have a star to compete with the likes of Rita Hayworth and Ann Sheridan, Universal placed Montez front and center in a series of fantasies set far, far away. After ascending to the pinnacle of movie-making, Montez was unceremoniously tossed aside by Universal, and after a string of further European movies, where she built an almost worshipful following in France and Italy, she passed away of what was probably a heart attack at just 39 years of age.</p> <p>“I want this book to introduce her to the world that has largely forgotten her,” said Zimmerman. “When I was working on the book, inevitably, no one I told about it knew who she was. It’s an uphill fight, since she’s just not terribly well remembered.”</p> <p>How did Montez, a Hollywood outsider if ever there was one, make it to become an A-list leading lady? As The Queen of Technicolor explains, she dedicated herself to a tried and true method – courting controversy and never letting the Hollywood press forget her name. A bombshell with a penchant for showing off her body, it didn’t take Montez long to run afoul of moralists of the time for wearing overly tight sweaters in photo spreads. She rode the ensuing uproar like an uplifting wave, leveraging her sexual potency into ever more publicity and better and better roles in movies.</p> <p>Another part of Montez’s success was that she loved to exaggerate her character, and was always in on the joke. In one instance while she ascended the ladder of fame, Montez self-promoted by attending a freshman dance at Harvard University. Of course the image of the glamorous star setting foot on the elitist campus caused a major stir, and Montez lapped it all up, having a great time serving young men the myth that she had any interest at all in dancing with them. “She always had a story ready for a newspaper columnist,” said Zimmerman, “and she never said ‘no.’ She’d do anything to get into their columns.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"01c01e04d38a2c91c159de2b753d2b65f6edca50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01c01e04d38a2c91c159de2b753d2b65f6edca50/0_0_1872_2429/771.jpg\" alt=\"Montez\" width=\"771\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>By the time Montez reached the zenith of her fame, she played the leading role in Universal’s six Neverland movies, ahistorical fantasias that took place in locations designed to stoke the interests of audiences at the time. Given their heavy dose of escapism, and the overall irreality that they portrayed, these movies played marvelously into the Technicolor revolution that had been sweeping Hollywood since The Wizard of Oz mainstreamed the technology 1939. It was via these vivid epics that Montez became known as “the Queen of Technicolor”.</p> <p>“World War II was a major boon for Maria,” said Zimmerman. “There was a huge desire to have an action adventure movie that was totally irrelevant and didn’t even make much sense. You could go into the theater and forget what was happening. Her films were the perfect escapist pictures.”</p> <p>The Queen of Technicolor is assiduously researched and is a meaningful first biography of a woman who deserves to be remembered. The book is fascinating for how its story of Montez’s rise combines elements of the old Hollywood studio system that defined film’s so-called golden age, the cultural and moralistic milieu of the time, and the vast publicity apparatus that allowed Montez to turn the era’s sexism to her advantage. Proving the adage “the more things change, the more they stay the same,” Montez’s story rings true to how famous women get ahead today in our image-saturated wired culture.</p> <p>She would undoubtedly fit right into our social media age, with its unending string of self-made glamor goddesses best known for being famous. Montez’s <em>sui generis </em>origins, her outspokenness, and her ability to manipulate cultural biases to her advantage are all familiar to today’s influencers. Whereas Montez was ever-dependent on photographers to take glamorous shots of her and newspaper columnists to write up her latest exploits, one can only imagine what she might have done with her own Instagram platform or a reality TV show. It would probably have been fantastic. As Zimmerman commented, “it’s intriguing to think what Maria would have done today, if she had her own social media.”</p> <p>Given Montez’s love of outrageous costumes and extravagant vamping, it’s perhaps not a surprise that she ended up becoming a queer icon in the years after her death. She was central to Gore Vidal’s 1974 novel Myron, and she was idolized by artists including the queer underground film legend Jack Smith and Andy Warhol himself.</p> <p>The Queen of Technicolor never misses a chance to inform us how beautiful, alluring, sexy, gorgeous, leggy or well-endowed Montez was, nor to describe certain body parts and the outfits that barely covered them. It may be that Montez sexualized herself in order to achieve the legendary Hollywood status that she yearned for, but it is another thing, 80 years later, to see the objectification continue in a biography ostensibly dedicated to her power and memory.</p> <p>That said, it is important to have a book the puts Montez back on the map, and hopefully there will be more where this one came from. Although Montez may not have made great art, her movies were sensual delights that helped audiences imagine other worlds – something most of us can get behind in these enormously stressful times of disease, political upheaval and climate crisis. Her self-confidence and originality also inspired queer communities to embrace themselves, resonating for decades afterwards. Most of all, she seemed to just be having lots of fun – reminding us all to find a little room for joy and glamor in our lives.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Queen of Technicolor: Maria Montez in Hollywood is out now</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/16/peru-fire-prevention-brigade-sacred-valley-wildfires-aoe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T06:15:49Z","webTitle":"‘It’s much easier to stop someone lighting a match than to put out a 1,000-acre fire’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/16/peru-fire-prevention-brigade-sacred-valley-wildfires-aoe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/16/peru-fire-prevention-brigade-sacred-valley-wildfires-aoe","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s much easier to stop someone lighting a match than to put out a 1,000-acre fire’","trailText":"In Peru’s Sacred Valley, a community-led initiative is creating fire prevention brigades to stop devastating wildfires before they even begin","byline":"Nick Dall","body":"<p>Peru’s Sacred Valley, the breathtaking landscape between Cusco and Machu Picchu, has always had a few conventional fire brigades, but anyone who has ever witnessed a bushfire will know there is little you can do once it takes hold. </p> <p>While there is a place for carefully managed burning – at the right time of year and in the right weather conditions it can clear land of brush and understory – reckless burns can be catastrophic. “Years of hard work can be undone in a single day,” says Joaquín Randall, who has set up the NGO <a href=\"http://vallesagradoverde.org/en/\">Valle Sagrado Verde</a>, a reforestation project planting native trees such as huaranhuay, chachacomo, molle and tara in the Sacred Valley. “2020 was a really bad year.

Thousands of years’ worth of topsoil can be washed away if it rains after a fire.”</p> <p>Randall felt that the time, money and energy spent on putting out fires would be better used preventing them. “It’s much easier to stop someone lighting a match than to put out a 1,000-acre fire,” he says.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/23/climate-crisis-driving-increase-in-wildfires-across-globe-says-report-aoe\">UN report</a> calculated that 50% of funding globally goes towards extinguishing fires, and just 1% on planning and prevention. The paper advises spending 50% on planning and prevention, 30% on response and 20% on recovery. Without these changes, the authors warn, wildfires will increase by a third by 2050.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We pay people to put fires out.

The municipality provided training, transportation and logistical and organisational support. Randall provided 80 safety vests and hard hats, and a financial incentive that would be paid if communities were able to prevent trees from burning.</p> <p>“It’s completely normal to pay people to put fires out,” says Randall. “So why shouldn’t we pay people to stop them from happening in the first place?”</p> <p>The prevention programme has focused on education, says Cusiyupanqui. “Using the volunteers as community spokespeople, we explained how controlled burning should be done, and we made sure they supervised all high-risk burns in the area.” </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4e8575311377e7acb77bbb15a0dda40468bd397\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4e8575311377e7acb77bbb15a0dda40468bd397/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"About 20 people at work on steep hillside\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers plant trees in the Sacred Valley as part of the fire prevention programme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Valle Sagrado Verde</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The farmers understood the message and welcomed this way of approaching fires,” says Carlos Olivera Puma, president of the fire prevention brigade in Rumira, near Machu Picchu. “Thank God there were no fires in our area last year.

In 2011, his first child was stillborn and he went with his wife down to the wild north coast of the county to escape. It was winter, and cold, and yet he walked into the ocean. “And for a few moments the grief wasn’t silenced so much as confronted by a wall of deafening white noise muting its constant scream. The sea’s great indifference was a comfort in a way I can’t easily explain and it continues to play its part.”</p> <p>Now, in <em><a href=\"https://www.quartoknows.com/books/9780711273962/the-draw-of-the-sea\">The Draw of the Sea</a></em>, Menmuir, whose 2016 Booker-longlisted novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/21/the-many-wyl-menmuir-review\">The Many</a></em> was set in a fishing village in Cornwall, has turned his focus on the place the sea plays in Britain’s collective consciousness, the way we have been shaped by the waters that surround us. He intercuts his own story – he moved to Cornwall in 2013 and he and his family now live a watery existence, swimming, surfing, rockpooling and beachcombing – with a broader consideration of the lives of a motley collection of seafarers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Menmuir is an inveterate beachcomber, reading complex histories into the objects he finds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book’s first chapter draws on the work of the Cornish playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/15/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Nick Darke</a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.janedarke.co.uk/boatshed-films-ltd/the-wrecking-season/\">final film</a> was a documentary charting the history of Cornish wreckers. While, as Menmuir says, “the term wreckers brings to mind false lights and ships lured on to the rocks”, there is little evidence that wrecking was ever this nefarious. Rather, it is the tradition, largely Cornish, of scouring the beaches for objects of greater or lesser use that are brought in by storms and the great ocean currents.</p> <p>Menmuir is an inveterate beachcomber, carrying out what he calls “flotsamancy” – reading complex histories into the objects he finds. As Darke’s widow says to him, these objects “make the whole world seem a whole lot smaller, a lot more connected”. He knows this intimately – his house was constructed of Nigerian iroko wood that fell from a ship off Penzance.</p> <p>The book is oriented south westerly, with the chapters taking place either in Cornwall or on the Isles of Scilly, 25 miles further out into the Atlantic. It is here that Menmuir and his family holiday and Scilly serves as a kind of dream landscape for him, one in which he is more easily able to immerse himself in the maritime world. The islands of the archipelago were once a single larger island, Ennor, and Menmuir uses the memory of this place to explore the legend of Lyonesse, the Arthurian Atlantis.</p> <p><em>The Draw of the Sea</em> is particularly good on the natural world. There’s a wonderful story of the traditional method of hunting conger eels in Scilly – you suspend a small boy in front of the hole in which they live, wait for the eel to wrap itself around him and then pull the boy up. Elsewhere, we learn that barnacles have a “lucky dip penis” up to eight times the length of their body. They reach blindly out with their extensive members in the hope of encountering a nearby mate – of either sex, barnacles being hermaphroditic.</p> <p>Menmuir’s novels are full of beautiful language and this, too, is a book that sings. He describes the feeling he gets by the sea as akin to “what I imagine the cathedral builders sought to achieve when they lifted the clerestories to the sky, creating a huge space to inspire awe and to humble, to lift the heart, a space filled with light and wonder”.

But that fear is a good thing, he stresses. “I want to do things I’ve never done before.”</p> <p>The play was written for Barnett by Marcelo Dos Santos, is directed by Matthew Xia and has been brought to the fringe by Fleabag producer Francesca Moody. Barnett plays a troubled comedian – at a festival not exactly short of them – and the show initially takes the form of a standup routine. It’s about “how much we lie to ourselves, how much we choose to reveal and how capable we are of being truly vulnerable,” says Barnett. Though, he adds quickly, it is “also really funny”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/16/feeling-afraid-as-if-something-terrible-is-going-to-happen-review-edinburgh-fringe\">Feeling Afraid As If Something Terrible Is Going to Happen review – seriously funny</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though Barnett came to prominence as part of an ensemble in Alan Bennett’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/may/19/theatre1\">The History Boys</a> – and still talks with great fondness of his co-stars, who included James Corden and Russell Tovey – he finds solo shows thrilling. Back in 2010, he gave a moving and tender performance as a young man grappling with his first tax return and slowly revealing the loss that shaped his life, in James Graham’s play The Man in the tiny Finborough theatre. The solo show is a particularly exposing form, he says. There’s nowhere to hide – particularly in Paines Plough’s Roundabout space, where his current plays is. But it can be incredibly intimate. “Each time I do one of these shows, I have to get over that initial fear of looking people in the eye and interacting with them.” Ultimately, he says, it’s a liberating thing to do as a performer. “My true love is new writing in small spaces.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdd6d32dd5792a171a1a9727479343c8c4068e82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdd6d32dd5792a171a1a9727479343c8c4068e82/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liberating … Samuel Barnett in Feeling Afraid As If Something Terrible Is Going to Happen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liberating … Samuel Barnett in Feeling Afraid As If Something Terrible Is Going to Happen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Born in Whitby in 1980, Barnett is part of a large family – one of four siblings. He started performing young, before moving to London to study at Lamda and spent most of his 20s playing the role of Posner in Nicholas Hytner’s production of The History Boys. (Defining line: “I’m a Jew. I’m small. I’m a homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I’m fucked.”) He was involved from the first reading, did the play at the National and in the West End, toured with it to Broadway – where he was nominated for a Tony award – as well as to Australia and Hong Kong, and starred in the 2006 film, also directed by Hytner.</p> <p>He’d be intrigued to see how a director would address the play today – particularly teacher Hector’s inappropriate behaviour with his young male students, groping them as they ride on the back of his motorcycle. The boys in the play treat it as a rite of passage. Though the play was written in a pre-#MeToo era, “we all had issues with it back then,” says Barnett. While Bennett and Hytner said it was true to their experiences at school in the 50s and 60s, the play was set in the 1980s which made it more jarring. Not that the setting changes things, Barnett stresses. “It’s not OK. It’s never been OK – you cannot behave like this.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2cc004623906f0a10336649bb2daa514b3123b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2cc004623906f0a10336649bb2daa514b3123b5/0_28_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barnett, third from right, with the cast of Nicholas Hynter’s film adaptation of The History Boys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barnett, third from right, with the cast of Nicholas Hynter’s film adaptation of The History Boys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Playing a teenager in that production for so long, he says, kept him “emotionally young”. That and his boyish looks mean it’s taken him some time to be taken seriously as an actor in older roles. But he’s enjoying the opportunity to play characters closer to his age, as is the case in Edinburgh. He used to find it easy to play naive but now finds it much harder, while at the same time: “I’m probably even more openly vulnerable than I used to be, because I know myself, so I can bring more to the role.”</p> <p>In 2016 he played the main character – a detective who relies on coincidence to solve cases – in Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency, based on the books by Douglas Adams, and more recently starred in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/03/four-lives-review-stephen-merchant-chilling-stephen-port-troubling-mind-boggling-drama-police-protect-and-serve\">Four Lives</a>, Neil McKay’s BBC drama about the multiple police failings in the case of Stephen Port, who killed four young gay men. Barnett played Port’s neighbour, who was dismissed when he first attempted to provide information to the police, and delivers a speech accusing them of having blood on their hands. “It was great to be in something that was going to educate and have an impact, and that was really important to the LGBTQ+ community. It really had something to say.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1b481c46a71aeb0ce4d90df40fa8ee9a82ef1acc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b481c46a71aeb0ce4d90df40fa8ee9a82ef1acc/0_293_3865_4825/801.jpg\" alt=\"‘I’m probably more vulnerable than I used to be’ … Samuel Barnett.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I have to get over that fear of looking people in the eye’ … Samuel Barnett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barnett’s father and grandfather both died from Covid-19 during the pandemic. It prompted him to research his family history, and he penned a show, Medium, about his discovery that he came from a line of magicians. Like so many people who lost loved ones to the disease, he was unable to be with his father in his last days. “I think it’s a privilege, a human privilege, to be able to go through a process of death with someone,” he says. Covid restrictions prevented that. “And then it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/12/partygate-police-have-issued-50-fixed-penalty-notices-says-met\">all these rules were broken anyway</a>. That’s galling.”</p> <p>The lockdown did at least give him the opportunity to grieve properly. “I couldn’t go anywhere so I had the time and space to face it,” he says. As for the government: “I don’t have the energy to waste on getting angry about them.” On the one hand, the feelings of rage and powerlessness would just be too much, he says, if he were to give in to them. But he’s also sensitive to the fact that humans are fallible and politicians are humans too. That doesn’t make it easier, he says. “But governments fall and this one will fall eventually.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/feeling-afraid-as-if-something-terrible-is-going-to-happen\">Feeling Afraid As If Something Terrible Is Going to Happen</a> is at Roundabout @ Summerhall until 28 August.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"travel/2022/aug/16/crete-village-samaria-white-mountains-eco-tourism-hiking-walking-holidays","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"Discreet Crete: exploring the Greek island’s gorges and ancient villages on a new eco-tour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/16/crete-village-samaria-white-mountains-eco-tourism-hiking-walking-holidays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/aug/16/crete-village-samaria-white-mountains-eco-tourism-hiking-walking-holidays","fields":{"headline":"Discreet Crete: exploring the Greek island’s gorges and ancient villages on a new eco-tour","trailText":"Away from the bars and bustle, Crete’s spectacular White Mountains are opening up to sensitive and sustainable travel – with scrumptious food","byline":"Lorna Parkes","body":"<p>‘Tonight there will be you and me and the goats,” my guide Vassia Mastrogianni explained as we began our car journey into Crete’s White Mountains.

Crete and Croatia are the first two collaborations, and there are three more in the pipeline.<br><br>On the edge of Samaria national park, we stopped at the yawning mouth of Aradena gorge to take a walk through an abandoned stone village torn apart by a 1940s vendetta. The heinous crime? A goat’s bell, taken by a boy who then refused to return it. Seven people died because of the family feuds that ensued, said Mastrogianni, resulting in a slow exodus from which the village never recovered. Such travesties characterised an era of deprivation and lawlessness after the second world war, when Greece was racked by civil war and the White Mountains harboured militia and guns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aec388a32620f111ad961aa9ab13b307f0486a06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aec388a32620f111ad961aa9ab13b307f0486a06/0_294_4032_2730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aradena village byzantine church\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aradena’s byzantine church</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorna Parkes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But now there are signs of life in the village again. Amid the goats and rubble, some families have returned to rebuild their houses. A waymarked walking trail through the village is bringing tourists. The vertiginous bridge connecting Aradena and this south-eastern pocket of Samaria national park to Crete’s road network was only built in 1987, but is in itself now an attraction. We found a bungee jumper there, goading himself to dive into the throat of the 138-metre-deep gorge from a metal platform.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/06/zakros-gorge-hiking-and-foraging-in-crete\">Walk like a Minoan: hiking and foraging in eastern Crete</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ten minutes further down the road, our base village of Agios Ioannis emerged out of nowhere as a cluster of houses sprawled across an 800-metre-high plateau.

It was very different,” Georgedakis told me, as we picked our way between limestone boulders as big as grazing flocks of sheep, on a woodland hiking trail cleared and waymarked with help from Meet. “It took two hours to get to the next village.”</p> <p>A strong scent of pine hung like incense in the close air as we headed gently downhill to a clifftop clearing where a sparkling bay hooked around the southern Sfakia coast – a region where small villages are connected by water taxis and footpaths alone. Far below, the sea lapped at the doors of a 1,000-year-old church as small as a chess piece.</p> <p>Beyond it, Georgedakis pointed out Agia Roumeli, the small coastal town at the exit of the Samaria Gorge – Crete’s second most visited tourist attraction after the Palace of Knossos. Despite being so close, there is no road to Samaria from this south-eastern swathe of the national park. Agios Ioannis felt utterly disconnected from it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"96986e7868aac94de689330ac352abfccea47eca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96986e7868aac94de689330ac352abfccea47eca/0_116_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alonis Guesthouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from the Alonis guesthouse</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorna Parkes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Samaria, Meet’s objective is to promote low-impact tourism that helps preserve the traditional culture and the natural environment that is so undisturbed in this area of the park. But local businesses must meet strict sustainability criteria before coming on board. For Alonia Guesthouse, this involved reporting huge amounts of granular business data – from how much rice is used in the guesthouse meals and the consumption of fuel used in its daily activities, to how many kilowatts and cubic metres of water are consumed each year.</p> <p>That evening, at the instruction of our hosts, we didn’t eat until the bees had gone to sleep. The light of a silvery moon illuminated the mountaintops like a floating spectre – and there was no rice on the dinner table. Only specialities such as Cretan salad with mizithra cheese, boureki potato pie, sweet pork and butter-soft lamb with heaped mounds of creamy tzatziki and Greek fava dip drenched in local olive oil. Invisible goat bells played an erratic tune, like a toddler running riot with a tin can through the hills. Tomorrow we would discover the little-visited Sfakia coast, but I knew that I’d be reluctant to leave these mountains.</p> <p><em>• </em><em>Trip provided by Intrepid Travel.

It feels as if the Conservative leadership race has been going on forever at this point. The low hum of political drama has largely faded into the background, subsumed by reports of various economic and social crises. However, in just over two weeks the next prime minister of this country will be announced and with them will come a new(ish) government. The scales look tipped in favour of Liz Truss: a poll of Conservative party members for the Observer put her<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/13/poll-of-tory-members-gives-liz-truss-22-point-lead-to-be-next-prime-minister\"> 22 points</a> ahead of Rishi Sunak.

They will be inheriting a country barrelling towards a second recession in two years, a looming energy crisis this winter and escalating conflict in Ukraine. How would Truss tackle these colossal problems, and which MPs would she enlist to tackle them?</p> <p>***</p> <p>1 Chancellor of the exchequer</p> <p>A central part of Truss’s approach to economic policy is downsizing the state and putting more money into people’s pockets. Her tenure would see a significant departure from the kind of policies that were implemented under Rishi Sunak. The person who has stayed loyal to Truss and shares her vision is the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. “He would certainly be a bold pick [for chancellor], because he is very much a small-state thinker as well,” Bale says.</p> <p>To push Truss’s neoliberal Thatcherism, Kwarteng would likely focus on light-touch regulation that a Truss government will regard as essential for a global Britain to reap the benefits of Brexit. But a change of chancellor is not a given, Bale adds. “Some of Truss’s policies will likely spook the markets, and one way of counteracting that will be to keep the current chancellor [Nadhim Zahawi] in place.”</p> <p>Ultimately, whatever big ideas Truss and her government might try to push through, policy will be informed by the state of the economy. “The chancellor will have to live in the real world,” Bale says. That might mean direct subsidies to help people handle the cost of living crisis. Promises of large tax cuts and scaling back government intervention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/liz-truss-economic-plan-ruinous-nonsense-no-reference-to-reality\">are looking increasingly difficult to fulfil</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <p>2 Home secretary</p> <p>Some continuation of the status quo in the Home Office is likely, with Truss, like Sunak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/aug/03/conservative-leadership-race-liz-truss-civil-service-pay-poll-lead-rishi-sunak-hustings-uk-politics-live\">having committed to the plan to deport UK migrants to Rwanda</a>. “Whether they will be any more successful at actually making that plan work is a very different matter,” Bale says.</p> <p>One of the possible picks for home secretary is the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, who has been a Truss backer from the start. Operationally, Coffey makes a lot of sense, but there is no indication that a Coffey Home Office will have more luck than Priti Patel in reducing immigration or implementing other policies. “When it comes to immigration, the secret story of the last two or three years has been the fact that the Conservative government has run a relatively liberal immigration policy in many respects,” Bale explains. “They haven’t necessarily reduced immigration. European migrants to this country are being replaced by migrants from other parts of the world, especially south Asia, in particular into higher-skilled roles.” Regardless of who is running the Home Office then, balancing election pledges of lower numbers with a laissez-faire approach to certain kinds of migrants (richer ones from outside Europe) will be a line the Conservatives will likely try to toe.</p> <p>***</p> <p>3 Foreign secretary</p> <p>While Liz Truss has been described by many as a political chameleon, she has been steadfast in her views about foreign policy. “I think the Truss government will be Johnson on steroids in some ways when it comes to foreign policy,” Bale says. He predicts that she will likely pick another hawkish figure, such as the chairman of the foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, who also has taken a hardline stance on China and is in favour of interventionist policies and higher defence spending.</p> <p>***</p> <p>4 Will the next government be a winner?</p> <p>Politics is fickle and fast-moving, so predicting the future can be futile. However, any Conservative government has an uphill battle at the next election. Tory MPs did not overwhelmingly back Liz Truss, and it is no secret that divided parties don’t do well during elections. While Truss is significantly more popular than Sunak with the Tory membership, this could be her undoing in the long run if she does win the leadership vote. “Just as there was an underrating of Truss before the contest began, we are perhaps beginning to see an overrating of Truss as the contest has proceeded,” says Bale.</p> <p>This pendulum swing reminds Bale of when Theresa May became prime minister in 2016. “She was going to be the new Thatcher: people were going to unite around her, people supposedly admired her very direct style, her honesty, her authenticity – but it all fell apart very quickly,” he says. “And I suspect, or at least I fear, that might be the case with Truss as well.” It’s impossible to know where the country will be in two years when the next general election is expected to take place, and what kind of political landscape it could take place in. However, it is obvious that if Liz Truss becomes the next prime minster, regardless of what her cabinet looks like she has a mammoth task ahead.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p>I loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/15/you-have-to-be-100-times-funnier-in-danish-the-pitfalls-and-pleasures-of-taking-comedy-across-borders\">Rachael Healy’s Edinburgh fringe-adjacent piece</a> on <strong>comics who perform in second languages</strong>.

While GCSE attainment has been increasing over time, 16-year-olds who are eligible for free school meals are still around 27 percentage points less likely to earn good GCSEs than less disadvantaged peers.”<br><br>At the start of their educational journey, just 57% of English pupils eligible for free school meals reached a good level of development at the end of reception in 2019, compared with 74% of their better-off peers, the report notes.</p> <p>Failure is “baked in” at an early age, the authors say. Fewer than half of disadvantaged children reached expected levels of attainment at the end of primary school, compared with nearly 70% of their better-off peers. Of those who do achieve the expected level, just 40% of disadvantaged pupils go on to receive good GCSEs in English and maths, compared with 60% of better-off students.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest failure of the education system, the report suggests, is that for those leaving school with poor GCSEs, there is a lack of a clear path and “second chances”, leaving millions disadvantaged throughout their lifetime.</p> <p>The report finds the relationship between family background and attainment is not limited to the poorest, but educational performance improves as family income goes up. Just over 10% of young people in middle-earning families gained at least one A or A* grade at GCSE, compared to a third of pupils from the wealthiest tenth of families.</p> <p>These inequalities lead to vast gaps in earning, the report says, pointing out that by the age of 40 the average UK employee with a degree earns twice as much as someone qualified to GCSE level or below.</p> <p>“These challenges are set to become more acute,” the report concludes. “The Covid-19 pandemic put the education system under enormous strain, with significant learning loss overall and a huge increase in educational inequalities.</p> <p>“Perhaps even more damaging in the longer term will be the social, emotional and behavioural impacts of missing out on classroom learning and formative experiences during the lockdowns.”</p> <p>Imran Tahir, a research economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: “We can’t expect the education system to overcome all the differences between children from different family backgrounds. But the English system could do a lot better.</p> <p>“If the government is to meet its mission to have 90% of pupils attaining the expected level at the end of primary school [as stated in its recent schools white paper], it needs to prioritise the education system and especially the disadvantaged pupils within it.”</p> <p>Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said: “Some 12 years of Conservative governments have utterly failed to tackle inequalities across the education system, which are letting down our children and holding back young people’s opportunities and life chances.</p> <p>“200,000 primary schoolchildren do not have access to a good or outstanding school, teachers are leaving our schools in record numbers, GCSE grades among children on free school meals are going backwards. The Tories are messing about with school structures, not improving children’s outcomes.”</p> <p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “Government policy is in a rut of meaningless targets, empty rhetoric and pitiful levels of funding.</p> <p>“We need to see investment in early years education, better support for schools which face the greatest challenges, funding for schools and post-16 education which matches the level of need, and a rethink of qualifications and curriculum so that they work well for all learners.”</p> <p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Since 2011, we have narrowed the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers at every stage of education up to the pandemic, and recent figures show that a record proportion of the most disadvantaged students are progressing to higher education.</p> <p>“As part of our work to level up opportunities for all we have invested nearly £5bn to help young people to recover from the impact of the pandemic – with over 2m tutoring courses now started by the pupils who need them most – alongside an ambitious target for 90% of children to leave primary school at the expected standard in reading, writing and maths by 2030.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/16/half-empty-glasses-review-activism-in-all-its-messy-complexities","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T05:00:49Z","webTitle":"Half-Empty Glasses review – activism in all its messy complexities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/16/half-empty-glasses-review-activism-in-all-its-messy-complexities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/16/half-empty-glasses-review-activism-in-all-its-messy-complexities","fields":{"headline":"Half-Empty Glasses review – activism in all its messy complexities","trailText":"The problems facing 16-year-old Toye when he resolves to include Black voices his school curriculum are brought to compelling life","byline":"Catherine Love","body":"<p>How do you change the world? That’s the question at the heart of Dipo Baruwa-Etti’s new play. He and his young protagonist are hardly the first to ask it. As the play itself makes clear, 16-year-old Toye – a talented pianist and gifted student – is the latest in a long line of people who have tried to make their mark. But what stops this from becoming a glib meditation on a well-worn subject is its ability to capture the messy complexities of activism, social change and personal ambition.</p> <p>When we first meet him, Toye (Samuel Tracy) is utterly focused on his immediate goal: winning a music scholarship to a private school. But while revising, he starts to notice the absence of his own history and culture in the curriculum. As a corrective, he starts a lunchtime club to teach Black British history to his classmates, supported by best friends Remi (Princess Khumalo) and Asha (Sara Hazemi). Initially, it seems like this might be a simple story of awakening and inspiration. But Half-Empty Glasses is more complicated than that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/15/breathless-review-a-hoarder-of-clothes-edinburgh\">Breathless review – a hoarder of clothes begins dating a minimalist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As so often happens, Toye soon finds himself hemmed in by structures far bigger than he is. Remi and Asha, meanwhile, favour different tactics. Head girl Remi urges a more patient and incremental approach; Asha wants to widen their focus to bring in other marginalised figures, including those from her own Middle Eastern background. For Toye, the self-appointed and increasingly stubborn leader, it’s confrontational protest or nothing. Baruwa-Etti has the skill of making all these perspectives equally compelling without the play ever feeling like a contrived debate. As performed by the strong cast of three, each of the viewpoints on offer comes across as real and deeply rooted in character.</p> <p>In Kaleya Baxe’s simple but focused production for Paines Plough’s Roundabout space, Rory Beaton’s lighting is the star. When Toye plays piano or reads about Black history, the space explodes with colour, showing the different hues that art, knowledge and empowerment can bring to human experience. This, the staging seems to suggest, is what’s at stake: the right to a world full of colour and light.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/half-empty-glasses\">Roundabout @ Summerhall, Edinburgh</a>, until 28 August.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2022\">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a>.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/16/labour-to-push-energy-price-cap-policy-in-campaign-blitz","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T05:00:49Z","webTitle":"Labour to push energy price cap policy in campaign blitz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/16/labour-to-push-energy-price-cap-policy-in-campaign-blitz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/16/labour-to-push-energy-price-cap-policy-in-campaign-blitz","fields":{"headline":"Labour to push energy price cap policy in campaign blitz","trailText":"Party aims to get out message on plan to tackle cost of living before new Conservative PM enters No 10","byline":"Jessica Elgot and Peter Walker","body":"<p>Labour is planning a campaigning blitz in order to take ownership of its new energy price cap policy in case the next Tory leader bows to pressure and cancels the 80% rise expected in October.</p> \n<p>Keir Starmer has vowed that his party “wouldn’t let people pay a penny more” on their gas and electricity bills this winter, proposing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/14/labour-announces-plan-to-freeze-energy-price-cap-with-reinforced-windfall-tax\">freezing the price cap at current levels</a> and preventing the average household bill from reaching £3,600.</p> \n<p>Senior sources said the party had limited time to get out its message before the next Tory leader, presumed to be Liz Truss, enters No 10. The new prime minister will need to produce a comprehensive package on the cost of living, despite Truss’s reticence to spell out how she would help beyond tax cuts.</p> \n<p>Labour will increase efforts to promote its policy in the coming days, including with digital adverts, campaign tools for local parties and with direct mail for MPs to use. Plans for the summer offensive have been in the works since mid-July.</p> \n<p>Over the coming weeks, the party will set out more on its energy policy offer, including plans to upgrade 19m homes to make them more energy efficient, double onshore and offshore wind capacity and triple solar power.</p> \n<p>Starmer has said Labour’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/14/labour-announces-plan-to-freeze-energy-price-cap-with-reinforced-windfall-tax\">plan</a>, funded in part by an expanded windfall tax, is the radical approach needed to help households and reduce inflation, contrasting it with the inaction of a “lame duck” government.</p> \n<p>“We asked ourselves: do we want a plan that allows those prices to go up, causes that anxiety, and then rebates some people after the event, but doesn’t do anything about inflation, or do we want to be more radical, more bold, more ambitious?” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.</p> \n<p>“One of the benefits of our proposal is that it brings inflation down, which benefits everybody, but particularly those who are most vulnerable, and those who are least well off.”</p> \n<p>Sources close to Starmer say plans for the party conference will need to be adapted on the basis of what the new prime minister announces in the first weeks in office, especially if there is an early emergency budget.</p> \n<p>Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economics thinktank, has queried whether Labour’s plan would help greatly with inflation, saying the rate would go up again once the energy subsidy ended.</p> \n<p>Starmer will visit marginal seats across the country almost every day of the coming fortnight, while the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will visit Scotland to outline how Labour’s plans compare with the SNP’s.</p> \n<p>“We are working with the assumption Liz Truss is going to do a big offer on energy – we are assuming that what she says now is fairly different to what she will do,” one senior Labour source said. “She will do what is politically salient. So we need to make sure we look like we are winning the argument now.”</p> \n<p>Senior Labour politicians will increase calls for the Tory candidates to outline their plans faster. Before the first Conservative hustings in Scotland, in Perth on Tuesday evening, Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, issued a call for the candidates to set out their cost of living packages before the price cap announcement on 26 August.</p> \n<p>“If this was a banking crisis, the government would act. If this was a war, the government would act,” he said. “Tonight, in their hustings, the candidates must immediately clarify whether they agree with Labour’s proposals. And if not, what their alternative proposals are. The British people deserve answers, not more delay from a distracted and out-of-touch Conservative government.”</p> \n<p>Momentum, the leftwing grassroots group that has often been at loggerheads with Starmer, issued a statement backing Labour’s plan on Monday night, though it said it should extend to full-scale nationalisation.</p> \n<p>Hilary Schan, a Momentum co-chair, said: “Labour should be arguing for public ownership, at a fraction of the price. It’s the commonsense solution, backed by most voters, and the best way to keep soaring bills down.”</p> \n<p>Reeves told TalkTV on Monday night that she remained sceptical of full-scale nationalisation, although she did not think the energy sector was “working today”.</p> \n<p>She added: “The whole point of the package we’ve put together today is that every single penny of it will go directly to lowering people’s bills.”</p> \n<p>Starmer has faced criticism for the time it has taken for Labour to put out its plan. A week ago the Liberal Democrats <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/08/ed-davey-calls-for-energy-furlough-scheme-to-avoid-october-price-cap-rise\">said the energy price cap rise</a> should be stopped, and the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/10/gordon-brown-says-energy-firms-unable-to-offer-lower-bills-should-be-temporarily-re-nationalised\">set out his own plan</a> for the crisis.</p> \n<p>Starmer told BBC One’s Breakfast programme that his team had been working on the plan for more than six weeks. He added: “I’m not going to apologise for going on holiday with my kids. It’s the first time we’ve had a real holiday for about three years.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/16/lebanese-town-yaroun-stays-silent-on-salman-rushdie-alleged-attacker","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T05:00:48Z","webTitle":"Lebanese town stays silent on Salman Rushdie’s alleged attacker ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/lebanese-town-yaroun-stays-silent-on-salman-rushdie-alleged-attacker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/16/lebanese-town-yaroun-stays-silent-on-salman-rushdie-alleged-attacker","fields":{"headline":"Lebanese town stays silent on Salman Rushdie’s alleged attacker ","trailText":"In Yaroun, where Hadi Matar is thought to have spent several summers, locals are keeping their heads down","byline":"Martin Chulov in Yaroun, south Lebanon","body":"<p>The home town of the father of Salman Rushdie’s would-be assassin is a forbidding place, where Shia Islamic iconography sits among palatial mansions, bullet-pockmarked homes and wary locals, who for now want nothing to do with visitors.</p> <p>Yaroun, on Lebanon’s border with Israel, has long been a centre of Iran’s four-decade-old conflict with Israel.

Now we’re paying the price","trailText":"From the climate to water and energy, our country is facing multiple crises that are a product of total political failure, says Guardian columnist John Harris","byline":"John Harris","body":"<p>“Almost nothing seems to be working in Britain,” says <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/08/09/almost-nothing-seems-to-be-working-in-britain-it-could-get-worse\">the Economist</a>. The Financial Times reckons the country is “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8efd8261-8ef2-4734-a58f-3ee5364347aa\">creaking</a>”; one Daily Telegraph columnist, with characteristic restraint, foretells “<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/08/10/horrifying-truth-behind-coming-collapse-basketcase-britain/\">the coming collapse of basketcase Britain</a>”.</p> <p>Whatever conclusions follow, the basic observation is much the same: what with skyrocketing bills, crisis-plagued railways, a drought worsened by our decaying water infrastructure and an NHS once again on the brink of collapse, the United Kingdom is being confronted with huge problems it can no longer wish away. Up to now, it has been easy to pin the blame for our malaise on whatever crisis was then afflicting us. But there suddenly seems to be a dawning understanding that the era of Covid-19, Brexit, the war in Ukraine and the overarching climate emergency have exposed fundamental failures that have been festering for decades.</p> <p>Mounting predictions of a national meltdown only highlight a story that ought to be very familiar by now: the deep and enduring problem of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/10/britain-crises-one-thing-in-common-failure-to-invest-cost-of-living-drought-covid\">British underinvestment</a>, and a national mindset innately averse to thinking about the future. From time to time, some or other grand project – London’s new Elizabeth line is a good example – suggests that the right people can just about get their act together. But for the most part, we have an economic model that excels at ephemeral stuff, but fails when it comes to the things that everyday life – let alone a healthy, future-proofed economy – actually depend on.</p> <p>In that sense, the quintessential modern British experience is that of being stranded in the kind of mainline railway station where the consumerist wonderment extends into the distance – able to buy the latest in coffee, sushi and so-called Cornish pasties – but being faced with points failures, shortages of train staff, and that grimly British incantation about “any inconvenience caused”.</p> <p>In 2018, a <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/blogs/uk-third-bottom-global-investment-league\">report by the TUC</a> revealed that private and public investment as a proportion of national income put us 34th in a ranking of 36, trailed only by Portugal and Greece. In the 40 years to 2019, fixed investment in the UK averaged <a href=\"https://economy2030.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Stagnation_nation_interim_report.pdf\">19% of GDP</a>, the lowest in the G7. Now, business investment in the UK remains more than 9% below its pre-pandemic level. Crucial parts of our national infrastructure have been failed twice over: first when they were state-owned and let down by the stinginess of the man from the ministry – and then when they became privatised victims of modern capitalism’s increasing fondness for stripping out, squeezing down, and chasing dividends.</p> <p>The fate of England’s water is a particularly vivid example. Pipes, reservoirs and treatment works were once owned and run by local councils, but <a href=\"https://corporatewatch.org/who-owns-your-water-and-how-theyll-try-to-keep-it/\">are now in the possession</a> of a mind-boggling mess of interests that includes a Malaysian conglomerate called the YTL corporation, Norway’s state-owned bank and JP Morgan Asset Management. The consequences have been as mad as that suggests: between 1991 and 2019, such shareholders were paid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/england-privatised-water-firms-dividends-shareholders\">£57bn in dividends</a> – nearly half what the water companies spent on maintaining and improving their infrastructure.</p> <p>Late last week, there were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d53c3c4-a189-488d-aff3-3b63bddd1937\">reports of ministers</a> threatening electricity generators with an extended windfall tax, unless they used hugely increased profits to invest in green energy rather than pay shareholder dividends – a story that once again highlighted the tensions between instant payouts and longer-term considerations. Given that the average company share is now held for about six months, the former usually wins.</p> <p>Executive bonuses based on annual results are part of the same problem. In the consumer economy, the results are bad enough (think of the hours most of us spend on poorly staffed customer helplines). But once that logic dictates decisions that affect our most basic infrastructure, you get a mixture of tragedy and disaster: national resilience coming a distant second to the kind of greed that finds a home in offshore tax havens.</p> <p>Our systems of politics and power hardly help. With elections seemingly arriving every couple of years, and with our fourth prime minister since 2016 imminent, it is hardly surprising that planning – and spending – for the future so rarely intrude on the national conversation. The problem is made worse by the stupidities of a two-party system built on the idea that consensus is for wimps, and by post-Thatcher Conservatism – funded by bond traders and hedge fund managers, and deeply averse to any suggestion that the state should spend significant amounts of money.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest issue of all is that the British state is so centralised: overloaded Whitehall departments cannot possibly deal with demands for investment from wildly different parts of the country, and are usually beholden to the penny-pinching mindset of the Treasury.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/10/tax-profits-freeze-energy-prices-bring-suppliers-into-public-sector-gordon-brown\">We must tax profits now, freeze energy price rises - and if necessary bring suppliers into the public sector | Gordon Brown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What may or may not happen once Boris Johnson’s successor takes over is a very interesting question. Current levels of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-2020-documents/spending-review-2020\">public sector investment</a> have just about moved us away from the chronic self-harm of the austerity years, but they still fall short of the emergencies we will carry on facing – and besides, the Tories’ evident post-Johnson lurch to the right makes such small gains feel fragile. Most big investment ideas remain for the birds: all our big cities should have modern transit systems, but given that such things get nowhere without permission from the centre, most of them look set to remain stuck in the past. The climate crisis demands an energy revolution and home insulation programme that shows no convincing signs of materialising.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the term Theresa May and Boris Johnson used to describe renewed investment in parts of the country that had been denied it has literally become a joke: at a recent leadership hustings in Darlington, when Rishi Sunak was asked what “levelling up” actually means, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexofBrown/status/1557084983428370432\">simply laughed</a>. As the last few weeks have proved, neither public nor private investment really capture the Tory imagination: its members – and financial backers – want the sugar-rush economics of tax cuts instead.</p> <p>On the other side of the House of Commons, the opposition has better ideas – witness Labour’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/27/labour-promises-spend-28bn-year-tackling-climate-crisis\">£28bn-a-year climate investment pledge</a>. But Keir Starmer’s party hardly feels like it has the confidence or ideas to push us out of our current short-termism and future-denial (when the frontbencher Steve Reed was recently asked about taking energy companies back into public ownership, he ruled it out on the basis that “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaulStaniforth/status/1557627367421607941\">nationalising companies costs an awful lot of money</a>”).</p> <p>Those of us who make the case for a progressive politics that would run well beyond Labour – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/26/boris-johnson-tories-progressive-alliance-byelections-uk-government\">embrace coalition</a> and consensus instead of rejecting them – don’t do so because it would be nice if everyone got along better. The case for a more pluralistic way of doing things is all about the realisation that long-term thinking and lasting change require a different political mentality. Unless it arrives, the crises over housing, water, energy and all the rest will grind on, and the kind of corporate governance that might help push us somewhere different will always be deferred until tomorrow.</p> <p>Whatever the alarm about a country that no longer works, this is exactly the impasse in which we find ourselves: well aware of the danger, but as the David Bowie song put it, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv7Y7F-Q2KE\">always crashing in the same car</a>. </p> <ul> <li><p>John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/16/question-of-time-ukrainians-determined-win-back-south","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T05:00:48Z","webTitle":"‘A question of time’: Ukrainians determined to win back the south","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/question-of-time-ukrainians-determined-win-back-south","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/16/question-of-time-ukrainians-determined-win-back-south","fields":{"headline":"‘A question of time’: Ukrainians determined to win back the south","trailText":"War against Russia is entering a decisive phase, but on the frontline a big push still feels some way off","byline":"Luke Harding in Mykolaiv; pictures and video by Christopher Cherry","body":"<p>In a wrecked office inside Mykolaiv’s administration building in southern Ukraine, Dmytro Pletenchuk showed off his collection of Russian weapons. Propped against the wall were fired Russian rockets and cluster bombs. “I’m thinking about opening a bar for veterans when the war is over,” he said. “My friend who was killed in Kharkiv used to run one. We could use them as decorations.”</p> \n<p>Pletenchuk’s one-time government workplace was a spectacular ruin. In March, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/jul/21/footage-appears-to-show-russian-missile-mykolaiv-video\">Russian missile slammed into the regional state HQ</a>, gouging a giant hole, killing 37 people and wounding many more. The security guards in reception miraculously survived. Colleagues having breakfast in the canteen were less fortunate. There are bloodstains on the stairs and in an upstairs corridor.</p> \n<p>“We are fighting against fucking idiots. It’s good for us. But they have nuclear weapons,” Pletenchuk said, showing off his glass-strewn ninth-floor office, with a panoramic view over the city’s river and port. “Russia is like a monkey with a hand grenade,” he added. “It’s a problem for the whole world. We don’t know<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/13/its-madness-ukraine-holds-breath-as-putin-turns-nuclear-plant-into-frontline\"> if they are going to blow everyone up.”</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5d4dd5cc-607a-4486-a644-3e875cc918a3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3t4FNJwpwFU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Early in Vladimir Putin’s invasion, Russian troops came close to seizing Mykolaiv, known in Soviet times for its huge shipyard. They swept up from Crimea, occupying the city of Kherson, a regional capital, and much of southern Ukraine. In September, the Kremlin plans to hold “referendums” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/ukraine-kherson-region-referendum-russia\">in Kherson</a> and Zaporizhzhia provinces, which will almost certainly result in them being annexed to Russia.</p> \n<p>Ukraine is determined to stop this happening. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has ordered a counteroffensive. The goal is to liberate Kherson and surrounding Russian-occupied settlements on the right bank of the Dnieper River, followed by further territories in the south and east, and ultimately Crimea itself, seized in 2014 by undercover Russian operatives.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/kherson-locator/giv-6562jRQk3Z2bC57o/\" data-alt=\"Map of Ukraine frontline\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/kherson-locator/giv-6562jRQk3Z2bC57o/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Six months on, the war is entering a decisive phase. The next few weeks may determine Ukraine’s de facto borders for years to come. In the eastern Donbas, Russian troops continue to advance, pressing on the Ukrainian-controlled cities of Bakhmut and Sloviansk. In the south, by contrast, their grip appears shakier. The frontline runs between Mykolaiv and Kherson, across a steppe landscape of fields and pulverised villages.</p> \n<p>Since June Ukraine has deployed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/himars-what-are-the-advanced-rockets-us-is-sending-ukraine\"> US-supplied Himars multiple rocket launch systems</a> to clinical effect. It has knocked out four crossing points over the Dnieper, including the Antonivsky Bridge connecting Kherson with the left-bank town of Oleshky. Russia’s S-300 and S-400 air defences seem powerless. Over the weekend they failed to stop the latest Himars strike. Video shows orange explosions and clouds of black smoke above the bridge.</p> \n<p>Guided missiles also hit the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, rendering its bridge unusable to heavy vehicles. Ammunition dumps and command posts have been blown up. Last week Kyiv <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/russian-warplanes-destroyed-in-crimea-saky-airbase-attack-satellite-images-show\">wiped out Saky aerodrome</a> on the west coast of Crimea, in a mysterious operation deep behind enemy lines. Eight war planes were destroyed.

Not enough to do an offensive now and to beat the enemy. It is enough to defend our territory,” said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/31/plea-for-heavy-weapons-ukraine-frontline-mykolaiv\">Roman Kostenko</a>, a pro-European deputy who heads the parliamentary defence and security committee. A special forces officer, Kostenko led the operation in March to defend Mykolaiv, where he and his military team are based.</p> \n<p>Advanced western weapons have allowed Ukraine to erode Moscow’s military superiority, slowly but surely. “They have made a difference. Previously they fired 100 shells at us, now they fire 20. We are approaching parity,” Kostenko said. He continued: “To liberate Kherson we don’t need to attack Kherson. If we control the bridge, they have no logistics. If they make a pontoon bridge, it can easily be destroyed.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4891b9702d327d584bf97c8ea8a663d50b1a8428\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4891b9702d327d584bf97c8ea8a663d50b1a8428/0_285_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damaged administration building in Mykolaiv\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The administration building in Mykolaiv that was destroyed by a Russian missile in March, killing 37 people.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Cherry/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Russians appear to have come to the same conclusion. Some western intelligence experts believe it is a matter of time before they abandon Kherson and retreat across the river. Their military leadership reportedly fled last week to the safer left bank. Russian motorised and airborne regiments have been reinforcing defensive positions, with additional soldiers brought in, as well as equipment from Crimea.</p> \n<p>Ukraine’s Himars rockets have a range of about 50 miles (80km). At the end of July a precision-guided missile<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JimmySecUK/status/1554925576053559299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"> blew up a military freight train</a> in the Kherson region town of Brylivka. Russia has relocated some of its forward command and control centres, pulling back to the village of Myrne, Kostenko said. Troops are digging trenches and moving into civilian houses.</p> \n<p>So far the Biden administration is refusing to supply Kyiv with Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) rockets, which can be used in Himars systems and have a 185-mile range. Its reasoning is that Ukraine could use them to strike Russia itself, an act the US fears may lead to a third world war. Zelenskiy dismisses this scenario and has pledged not to attack Russian territory. Negotiations continue, as the Pentagon reviews the situation.</p> \n<p>Occupied Crimea, though, is not Russia. The peninsula, heavily militarised by Moscow, is a legitimate Ukrainian target, according to Washington and its allies. “If we got ATACMS, we could hit the bridge linking Crimea with the Russian mainland. It would dramatically change our position in the south,” Kostenko said. “We understand the fears of the US side. But with ATACMS we could further degrade Russia’s logistics.”</p> \n<p>Kostenko’s Golos party colleague Roman Lozynskyi described Himars as a battlefield “game changer”. He showed the Guardian a 60-second video clip he filmed last month somewhere in the Mykolaiv region. A rocket pierces an inky black canopy, streaking above a ghostly tree line. The noise is shattering. More than a dozen guided missiles roar into the heavens, in rapid succession. There is smoke and bright white light.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/lukeharding1968/status/1558817440745889795\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Can Ukraine win back the south?

We can use it to destroy dozens of Russian military camps.” Alongside Kostenko, Lozynskyi is one of a handful of lawmakers from the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, to have joined the army. He has been serving since February on the southern front. In the corridor of his base are next-generation light antitank weapons and Stinger missiles.</p> \n<p>Until Ukraine strikes, Russia is able to bombard Mykolaiv every day. The city – home to 240,000 people, from a pre-invasion population of half a million – has been badly damaged. On Saturday three Uragan rockets smashed into the port. Missiles have wrecked schools, the national university, several hotels, and the Golden Pheasant restaurant. At least 121 people have been killed and 534 injured, including six children.</p> \n<p>Shelling has wrecked the main water pipe supplying the city. The local council has installed standpipes; residents spend part of their day queueing for drinking water and can be seen on the streets lugging five-litre bottles. “I ignore the explosions. If they bomb me, they can bomb me in my bed,” 72-year-old Valentina Bevz said as she waited her turn at a communal tap. “We have a saying: ‘You can’t escape your destiny.’”</p> \n<p>She said her sister had rung on the day of the invasion from Crimea, asking tearfully: “Will you break off contact with me?” Bevz said: “She understands what’s going on and her friends are decent people. Most Russians are zombies and chauvinists. They think Russia is always right.” Irina Moroz, 79, described Russia’s president as “Putler”. “The name is a cross between Putin and Hitler,” she said cheerfully.</p> \n<p>The governor of the Mykolaiv region, Vitaliy Kim, would not be drawn on when exactly Ukraine may go on the offensive. “It’s a question of time. I hope it will happen as soon as possible. We have an order to win back our territories and our people,” he said. The west could speed up the recapture of Kherson by giving Ukraine more heavy weapons and by not succumbing to war fatigue, he added.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5a9a9eef8fc8a5c12280016f941d4d69d3c45fe\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5a9a9eef8fc8a5c12280016f941d4d69d3c45fe/0_48_5477_3287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vitaliy Kim and friend\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vitaliy Kim (right) poses for a selfie with another man.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Cherry/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kim described the Kremlin’s tactics as “terrorism”. He said Russian soldiers were regularly shelling civilians to “break our will”. “It isn’t working. They are just killing people,” he noted. Asked if the promised counterattack was a bluff, the governor pointed to the gains Ukraine’s armed forces had already made. They had pushed the Russians back, he said, and liberated a string of villages to the east of Mykolaiv, around the Inhul River.</p> \n<p>Back at the shattered administration building, Pletenchuk – a captain in the navy and a public affairs officer – said he had no doubt Ukraine would prevail. Ukrainians had always resisted Russian imperialism, he said. They included his grandfather, whom Stalin sent to Siberia. Pletenchuk reasoned: “We have motivation. They don’t want to die in this country. We are defending our homeland. They are fighting for a washing machine.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/16/its-where-i-learned-how-to-be-a-comedian-nish-kumar-on-why-the-edinburgh-fringe-still-matters","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T05:00:48Z","webTitle":"‘It’s where I learned how to be a comedian’: Nish Kumar on why the Edinburgh fringe still matters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/16/its-where-i-learned-how-to-be-a-comedian-nish-kumar-on-why-the-edinburgh-fringe-still-matters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/16/its-where-i-learned-how-to-be-a-comedian-nish-kumar-on-why-the-edinburgh-fringe-still-matters","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s where I learned how to be a comedian’: Nish Kumar on why the Edinburgh fringe still matters","trailText":"The festival stands at a crossroads, with costs for performers soaring and many younger acts staying away.

This year, I will do a week of shows, performing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/25/nish-kumar-your-power-your-control-review-this-time-its-personal\" title=\"\">Your Power, Your Control</a>, which I began work on at 2021’s greatly reduced and socially distanced festival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07c55ff167d8d0e6139ff45abc3e977bfff9dc46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07c55ff167d8d0e6139ff45abc3e977bfff9dc46/0_0_2936_4360/673.jpg\" alt=\"We Are Klang, AKA Marek Larwood, Greg Davies and Steve Hall, in 2006\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Early inspiration … We Are Klang, AKA Marek Larwood, Greg Davies and Steve Hall, in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I first attended the fringe in 2006 as a member of the Durham Revue, a student comedy group that is like the Cambridge Footlights, minus the prestige and the everything. We spent all day handing out flyers with our faces on them to uninterested passersby, before performing an hour of sketch comedy. Our evenings were then spent drinking badly watered-down lager from the venue bar and trying to see as many shows as humanly possible.</p> <p>The truth is, I was in heaven. I was a lovely brown sponge, soaking up everything I could. I saw Greg Davies screaming in a portable building as part of the sketch group We Are Klang, an experience I would have subsequently at even closer quarters as a contestant on Taskmaster, a show the bearded weirdo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/mar/18/taskmaster-alex-horne-new-challenges-interview\" title=\"\">Alex Horne</a> developed initially for the fringe. I also saw a seminal performance by the even more bearded and even weirder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/02/dot-dot-dot-review-daniel-kitson-review\" title=\"\">Daniel Kitson</a>, a comedian, playwright and professional recluse.</p> <p>The fringe never stopped being an education for me. When I was starting to write hourlong shows of my own, I went to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/oct/20/bridget-christie-flashers-penis-horrible-menopause-comedy-female-anger-comedian\" title=\"\">Bridget Christie</a> and realised everything I was doing was shit and needed to be overhauled. I have watched shows by contemporaries, such as my ex-flatmate turned sitcom superstar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/23/rose-matafeo-comedy-baby-done-horndog-starstruck\" title=\"\">Rose Matafeo</a>, the sketch masters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/02/its-fun-to-play-the-men-weve-been-subjected-to-meet-lazy-susan-reinventors-of-the-female-sketch-show\" title=\"\">Lazy Susan</a> and the genius/serial award-loser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/16/james-acaster-life-on-a-plate-eat-ice-cream-all-the-time\" title=\"\">James Acaster</a>, that reminded me why I fell in love with comedy.</p> <p>When I hosted Edinburgh Nights for the BBC in 2018 and 2019, I was even forced to watch things that weren’t comedy.

In 2010 and 2011, I performed in a sketch double act with Tom Neenan. We were called the Gentlemen of Leisure and the show was a parody of The Culture Show on BBC Two and was exactly as financially profitable as it sounds. But we learned a huge amount about joke-writing and the partnership ended up with Tom becoming my partner in crimes against comedy on various radio shows and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/16/nish-kumar-bbc-must-be-clear-did-it-axe-the-mash-report-in-a-war-on-woke\" title=\"\">The Mash Report</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I was doing standup on the Free Fringe, where the audience members aren’t charged, but can offer a donation to the performers on leaving the venue. The aim is for the donation to be in cash, but we were often compensated in old playing cards, flyers for our own show and bits of string. Still, these were formative experiences, performing on 25 consecutive days, accelerating my development more than months of infrequent gigging on the open mic circuit in London possibly could.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"848798f220f9a2f39916c30a331958c87fda27f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/848798f220f9a2f39916c30a331958c87fda27f9/0_0_3721_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nish Kumar with his double-act partner, Tom Neenan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gentlemen of Leisure … with his double-act partner, Tom Neenan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is not to say that the festival has been without its lows. And my Gods (I am Hindu), those lows were low.</p> <p>In 2007, I was chased off stage by a heavy metal band – the venue had been double booked and the band and its fans were not in the mood for my brand of whimsy. That year, my student sketch group did a gig that went so badly that we exited through a fire escape so as not to have to speak to any of the other performers.</p> <p>In 2011, Tom and I arrived at our venue to find a bucket where the second row of seating should have been, as the cave we were performing in had sprung a leak. In 2013, a group of audience members waited outside to beat me up. </p> <p>Despite all this, I love the fringe. It is where I learned how to be a comedian and created work opportunities that I continue to benefit from. On my 30th birthday, I was nominated for the Edinburgh comedy award and offered a slot on Have I Got News for You and Live at the Apollo. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/20/david-o-doherty-milton-keynes-stables-review\" title=\"\">David O’Doherty</a> and I spent an hour searching for chips at 6am, so it wasn’t all glamour. The producers of The Mash Report saw me do a political show in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016 and felt I would be a good fit as host for the nascent TV series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57bca5bb6c0153fa708d2818428c739fb552fade\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57bca5bb6c0153fa708d2818428c739fb552fade/0_0_1120_630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachael Young\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beyond comedy … Rachael Young, the creator of Nightclubbing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcus Hessenberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At times, it can feel as though defending the fringe is morally indefensible, like eating meat or supporting Manchester United. Landlords have been encouraging students to stay in their flats in August, leading to a shortage of properties and driving up prices. The Fringe Society was forced to <a href=\"https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/edinburgh-residents-urged-to-take-in-fringe-performers-to-help-tackle-soaring-accommodation-costs-3669483\" title=\"\">launch a drive</a> to find Edinburgh residents who would be willing to rent properties to performers for less than £280 a person a week. Some performers are staying out of town in caravans or on campsites.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Fringe Society is facing criticism for <a href=\"https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-festival-fringe-met-backlash-24392841\" title=\"\">scrapping its app</a>, a valuable tool for performers to direct audiences to their shows, sell more tickets and hopefully mitigate some of those astronomical rents.</p> <p>The fringe is supposed to be a place where performers can come to experiment and evolve. However, it is turning into a playground for those born wealthy – like Monaco, but with more people who went to clown school.</p> <p>It has been heading this way for years – and I am not exactly an example to the contrary. I grew up middle class and went to a fancy university that subsidised my first two trips here. More significantly, when I started doing solo standup shows, my first three were paid for by a management company. At the time, the going rate for a solo show (including venue hire, accommodation and PR costs) was about £10,000. I was performing in venues that were so small that even if I had sold every single ticket I would still have lost money.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some performers are staying out of town in caravans or on campsites</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It would be disingenuous not to acknowledge my fortune. It would make me no better than the swines in our cultural and political life who are the children of wealth, but proudly proclaim that they “did it on their own, without any help”. It is our most pernicious myth, aside from the one that brussels sprouts taste nice if you fry them with bacon. Your dad bought you a flat and the thing that tastes good is bacon. Sprouts taste like small, hard farts.</p> <p>This is to say nothing of the woeful underrepresentation of female acts, ethnic minorities and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Organisations such as <a href=\"https://www.fringeofcolour.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Fringe of Colour</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bestinclass.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Best in Class</a> work hard to address this, but wholesale change is needed. No one seems to be able to put the finger on who is to blame. Landlords, venues, PRs, Edinburgh university and the Fringe Society blame each other, but in the end the bill is footed by performers.</p> <p>It is no wonder that younger comedians are increasingly seeing the benefits of social media exposure to their careers; the startup costs required are minuscule in comparison to those of doing a show on the fringe. But allowing the fringe to slip slowly into obsolescence would be a shame. At its core, it offers performers a boot camp to hone their skills and a collision of different styles of performance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/11/edinburgh-festival-fringe-refuseniks-comedians-standups-debt-squalid-flats\">‘Someone’s making money but it’s not us’ – the comics spurning the Edinburgh fringe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Being a performer at the fringe can feel like being a character on a film set in Las Vegas, because the house always wins. And I mean one of the bleak Vegas films, not Ocean’s Eleven – there is no sign of Clooney or Pitt. The only time it resembles Ocean’s Eleven is when you hear some drama student attempt a truly disgraceful cockney accent that would make even Don Cheadle say: “Bleeding heck, guvnah.”</p> <p>I still believe in the fringe. Perhaps that is inevitable, given my whole life is tied to it, like a pointless Forrest Gump. My birthday is in August, so I can measure my life through the festivals I have attended. My first years I was there, I spent almost every waking moment with Tom and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/15/ed-gamble-i-was-a-little-human-dustbin-great-british-menu-off-menu-podcastjudge\" title=\"\">Ed Gamble</a>. In the past three years, I have been best man at their weddings. In 2010, I met a woman who was funny and charming, but whom I presumed disliked me intently. In October, we will have been in a relationship for 10 years. I cannot separate my own life from the fringe and the city of Edinburgh. It has given so much to me, professionally and personally.</p> <p>But even I understand that it stands at a crossroads. It must find a way to recapture its egalitarian spirit to remain relevant. It is not enough for charitable organisations to fill in the gaps; systemic change is needed. I say this not out of malice, but simply because I strongly believe, to quote my own mother: “If you love something, you must be willing to relentlessly point out everything that is wrong with it,” a phrase she often says to and about me.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/nish-kumar-your-power-your-control\" title=\"\">Nish Kumar: Your Power, Your Control</a> is at Assembly George Square</em><em>, 22-28 August</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/16/former-australian-prime-minister-scott-morrison-pm-secretly-gave-himself-five-ministerial-roles","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T04:34:43Z","webTitle":"Outrage as Australians discover former prime minister secretly gave himself five additional ministries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/former-australian-prime-minister-scott-morrison-pm-secretly-gave-himself-five-ministerial-roles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/former-australian-prime-minister-scott-morrison-pm-secretly-gave-himself-five-ministerial-roles","fields":{"headline":"Outrage as Australians discover former prime minister secretly gave himself five additional ministries","trailText":"Incumbent prime minister says he ‘cannot conceive of the mindset’ that enabled Scott Morrison to appoint himself to additional positions while PM","byline":"Amy Remeikis in Canberra","body":"<p>Scott Morrison secretly appointed himself to five additional ministries while Australia’s prime minister, in what his successor has labelled an “unprecedented trashing of the Westminster system”.</p> \n<p>The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/scott-morrison-five-more-secret-ministries-minister-portfolio-ministry-including-treasury-home-affairs\">said on Tuesday he was waiting on legal advice over any possible ramifications of the secret appointments</a> and was “open to reforms and suggestions” so the situation did not reoccur.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/defiant-scott-morrison-resists-pressure-to-resign-defends-secret-portfolios-as-necessary\">Defiant Scott Morrison resists pressure to resign, defends secret portfolios as ‘necessary’ </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Morrison now faces calls to resign from parliament over the revelations, including from one of his former ministers.

At worst, it can mean staff <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2019/04/12/amazon-staff-are-listening-to-alexa-conversations-heres-what-to-do/?sh=25a390ae71a2\">listening to conversations</a> recorded by your smart speakers or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/13/amazon-ring-doorbell-videos-police-11-times-without-permission\">sharing your doorbell camera videos with the police</a>. And as with anything internet-connected, there is also a risk of hackers gaining access to your private information.</p> <p>But despite the risks, smart home technology is booming. Even if you’re not inclined to purchase an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/07/21/how-a-fish-tank-helped-hack-a-casino/\">internet-connected fish tank</a> or a toilet that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/sep/23/the-smart-toilet-era-is-here-are-you-ready-to-share-your-analprint-with-big-tech\">tracks and analyses your stool samples</a>, odds are you’ve got at least one smart device at home. It could be the TV you stream Netflix on, your baby monitor or the air conditioner you control with an app.</p> <p>So is it possible to have a smart home and <em>not</em> be spied on? Well, sort of.</p> <h2>The big decisions</h2> <p>From a data privacy perspective, the smartest home is a dumb home.</p> <p>“That’s the real answer: don’t do it,” Vaile says. Failing that, he recommends paring back your system as much as possible.</p> <p>“Just ask all the time: why do I need this?” he says. “Because every one of the fancy new tricks will come with both a privacy and a data security cost.” The simpler the system, “the better off you’ll be”.</p> <p>Simplifying means disabling certain features on existing devices and being judicious about what you buy.</p> <p>Andre Lackmann, an IT professional from Sydney, has many smart devices at home – but not security cameras. This limits his privacy and security risk to a level he is comfortable with.</p> <p>To do this yourself, he suggests imagining the consequences of a data breach. “If they get some information about when my lights went on and off, or what temperature it is in the living room, that’s not a big deal,” Lackmann says. “But if they can get a video feed of the bedroom, that’s a bit of a problem, right?”</p> <p>It’s also a matter of determining what data you’re willing to trade in return for greater convenience. For instance, Lackmann has Phillips Hue smart lights – but has disabled the feature that allows him to control them remotely. That function requires an internet connection, and switching the lights off when he’s out feels like a small reward for letting a company into his home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As soon as you connect the internet, from a data privacy point of view, you are in the hands of the manufacturers</p> <footer> <cite>Matt Furnell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lackmann does, however, allow his air conditioner remote access, because for him, being able to set the temperature before he comes home is useful enough to make his data sacrifice worthwhile.</p> <p>When you’re at the decision-making stage, you might also like to consult the <a href=\"https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/\">Mozilla “privacy not included”</a> guide before you buy, to get an idea of just how creepy different products are.</p> <p>You will also need to balance your risk of being hacked with data privacy concerns. If there <em>is</em> a security risk, bigger companies such as Google and Amazon will roll out updates that fix the problem quickly. A security camera fished from the bargain bin may not, Lackmann says.</p> <p>“[With] smaller, no-name brands, it’s not that the devices are bad, per se. It is generally that they don’t get a lot of after-sale support,” he says. “[Smaller brands] are much less likely to get any security updates.” To that end, it is also important to regularly install the updates for your products once they’re in your home.</p> <h2>The set-up</h2> <p>For Matt Furnell and Justin Kern from JFK Automation, a company that installs smart home systems, the key to data privacy is avoiding cloud-based services and internet-connected devices as much as possible.</p> <p>“As soon as you connect the internet, from a data privacy point of view, you are in the hands of the manufacturers,” says Furnell. “So you should give them the least amount possible to work with.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4412765d92e319bfd0cea4349d0e2dfd4f4b4fe3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4412765d92e319bfd0cea4349d0e2dfd4f4b4fe3/0_0_8600_5733/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Curious Young Girl Using Smart Speaker While Having Breakfast With Her Family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you <em>are</em> trying to stay off the cloud, you’ll need to skip the assistant function on speakers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oscar Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In many products, the pair say, cloud connectivity is unavoidable, but others will allow for workarounds – for instance, sending security camera footage to a hard drive in your house.</p> <p>If you <em>are</em> trying to stay off the cloud, you’ll need to skip the assistant function on speakers. Whether you’re asking Alexa, Siri or Google, Kern and Furnell say that every voice command product currently available in Australia connects to the cloud.</p> <p>For customers who are particularly privacy-conscious, JFK Automation doesn’t connect the system to the internet at all. That means customers sacrifice the ability to control their devices remotely and instead operate everything using an offline app.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/18/amazon-ring-largest-civilian-surveillance-network-us\">Amazon’s Ring is the largest civilian surveillance network the US has ever seen | Lauren Bridges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Putting your smart home devices on a separate internet network to your computers and phones can help with security, but not data privacy.</p> <p>This is what Lackmann does. “I have one network that has all of the home automation gear on it and another network that has all of my personal information – our laptops, computer storage, files and stuff like that,” he says. That way if his smart devices are compromised, “they’re segregated from the more important information”.</p> <h2>Simpler fixes</h2> <p>Already got smart devices at home? You can still minimise what companies collect and what hackers can get.</p> <p>To understand just how many of your home gadgets rely on the internet, Furnell and Kern recommend switching off your router to see what stops working. From there, you might decide to kick devices off your wifi if you don’t feel they need to be online.</p> <p>You can also turn off any voice-assistant functionalities and cover up cameras you don’t need – for instance, sticking paper over your baby monitors when they’re not in use.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a0a5454204f10e6b971176ee87a87c8e9708f51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a0a5454204f10e6b971176ee87a87c8e9708f51/103_0_4783_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman hands blocks a webcam and microphone above her of computer by an adhesive red tape for security.

However, Furnell says, they’ll still be storing your data – which you should be able to log on and delete.</p> <p>Once every three months or so, Furnell will log into his devices to see what they have collected and what they are doing with the data, then he deletes the stored data.</p> <p>However, Vaile cautions that playing around with your privacy preferences gives a “misleading feeling of … control”.</p> <p>“The metadata analysis – the data collection that’s unaffected by preferences – is probably much more important to them, and much more significant to you.”</p> <p>Ultimately, if you want a smart home, you will have to accept that convenience comes with a privacy trade-off.</p> <p>“You can’t have your cake and eat it too,” says Kern. “If you want to have all these functions and features … you have to be connected to the internet, and there is a risk of someone having your data.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2022/aug/16/my-vulnerable-patients-cannot-pay-large-gap-fees-australias-health-system-is-failing-them","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T03:08:28Z","webTitle":"My vulnerable patients cannot pay large gap fees.

That’s no longer true | Jennifer Doggett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I should have known that this was coming. We are in the middle of a healthcare crisis, exacerbated by local Covid-19 epidemics. I knew that my local outpatient departments had long waiting lists and increasingly prohibitive referral criteria. I knew that my patients kept waiting for non-emergency operations. And I knew that my own GP clinic was getting more and more desperate calls from vulnerable community members, asking if we could please, please make an exception to our closed books.</p> <p>General practice is the heart of primary care and it is the foundation for any strong health system. In its humble, quiet way, it can save money and save lives. But the truth is that many Australians now can’t afford quality GP care, due to decades of severe government underfunding. So they’re going to an ED, later and sicker than when they would have seen their GP. It’s cheaper for the patient but delayed care is much more costly for Australian taxpayers. It leads to overburdened EDs, expensive hospital stays, worse health outcomes and increased deaths. Our EDs are overflowing, and this is in part because general practice is overflowing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to remodel the system so health workers aren’t financially punished if they work with those who need it most</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They say every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets. In Australia almost all GP clinics are private businesses, dependent on the Medicare rebate system to support patients to access these services. The Medicare benefit scheme system has been undervaluing the importance of primary care for years. The MBS for general practice encourages throughput and shorter consultations. It disincentivises longer consultations, complex care, conversations and communication.</p> <p>Nine years ago a Labor government introduced the Medicare rebate freeze, a “temporary” measure, as part of a $664m budget savings plan. This has been continued by shortsighted successive Coalition governments and now we see GP practices scrambling to add gap fees to cover increasing costs, or reduce consultation times. Twenty years ago around 40% of medical graduates became GPs. Now, only 15% choose the specialty. GPs carry an immense burden of responsibility for the health outcomes of their patients. Why would a young doctor decide to become an undervalued, harried GP?</p> <p>There’s a trope circulating about greedy GPs. But at Utopia Refugee Health, everyone has taken a pay cut to work here. Everyone is here because we care about the people we serve. And yet we are feeling the pinch more than anyone else. We have constant discussions among the staff: how do we recruit GPs to do this interesting, transformative community work? There are no GPs around. There is no extra funding from any government to support us. How long can we afford to stay open? Our patients, who are some of the poorest in Melbourne’s west, cannot afford large gap fees. They have complex bio-psycho-social needs and they need time and quality GP care more than most. But the system does not support this. There is no funding for our patients beyond Medicare, and it is failing them, and so many more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/treated-as-a-third-class-citizen-patients-who-need-medicare-most-struggle-to-find-a-gp-who-bulk-bills\">‘Treated as a third-class citizen’: patients who need Medicare most struggle to find a GP who bulk bills</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Altruism isn’t a sustainable way to run a health system. And relying on the free market doesn’t always work. Especially not for healthcare. Medicare should fund longer consults, not reduce your rebate if you need more time with your doctor. We should empower, not deter, doctors to spend time with people who need extra care: those with complex health needs, mental illness, with low literacy or language barriers, with social stressors and chronic illness. Medical schools must prioritise diversity and support those from poorer backgrounds. Training and recruitment schemes should attract the brightest GPs and health workers to build skills and work in poorer and disadvantaged communities. Clinicians in community health should have the option of equivalent salaries to their colleagues in hospital systems. We need better services for those who are struggling, left with low-quality care in our “universal” health insurance model. We need to remodel the system so health workers aren’t financially punished if they work with those who need it most. Patients deserve better rebates and quality care. We need to unfreeze primary care so it is not stuck in a bygone era.</p> <p>To alleviate stress on the whole system, we must redesign and boost investment in general practice. Primary, preventive care should be valued by policymakers as the foundational skeleton of the health system, giving patients continuity of care and saving the healthcare dollar long term. A system that cares well for a vulnerable person with a broken hip is a system that will look after you and your family when you need it most.</p> <p>• Dr Mariam Tokhi is a GP, writer and educator in Naarm.

He was not prepared for his boss’s reaction:<br><br>“Oh, wow, OK … I completely understand. How can we help you with that?”<br><br>His boss suggested a role within the company that Gibson hadn’t been aware of.

He’s seeing “hundreds of thousands of jobs” available, yet “there aren’t hundreds of thousands more people in the workforce”. So in a twist, he’s seeing employers taking the risks. Instead of demanding a candidate with 10 years’ experience doing this exact job, they are simply saying: “I need someone who can do this job.” <br><br>So if you’ve been feeling insecure about applying for the job you want, it may be time for a rethink. “Ask yourself: ‘What do I really want to do?’”, Gibson says. And apply, even if you “only tick 30% of the criteria”.<br><br>Gibson believes change can be positive at any stage in your working life. <br><br>“People don’t have to just take risks because they’re completely unhappy,” he says.</p> <p>“You can just want something more.”</p> <p><em><strong>With vacancies high – and competition low – <a href=\"https://www.seek.com.au/career-advice/?tracking=CPP-TGAIART-TheGuardianGreatJobBoom-30297&amp;utm_campaign=TheGuardianGreatJobBoom&amp;utm_source=TheGuardian&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_content=TheGuardianPartnerCampaignBoiler\" rel=\"nofollow\">now may be a better time than ever to take that leap and apply for a new role on Seek.</a></strong></em></p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/15/rudy-giuliani-target-criminal-investigation-georgia-election","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T00:02:25Z","webTitle":"Rudy Giuliani informed he is target of criminal investigation in Georgia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/15/rudy-giuliani-target-criminal-investigation-georgia-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/15/rudy-giuliani-target-criminal-investigation-georgia-election","fields":{"headline":"Rudy Giuliani informed he is target of criminal investigation in Georgia","trailText":"The former New York mayor has been identified as a key figure in Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election","byline":"Hugo Lowell in New York","body":"<p>Donald Trump’s former attorney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rudygiuliani\">Rudy Giuliani</a> is a target of the criminal investigation in Georgia that has been examining efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in that state by the former president and his allies, a source briefed on the matter confirmed on Monday.</p> <p>The move to designate Giuliani, 78, as a target – as opposed to a subject – raises the legal stakes for the ex-New York mayor, identified as a key figure in the attempt to reverse the former president’s electoral defeat to Joe Biden in the state.</p> <p>It also raises the legal pressure on Trump, who is himself facing increased legal exposure amid a justice department investigation over his unlawful retention of government documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort, along with a state investigation in New York over his business practices.</p> <p>The notice that Giuliani was now a target of the Georgia investigation came on Monday from the office of Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis, the source said.

arguing against unsealing the affidavit, the justice department also said that the disclosure could harm its ability to gain cooperation from witnesses not only in the Mar-a-Lago investigation but also additional ones that would appear to touch on the former president.</p> <p>“Disclosure of the government’s affidavit at this stage would also likely chill future cooperation by witnesses whose assistance may be sought as this investigation progresses, as well as in other high-profile investigations,” prosecutors added.</p> <p>The existence of potential witnesses who could yet cooperate in a number of investigations against Trump – seemingly people with intimate knowledge of the former president’s activities – rattled close advisers once more on Monday, further deepening distrust inside his inner political circle.</p> <p>Trump counter-attacked on his social media app, Truth Social. “There is no way to justify the unannounced RAID of Mar-a-Lago,” Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/108830529259405266\">said in a post</a>. “I call for the immediate release of the completely Unredacted Affidavit pertaining to this horrible and shocking BREAK-IN.”</p> <p>The lack of insight into what the justice department intends to do with the investigation into Trump’s unauthorized retention of government documents has deeply frustrated the Trump legal team and aides alike in a week of perilous moments for the former president.</p> <p>At least one lawyer on the Trump legal team – led by former assistant US attorney Evan Corcoran, who also acted as the lawyer for Trump’s top former strategist Steve Bannon – has called up a reporter covering the story for any insight into how the justice department might next proceed.</p> <p>It added to the already fraught atmosphere inside the reduced group of advisers who have day-to-day roles around Trump that erupted shortly after the FBI departed Mar-a-Lago and sparked suspicions that a person close to the former president had become an informant for the FBI.</p> <p>That speculation came in part amid widening knowledge about how the FBI might have established probable cause that there was a crime being committed at Mar-a-Lago using new or recent information – to prevent the probable cause from going “stale” – through a confidential informant.</p> <p>According to multiple sources close to Trump, suspicions initially centered on Nicholas Luna, the longtime Trump body-man who stepped back from his duties around March, and Molly Michael, the former Trump White House Oval Office operations chief, who remains on payroll but is due to soon depart.</p> <p>Luna was subpoenaed by the congressional investigation into the January 6 Capitol attack but has not spoken to the FBI about this case, one of the sources said. And although Michael is slated to also leave Trump’s orbit, the source said, her departure – like Luna’s – is not acrimonious.</p> <p>The focus in the middle of the week shifted to Mar-a-Lago employees and other staff at the members-only resort in Palm Beach, Florida, the sources said, seemingly in part because the FBI knew exactly which rooms and where in the rooms they needed to search.</p> <p>But towards the weekend, and following the revelation that the FBI removed a leather-bound box from the property and already knew the location of Trump’s safe, scrutiny shifted once more to anyone else who had not yet been suspected – including members of Trump’s family, the sources said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the former president did not respond to a request for comment. Calls to Trump lawyers went unanswered or straight to voicemail. The justice department declined to comment on the investigation or Monday’s request.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the escalating distrust and rampant speculation about an informant has started to reach dizzying levels, even by the standards of the Trump presidency, which was characterized in many ways by competing interests and political backstabbing, the sources said.</p> <p>The legal pressures for Trump also intensified elsewhere Monday, after his former attorney Rudy Giuliani was told he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/15/rudy-giuliani-target-criminal-investigation-georgia-election\">now a target of the criminal investigation</a> in Georgia that has been examining Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in that state.</p> <p>It remains unclear whether the FBI relied on confidential informants, and the Guardian first reported that the search came in part because the justice department grew concerned that classified materials remained at Mar-a-Lago as a result of interactions with Trump’s lawyers.</p> <p>At least one Trump lawyer signed a document – apparently falsely – attesting to the justice department that there were no more classified materials left at Mar-a-Lago after federal officials in June removed 10 boxes worth of government records, the sources said, confirming a New York Times report.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/16/interest-free-loans-uk-food-microloans-cost-living-iceland","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T23:01:41Z","webTitle":"Interest-free loans to be rolled out in UK to help with food bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/16/interest-free-loans-uk-food-microloans-cost-living-iceland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/16/interest-free-loans-uk-food-microloans-cost-living-iceland","fields":{"headline":"Interest-free loans to be rolled out in UK to help with food bills","trailText":"Supermarket Iceland is part of scheme to offer sums of £25 to £100 to buy everyday items","byline":"Rupert Jones","body":"<p>A zero-interest loans scheme aimed at helping thousands of people who are struggling to put food on the table is being rolled out across the UK.</p> <p>The initiative, the result of a link-up between the supermarket chain Iceland and a charity-owned lender, is the latest interest-free loans scheme to launch in response to growing concern about households who find themselves at the sharp end of the cost of living crisis and are unable to access or afford existing forms of credit.</p> <p>The scheme is designed to enable them to cover school holiday grocery bills or smooth out gaps in their income by providing interest-free “microloans” of between £25 and £100 to buy everyday items.</p> <p>Iceland has partnered with Fair for You on the initiative, which is being extended across the UK from 16 August after a pilot phase during which loans were provided to more than 5,000 customers.</p> <p>The microloans are made available on preloaded cards, with repayments set at £10 a week.

They played for five bruising sets over four-and-a-half hours and although Wawrinka advanced, nobody really won. Murray left the match with serious hip injury, then two days later Wawrinka departed with a career-altering knee injury. After numerous surgeries and one metal hip, neither has fully recovered their levels.</p> <p>On Monday afternoon, they began their 22nd meeting in far more understated circumstances, a first-round match in the secluded suburbs of Cincinnati. In the arduous, jittery match that followed, as both men battled their bodies as well as each other, Murray overcame a bout of cramping and a break in the third set as he drew upon his typical grit to emerge as the victor, 7-6(3), 5-7, 7-5.</p> <p>“When you’re cramping, you need to try to relax because you don’t want to be playing long points,” Murray said. “Whenever I had the chance, I tried to play aggressive, get him defending a little bit. Because on this court, with the speed of the court, how lively it is, I was having to do lots of running when I wasn’t doing too much with the ball so going for my shots worked for me.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/15/frustration-in-cincinnati-as-serena-williams-and-emma-raducanu-match-is-postponed\">Frustration in Cincinnati as Williams and Raducanu match is postponed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It marked an essential win after what has been a difficult period for Murray. His grass-court season had started with an extremely promising run to the final of Stuttgart. After the abdominal injury he suffered in the tight final with Matteo Berrettini then the second round loss at Wimbledon to a red-lining John Isner, he immediately travelled to the United States in search of wins and points to build his ranking.</p> <p>They did not follow. Murray reached one quarter-final in Newport, then he lost his opening match of his following two events, suffering from cramp in a miserable experience against the world No 115 Mikael Ymer. Last week in Montreal, he meekly lost 6-1, 6-3 to No 13 Taylor Fritz, looking slow and listless throughout.</p> <p>Early on here, Murray served well and he successfully tested Wawrinka’s shot tolerance with his defence but his positive contributions were mixed with tentative forehands and too many unforced errors. Against an opponent who has won only three matches in his nine events since returning from foot surgery, Murray was far more solid when it counted in the opening set tiebreak.</p> <p>But from the second set, he struggled as Wawrinka found a cleaner stretch of ball striking, spraying loose errors as he was unable to move Wawrinka around the court despite the Swiss’s diminished movement. After conceding his serve and the second set, Murray began to cramp in his left leg and he attempted an underarm serve. As he surrendered his service game he fell behind 2-0.</p> <p>Even as he despaired, Murray fought, as he always does, his physical issues prompting him to attack freely, continually forcing Wawrinka on the back foot. The physio continually entered the court, but Murray recovered the break deficit and broke again at 5-5 in the third set before serving out to win.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b67c1c84e8a26aeb6139feb85bfc48d68ac4f6f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b67c1c84e8a26aeb6139feb85bfc48d68ac4f6f9/0_294_5742_3445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cameron Norrie (left) came through a tough match against Holger Rune of Denmark\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cameron Norrie (left) came through a tough match against Holger Rune of Denmark </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frey/TPN/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reward is a second-round match that will push him even further to his limits.

DAs generally have a limited impact on root causes of crime and are instead responsible for choosing which cases to file and what charges to prosecute. An <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-04-01/violent-crime-surge-la-county-george-gascon\">LA Times analysis</a> found that during his first year in office, Gascón filed felony cases at a nearly identical rate to his predecessor.</p> <p>The vast majority of prosecutors in the office also voted in February to support the recall, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/22/los-angeles-prosecutors-progressive-da-gascon-00010798\">according to the union</a> representing the deputy DAs, which has strongly opposed Gascón.</p> <p>The recall campaign had said it was “non-partisan”. But two conservative mega-donors accounted for nearly a quarter of the recall campaign’s publicly disclosed funding, according to an <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-24/los-angeles-district-attorney-george-gascon-recall-effort-san-francisco\">LA Times report in June</a>, which also noted that the recall spokesperson formerly worked for the Trump campaign and Larry Elder, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/14/larry-elder-california-recall-election-trump\">rightwing radio host</a> who ran against California’s democratic governor last year.</p> <p>Anne Irwin, executive director of Smart Justice California, a group that advocates for reform, also praised the news of the failed recall in a statement on Monday, saying, “Fueled by Republican mega-donors, police unions, and others ideologically opposed to reform, the campaign followed a familiar pattern of using misinformation, fear-mongering, and the politicization of tragedies to scapegoat district attorney George Gascón ... Angelenos saw through these disingenuous tactics for a second time.”</p> <p>Jody David Armour, a University of Southern California law professor, said the failed recall was a “victory for democracy” and sent a signal that law enforcement groups will face an uphill battle if they continue to try to oust reform-minded officials. It also offered a counter to pundits who have argued that voters no longer support progressive candidates, he said : “This establishes that there’s no buyer’s remorse from voters who supported criminal justice reform. If anything, the Chesa Boudin recall is more the aberration than the pattern.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/porn-king-the-rise-and-fall-of-ron-jeremy-review-a-terrifying-tale-of-accusations-in-the-sex-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T22:05:39Z","webTitle":"Porn King: The Rise and Fall of Ron Jeremy review – a terrifying tale of rape accusations in the sex industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/porn-king-the-rise-and-fall-of-ron-jeremy-review-a-terrifying-tale-of-accusations-in-the-sex-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/porn-king-the-rise-and-fall-of-ron-jeremy-review-a-terrifying-tale-of-accusations-in-the-sex-industry","fields":{"headline":"Porn King: The Rise and Fall of Ron Jeremy review – a terrifying tale of rape accusations in the sex industry","trailText":"As the adult film star awaits trial on 34 charges, this programme lays bare the prejudice women face when dealing with sexual assault while working in porn","byline":"Lucy Mangan","body":"<p>For all the second-wave feminism I read at university, nothing brought the systemic disadvantage to women and the embedded power structures of the patriarchy home to me like my first sight of Ron Jeremy.</p> <p>This would have been in the late 80s, the beginning of the porn star’s heyday, and he already looked revolting. That was kind of the point of him, I understood. He was there so that every man, no matter how unprepossessing, could inch his erection a little closer to the dream of being able to shag all the desirable women that came into his orbit. He was there to assure them all that there was no standard too low.</p> <p>The two-part Channel 4 documentary Porn King: The Rise and Fall of Ron Jeremy gives a voice to some of the women who have been the subject of his attentions, on and off set, including some of those whom – according to their vivid testimony – he raped. Jeremy is in jail awaiting, if found medically competent by experts, trial on 34 charges. They include 12 of rape, including of a 15-year-old girl in 2004, forcible oral sex, penetration with a foreign object and sodomy, the last allegedly taking place in 2020. Jeremy denies the charges. </p> <p>The documentary follows the distressing, depressing pattern that has become familiar to us through the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/06/surviving-r-kelly-review-disturbing-but-deeply-flawed\">Surviving R Kelly</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/06/jimmy-savile-a-british-horror-story-review-a-welter-of-devastating-detail\">Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story</a>, innumerable programmes about Jeffrey Epstein and most of Netflix’s true-crime output. A predatory man uses his charm/wealth/power/a combination thereof to abuse the women around him, either ignored or enabled by those in his employ, or otherwise benefiting from his position. He goes unchallenged for decades while the women look for the safety to speak up, and then must fight to be heard and taken seriously. The problems women face in such situations are, of course, multiplied immeasurably when they are women in the porn industry. The idea that if somebody consents to sex once, she has effectively consented to it for ever and with anyone dies particularly hard when the woman has sex for a living. It doesn’t hold up under the slightest scrutiny, but even the slightest scrutiny of endemic prejudice is always in short supply.</p> <p>The former adult film star Ginger Lynn says Jeremy raped her in 1983, after she and her then boyfriend refused to let him join in a sex scene they had been filming earlier that day. The next day, on her 21st birthday, he was used as a last-minute substitute for another sex scene with her, although he had always been on her “‘No’ list”. “I didn’t want to fuck Ron – he was old, hairy, smelly,” she remembers. “And he thought he was funny.”</p> <p>Bristol-born and bred Lianne Young moved to the US in her early 20s at the turn of the millennium to work in the porn industry. “I knew I would never do a scene with Ron Jeremy,” she says. “The man is grotesque.” She describes chatting to people at an industry party when he came up behind her, pushed her over a table and shoved his penis inside her. It all took about four or five seconds. He has lived, she says, rent-free in her head ever since. The silence of the onlookers remains deafening.</p> <p>There are accounts of other assaults too. The podcaster Siouxsie Q describes a particularly violent one from which she escaped with bloodied underwear after he suggested they go somewhere quieter for an interview she had asked for.</p> <p>His defenders, including unsettlingly vulpine “porn pastor” Craig Gross, adduce mitigating evidence. There are “blurred lines” in an industry where touching and being touched by the fans you meet is expected. There are the years of adulation clouding Jeremy’s judgment. Or they simply insist that the “goofball” they know just isn’t capable of any untoward behaviour.</p> <p>Several of them query why Lynn worked with Jeremy on more than one occasion after the alleged rape. She “did a dumb thing” when “trying to get closure”, she says – an impulse that anyone who has tried desperately to normalise a terrible thing will recognise.</p> <p>The documentary gives fair time and weight to each side and leaves it up to the viewer to decide which they find the more convincing. The women who are part of the case against him oscillate between rage and weariness. Rage of a different sort bubbles away underneath most of the interviews with the others – occasionally, as with the pastor when he snarls “Let me fucking finish talking” at the interviewer, breaking the surface.</p> <p>Depressing and distressing, yes. But terrifying, too. And on we go.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/red-rose-review-a-sinister-app-wreaks-havoc-on-the-lives-of-teenagers","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T21:50:39Z","webTitle":"Red Rose review – this lively teen horror series is a creepier Black Mirror","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/red-rose-review-a-sinister-app-wreaks-havoc-on-the-lives-of-teenagers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/15/red-rose-review-a-sinister-app-wreaks-havoc-on-the-lives-of-teenagers","fields":{"headline":"Red Rose review – this lively teen horror series is a creepier Black Mirror","trailText":"Terrifying smartphone apps! Blackmailed teens! French exams! This entertainingly disturbing BBC drama about Bolton school leavers could well have a second series in it","byline":"Stuart Jeffries","body":"<p>School’s out and French is over! The annual British festival of unlearning any foreign languages you picked up in class can begin. “J’ai voudrais un vodka,” says one monoglot schoolgirl as she prepares for a summer of getting off her nut with her mates in Bolton. Think it through, young lady. You don’t use an auxiliary verb when conjugating in the conditional. Somebody is going to be in for a disappointment when GCSE results come out later this month.</p> <p>As is our heroine, Rochelle. “That last question?” she tells Wren of the exam paper. “I copied down all the French from the back of that,” she says, waving her mineral-water bottle. How disappointing for an examiner who had been looking forward to a run-through of the plot of Camus’ L’Étranger only to be confronted with the ingredients for Volvic.</p> <p>But Rochelle has got bigger problems than her looming French fail. Her phone is haunted. Sadly, this isn’t part of the 100Gbps data bundle from Giffgaff, but something – where is caps lock? – MORE SINISTER. An app called Red Rose is corrupting Bolton school leavers’ phones, as if it were bent on turning their lives into a task-fixated video game. Which, if you read the latest philosophy of virtuality, is pretty much where we are heading.</p> <p>This is the premise for the entertaining and disturbing Red Rose (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0cpqlr7\">BBC Three</a>). No matter that it is very similar to the premise of Black Mirror’s 2016 episode Shut up and Dance, in which a teenage boy downloads what he thinks is an anti-malware program called Shrive that films him masturbating to pornography and then threatens to make the footage go viral unless he performs increasingly horrible tasks, up to and including murder.</p> <p>Something similar happens to Rochelle. An invitation to download the app pops up on her screen and, like a mug, she presses download. Red Rose is soon issuing imperious demands. Unless she kisses Noah at a house party, footage of her queueing for cereal at a food bank will appear on TV screens around the house.</p> <p>Rochelle doesn’t want to kiss Noah, because her mate Wren, Noah’s girlfriend, will go postal. Nonetheless, she does – and she does. (It doesn’t seem to occur to Rochelle, Wren or the scriptwriter that anyone who would tease a mate for using a food bank is no mate at all, but still.)</p> <p>There is another problem: the party soundtrack. Who rewound us back to the 90s? Faithless’s Insomnia? Rhythm Is a Dancer by Snap!? Aqua’s Barbie Girl? If this is what the kids are getting down to this summer, they have bigger problems than bad grades.</p> <p>But what makes Red Rose more insidious than anything that spooled from Charlie Brooker’s laptop six years ago is that the app is Jekyll as much as Hyde. When Rochelle’s power cuts out and she hasn’t got any money for the meter, she suddenly finds it has been credited with £100. And when she worries she has nothing to wear for the party, she wakes up one morning to find a sparkly dress on the washing line. We don’t know what Red Rose is yet, but it is not impossible that it is the ghost of future Rishi Sunak, easing the cost of living crisis with random acts of ill-conceived taxpayer-funded largesse.</p> <p>But the Sunak hypothesis is far-fetched. After all, before the opening credits, we saw a girl the previous Christmas being tormented in a flat in Manchester. No matter how many times she shouts: “Alexa, turn everything off!” her phone, TV and air conditioning continue to go rogue. All her devices are controlled by some scarcely comprehensible malignant force that drives her to do something fatal. Such is Red Rose, which is more Liz Truss than Sunak in my book.</p> <p>Later, Wren and Rochelle’s friendship is put under further stress when Red Rose changes their innocuous texts into abusive ones. Rochelle picks up her phone and sees footage of her dead mother. “She misses you, too,” says Red Rose. But does she? The last message from Red Rose to Rochelle in this bravura opening episode is of two twins she should be babysitting when she is attending this grotesque party. On her phone, the two girls appear, plaintively wondering where she is. A figure looms behind them, saying: “Don’t worry, I’ll look after them.” The woman is Rochelle’s mother, looking like a zombie straight from The Walking Dead. Which betokens nothing good, clearly.</p> <p>The creators, Michael and Paul Clarkson, have previous with horror hokum (they produced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/09/the-haunting-of-bly-manor-review-mike-flanagan-tv-horror-drama\">The Haunting of Bly Manor</a>), but here they make something more engaging.

We will find out in the next few episodes. And, if it is a hit, there will be a Yorkshire-set sequel called White Rose; just see if there isn’t.

The 31-year-old had been so weary before this race that she had spent the day in a deep slumber. Yet fuelled by caffeine and a desire for her third medal in 12 days, she produced another performance of immense grit and steel.</p> <p>In blustery conditions, McColgan applied the template that had served her so well in Birmingham, pushing to the front early and applying a cobra-like squeeze for lap after painful lap. But this time the Kenyan-born Turkish athlete Yasemin Can proved to have a powerful antidote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/15/ricardo-dos-santos-iopc-review-case-athlete-stopped-by-armed-officers-met-london\">Ricardo dos Santos: IOPC to review case after armed Met police stop athlete</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With seven laps remaining Can made a decisive move, breaking away before coming home in 30min 32.57sec. But McColgan had enough in the tank to beat Israel’s Lonah Chemtai Salpeter to silver on the final lap in 30min 41.05sec.</p> <p>“I felt very tired all this week,” McColgan admitted afterwards. “I hadn’t slept for several nights after the 10,000m in Birmingham and then I had to do it again in the 5,000m. And then all the media the following day when you’re up at the crack of dawn and on your feet all day – I’m not used to that.</p> <p>“All I did today was sleep. My roommate just thought I was dead. And even though the housekeeper came in, I didn’t even hear it. I was just totally knocked out.”</p> <p>However McColgan still packed a punch when it mattered. After a sedate opening kilometre, she decided enough was enough and kicked on. Soon the field was strung out and screaming. With 18 of the 25 laps remaining, only four athletes were left in contention. And while gold ultimately proved beyond her, this was another impressive performance.</p> <p>“I didn’t want a last kilometre burn-up,” McColgan said. “But when the pace went up, I just didn’t quite have that zip. But it was probably to be expected. I’m not a superhuman and I have to respect that my legs were going to be tired.</p> <p>“And I knew it was going to be tough with Can. I knew she was the one to beat tonight and she just was super strong. I couldn’t stay with her.”</p> <p>Meanwhile the most powerful story of the evening came from British 400m runner Laviai Nielsen after she won her heat in a season’s best 51.60sec – and then revealed that, like her twin sister Lina, she has multiple sclerosis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f185c79431edb2cb2e657154e6d84392f3f067b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f185c79431edb2cb2e657154e6d84392f3f067b2/0_68_4616_2770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laviai Nielsen of Great Britain won her 400m heat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laviai Nielsen of Great Britain won her 400m heat</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I got diagnosed last year, two days before I flew to the Olympics, which was great for my mental health,” Laviai said. “I saw Lina when she got diagnosed when she was 17 and she went through a really dark period. No 17-year-old should have to face that. I saw her face depression.</p> <p>“I looked back at the nine years she had and thought: ‘I’m going to be OK.’ I’ve got the most perfect example right in front of me. I dealt with it in my own way, but ever since it’s been really positive and we’ve helped each other through it all.”</p> <p>Earlier there were extraordinary scenes in central Munich as Germany’s Richard Ringer produced a stunning sprint finish to win the men’s marathon.</p> <p>With 200m remaining, it looked like Israel’s Maru Teferi was a certainty for gold – with the BBC’s commentary team of Steve Cram and Paula Radcliffe announcing that the victory was “absolutely” his. However Ringer, a former European bronze medallist over 5,000m, used his track speed to take a stunning victory in 2:10.21 – two seconds clear of Teferi.</p> <p>On Tuesday Dina Asher-Smith returns after a hamstring injury to defend her European 100m title against her compatriot Daryll Neita and Swiss world indoor 60m champion Mujinga Kambundji. On the men’s side, the Olympic 100m champion Marcell Jacobs is favourite, with reigning champion Zharnel Hughes the main danger.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/15/wolves-agree-club-record-fee-of-38m-for-sporting-midfielder-matheus-nunes","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T21:12:10Z","webTitle":"Wolves agree club record fee of £38m for Sporting midfielder Matheus Nunes ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/15/wolves-agree-club-record-fee-of-38m-for-sporting-midfielder-matheus-nunes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/15/wolves-agree-club-record-fee-of-38m-for-sporting-midfielder-matheus-nunes","fields":{"headline":"Wolves agree club record fee of £38m for Sporting midfielder Matheus Nunes ","trailText":"Wolves are set to sign the Portugal midfielder Matheus Nunes after agreeing a deal worth €45m plus €5m in add ons with Sporting","byline":"David Hytner","body":"<p>Wolves are set to sign the Portugal midfielder Matheus Nunes after agreeing a deal worth €45m (£38m) plus €5m in add ons with Sporting for the 23-year-old.</p> <p>The deal, which represents the player’s buyout clause, would be a club record for Wolves, beating the £35m they paid for Fábio Silva last summer.

Crystal Palace, aiming to build on a fine first season under Patrick Vieira, have been given the toughest start of any team in the Premier League: an opening game against New Arsenal last week, then Liverpool tonight and Manchester City at the end of August. Sure they also have a winnable match at home to Villa on Saturday, but can we please not dwell on that. I’m trying to sell a narrative here!</p> <p>Point is, nobody gives Palace much chance tonight. If you’re into the whole betting thing, you can get 16/1 on a Palace victory and 6/1 on a draw. Since they had the effrontery to win three consecutive games at Anfield between 2015-17, Palace have lost ten in a row, home and away, against Liverpool.</p> <p>This fixture looked formidable even before Liverpool started the season with a sloppy, sluggish 2-2 draw at Fulham. A performance like that has consequences. The Liverpool players have had nine days of listening to the people who doubt their commitment to another season of heavy-metal football. The backlash begins at<strong> 8pm.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-15T18:01:12.708Z\">at 7.01pm BST</time></p>  </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/15/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T21:07:58Z","webTitle":"Darwin Núñez sees red before Luis Díaz gives Liverpool draw with Crystal Palace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/15/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/15/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Darwin Núñez sees red before Luis Díaz gives Liverpool draw with Crystal Palace","trailText":"A sensational solo goal from Luis Díaz helped Liverpool to secure a 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace after Wilfried Zaha’s first-half strike and Darwin Núñez’s red card","byline":"Andy Hunter at Anfield","body":"<p>Darwin Núñez sent a message on his full Premier League debut and it merely added to Liverpool’s problems in this fledgling campaign. The new £64m striker showed Anfield and rival defenders everywhere that he can rise easily to provocation by collecting a straight red card and a three-match ban for head-butting Crystal Palace defender Joachim Andersen. Núñez lost his head at precisely the moment Liverpool needed him to use it wisely.</p> \n<p>Only two games in but four points behind Manchester City already, Liverpool’s start to the season has brought Jürgen Klopp one headache after another. His team’s display against Palace was not high on the list. Liverpool largely dominated against Patrick Vieira’s team and stirred impressively following Núñez’s foolish loss of control, Luis Díaz equalising in spectacular style after Wilfried Zaha’s first-half opener. But with injury problems showing no sign of abating and given the punishing demands of a title challenge the loss of the Uruguay international was galling for Klopp. Núñez is the first Liverpool player to be sent off for violent conduct during his tenure. His manager needs him to learn from the mistake and learn fast.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/aug/15/liverpool-v-crystal-palace-premier-league-live-score-updates\">Liverpool v Crystal Palace: Premier League – live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Liverpool pushed for a winner that would have sparked delirium inside Anfield but Vieira’s determined team defended with clear heads and impressive spirit to end a run of 10 successive defeats against Klopp’s side. The visitors worked tirelessly off the ball and could have pinched all three points late on through Zaha or Andersen.</p> \n<p>There were more additions to Liverpool’s already extensive injury list ahead of their first home game of the season. Joël Matip joined fellow central defender Ibrahima Konaté on the sidelines with a muscle injury and, with Joe Gomez only fit enough for the bench after a recent problem, Nat Phillips was handed his first Premier League start since May 2021. It was Phillips’s first start alongside Virgil van Dijk and he marked his return by winning two towering headers inside the opening 14 seconds. Roberto Firmino was also absent.</p> \n<p>Liverpool’s opening-day performance at Fulham improved immeasurably following Núñez’s introduction and they started with an intensity and focus that was absent in the first half at Craven Cottage. The hosts should have led after a minute when Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita punched a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross out to James Milner while under pressure from Liverpool’s new centre-forward. Milner reacted sharply but skied a clear opening over Guaita’s goal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"543b6b2fcaf8c2ced1eaab8945cfd1ad021b078f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/543b6b2fcaf8c2ced1eaab8945cfd1ad021b078f/0_111_2605_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Díaz reacts after his sensational equaliser for Liverpool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Díaz reacts after his sensational equaliser for Liverpool.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Núñez also missed a decent opportunity after Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold stretched Palace with long, pinpoint passes. Andersen managed to block Harvey Elliott’s goalbound drive, presenting Alexander-Arnold with another chance to cross. He found Núñez unmarked at the back post but, perhaps surprised by Palace’s failure to head clear, the striker steered an awkward volley high and wide.</p> \n<p>Liverpool were understandably keen to utilise the height of their new forward addition and swept crosses in behind the Palace defender regularly, but there was variety to their early dominance. The connection between Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah ensured an exhausting night for Tyrick Mitchell at left wing-back while Núñez also displayed an immediate and encouraging rapport with the Egypt international. The Uruguayan’s movement off the ball impressed too. For 57 minutes anyway.</p> \n<p>Palace were not only besieged for the opening half hour, their struggle to retain possession or win any 50-50s drove Vieira to distraction. Klopp’s irritation looked trivial in comparison, the Liverpool manager turning towards the crowd and putting his finger to his lips after they had encouraged a hugely ambitious Van Dijk shot from 30 yards. All of which explained why the Palace breakthrough came as such a shock.</p> \n<p>The visitors had barely had a chance to counterattack through Zaha until Guaita scooped a clearance towards Eberechi Eze inside the Palace half. Eze controlled superbly, spun away from Fabinho’s hesitant challenge and released Zaha into acres of space behind Phillips. Palace’s lone striker waltzed through on goal and beat Alisson with a clinical, powerful finish into the far corner.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb1716cb655eb3f27ea22feaaceaba25c5484074\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb1716cb655eb3f27ea22feaaceaba25c5484074/0_0_3203_1922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wilfried Zaha fires the ball past Alisson Becker to put Crystal Palace ahead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilfried Zaha fires the ball past Alisson Becker to put Crystal Palace ahead.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Zaha was close to doubling Palace’s stunning advantage minutes later when Cheick Doucouré parted Liverpool’s central defence again. A heavy first touch undermined the goalscorer’s prospects of a repeat finish, however, and Alisson saved Zaha’s shot at close range. Vieira’s team had good fortune to thank for preserving their lead until the interval. The final act of the first half saw Elliott release Núñez inside the area with a delightful chip. As the striker shaped to shoot Doucouré dived in with a crucial touch, diverting the ball beyond his own keeper but against the far post.</p> \n<p>Liverpool’s problems increased when Núñez saw red for a head-butt on Andersen. Trouble had been brewing between the pair for some time and when the defender shoved Núñez in the back following an argument the striker stupidly took the bait.

Four minutes after the dismissal, and three days after Klopp had backed Díaz to come good in front of goal, the Colombia international responded with a superb goal that set up a frenetic finale.

Where that project was climate art as provocation, You’re Safe Til 2024: Deep History – one part of a six-year cycle of shows about the changing planet – is a more contemplative and equivocal investigation of what theatre can do in the face of environmental collapse.</p> <p>The show works with two contrasting timescales: the epic sweep of human history, and the intense period of a few days in December 2019 when swathes of Australia – where Finnigan was born and raised – were in flames. These are the two extremes of the Anthropocene that we struggle to wrap our heads around. Climate disasters can destroy homes and lives with terrifying speed. And yet the causes and impacts of global heating stretch far into the past and future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/15/the-book-of-life-review-theatre-edinburgh\">The Book of Life review – harmony and hope in a musical Rwandan journey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finnigan deftly demonstrates some of the ways in which art can help with this imaginative leap. As the son of a climate scientist, he’s aware of the limitations of simply communicating the facts. So, he takes one of his dad’s theories – that humanity can adapt through learning from key turning points in the species’ past – and animates it theatrically. Tens of thousands of years of human history are made legible through a single, recurring protagonist, while the expanding human population is vividly illustrated using grains of sugar piling up on a table. But the narrative Finnigan is trying to construct about humanity is ruptured by dispatches from Australia, where his best friend is fleeing wildfires. All of a sudden, art feels inadequate.</p> <p>There are no easy answers here, but that’s the point. What Finnigan captures powerfully is the panic of being gripped in a crisis, stressing that climate change is not a future threat – it’s with us now. There’s a grim sort of optimism to the stories of survival that Finnigan unearths from humanity’s past, tempered with an acute awareness of all that still stands to be lost. The climate crisis might not be <em>the</em> end of the world, but many worlds may end along the way.</p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/you-re-safe-til-2024-deep-history\">Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 29 August.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2022\">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/16/morning-mail-morrison-accused-of-bias-tasmanian-statue-to-fall-australian-homes-too-cold","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T20:59:40Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Morrison accused of bias, Tasmanian statue to fall, Australian homes too cold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/morning-mail-morrison-accused-of-bias-tasmanian-statue-to-fall-australian-homes-too-cold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/morning-mail-morrison-accused-of-bias-tasmanian-statue-to-fall-australian-homes-too-cold","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Morrison accused of bias, Tasmanian statue to fall, Australian homes too cold","trailText":"<strong>Tuesday:</strong> Scott Morrison’s use of extraordinary ministerial powers to block a controversial gas project faces a legal challenge.

In Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, at least 54 winners out of 87 contests — more than 62 percent of nominees — have embraced the former president’s false claims.</p> \n   <p>The count covers offices with direct supervision over election certification<strong>, </strong>such as secretaries of state<strong>, </strong>as well as the U.S. House and Senate, which have the power to finalize — or contest — the electoral college count every four years. Lieutenant governors and attorneys general are also included, with each playing a role in shaping election law, investigating alleged fraud or filing lawsuits to influence electoral outcomes.</p> \n   <p>Among the six battlegrounds, only Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania have nominated statewide candidates who would have direct power over the certification process and who worked to overturn the 2020 result or have said they would not have certified it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62fa5ddc8f08e57f94554b64\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-15T14:57:13.484Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Republican senator Lindsey Graham now says he will appeal the federal court order today upholding a subpoena for his appearance before a special grand jury in Georgia investigating attempts to meddle with the state’s election results, Politico reports: </strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1559189880218984448\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">JUST IN: Graham intends to appeal the ruling rejecting his bid to quash the FUlton County subpoena. <a href=\"https://t.co/GGMLGh1ilK\">https://t.co/GGMLGh1ilK</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XWxsPdTLBt\">pic.twitter.com/XWxsPdTLBt</a></p>— Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1559189880218984448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 15, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62fa5bcb8f08b32cd2006b9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-15T14:47:38.629Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Republican senator Lindsey Graham has failed in his latest attempt to get out of appearing before a special grand jury in Georgia looking into attempts to undermine the 2020 election results in the state, Politico reports:</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1559158937806671872\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: A federal judge has *denied* Lindsey Graham's attempt to quahs his Fulton County grand jury subpoena.<br><br>\"[T]he Court finds that the District Attorney has shown<br>extraordinary circumstances and a special need for Senator Graham’s testimony.\"<a href=\"https://t.co/9Red9FgbRh\">https://t.co/9Red9FgbRh</a></p>— Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1559158937806671872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 15, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1559163633657167872\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">GRAHAM has argued that the DA should pursue the evidence through other witnesses who were on the same calls before subpoenaing a sitting senator.

He was majestic in becoming the undisputed world cruiserweight champion before, in 2019, he moved up to heavyweight where most of boxing’s vast riches are on offer.</p> <p>He beat Joshua in only his third heavyweight contest but he has apparently since packed on 15 kilos of muscle in preparation for Joshua’s renewed threat.</p> <p>“In the first month of the war I lost 10 pounds,” Usyk says as he remembers how, like so many Ukrainians, he shed weight amid the stress and worry. “But when I started preparing for this fight I quickly gained the weight and my team put in all this incredible work to strengthen my body. I don’t want to say a lot about the weight but the main thing is I feel incredibly fit and strong. You can see it in the gym but I am really going to prove this in the ring.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7eeb1651640558320a3f308c486694f19d7ed860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eeb1651640558320a3f308c486694f19d7ed860/0_0_4800_3514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oleksander Usyk and Anthony Joshua pose together after their press conference at the Four Seasons Hotel, Park Lane, London in June of this year. to announce their August 20th Rematch in Saudi Arabia for the IBF, WBA, WBO & IBO World Heavyweight Titles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"732\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oleksander Usyk and Anthony Joshua pose together after their press conference at the Four Seasons Hotel, Park Lane, London in June of this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Robinson/Matchroom Boxing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His team have posted videos on social media of Usyk looking formidable as he rips into the heavy bag, and there are stories of how sparring partners have been forced to leave camp because of the punishment they have absorbed. I am more interested in whether, despite now resembling a fully fledged heavyweight, Usyk will retain his usual speed and dexterity. He grins. “That’s not going to be a problem at all.”</p> <p>Usyk told me a few months ago in London that Joshua did not hurt him in their first bout, even though he admitted it had been a hard fight. He was in the UK for a media conference to publicise the rematch but, after his promotional duties, Usyk sat down with a few of us. It was striking how open he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/30/boxing-oleksandr-usyk-anthony-joshua\" title=\"\">about the impact of the war</a> on him as he reflected on the month he spent as a Ukrainian soldier.</p> <p>“Every day I was there, I was praying and asking: ‘Please, God, don’t let anybody try to kill me. Please don’t let anybody shoot me. And please don’t make me shoot any other person.’”</p> <p>Even more movingly, Usyk said: “My children are asking: ‘Father, why do they want to kill us?’” The world heavyweight champion looked briefly helpless when, after a long pause, he said: “I don’t know what to tell them.”</p> <p>I return to that moment now and ask Usyk if, as the war grinds on with no end in sight, his three children still voice that very human question. “They do,” he says, “but I have the answer now. I explain to my kids that the Russians are trying to kill us because they are weak people. I also tell them this is the same reason why they are not going to win the war. We are stronger than them.”</p> <p>He is still their father and so they must feel some fear and concern as he faces Joshua again. Will they watch the fight? “I really trust my kids and it is up to them if they see the fight. And even if I tell them they can’t watch they will probably do it anyway. I don’t want them to have to lie and say they didn’t watch. I want to keep that trusting relationship and be honest with them. I trust them to know what is best for them and whether or not they watch me fight.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fb65e6201b8c09f488f4788c7d86c9d5a84b89c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb65e6201b8c09f488f4788c7d86c9d5a84b89c1/0_0_3500_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oleksandr Usyk in the first fight against Anthony Joshua at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in September last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oleksandr Usyk was imperious in the first fight against Anthony Joshua at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in September last year. <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Usyk has ensured that all <a href=\"https://talksport.com/sport/boxing/1163636/oleksandr-usyk-anthony-joshua-rematch-free-tv-channel-youtube-live-stream-where-to-watch/\" title=\"\">Ukrainians will be able to watch him</a> against Joshua. He was willing to cover any financial costs to remove the pay-per-view restrictions in Ukraine but an agreement was soon reached to make the fight available for free in his own country. “It’s great and it will show the connection between me and Ukraine. The fact that everyone at home can watch will inspire me.”</p> <p>It is easy to imagine that Volodymyr Zelenskiy will be among those millions of viewers, given that Usyk is one of the most famous and revered people in Ukraine. Has Usyk spoken recently to Zelenskiy? “Our president has a lot of work right now so he’s really busy with all the country’s issues. But I will speak to him later and it will be an honour.”</p> <p>Usyk has set up a foundation in response to the war and he talks passionately about his work with the UK-based sports NFT platform <a href=\"https://usyk.blockasset.co/\" title=\"\">Blockasset</a>. They have just launched an exclusive digital artwork collection of 2,000 items in a bid to raise $2m for the Usyk Foundation which will support humanitarian aid for Ukrainians in need of medical care, shelter and food. “It’s a great initiative,” Usyk says, “and the collection captures big moments in my career, like beating Anthony Joshua in London. They are totally unique assets to raise money for Ukraine.”</p> <p>Does Usyk worry that the world is beginning to forget about the war? “I think some people are not doing enough to help Ukraine. Lots of people are trying to hide and just wait until the war ends and hope that it will not touch them. But it’s not possible because it will touch everybody somehow. All of us should pay attention to what is happening and do something.”</p> <p>What has been the lowest moment for him since the war began? “The whole time has been really tough. I don’t want anyone to pity me but the toughest time was at the beginning of the war because I wasn’t with my family. Not being with my wife and children is the toughest for me. But I got through this because I prayed to God and I felt confident again.”</p> <p>His family home in Vorzel was broken into by Russian soldiers who used it as a base for a short time. Usyk stresses: “I have people rebuilding it, so everything is going to be OK.”</p> <p>Such strife makes routine boxing queries seem redundant even though another victory for Usyk would carry profound resonance for Ukraine. But will Joshua be desperate to win because a second successive defeat would be a shattering outcome for him? “I am just going to box like it’s a normal fight, so I don’t know about Joshua. But I won’t be just as good as any other time I have fought. I will be better.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fcbd1f6ac6707eda11747d46b93e509ab7a7ec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fcbd1f6ac6707eda11747d46b93e509ab7a7ec8/0_0_3256_2171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oleksandr Usyk celebrates with the flag of Ukraine after his unanimous decision victory over Anthony Joshua.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oleksandr Usyk flies the flag of Ukraine as he celebrates after his unanimous decision victory over Anthony Joshua.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first fight there were times when it looked as if Usyk had the ability even to stop Joshua. Could he actually win by knockout this weekend? “I am not going to make any predictions but right now I need my dinner. I am really hungry. My time is up.”</p> <p>He says this politely but with the kind of conviction he carries in the ring. Our video call is about to end before I have had time to ask Usyk about any misgivings he might harbour about fighting in Saudi Arabia – where the treatment of so many ordinary people is as cruel as it is deadly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/28/saudi-arabia-has-spent-at-least-15bn-on-sportswashing-report-reveals\" title=\"\">No amount of sportswashing</a> can obscure the executions and imprisonments that occur under a brutal regime. It is a question Usyk has not answered before but there is no shifting him now. The interview is over and he wants a break on the very last night of his training camp.</p> <p>It is hard to resent Usyk, an intelligent and friendly man who explained to us earlier this year how war had changed him. “Sometimes I just force myself to bring a smile,” he said in London. “Sometimes I just force myself to sing. I don’t even know how to explain it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/30/absolutely-wounded-tyson-fury-laments-anthony-joshuas-loss-to-usyk\">‘Absolutely wounded’: Tyson Fury laments Anthony Joshua’s loss to Usyk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The gravity of Russia’s invasion has marked him and it clouds the logic which suggests that Usyk should be too good yet again for Joshua.

Birdsall declined to elaborate on what Talib’s side of the story is.</p> <p>Local news reported Yaqub Talib and Aqib Talib, a five-time Pro Bowler who announced his retirement in 2020, are coaches for North Dallas United Bobcats, a youth football team. Aqib Talib was named last month as a contributor for Prime Video’s Thursday Night Football.</p> <p>Hickmon was a loving husband and father who was dedicated to serving the young athletes he worked with, local news reports say. “We have two lovely children who don’t have their father in their life now. We have a wife that is heartbroken and a family that is going through, and it’s very difficult, and we all need to be praying for them,” Keith Hall, pastor of the church of which Hickmon was a member, <a href=\"https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/lancaster-coach-killed-during-shooting-at-sporting-event/3047970/\">told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth</a>.</p> <p>His killing not only leaves a hole in the family it also has traumatized the children who bore witness to the gunfire. “Half of them couldn’t sleep.

Kaiser has rejected union proposals seeking to expand the workforce and “improving access to care”, according the union, while the company argues the central issues relate to wage increases and time spent on administrative tasks.</p> <p>Despite reporting record profits last year, Kaiser has just one mental health clinician for every 2,600 patients, the union said. Patients who should receive therapy weekly instead are waiting up to eight weeks, according to the union, and overwhelming caseloads are pushing therapists to leave the company entirely.</p> <p>“Patients are getting ripped off while Kaiser’s coffers are bulging,” Sal Rosselli, the president of the National Union of Healthcare Workers, said in a <a href=\"https://nuhw.org/more-than-2000-kaiser-permanente-mental-health-clinicians-to-start-open-ended-strike-august-15/\">statement</a>. “We don’t take striking lightly but it’s time to take a stand and make Kaiser spend some of its billions on mental health care.”</p> <p>The need for mental health services surged during the pandemic as anxiety and depression rose in the US and across the world. In the first year of the pandemic, anxiety and depression increased by 25% globally, according to the World Health Organization. The US surgeon general has warned America’s youth are facing a mental health pandemic.</p> <p>But Kaiser patients aren’t getting the care they need, the union says, accusing the healthcare giant of violating clinical guidelines around treatment and state laws. California previously <a href=\"https://sfgate.com/health/article/Kaiser-fined-4-million-over-mental-health-access-4622014.php\">fined Kaiser $4m</a> for problems with its mental health services, including extended wait times. The state is investigating Kaiser’s behavioral health services after receiving complaints from patients and providers.</p> <p>“We’re serving a strike notice because our patients aren’t receiving needed services,” Shay Loftus, a Kaiser psychologist participating in the strike, said in a statement. “We’re not willing to be part of a system that disrespects the work we do and prevents us from providing ethical care.”</p> <p>Kaiser argues it’s facing the same shortage of workers as other US care providers because there aren’t enough mental healthcare professionals to meet the rising demand and that the union is “exploiting current challenges as a bargaining tactic”. The company has hired nearly 200 clinicians since 2021 and used virtual care to improve access, according to Kaiser.</p> <p>“Despite all that we are doing, we, like others, are challenged to meet the demand and know more must be done. We are focused on continuing to find new ways to meet our members’ and patients’ mental health needs,” Deb Catsavas, the senior vice-president of human resources at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, said in a <a href=\"https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/who-we-are/labor-relations/committed-to-reaching-a-fair-and-equitable-agreement\">statement</a>.</p> <p>“This strike is an unnecessary tactic to increase the union’s leverage at the bargaining table, making it harder, not easier, to deliver mental health care,” Catsavas said.</p> <p>Patients will continue to receive care from workers who opt not to strike, Catsavas said, adding that “nonurgent” appointments may be rescheduled.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/15/frustration-in-cincinnati-as-serena-williams-and-emma-raducanu-match-is-postponed","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T19:03:43Z","webTitle":"Frustration in Cincinnati as Serena Williams v Raducanu is pushed back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/15/frustration-in-cincinnati-as-serena-williams-and-emma-raducanu-match-is-postponed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/15/frustration-in-cincinnati-as-serena-williams-and-emma-raducanu-match-is-postponed","fields":{"headline":"Frustration in Cincinnati as Serena Williams v Raducanu is pushed back","trailText":"Fans at the Western &amp; Southern Open were upset after a late decision to reschedule the first-round match between Emma Raducanu and Serena Williams, who will soon retire from the sport","byline":"Tumaini Carayol in Cincinnati","body":"<p>The highly anticipated first-round clash between Serena Williams and Emma Raducanu at the Western &amp; Southern Open in Cincinnati was abruptly postponed from Monday to Tuesday, frustrating fans who had spent considerable money and travelled to the event to watch the match.</p> \n<p>Cincinnati is likely to be the penultimate tournament of Williams’s career after she announced last week that her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/09/serena-williams-retirement-tennis-us-open\" title=\"\">retirement is imminent</a>.

My hope is that this will bring renewed impetus for just transitions towards vibrant, more resilient low-carbon economies and societies.”</p> <p>Matthew Samuda, a minister in the Jamaican government, said: “He’s an excellent choice, very qualified, and very committed to the climate change agenda. Most importantly, he understands the challenges of developing nations. Jamaica and no doubt the entire Caribbean looks forward to working with him.”</p> <p>In the Paris agreement, countries agreed to ensure that temperatures would not rise above 2C and to “pursue efforts” to stay within 1.5C. But island nations led in forcing a refocus on 1.5C instead of 2C, because of their vulnerability. Stiell’s appointment has been seen as bolstering such efforts.</p> <p><a

has shown that 2C is much more dangerous, and recent extreme weather around the world, which has heated by about 1.1C to 1.2C above pre-industrial levels, has confirmed fears that even 1.5C will cause severe

action","byline":"Rowena Mason Deputy political editor","body":"<p>Ministers are planning to reduce redundancy pay for civil servants while cutting 91,000 Whitehall jobs, setting up a bitter confrontation that unions warned may lead to legal and industrial action.</p> <p>The proposals could result in average packages being cut by a quarter at a time when the minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency, Jacob Rees-Mogg, is aiming to shrink the civil service by a fifth.</p> <p>The plans are set out in a consultation document that highlights how changes to redundancy payments would “create significant savings on the current cost of exits”.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office insisted the proposed redundancy pay cuts would have happened regardless of the planned “headcount reductions”, which could result in the civil service being scaled back to the size it was in 2016.</p> <p>However, the consultation comes after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95fbb2f3-51c6-449d-b79f-60b2ad170ee9\">reports</a> that the Treasury was concerned about the upfront cost of 91,000-strong reduction in civil servants after a review found it could cost at least £1bn and lead to loss of public services.</p> <p>Trade unions said relations between the government and civil service were already at “rock bottom”, with Whitehall suffering low morale and a brain drain as a result of the cuts.</p> <p>The proposed changes also come on top of existing <a

also been infuriated by the refusal of ministers to meet to discuss the 91,000 headcount reduction, with one senior source saying this lack of engagement was “unparalleled in my experience”.</p> <p>Civil servants were infuriated on Friday when the campaign of Tory leadership frontrunner Liz Truss suggested Whitehall had a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/12/liz-truss-protect-british-jews-antisemitism-woke-culture\">“woke” culture “that strays into antisemitism”</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element

accused of offensive remarks about Jewish people and civil service</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A previous effort by the government to cut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/18/civil-service-redundancy-payment-cuts-unlawful-public-sector-workers\">civil service redundancy pay ended up being blocked in the courts in 2017</a> on the grounds that ministers had failed to consult sufficiently with trade unions.</p> <p>Unions said they were shocked by the decision to go ahead with the consultation on reducing redundancy pay at the same time as proposing job cuts, and that it was unclear whether the plans to shrink the civil service to 2016 levels would be done on current or revised terms.</p> <p>Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect trade union, said: “Against the backdrop of the announcement to reduce civil service headcount by one in five, and the repeated refusal of ministers to meet with Prospect and other unions on the issue, we have no confidence that this ‘consultation’ is being carried out in good faith.</p> <p>“No other employer, public or private, would propose reducing redundancy terms at the same time as savage job loss proposals and do so with the aim of reaching agreement. We will be working with other unions to oppose detrimental changes to the civil service compensation scheme and exploring every route – including industrial and legal ones.”</p> <p>The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, representing about 180,000 public sector workers, is also balloting members in the UK civil service and related areas for industrial action <a href=\"https://www.pcs.org.uk/news-events/news/pcs-national-strike-ballot-date-confirmed\">from 26 September until 7 November</a> over pay, pensions, jobs and the redundancy terms.</p> <p>The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “Coming on top of a derisory 2% pay offer and the threat of 91,000 job cuts, these proposed cuts to our members’ redundancy terms add insult to injury. It’s clear the government wants to get job cuts done on the cheap.</p> <p>“PCS will fight these proposals as we did in 2017, when we successfully persuaded the high court to overturn the government’s previous attempts to rip up our members’ redundancy rights.”</p> <p>The current redundancy terms were negotiated in 2010 under former Tory minister Francis Maude. The proposal is for departing staff to get three weeks of pay for every year of service, down from the current month of pay. There would be a cap of 18 months of salary for voluntary redundancy and nine months for compulsory, down from the current 21 months and 12 months.</p> <p>There would also be a minimum salary of £26,000 when calculating the redundancy payouts and an upper limit of £149,829.</p> <p>This would mean someone paid £26,000 with 10 years of service could currently expect to get a payout of £20,000, but under the proposals would get £15,000.</p> <p>The consultation document warns that disabled employees could be disproportionately affected. It highlights the requirement for “efficiency departures” involving staff with underlying health conditions. The document said: “It is recognised that disabled staff may be disproportionately impacted by the proposals and so there is a risk of indirect discrimination. Less favourable treatment on grounds of age and disability is lawful if it is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate social policy aim.”</p> <p>In response to union criticism, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “In the context of high national debt and increasing cost pressures, it’s vital that all areas of government spending, including the civil service compensation scheme, are affordable as well as fair to both staff and the taxpayer.</p> <p>“Reforming the scheme is a longstanding policy and not connected to headcount reductions. We will continue our close engagement with unions on these proposals.”</p> <p>It would be a choice for the next prime minister, Truss or Rishi Sunak, whether to go ahead with the proposals. Truss, who is supported by Rees-Mogg, is backing plans to cut civil service costs and has pledged to wage “a war on Whitehall waste”.</p> <p>Sunak set out his own plans for reforming Whitehall on Monday, saying he would ensure senior civil servants had to spend at least a year of their career outside Whitehall or in industry and would no longer receive pay rewards based on the longevity of their service, but rather performance.</p> <p>He also said he wanted to “tackle civil service groupthink” and shake up the “bloated post-Covid state”.</p> <p>Both candidates will be in Scotland on Tuesday for a hustings. Ahead of that, Truss set out plans to bring in parliamentary privilege for the Scottish parliament and push for a trade deal with India benefiting Scotch whisky exports, while Sunak set out plans to require UK ministers to be more visible in Scotland and hold the Scottish government better to account.</p> <p>Truss’s campaign received a further boost on Monday, when a former cabinet minister became the third MP to publicly announce they were moving from Sunak’s camp to her own.</p> <p>Alun Cairns, who served as Welsh secretary, said Truss was full of “positive ambition” and was more likely to preserve the union.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/william-ruto-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election-amid-dispute","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T18:31:30Z","webTitle":"William Ruto declared winner of Kenya presidential election amid dispute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/william-ruto-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election-amid-dispute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/william-ruto-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election-amid-dispute","fields":{"headline":"William Ruto declared winner of Kenya presidential election amid dispute","trailText":"Electoral commission chair declares deputy president winner of tight race as other senior officials disown results","byline":"Caroline Kimeu in Nairobi","body":"<p>William Ruto has been declared the winner of Kenya’s presidential election, amid last-minute chaos as four senior election officials denounced the week-long count and disowned the result.</p> \n<p>Official results showed that Ruto, the current deputy president, won 50.5% of the vote, beating the longtime opposition leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/13/kenya-presidential-election-raila-odinga-slightly-ahead-in-early-results\">Raila Odinga</a> and narrowly avoiding a run-off.</p> \n<p>But chaos erupted minutes before the results were announced, with four out of seven electoral commissioners saying they disowned the outcome, which they termed “opaque”.</p> \n<p>“We are not able to take ownership of the results that will be announced,” said the deputy chair of the electoral commission, Juliana Cherera.</p> \n<p>The sudden declaration prompted fears that vote-rigging allegations could lead to a legal challenge or even deadly violence like the country witnessed after 2007 and 2017 presidential polls. Cherera tried to allay concerns by advising those involved to take their complaints to court.</p> \n<p>The 55-year-old president-elect later issued a conciliatory message, vowing to work with “all leaders”. “There is no room for vengeance,” said Ruto. “I am acutely aware that our country is at a stage where we need all hands on deck.”</p> \n<p>As news of the results filtered through to Odinga’s stronghold of Kisumu, there were some outbreaks of violence. In one area, protesters congregated on a roundabout, throwing stones, setting tyres on fire and throwing up roadblocks with broken rocks.</p> \n<p>“It was not free and fair. We were cheated,” Collins Odoyo, 26, an Odinga supporter, told AFP.</p> \n<p>Some international analysts suggested that the commissioner’s move might be politically motivated because the four commissioners criticising the vote count as opaque were appointed by the outgoing president Uhuru Kenyatta late last year. “Their intervention smacks of political interference from the Raila Odinga camp,” said Benjamin Hunter, an Africa analyst with Maplecroft, a UK-based consultancy.</p> \n<p>Kenyatta had backed Odinga after falling out with Ruto. Odinga and Kenyatta come from two of Kenya’s wealthiest and influential families.</p> \n<p>Kenyatta’s endorsement was expected to draw in support for Odinga from the Kikuyu community, which held a critical number of votes in the election. But Odinga’s community, the Luo, have been at political odds with the Kikuyu for decades, and a reconciliation between the two after a long rivalry was ultimately not enough to bridge the divide.</p> \n<p>In the Kikuyu heartlands, Ruto swept the vote with his appeal to Kenyans on economic terms and not only traditional ethnic ones. “Ruto’s populist tenor convinced Kikuyu voters angry at the flatlining economy and Kenyatta’s alliance with Odinga to side with him,” Hunter said.</p> \n<p>Despite the chaos surrounding the announcement, celebrations briefly broke out in parts of the country, including Kayole, a residential neighbourhood in Nairobi where Ruto and Odinga both have some support.</p> \n<p>Ruto’s supporters were eager to see the self-proclaimed “hustler” rise to the country’s highest office from his humble beginnings selling chickens by the roadside.</p> \n<p>“He started from the very bottom and has kept rising up, so it makes us hopeful that he will empower Kenyans at the bottom, because he knows what it’s like to face problems,” said Miriam Wangeci Karuga, 36, an informal worker in Nairobi.</p> \n<p>Shadrach Ouma, 33, a doctor and Odinga supporter from Embakasi North, said before the announcement that he would be ready to accept any outcome if won fairly. “The country belongs to all of us, so we’ll just continue to coexist peacefully with our neighbours and focus on building the country.”</p> \n<p>The election was largely peaceful, but analysts said the election officials’s move to disown the results may throw the country into an old pattern. Kenya’s last three elections have been contested, with a 2017 poll rerun, and a dispute in 2007 leading to deadly post-election violence.</p> \n<p>Hunter said: “The sentiment that Raila has been cheated yet again will intensify anger in his Nyanza stronghold and spark protests in the coming days.”</p> \n<p>The last-minute divide among the electoral officials was unexpected. Trust in the electoral commission had received a significant boost in this election after it made all voter forms publicly available, opening them up to independent counts by the media and the public.</p> \n<p>On the back of Monday’s events, Odinga may contest the results in court, in what is likely the opposition figure’s last bid for the presidency.</p> \n<p>“Kenya faces up to three treacherous weeks of uncertainty if Odinga files a petition with the supreme court, as he did in 2013 and 2017,” Hunter said. “Odinga has a week to file a challenge to the result and the court has two weeks to decide, casting an already delayed outcome into further suspense.”</p> \n<p>If the electoral commission’s announcement holds, Ruto will take over the reins of the country at an economically turbulent time. Kenya’s inequality has been laid bare by a cost of living crisis that has been fuelled by the Covid pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine. Rising prices of basic commodities have left many Kenyan households struggling and placed the country’s staple food <em>ugali</em> (thick maize flour porridge) out of reach for many of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/12/on-the-street-and-online-social-media-becomes-key-to-protest-in-kenya\">the country’s poor</a>.</p> \n<p>“The incoming president is in an unenviable position,” said XN Iraki, a Kenyan economist. Pointing to some of Ruto’s campaign promises, such as a pledge to set up a fund for small businesses, he said: “It is not clear where that money will come from.”</p> \n<p>Kenya is saddled with public debt of more than 8.5tn shillings (£55bn) and is due to spend more on debt repayments than on recurring expenditure this year.</p> \n<p>“People have been waiting for the results so that they can get back to work. Kenyans have come to realise that whichever way it goes, they are still on their own,” Iraki said.</p> \n<p>• This article was amended on 16 August 2022 to remove part of a quote that incorrectly said the four commissioners criticising the vote count as opaque were appointed by the outgoing president Uhuru Kenyatta in 2018.

Here is everything you might have missed:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukrainian forces reported heavy Russian shelling and attempts to advance on several towns in the eastern region of Donetsk that has become a key focus of the near six-month war, but said they had repelled many of the attacks.</strong> Ukraine’s military command said on Sunday that Russian soldiers had continued unsuccessfully to attack Ukrainian positions near Avdiivka, which, since 2014, has become one of the outposts of Ukrainian forces near Donetsk.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia is probably in the advanced planning stages to hold a referendum for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) to join Russia, according to British intelligence.</strong> On 11 August, Russian media reported that the Moscow-installed administrative head, Denis Pushilin, said that the date of a referendum on the DPR joining Russia would be announced after the DPR’s “complete liberation”. However, it is unclear if the final decision to go ahead with a vote has yet been taken, the UK’s Ministry of Defence reports.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Mykolaiv came under sustained overnight fire from Russian forces, a Ukrainian official has said.</strong> Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, posted on his Telegram account that an educational facility and hotel had been struck on the outskirts of the city. He added there were no casualties.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The defence team of US basketball star </strong><strong>Brittney Griner</strong><strong> has appealed against her conviction for drugs possession and trafficking, Griner’s lawyer Maria Blagovolina told Reuters on Monday.</strong> Griner, who had played for a Russian club, was arrested at a Moscow airport on 17 February after cannabis-infused vape cartridges were found in her luggage. She pleaded guilty to the charges but said she had made an “honest mistake” by entering Russia with cannabis oil, which is illegal in the country. She was convicted on 4 August and jailed for nine years.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> and North Korea will expand bilateral relations</strong>, Pyongyang’s state media reported on Monday. Putin told North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that the two countries would “expand the comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations with common efforts”, Pyongyang’s state media reported on Monday. In a letter to Kim for North Korea’s liberation day, Putin said that closer ties would be in both countries’ interests, and would help strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the north-eastern Asian region, North Korea’s KCNA news agency said.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The first UN ship to carry Ukrainian grain for Africa is ready to depart</strong> with 23,000 tonnes of wheat. The MV Brave Commander will head to Africa and “Ethiopia will be the last country where the 23,000-tonne cargo of wheat will be delivered”, said Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov. It will be the first shipment of food aid since Kyiv and Moscow agreed a deal brokered by the UN and Turkey in July to unblock Black Sea grain deliveries.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>The first ship to depart Ukraine when grain exports resumed was approaching the Syrian port of Tartus on Sunday</strong>. The ship left Ukraine two weeks ago but cargo on the Razoni was refused by its original Lebanese buyer, two shipping sources told Reuters.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his forces will target Russian soldiers who shoot at or from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant</strong>. “Every Russian soldier who either shoots at the plant, or shoots using the plant as cover, must understand that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/14/ukraine-says-it-will-target-russian-soldiers-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant\">becomes a special target </a>for our intelligence agents, for our special services, for our army,” he said.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>A total of 42 countries have called on Russia to immediately withdraw military forces from the plant</strong>, including the US, Japan and the UK, plus the EU. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned of a possible nuclear disaster unless fighting stops.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy has warned those with Russian citizenship against being complicit</strong> and silent in supporting Putin’s war on Ukraine. “People’s silence approaches the level of complicity. And the rejection of the real fight against evil becomes the assistance to it. Therefore, if you have Russian citizenship and you are silent, it means that you are not fighting, it means that you are supporting it,” he said in his latest national address.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s forces continued to strike at strategic bridges supplying Russian troops holding the city of Kherson</strong>, the only major site held by the invaders on the west bank of the Dnieper, including the Antonovsky road bridge and<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>crossing at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant upstream. Ukraine said Russian troops who crossed the Dnieper River during their offensive in the southern region were facing growing difficulties after bridges were damaged.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia says it has taken control of Udy, a village in the eastern Kharkiv region</strong>, according to its latest military briefing. The village has been under heavy shelling by Russian forces.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia’s priority over the past week has likely been to reorient units to strengthen its campaign in southern Ukraine,</strong> British military intelligence said on Sunday. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russia also appeared to be intensifying attacks on the eastern Donbas front, in what is likely to be an attempt to ensure Ukraine is not able to concentrate forces in the south against Kherson.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Countries throughout <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> have called for the EU to limit or block short-term Schengen visas for Russian citizens</strong>. Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and the Czech Republic all urged new restrictions.

Looney appeared unaware that he, like everybody else in the UK, would get the discount automatically from October. It was only later that BP offered the PR-friendly answer that its £4.4m-a-year boss would make a donation to charity.</p> <p>Looney’s bafflement was understandable. High earners like him (and, indeed, high earners collecting considerably less) obviously don’t need assistance from the state in paying their energy bills this winter. There was no sound economic reason for Sunak to add a universally applied £400 element to a package that was otherwise rightly concentrated on vulnerable households, meaning those most affected by higher bills.</p> <p>That point, bizarrely, seems to have been lost on Sir Keir Starmer. The Labour leader has opted to back the most untargeted form of support this winter – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/14/labour-announces-plan-to-freeze-energy-price-cap-with-reinforced-windfall-tax\">a plan to freeze the price of energy for all consumers</a>, rich and poor alike, at its current level for six months.</p> <p>The idea is popular, we’re told, because three out of four Tory voters support it. In that sense, it may represent smart politics; the next prime minister will be under pressure to adopt chunks of the proposal, including the increase in the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. But the economics of freezing energy prices for all households, as opposed to only those least able to afford higher prices, makes little sense.</p> <p>Starmer’s scheme has the virtue of simplicity, it could be argued – and, yes, the plan is costed if one accepts the £7bn fiddle with the effect of temporarily reduced inflation-related payments on government debt. But a programme that costs £30bn for six months becomes vastly expensive if it has to be repeated for as long as wholesale prices remain high – a timeframe that is currently unknowable. If the Looney household and others didn’t need Sunak’s £400 discount, they definitely don’t require the average £1,000 saving that Labour’s proposal would deliver.</p> <p>More to the point, artificially holding down prices for everybody undermines the incentive on wealthier households to reduce their energy consumption, an imperative that ought to be front and centre of any national plan to get through the emergency. Starmer is also talking the language of more insulation in homes, but artificially underpricing a scarce resource does nothing to encourage consumers to turn down their boiler settings in the short term, use their spin dryers less, and so on. “Suppressing the price signal is only going to increase the likelihood that we run out of energy this winter,” says one independent energy analyst, Peter Atherton. Exactly right.</p> <p>One can argue all day about how to define a high-earning household that doesn’t need support from the public purse, but a means-tested approach of some form still seems the best way to proceed. It would be fairer, more financially sustainable in the long term and more likely to change behaviour. Labour’s plan has got off on the wrong foot; support should be targeted.</p> <h2>Heathrow seems to have redefined success</h2> <p>The way the Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, tells it, imposing a cap on the number of flights at the airport has been a complete triumph. Limiting the number of departing passengers to 100,000 a day since July has delivered fewer last-minute flight cancellations, better take-off punctuality and shorter waits for bags, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/11/heathrow-passenger-cap-is-working-airport-boss-says\">the airport was boasting only last week</a>.</p> <p>So, having bought time to regroup and focus, is Heathrow now in a position to resume a normal schedule in time for the next surge in demand that will arrive with the October half-term holiday? Actually, no. The airport is extending the cap until 29 October for the same reason: that it needs to support “more reliable and resilient passenger journeys”.</p> <p>An extension is probably sensible if Heathrow – or the ground-handling firms it usually blames during episodes of chaos – still haven’t got the necessary resources in place. But let’s not miss the wider picture. Being bounced into capping the number of passengers was a spectacular failure of management that flowed from the under-estimation of the speed of the recovery in demand. Taking even longer to fix the problem is not a success.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/16/nurse-practitioners-the-cure-for-spiralling-healthcare-costs-says-peak-body","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T17:30:35Z","webTitle":"Nurses are the solution to bulk-billing crisis, says peak body","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/nurse-practitioners-the-cure-for-spiralling-healthcare-costs-says-peak-body","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/nurse-practitioners-the-cure-for-spiralling-healthcare-costs-says-peak-body","fields":{"headline":"Nurses are the solution to bulk-billing crisis, says peak body","trailText":"They are a ‘threat to the back pocket of GPs’ – and that’s why nurses have been sidelined from the affordable healthcare debate, practitioners say","byline":"Melissa Davey","body":"<p>Doctors are “gatekeeping” conversations surrounding affordable access to healthcare, leaving nurses and their highly specialised skills undervalued and underutilised, peak nursing bodies say.</p> <p>The cost of access to basic healthcare is a pressing problem for many Australians, with an increasing number of general practitioners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/11/gps-ditching-bulk-billing-as-costs-rise-and-medicare-rebates-lag-survey-shows\">limiting access to bulk billing or scrapping it altogether</a>.</p> <p>The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australian Medical Association say extended freezes to the Medicare rebate, and a below-inflation 1.6% increase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/08/medicare-shake-up-how-will-the-changes-to-rebates-affect-doctors-and-patients-out-of-pocket-fees\">for most GP services from 1 July </a> means it is unfeasible for GPs to continue to bulk bill.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/bulk-billing-why-is-my-doctor-no-longer-bulk-billed-gp-near-me-medical-centre-is-medicare-in-crisis\">Why is my doctor no longer bulk billing and is Medicare in crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Doctors want the federal government to significantly increase the rebate, and to do more to attract medical graduates to general practice.</p> <p>But the president of the Australian College of Nursing Practitioners, Leanne Bose, said not enough was being done by government to increase the role of nurses in providing affordable primary healthcare.</p> <p>In New Zealand nurse practitioners, like general practitioners, can assess and treat patients, and provide prescriptions.

But salaries vary depending on location, demographics of the area, the size of the clinic, whether the GP owns the clinic, hours worked, the types of services and number of services per hour offered, and other factors including the proportion of patients who are bulk billed.”</p> <p>O’Donnell said bulk billing “can make you a very nice wage”. </p> <p>“Powerful medical lobby groups have a stranglehold on healthcare funding and are holding the Australian public, and their health, to ransom.”</p> <p>But the RACGP president, Adj Prof Karen Price, said many practices were struggling bulk-billing patients “and they have no choice but to shift to mixed or private billing”. The cost of equipment, facilities and Covid-19 measures added to financial stress, she said.</p> <p>“I don’t see any benefit in buying into a divisive and unhelpful doctors-v-nurses narrative,” Price said. “We are all healthcare workers interested in the same thing – ensuring our patients can get the best possible care when they need it.”</p> <p>The federal secretary of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, Annie Butler, said GP rebates had not kept pace with inflation and “probably” needed to increase.</p> <p>“But we also need to reform how we fund other activities and health services, and start to incentivise excellent chronic-disease management including that coming from nurses,” she said. “But GPs are the gatekeepers at every single point. We need to shift that.”</p> <p>Mary Chiarella, professor emerita with the University of Sydney’s Susan Wakil school of nursing and midwifery, said rather than paying GPs high salaries to attract them to rural and remote areas, registered nurses in those areas could be upskilled to become nurse practitioners.</p> <p>But she said those nurses had to be provided with appropriate access to Medicare Benefits Schedule provider numbers and other forms of funding.

But with specialists overwhelmed, where should they turn?","byline":"Nicholas Hudson","body":"<p>It seems like almost everyone has a friend who has recently been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). As a GP working in suburban Melbourne, what had been an occasional topic patients broached is now a conversation I’m having multiple times a week.</p> <p>So what has changed, and what does it mean for our health and health system?</p> <p>ADHD is a developmental condition, present from childhood, broadly involving issues with inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. There is an increasingly recognised subtype characterised by inattention without the other features. The stereotypical presentation is a child who is restless and a bit chaotic in their behaviour and struggling to meet their potential at school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/07/the-drugs-dont-work-and-other-mental-health-myths\">The drugs don’t work (and other mental health myths)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where I’m seeing growth is not so much among children, but rather among adults. The accepted wisdom is that highly functional adults can compensate for their ADHD until something upsets the apple cart. This might be running up against a task that surpasses their organisational strategies; a move from high school to the more self-directed learning of tertiary study; a shift away from the support structures of living with family; or a loss of the environmental cues and structures that had borne them along.</p> <p>The last three years have seen the classroom, workplace and home amalgamated into one porridgy, ill-defined singularity, with added mental, financial and social stress. It’s no wonder people started looking inwards when they didn’t immediately “bounce back” with the end of lockdowns.</p> <p>There can also be a snowball effect of symptom recognition. With swathes of algorithmic social media where people relate their experiences, or by talking to friends and hearing their stories, <a href=\"http://adhd-alien.com/2019/07/16/bingo/\">it’s easy to see why people might identify with</a> signs such as reading sentences off a page without absorbing any of it, forgetting a pin number that’s been used for a decade or feeling overwhelmed by the noise, sights and smells returning to the grocery store, school or office. </p> <p>As with most mental health conditions, the defining factor for diagnosis is the degree of dysfunction the person faces. Is their education faltering? Is it impacting their work? Are their relationships suffering?</p> <p>Don’t get me wrong: most of the people who come in wanting to explore an ADHD diagnosis meet the criteria and then some. But where does that leave them? And where does it leave a mental health system where wait times to see a psychiatrist were already teetering on untenable, before living through a global pandemic made us all feel that bit more vulnerable?</p> <p>The conventional wisdom is that the mainstay of management of ADHD is behavioural and psychological strategies, but when patients come in interested in a diagnosis, they’ve often pursued these avenues and are looking at medication options – and that’s where we hit a snag.</p> <p>Legislative requirements vary between state and territories, but from a Victorian context, medication requires a diagnosis by a psychiatrist (retrospective to before 18 years of age, if scripts are to be subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme), and either initiation of medication by the psychiatrist or deputisation of a GP through a written plan, that the GP can then use as supporting evidence to apply for a permit to prescribe. These permits can be held for up to two years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Australia weekend\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&link=true&link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>In the halcyon days, I could provide a referral to a psychiatrist with confidence that it was someone whose opinion I valued and trusted, who I had corresponded with professionally and received that most invaluable of endorsements: positive patient feedback.</p> <p>Now, if my patients have any hope of being seen, I’ve increasingly needed to refer to someone I haven’t worked with before. The path of least resistance for patients is to pursue a diagnostic review through a Medicare item 291, whereby the psychiatrist provides their diagnosis and a plan of action to allow the GP to treat. To meet this demand, a number of telehealth services have sprung up. </p> <p>The “going rate” for most of these single-appointment assessments appears to be an out-of-pocket cost of $200-400 – already placing it out of the reach of many patients. Depending on the service, costs can be in excess of $1,100. Some such assessments have provided me not with a clear insight into the patient’s situation and the medication options best suited to them, but rather a list of the medications that are used for ADHD, with a seemingly somewhat cynical view to ticking the box for prescribing requirements.</p> <p>I’m not confident this always leaves me or my patients any better off. </p> <p>So what advice can I offer? Firstly, caveat emptor – do your research, and ask your GP or psychologist which services they have confidence in. Second, the feeling of urgency for action in the “I think I might have ADHD” presentation can lead to hasty decisions. I encourage you to consider laying your foundation through work with a psychologist, and consider waiting to see a specialist we can vouch for.</p> <p>• Dr Nicholas Hudson is a general practitioner working in South Melbourne</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/16/its-absolutely-disgusting-watching-george-millers-rarely-seen-first-film","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T17:30:35Z","webTitle":"‘It’s absolutely disgusting’: watching George Miller’s rarely seen first film","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/16/its-absolutely-disgusting-watching-george-millers-rarely-seen-first-film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/16/its-absolutely-disgusting-watching-george-millers-rarely-seen-first-film","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s absolutely disgusting’: watching George Miller’s rarely seen first film","trailText":"In Violence in the Cinema, Part 1, an academic delivers a speech on brutality in film while he suffers – and commits – various violent acts","byline":"Luke Buckmaster","body":"<p>A terrible sense of amorality clings like a rash to Mad Max, which is the core reason it’s still shocking to watch today.

Like most shorts from that era, it looks homemade and scratchy, though its rudimentary production values can’t disguise a hint of Miller’s bravado.

His speech continues for a while, before, four and a half minutes in, apropos of nothing, a man wielding a large gun bursts through the door and shoots the academic in the face. Half of his head is now horrible, bloody goop, not unlike the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB82rvwACJk\">final image of Gus Fring in Breaking Bad</a>.</p> <p>Momentarily taken aback, Fyne holds his gooey face, collects himself, then continues speaking. After he is bandaged up, he commits heinous acts of violence himself. These include attacking a topless woman in a way so awful it shouldn’t be put into words here (the misogyny may be cloaked in satire, but it’s still there) and repeating Buñuel’s famous assault on a human eye from Un Chien Andalou, with a hot poker instead of a knife. The violence continues until the bitter end, when Fyne is run over by a car, then set on fire.

From socks that fall down and slip beneath your heel, to those that are too rough or too thin, the result is the same: blisters and difficulty walking. It is very hard to feel composed when your socks are failing your feet.</p> <p>But going without is a recipe for ruining your shoes. “Sweat is full of bacteria,” says Julia Kelly, owner of The Sockery. “So to keep your sneakers smelling fresh, always wear socks … of any kind.”</p> <p>Generally, socks fall into three categories: sport, business and fashion. According to Kelly the purpose of the sock should dictate the blend of materials and weave.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/09/from-tatty-to-tidy-which-worn-out-clothes-make-the-best-cleaning-rags\">From tatty to tidy: which worn-out clothes make the best cleaning rags?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Socks nowadays are woven to ensure they are fit for purpose – for example sport, hiking or business wear – and usually involve a blend of a number of yarns,” she says. “Most manufacturers will blend the yarns to create the correct ‘recipe’ for the intended use.”</p> <h2>For sport</h2> <p>Giuliano Pietrolungo, production manager at Compuknit Hosiery, says for most people, sports-standard ribbed socks made of a cotton Lycra blend with terry cushioning on the soles are a good choice.</p> <p>Kelly suggests looking for moisture-wicking fibres including wool or polyester blends such as <a href=\"https://wildernesswear.com.au/coolmax-xstatic-race-socks-specials/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwuuKXBhCRARIsAC-gM0gonAY5JIkBbd7L7ea41N1iIwv1g9t5BXRRBDXslFYKpXoe1YSrumAaAsaYEALw_wcB\">CoolMax</a>. And to avoid 100% cotton socks “as they tend to hold moisture and dry slowly, which is a perfect recipe for blisters”.</p> <p>Depending on how serious you are about the activity you’re doing, different sports socks have different performance attributes. For elite or higher-level professional sport, Pietrolungo says “compression socks are available that hold on to the foot and leg better with intentional compression and more technical fibres”.</p> <p>Kelly says some runners favour <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe_socks\">toe socks</a> because they separate the toes, preventing them from rubbing.</p> <h2>For everyday wear</h2> <p>When choosing socks for everyday wear, generally speaking, natural fibres will be more comfortable. With the right weave, blend and construction, they will also be more durable.</p> <p>Pietrolungo says natural fibres are best because they are breathable while also providing insulation. He says synthetic yarns are often used to improve the durability of the sock but if the concentration of synthetics is too high, it will compromise comfort.</p> <p>Everyone’s feet are different, so the ideal blend will partly come down to personal preference. But if you have a pair of socks that leave your feet particularly sweaty, it is worth noting their fabric composition and opting for a higher percentage of natural fibres next time.</p> <p>“Wool socks provide great comfort year-round and as wool is an insulator, they are warm in winter and cool in summer,” Kelly says. “Most quality wool socks are now made from merino wool and so do not prickle or itch as socks did in the past.”</p> <p>Wool socks also have odour resistance. “They don’t need to be washed after every wear,” Kelly says. “They can be air-dried which can help in the longevity of a sock and be useful if away on a short trip.” But this comes at a price, as merino socks tend to be more expensive than other blends.</p> <p>When choosing cotton socks, Pietrolungo says look for mercerised cotton (distinguishable by a slight sheen) because “it has a lovely soft delicate feel”.</p> <h2>Socks that stay up</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5deaf2c80704bae4bc1a9a5f5dfede18a0472bfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5deaf2c80704bae4bc1a9a5f5dfede18a0472bfb/1346_1512_2303_2145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wearing a pair of calf-high sports socks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"931\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Generally, the sock most likely to stay up is one that fits well and goes over the calf.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Storey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“There are a few factors that contribute to the sock’s ability to stay up on a leg but, unfortunately, none of these are permanent,” says Pietrolungo. “The amount of elastic in the top of the sock and leg is the biggest contributor.”</p> <p>To test this, he says, “give the leg [of the sock] a stretch from the inside [to get] a good indication as to how well it will hold. But nothing can stop gravity doing what it does over time.”</p> <p>Longer socks are also more likely to have staying power, Kelly says. “Generally, the sock most likely to stay up is one that fits well and goes over the calf.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/19/laying-it-on-the-line-how-to-air-dry-your-clothes-in-all-weather-conditions\">Laying it on the line: how to air-dry your clothes in all weather conditions</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Durability is in the details</h2> <p>One way to ensure durability is through the thickness of the sock, although this needs to be balanced with comfort. “The gauge of the knitting machine and, consequently, the weight of the yarn contribute to the durability,” Pietrolungo says. This can be assessed by rubbing the material between your fingers and visually inspecting the width and density of the yarn and weave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fc836de922e9860787c5e10ed453b4dbcfac014\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fc836de922e9860787c5e10ed453b4dbcfac014/0_0_4200_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of socks with additional enforcement and padding on the heel and toe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Socks with a reinforced toe and heel should be more durable.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AnthonyRosenberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another thing to look out for is additional padding. If you are on your feet all day, you are likely to want a sock that is padded along the sole of the foot. Socks with a reinforced toe and heel should also be more durable “as these are the parts of the sock that experience the most wear”, Kelly says.</p> <p>There are also socks that use different fibres for different parts of the sock to maximise durability. “Humphrey Law, an Australian manufacturer, <a href=\"https://www.humphreylaw.com.au/socks/66F_0\">weaves a sock with wool on the inside for comfort and nylon on the outer </a>layers to provide extra abrasion and wear resistance.”</p> <p>While high-quality socks are likely to be more durable over time, how you wear and care for them also makes a difference, Kelly says. To give your socks a fighting chance, keep your toenails trimmed, wash your feet before you put your socks on, and follow the manufacturer’s instructions when you launder them.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Have you found a particularly durable, comfortable pair of socks?

His policy of freezing energy bills at their current levels until next spring reveals him to be a politician capable of seizing the agenda when the opportunity arises. The public has become unnerved by the prospect of household energy bills of <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-uk-energy-bills-are-soaring-to-record-highs-and-how-to-cut-them/\" title=\"\">£5,000 a year in April 2023</a>, more than a fourfold increase in just 18 months. Such amounts are likely to cause an unacceptable rise in fuel poverty and hardship this winter. By calling for the suspension of price hikes, Sir Keir has done the right thing at the right time.</p> <p>The Labour leader is telling the public that they ought not be paying more than they do now for gas and electricity – and that the government will step in to pick up the rest of the tab if <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/wholesale-market-indicators\" title=\"\">wholesale prices</a> continue to rise. This is smart politics. It creates a sharp dividing line between the two major parties: both the Tory leadership contenders – Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – have rejected freezing bills completely. It also puts Labour on the side of ordinary people while the prime ministerial candidates’ policies are either unimaginative or designed mostly to appeal only to a rich, elderly sliver of the electorate. Three in four Tory voters back Labour’s energy bills plan. Even energy companies have suggested a version of Labour’s offer, with the industry <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/7306b50e-1b18-11ed-abb3-33f6138e136a?shareToken=ff934adb52836973655c626569f9649d\" title=\"\">proposing</a> to voluntarily pause customers’ bills for two years and spread the cost of the gas price crisis over a decade or more.</p> <p>Sir Keir’s intervention is important because it recognises the need to stabilise energy prices and reduce inflationary pressures through a price cap combined with investments to increase the resilience of the economy. His policy is not cheap, costing the state about <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labours-29bn-cost-living-plan-27738704\" title=\"\">£30bn</a>. Gas prices, which are driving energy costs, are unlikely to drop <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-uk-energy-bills-are-soaring-to-record-highs-and-how-to-cut-them/\" title=\"\">significantly</a> in the near future.</p> <p>Extending a household energy bill freeze for a year, says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrSimEvans/status/1559166816580239360?s=20&amp;amp;t=utHHiuIbkZ-_3hFVDBfUMQ\" title=\"\">industry expert Simon Evans</a>, would cost a further £44bn. Even more alarming perhaps is that households have historically only accounted for about half of UK national spending on energy. To insulate everyone – schools, hospitals and industry – would require a Covid-style <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/15/labour-energy-bill-freeze-political-economics-price\" title=\"\">spending spree</a>. It seems inconceivable to suggest such sums could be collected from households or businesses. Labour has already suggested a windfall tax on North Sea energy producers, which is the right thing to do. However, the big money is being made outside the reach of such a policy by entities such as Norway’s state-owned energy company.</p> <p>The energy market is <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/23255/documents/169712/default/\" title=\"\">broken</a>. Almost 30 UK energy suppliers have collapsed, affecting 4 million customers in the year up to May. Even before the present crisis started, the majority of energy suppliers in Britain were loss-making. It’s hard to see how a carbon-free energy grid is going to be built from such a <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1098100/review-electricity-market-arrangements.pdf\" title=\"\">system</a>. Sir Keir is reluctant to be drawn on what Labour’s policy would be after six months. But ensuring national strategic goals are met will need a government to be able to direct investment.</p> <p>Former Labour prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/10/tax-profits-freeze-energy-prices-bring-suppliers-into-public-sector-gordon-brown\" title=\"\">Gordon Brown </a>understands this – arguing that firms might have to be operated from the public sector if they failed to enact state priorities. Many companies have a vested interest in prolonging the life of natural gas assets – because they own them. Gas is a critical transition fuel, meant to be phased out and replaced by greener supplies. But this will require the government to be in the driving seat. Fortuitously, a combination of austerity exhaustion, Covid and high inflation has created an appetite for state activism. Having grasped the scale of the crisis, Sir Keir now needs to seize the moment for the sake of the country.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/15/the-guardian-view-on-giorgia-meloni-repositioning-europes-radical-right","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T17:06:51Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Giorgia Meloni: repositioning Europe’s radical right | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/the-guardian-view-on-giorgia-meloni-repositioning-europes-radical-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/the-guardian-view-on-giorgia-meloni-repositioning-europes-radical-right","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Giorgia Meloni: repositioning Europe’s radical right","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> The Brothers of Italy leader has embraced EU integration and rejected her party’s neo-fascist roots. She remains a threat to what the European project stands for","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>As one of the most consequential elections in Italy’s postwar history approaches, the frontrunner to become prime minister is already seeking to make an impact on the international stage. Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the nationalist Brothers of Italy party, recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/scepticism-over-giorgia-melonis-claims-fascism-is-history-in-italian-far-right\" title=\"\">released</a> a slick video in which she embraces European integration and distances herself from her movement’s neo-fascist origins. Speaking in English, French and Spanish, she notes that the Italian right had “handed fascism over to history for decades”. She and her party, Ms Meloni asserts, belong to mainstream western conservatism – an Italian equivalent of the Conservative party and US Republicans.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/italy/\" title=\"\">Polls</a> continue to suggest that the rightwing alliance comprising Brothers of Italy, the nationalist League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia will triumph on 25 September, with Ms Meloni’s party in pole position. As Italy’s first female prime minister, she would become a major player in Europe’s affairs at a critical moment of crisis. So how reassured should her intended audience be by this attempt to detoxify her brand?</p> <p>It is important to be clear about what Ms Meloni is not. Certain elements of her party retain a cultural “nostalgia” for Italy’s fascist traditions, but there will be no March on Rome in late September, 100 years after Benito Mussolini <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/March-on-Rome\" title=\"\">seized</a> power. Italy’s democratic institutions will remain in place (although the right’s desire for a directly elected presidential system would alter constitutional checks and balances). On economics, the rightwing coalition’s election manifesto and Ms Meloni’s video suggest that her government would be relatively pragmatic, seeking to placate markets and ensure that Brussels continues to send post-Covid funds to Rome.</p> <p>There is, however, no reason to be remotely sanguine about Ms Meloni’s possible accession to power. Debates about 20th-century fascism are beside the point. Ms Meloni’s desire is to become the de facto European leader of a modern radical right, one that seeks to move away from the postwar western emphasis on universal rights and protections for minorities. Speaking in June to a rally organised by Vox, the Spanish far-right party, Ms Meloni could not have been clearer about the culture wars that she would pursue as prime minister. “There is no middle ground possible,” she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sJ_4UNhocU\" title=\"\">said</a>. “Today, the secular left and radical Islam are menacing our roots … Either say yes, or say no. Yes to the natural family, no to the LGBT lobbies … Yes to the universality of the cross, no to Islamist violence. Yes to secure borders, no to mass immigration.”</p> <p>This is the ethnocentric politics of “illiberal democracy” – drawing on white replacement theory, cultural Christianity and hatred of diversity – which has been <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/165953/viktor-orban-built-illiberal-state\" title=\"\">pioneered</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-orban\" title=\"\">Viktor Orbán</a> (a close ally) in Hungary. As the leader of a European Union founding member and the eurozone’s third-largest economy, Ms Meloni’s long game would be to tilt the EU’s values in this direction.

But Fuhrman’s uncanny performance, supported by similarly beyond-call-of-duty turns from Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard and adept genre management from director Jaume Collet-Serra, somehow turned a mixed bag into a bizarrely elegant reticule of some distinction.</p> <p>This prequel, once again starring Fuhrman as Esther, isn’t nearly as classy or clever, although it has its own wackadoodle twist, two-thirds in. Even more problematic, if you saw the first film, is that Fuhrman is now over a decade older, which makes trying to pass her off as a nine-year-old even harder, although a certain amount of VFX jiggery-pokery and the use of stunt doubles for some shots has been done to adjust proportions. But if any digital work went into de-ageing the actor’s face, it wasn’t enough: nasolabial folds and periorbital regions don’t lie. This makes a nonsense of the plot, which kicks off when the littlest sociopath reinvents herself to get scooped up by Julia Stiles and Rossif Sutherland as an American upper-middle class couple who believe she is their lost child. While the twist accounts for some of the gullibility in the adult world, it’s a long stretch.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBkhwcmM-uM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bBkhwcmM-uM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The most disappointing thing about the film is that it has none of the spark or originality of the first one and just parasitically drains its source material, incorporating details like the creepy black-light drawings and the borderline paedophilic subtext without adding anything substantial. Even the bland attempt to reprise the voyeuristic sex scene from the original film – a truly erotic moment with Farmiga and Sarsgaard humping against a kitchen island – is a poor substitute. Fans deserve better servicing than this.</p> <p>• Orphan: First Kill is released on 19 August in cinemas.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/15/jimmy-anderson-fresh-at-40-england-south-africa-first-test-cricket","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T17:00:33Z","webTitle":"Jimmy Anderson feels fresh at 40 and ready to lead attack against South Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/15/jimmy-anderson-fresh-at-40-england-south-africa-first-test-cricket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/15/jimmy-anderson-fresh-at-40-england-south-africa-first-test-cricket","fields":{"headline":"Jimmy Anderson feels fresh at 40 and ready to lead attack against South Africa","trailText":"England seamer has said only Stuart Broad can match him and still be bowling in Tests at the age of 40 as franchise cricket is increasingly appealing for young quicks","byline":"Ali Martin at Lord's","body":"<p>Jimmy Anderson believes he is the last of his kind – a 40-year-old seamer heading into a Test at Lord’s – as the next generation of quicks around the world become increasingly drawn to the high-pay, low-workload lifestyle of Twenty20 cricket.</p> <p>Speaking before the three-match series between England’s rejuvenated side and the current leaders in the World Test Championship, one that starts ton Wednesday, Anderson tipped only Stuart Broad, four years his junior, to go on as long as he has.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/15/andrew-strauss-test-t20-cricket-sit-together-ecb\">‘A big Rubik’s Cube’: Strauss believes Test and T20 cricket can sit together</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Maybe Broady,” Anderson said, when asked if he could see another 40-year-old seamer playing Test cricket. “But definitely not after that, because no one will be stupid enough. Everything that has gone on in the world with franchise cricket, the Hundred, the short forms of the game, I can’t see anyone wanting to play Test cricket for this long.”</p> <p>Anderson, who turned 40 on 30 July, agreed that Trent Boult’s recent uncoupling from his New Zealand central contract to focus on time at home and T20 leagues represents a “landmark” moment for the sport “because he is such a high-profile international player and I can definitely see it happening more and more, particularly with bowlers”.</p> <p>Asked if this expected trend made him sad, Anderson said: “It does because Test cricket will probably bear the brunt of it. The easiest thing to do for bowlers is bowl four overs or 20 balls. It takes nothing out of you. And if you’re getting paid just as well it probably makes sense – it will tempt more people than not.”</p> <p>Even in the era of central contracts and improved sports science – plus his own Test specialism since 2015 – Anderson is an outlier. Were he to claim a wicket this week, he would become England’s first frontline seamer in their fifth decade to do so in Test cricket since Les Jackson against Australia in 1961 aged 40 years and 125 days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0a8045bebbd2adb091789e580ea5b535e90fe25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0a8045bebbd2adb091789e580ea5b535e90fe25/0_30_3011_1807/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Anderson reacts after taking the wicket of India’s Cheteshwar Pujara during England’s win at Edgbaston in July\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Anderson reacts after taking the wicket of India’s Cheteshwar Pujara during England’s win at Edgbaston in July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not that Anderson is feeling his age, with England’s record Test wicket-taker (657 victims to date) re-energised by the positivity that has swept through the dressing room since Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum took over as captain and head coach, and four successive breakneck wins against New Zealand and India followed. They have done so with an evangelical zeal as Stokes and McCullum seek to spread the word of Test cricket through their hyper-aggressive approach.</p> <p>“Even if we didn’t play this way, I still think Test cricket is an amazing format,” Anderson said. “I hope people see it and want to be a part of it, growing up wanting to play Test cricket. Our job and responsibility as Test cricketers is to promote the game and encourage as many people as possible to watch it and play it when they get older.”</p> <p>The so-called “Bazball” approach – a term England have sought to play down – has been a topic of conversation all summer, with Mark Boucher, the South Africa head coach, even joking before his press conference on Monday that anyone using the term should have to drink a shot of tequila (a drinking game that could be called “Bouchball”, perhaps).</p> <p>The former Proteas wicketkeeper’s lighthearted mood continued, saying his side’s recent defeat against England Lions in Canterbury – when the understudies racked up 672 all out at more than 5.5 runs per over – taught them “how to fetch the ball”. Boucher stressed the fixture was solely a warmup, not a form guide before the first Test.</p> <p>South Africa’s record at Lord’s is particularly strong, having won four of their six Tests at the ground since readmission, but Boucher is mindful the current generation are light on experience here. To that end their squad took a tour on arrival, including a visit to the museum, with the reaction heartening for the head coach.</p> <p>“This is where legends are made,” he said. “We walked into the changing room and you see all the names on the board. There’s so many stories around those performances. All the players were just staring in awe of what was around them. There’s a lot of passion and emotions are running high. In a good way.</p> <p>“As a coach you don’t really have to try and get the boys all geed up for a game like this. The youngsters want to perform at this ground, hopefully create something special and become legends in the game, like a lot of the cricketers in the past.”</p> <p>The teams have one final training session before the series gets under way. Other than a return for Ben Foakes, England are expected to be unchanged from July’s win over India – Ollie Robinson, fresh from five wickets for the Lions, appears closest to changing their minds – while Boucher is optimistic Kagiso Rabada will be fit after suffering an ankle problem on tour.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/15/iran-says-salman-rushdie-and-supporters-to-blame-for-his-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T16:59:22Z","webTitle":"Iran denies role in Salman Rushdie attack but claims author is to blame","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/15/iran-says-salman-rushdie-and-supporters-to-blame-for-his-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/15/iran-says-salman-rushdie-and-supporters-to-blame-for-his-attack","fields":{"headline":"Iran denies role in Salman Rushdie attack but claims author is to blame","trailText":"Foreign ministry spokesperson blames author and supporters after stabbing that left him with ‘life-changing’ injuries","byline":"Julian Borger in Washington","body":"<p>Iran has denied having any role in the attack on Salman Rushdie but claimed the author had only himself to blame for crossing a “red line” over Islam in his writings.</p> <p>Rushdie’s life was reported to be out of danger but he was said to have sustained “life-changing” injuries after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/12/salman-rushdie-attacked-onstage-new-york\">being stabbed 10 times when he was speaking at an event</a> on Friday in Chautauqua, New York.</p> <p>Hadi Matar, the 24-year-old New Jersey man arrested at the scene, was charged with second-degree attempted murder and assault with a weapon.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, issued <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/the-attack-against-salman-rushdie/\">a statement on Sunday</a> accusing Iran of encouraging violence against Rushdie, an Indian-born dual US and UK citizen.

An Untitled Love is set at a house party, complete with plastic-covered sofas and candid conversations, and its soundtrack is by neo-soul star D’Angelo.</p> <p>Abraham, who has just turned 45, is a choreographer of great talent and range. His last two works seen in the UK were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/25/royal-ballet-review-kyle-abrahams-fresh-style-connects-to-the-real-world\">The Weathering</a>, a fresh, exuberant and tender piece for the Royal Ballet, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jun/01/aim-by-kyle-abraham-review-sadlers-wells-london\">Requiem</a>, a left-field Afrofuturist work set to Mozart for his own company <a href=\"https://aimbykyleabraham.org/\">A.I.M.</a></p> <p>He has an ability to reach across dance styles and tonalities, drawing on his past as a club kid, a musician, a student of contemporary dance and crucially, a black man growing up in the US. His choreography is very human, embedded in real life and experience, sometimes with anger and frustration (as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/20/kyle-abraham-pavement-review-sadlers-wells\">Pavement</a>, about violence in and against the black community, or <a href=\"https://www.alvinailey.org/performances/repertory/untitled-america\">Untitled America</a>, about mass incarceration), but there is also hope and warmth, particularly so in An Untitled Love.</p> <p>“You know, I’ve made so many works that look at the injustice that we face as a people, and I really wanted to make something much more celebratory,” he says. The music the audience hears in the theatre before the show will be his parents’ “grown-folks music” from back in the day: Luther Vandross, Anita Baker, the Isley Brothers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6130a09502b5c2eb061082d82270c548e36fde75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6130a09502b5c2eb061082d82270c548e36fde75/0_538_3596_4496/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Abraham.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle Abraham, at the Royal Opera House studios.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Parsons/Times Newspapers Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He wanted to honour his parents and the aunts and uncles he grew up with, and draw a line through their histories, from his parents meeting at a historically black college in the 60s, to him studying at a historically black college himself in the 90s (Morgan State University in Baltimore).</p> <p>Abraham would listen to D’Angelo’s debut album, Brown Sugar, in his freshman year, when he was “trying to think about what my space was, how I looked at culture, how I looked at love and considering what that would even mean for me”. D’Angelo was a constant on his Discman. “I’m a gay man, right, but there’s something about the way he’s singing that song Lady that I can relate to. That sense of love he has in that song for this woman, it’s so palpable it makes me crave that music.”</p> <p>In An Untitled Love, the songs weave together with his own feelings on history, family and connection. “This work is ultimately looking at love and self-love, and it has a lot of laughter, a lot of joy.”</p> <p>Listening to him talk about it, you can’t help think of Steve McQueen’s film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/17/lovers-rock-review-steve-mcqueen-small-axe\">Lovers Rock</a>, from the Small Axe series, set at a house party, with minimal dialogue and maximum dancing. Abraham hasn’t seen it: “But you’re the second person in the last 24 hours to mention it!”</p> <p>He does talk about other films that influenced the characters and their arcs through the 70-minute piece, including the 2002 romcom Brown Sugar – no relation to the album – with Taye Diggs and Sanaa Lathan bonding over their childhood discovery of hip-hop, and another Lathan film, Love &amp; Basketball (2000). Those references are an example of the way Abraham’s dance lives in the world of movies, music, popular culture, political life and social systems, just as we do as people, but which is not always true of things we see on stage – especially dance, which does escapism and otherworldliness so well.</p> <p>Abraham calls D’Angelo’s music his “best friend”, especially so in “that first year in college when I didn’t really have many friends”. We have deep relationships, over decades, with songs we love. For Abraham, one of those is The Line, from D’Angelo’s second album, Voodoo, the gist of its lyrics about standing proud and being ready to take a risk. “That is one of the songs that still helps me get out of bed,” says Abraham, who has dealt with depression in the past. “Sometimes I need certain songs to really get me going, and that’s one that for years helped me start my day.”</p> <p>The show has already premiered in the US, and D’Angelo came to see it in Brooklyn. “Meeting him was really trippy because I had to play it cool and be as calm as I could,” says Abraham. “But he was really favourable. There were a couple things that we did where he said, ‘Oh, I feel like I should incorporate that in my show.’” Abraham’s response? “Oh my God!” he laughs at his own delight at getting the ultimate seal of approval.</p> <p><em>• </em><em>An Untitled Love is at <a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/events/an-untitled-love\">King’s theatre, Edinburgh, 20-21 August</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/14/hotter-summers-fuel-increase-skin-cancers-melanoma","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T16:51:59Z","webTitle":"Hotter summers may fuel increase in skin cancers, doctors warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/14/hotter-summers-fuel-increase-skin-cancers-melanoma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/14/hotter-summers-fuel-increase-skin-cancers-melanoma","fields":{"headline":"Hotter summers may fuel increase in skin cancers, doctors warn","trailText":"Higher summer temperatures caused by climate crisis may lead to more cases of melanoma, say medics","byline":"Nicola Davis Science correspondent","body":"<p>Experts have said higher summer temperatures caused by the climate crisis may fuel an increase in cases of potentially deadly skin cancers such as melanoma.</p> <p>The UK recorded its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/19/day-of-40c-shocks-scientists-as-uk-heat-record-absolutely-obliterated?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other\">highest ever temperature</a> of 40.2C last month, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/18/uk-weather-heatwave-cold-country-adapt-heat-climate\">climate scientists</a> stressed the heatwave was not a one-off and high temperatures were likely to become more frequent.</p> <p>Now medics are warning that the changing climate will cast a long shadow should people spend more time in the sun and have greater exposure to UV radiation.</p> <p>“As a clinician treating patients with melanoma, I am definitely concerned that a sustained trend in hotter summers will lead to more cases of melanoma and more deaths from melanoma,” said Sarah Danson, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Sheffield.</p> <p>Julia Newton-Bishop, a clinician scientist leading the melanoma research group at the University of Leeds, said: “Melanoma is caused essentially by sunburn, and this weather is so extreme that I am concerned that sunburns will increase and later so will the incidence of melanoma.”</p> <p>According to data from Cancer Research UK, skin cancer death rates among men in the UK have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/15/skin-cancer-melanoma-death-rates-for-men-uk-tripled-since-1970s\">more than tripled since the 1970s</a>, with increases also recorded among women. It is thought the rise may be down to a number of factors including greater sun exposure due to package holidays, with Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, warning that getting sunburn just once every two years can triple the risk of skin cancer.</p> <p>Prof Dann Mitchell, an expert in climate science at the University of Bristol, noted that the relationship between warmer weather and health could be indirect.</p> <p>“One of the clearest signals of climate change is hotter temperatures, not just in summer, but all year around,” he said. “This shift in temperatures also shifts behavioural patterns, and people in the UK tend to go outside more when the temperatures are warm. This leads to more exposure to sunlight throughout the year, and crucially more exposure to the UV part of that sunlight, which is a known risk factor for skin cancer.”</p> <p>Mitchell added that long-term health consequences of the climate crisis were not discussed enough.</p> <p>“This is because we cannot say a specific heatwave caused a specific cancer. Rather, we link the increased risk of cancer to the integration of many warmer days, with these warmer days made more likely due to human-induced climate change,” he said, adding that more research in the area was needed. </p> <p>Karis Betts, a senior health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said it was too early to know the impact of the recent heatwaves on skin cancer cases as cancer usually takes many years to develop.</p> <p>But she added: “It’s important to remember that it’s the ultraviolet rays from the sun rather than its heat that cause sunburn and skin cancer. The sun can be strong enough to burn from mid-March to mid-October here in the UK, whether it’s a heatwave or not.”</p> <p>Danson said there were a number of steps that could be take to reduce sun exposure and avoid getting sunburn, including staying out of the sun completely from 11am to 3pm, sitting in the shade, covering up with shirts and hats, and wearing and reapplying sunscreen.</p> <p>“Anyone with concerns about a new or changing mole should seek advice from their GP immediately as early diagnosis is really important and we have treatments available,” she said.</p> <p>• The headline and introduction of this article were amended on 15 August 2022 to reflect the quoted experts warning that the climate crisis “may” cause an increase in skin cancers, not that it “will” as an earlier version said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/15/oder-river-mystery-of-mass-die-off-of-fish-lingers-as-toxic-substances-ruled-out","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T16:47:22Z","webTitle":"Oder river: mystery of mass die-off of fish lingers as no toxic substances found","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/15/oder-river-mystery-of-mass-die-off-of-fish-lingers-as-toxic-substances-ruled-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/15/oder-river-mystery-of-mass-die-off-of-fish-lingers-as-toxic-substances-ruled-out","fields":{"headline":"Oder river: mystery of mass die-off of fish lingers as no toxic substances found","trailText":"Polish scientists only found elevated salt levels after thousands of dead fish were found floating in the central European waterway","byline":"Philip Oltermann in Berlin","body":"<p>Mystery continues to surround the cause behind a “catastrophic” mass die-off of fish in the Oder River, after Polish scientists said laboratory tests found elevated salt levels but no other toxic substances in the central European waterway.</p> <p>German municipalities have banned bathing and fishing in the Oder after thousands of dead fish were found floating in the 520 mile (840km) river, which runs from the Czech Republic to the Baltic Sea along the border between Germany and Poland.</p> <p>Conservationists expressed fears that the mass die-off could wreak havoc on the entire ecosystem of the Oder. “We have to see how the bird population develops and what will happen to the racoons and otters,” Karina Dörk, a district administrator of Germany’s Uckermark region, told the Tagesspiegel newspaper. “It is a catastrophe that will stay with us for years.”</p> <p>According to the interior ministry in Warsaw, 2,000 police officers, 300 firefighters and 200 soldiers have been deployed to help fish animal carcasses out of the water over the past few days.</p> <p>On Monday morning Polish and German environmental ministers announced a plan to use floating oil barriers to stop floating dead fish spreading further across the Szczecin Lagoon, from where the Oder flows into the Baltic Sea’s Bay of Pomerania.

The sexual conquest of young women became “a game”, the court heard.</p> <p>Opening the case, the prosecutor, Timothy Cray, told the jury Mendy was a “reasonably famous” footballer at the time of the offences, having won the World Cup with the French national team. “These days fame brings attention. Fame also brings money. And because of this, Mendy’s wealth and status, others were prepared to help him to get what he wanted,” said Cray.</p> <p>One of Saha’s jobs was “to find young women and to create the situations where those young women could be raped and sexually assaulted”, Cray added.</p> <p>In July 2021, Saha offered to pay a woman to attend a party at Mendy’s home with a friend – instead of working a shift at a nightclub, the court heard. The woman later told police Mendy raped her in his cinema room without using a condom. Two of Mendy’s associates blocked her friend when she went to look for her, the jury was told.</p> <p>Mendy and Saha had a joint purpose, the court heard. “These women were disposable: things to be used for sex, then thrown to one side,” Cray said.</p> <p>Two of the women told police they were “passed between” both men at Mendy’s multimillion-pound mansion, where he held pool parties. One was so drunk she only found out both men had had sex with her when semen from each was found in her knickers, the court heard.</p> <p>Five said they were raped or sexually assaulted solely by Mendy and six solely by Saha. The men deny all 22 charges brought against them.</p> <p>The alleged offences by Mendy are said to have taken place at his gated mansion in the hamlet of Mottram St Andrew, near Macclesfield, between October 2018 and 2021. The nearest village, Prestbury, was a 15-minute walk along an unlit country lane, the jury heard.</p> <p>Some of the women told police they had their phones taken off them on arrival. Ostensibly this was to protect Mendy and others from unwanted social media intrusion –&nbsp;“I imagine that Mendy did not want Pep Guardiola to see him out late on Instagram with a load of girls,” said Cray – but it also left them unable to call for help.</p> <p>One of the women, described by Cray as “the opposite of a football groupie”, said Mendy tried to rape her after she went to his house to meet another footballer.</p> <p>Another told detectives she was on her period when Mendy raped her. One woman, who accuses both men of rape, was 17 at the time. One, the court heard, was sexually assaulted when “more or less minding her own business in Mendy’s kitchen”.</p> <p>Two of the women said Mendy raped them in rooms they believed to be locked. The jury was shown video footage of a police officer demonstrating the locks on the doors, as Cray explained they were legitimately used by wealthy individuals.</p> <p>“The logic is that if you are likely to be a target for burglars, the locks in effect create a panic room that you can’t get in from the outside, but you can open them from the inside if you know what to do. The point is that you have to know how to open them from the inside, and you’ll perhaps see how the witnesses might have gotten the impression … that they are locked in,” said Cray.</p> <p>Both men knew what they were doing, Cray said. “They were not in some happy state of sexual ignorance about how this all works – they knew very well what they were doing. They turned the pursuit of women for sex into a game, in effect, and if women got hurt or distressed – too bad. Make it go away.”</p> <p>He added: “In this day and age, no one can doubt, can they, to use the common saying, that ‘no means no’? That’s no longer some sort of grey area, or some sort of an open door for a man to push through regardless … You don’t lose that right because you’ve been to a bar or dressed for a nightclub or gone to a footballer’s house and you are partying.”</p> <p>The prosecutor told the jury the defendants were likely to argue that the women alleging rape and sexual assault “consented to sex willingly, often enthusiastically”, said Cray.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/from-nasal-vaccines-to-pills-the-next-defences-against-covid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T16:23:46Z","webTitle":"From nasal vaccines to pills: the next defences against Covid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/from-nasal-vaccines-to-pills-the-next-defences-against-covid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/from-nasal-vaccines-to-pills-the-next-defences-against-covid","fields":{"headline":"From nasal vaccines to pills: the next defences against Covid","trailText":"Analysis: a bivalent vaccine has been approved and research is being carried out into possible pan-coronavirus vaccines","byline":"Hannah Devlin Science correspondent","body":"<p>When the autumn booster programme begins next month, many people are likely to receive Moderna’s new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/dual-variant-covid-vaccine-approved-uk-booster-programme-moderna\">bivalent vaccine</a>, designed to protect against the original Covid strain and the more transmissible Omicron variant. As Covid continues to evolve, so will vaccination strategies. Here we look at some of the developments in the pipeline.</p> <h2>Variant-specific boosters</h2> <p>In the past two years we have watched natural selection in action, with successive strains of Covid emerging, each more transmissible and better able to evade previous immunity than the last. To combat this, vaccine manufacturers have updated vaccines to more closely match strains in circulation, with Moderna’s bivalent vaccine the first to be approved that targets two strains simultaneously (the original variant and Omicron). A Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent vaccine is also under review. These updated vaccines are likely to be more effective (we have yet to get conclusive efficacy data), so they will be valuable for ensuring that people at greatest risk of severe illness remain protected against hospitalisation and death. But there are diminishing returns on deploying these vaccines in the wider population because they do not prevent infection and only prevent symptomatic disease for a few months.</p> <h2>Nasal vaccines</h2> <p>The first generation of Covid vaccines all work by boosting circulating antibodies. But they do little to stimulate antibodies in the tissues that line the nose and airways, and this so-called mucosal immunity is the body’s first line of defence against respiratory infection. This is considered a major weakness of current Covid vaccines and could explain why current vaccines protect against illness and death but not against infection. Scientists hope nasal vaccines, similar to those used for seasonal flu, could overcome this shortcoming and help weaken the chain of transmission and reduce the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/17/unexpected-changing-waves-covid-seasonal\">continued impact of Covid</a>. There are at least 12 nasal vaccines in clinical development, with four in phase 3 trials, and many view an effective nasal vaccine as the next major prize for vaccine research.</p> <h2>Vaccine pills</h2> <p>One company, Vaxart, has developed a tablet that showed promising results in a small trial <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/oral-vaccine-shows-promise-hypertension-ups-covid-hospitalization-risk-2022-07-21/\">last month</a>. The aspirin-sized pill uses an adenovirus, similar to the delivery system used by the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, to deliver instructions for making the Covid spike protein to cells in the gut. This stimulates the release of antibodies in the nose and mouth. In the trial, nearly half of volunteers showed higher levels of antibodies in nasal and saliva samples than people whose antibodies were the result of a previous Covid infection. The enhanced antibody levels lasted for six months, according to the trial results. A phase 2 trial with 900 participants is under way and expected to report next year.</p> <h2>Pan-coronavirus vaccines</h2> <p>Last month there was a <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/why-efforts-make-better-more-universal-coronavirus-vaccines-are-struggling\">call from the White House</a> to develop vaccines designed to protect against future Covid-19 variants, and even unknown coronaviruses that could emerge in the future. At the more modest end of the spectrum – although still a major advance on current vaccines – scientists are working on vaccines with broad immunity against current and future Covid-19 strains. These would be designed to sidestep the continual game of catchup with newly emerging variants. </p> <p>The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the US has the only pan-coronavirus vaccine candidate of this type in clinical trials. Other teams are exploring the even more ambitious goal of developing a vaccine that would work for the entire coronavirus family, including the viruses that cause Mers, Sars and seasonal colds. However, achieving this is some way off and is perhaps best viewed as pandemic preparedness research rather than something likely to yield a new Covid vaccine that could be widely deployed in the next year. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/15/a-moment-of-reckoning-for-the-water-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T16:22:45Z","webTitle":"A moment of reckoning for the water industry | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/15/a-moment-of-reckoning-for-the-water-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/15/a-moment-of-reckoning-for-the-water-industry","fields":{"headline":"A moment of reckoning for the water industry","trailText":"<strong>Letters: </strong>Warnings about the UK’s fragile water supplies have been ignored for years, writes <strong>Michael Norton</strong>.

Farmers lack water for irrigation, and an increasing number of households are experiencing water restrictions. Water companies have built little or no additional storage, largely due to the view of the regulator, Ofwat, that customers are unable to afford raised tariffs and that “resilience” can be achieved in other ways. </p> <p>Management of water resources represents a huge economic opportunity. Multipurpose water resource developments can bring flood control, energy generation and water for agriculture, in addition to a more secure domestic water supply.
