The blaze has consumed more than 19,200 acres, fueled through the dry, overgrown vegetation coating the hillsides and favorable fire conditions that spurred erratic and extreme behavior.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/firefighter-chasing-adrenaline-hit-started-french-wildfires-say-prosecutors\">Adrenaline-seeking firefighter started French wildfires, say prosecutors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many have still been kept from their homes as the fire continues to spread since igniting last week, as residents await word on whether theirs was one of the 162 structures reported destroyed. That number could go up as damage assessment crews work to investigate the destruction, and hundreds of houses still lie in the fire’s path.</p> <p>“If the fire intensifies it could reach those areas,” said a Cal Fire public information officer, Hector Vasquez, noting that warmer and drier conditions are expected in the coming days and that the steep, rocky terrain where the fire is burning has hindered efforts to corral it. Homes will remain at risk until the blaze has been completely extinguished. “But the number [of homes at risk] has gone down significantly in the last few days,” he added.</p> <p>The Oak fire is one of many disasters raging across the US, as scorching temperatures baked the Pacific north-west, the west remained parched in record drought, and severe storms sent flash floods surging across several states. At least four people have died due to the extreme heat in Oregon, according to the state medical examiner, while the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/29/kentucky-flash-flooding-death-toll\"> death toll mounts in Kentucky</a>, where 16 people have been reported killed in historic flooding.</p> <p>“We may have even lost entire families,” said Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, speaking in an update posted on YouTube.</p> <p>The climate crisis has turned up the dial on disasters and, as temperatures continue to climb, extreme events are expected to increase and overlap, testing resilience and hampering recovery. Although the ways that individual events are linked to climate change must be studied to be confirmed, the trends tell a troubling story of what’s to come.</p> <p>“Instead of random extreme weather events, we’re seeing these large-scale anomalies,” said climate scientist Karen McKinnon, who studies climate variability at the University of California, Los Angeles. She also noted the scale of the continent-wide heatwave.</p> <p>“Most evidence pointed to the extreme 120F temperatures in the Pacific north-west last year as being largely a freak event,” she said. “But if we see it again, that’s a huge signal that something about the underlying physics of the system is changing. If you see two freak events in a row, then you know you need to re-examine your conceptual system.”</p> <p>As for fires, California – which experienced record-breaking blazes in recent years – has had a milder start to its high-risk season, even with the destructive Oak fire.</p> <p>“This time last year we had multiple fires burning throughout the state,” Vasquez said, adding that the lack of competition for resources played a big part in enabling crews to attack the fire quickly. “We had so many personnel and they got here quickly because we had a wide range of personnel not assigned to other incidents.”</p> <p>Still, with months left before the state sees wetting rains that reduce the risks, this could just be the beginning of another fire-filled season. Fires are important to maintaining the health of California’s landscapes, and can improve resilience and ecosystem recovery, especially in forests that are adapted to flames. But high-intensity conditions and an over-abundance of dried fuel have changed fire behavior, resulting in more destructive blazes.</p> <p>Overgrown parched vegetation across the state is baking in summer heat. Many regions are primed to burn.</p> <p>“There have been several fires started since the Oak incident started,” Vasquez said, “and that could be a strong indicator of what lies ahead of us.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/29/battle-for-the-golden-boot-mead-and-popp-have-dual-goals-in-their-sights","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T19:29:57Z","webTitle":"Battle for the Golden Boot: Mead and Popp have dual goals in their sights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/battle-for-the-golden-boot-mead-and-popp-have-dual-goals-in-their-sights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/29/battle-for-the-golden-boot-mead-and-popp-have-dual-goals-in-their-sights","fields":{"headline":"Battle for the Golden Boot: Mead and Popp have dual goals in their sights","trailText":"The two forwards are level on six goals each and either could secure the accolade of being the tournament’s top scorer as well as leading their nation to victory at Wembley","byline":"Paul MacInnes and Sid Lowe","body":"<p>Sunday’s Women’s European Championship final doesn’t need any hyping up. England, Germany, at Wembley, in what has become the biggest women’s football tournament of all time – the reasons for excitement are plain. But there is one further factor that shouldn’t be neglected: a shootout for the Golden Boot.</p> <p>Beth Mead of England and Germany’s Alexandra Popp go into the final with six goals each in the tournament. Headers, howitzers, placed finishes and poaches, they have found every type of way to hit the net. Wolfsburg’s Popp has scored in every match, a record for the championship, while Mead has done so against every team bar Spain. Both have also shown real leadership when their teams have needed it. Now one has the chance to steal the accolade of tournament top scorer from the other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/prankster-popp-insists-pressure-is-more-on-england-before-euro-2022-final\">Prankster Popp insists ‘pressure is more on England’ before Euro 2022 final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia’s and Arsenal’s Steph Catley has as much experience of facing up to Mead as anyone. On the training pitch and at international level, the left-back has dealt with the forward up close. “There’s many reasons why she scores so many goals,” Catley says of Mead, “but I think from playing against her it’s the fact she’s just constantly on the move. She’s moving, she’s looking where she can get the ball, how she can get in behind a player or in front, and she’s making selfless runs for other players which puts her in positions where on the second ball she’s able to score.”</p> <p>The instinct of being in the right place is something natural, according to Catley, but it is augmented by an approach characterised by desire. “Mentally she knows where she needs to be but she also has the work rate, which means she’s always going to get into the right position,” Catley says. “When the ball’s transitioning she’s the first with her head down sprinting towards goal, trying to get in a position where she can score. I think it’s that ruthlessness and wanting always to score that puts her above the rest and in the right positions.”</p> <p>Catley believes, off the pitch, Mead wears her commitment to excellence lightly. “The best thing about her is that when she is off the field she is so warm and welcoming,” she says. “She is such a happy person, such a positive person, and I think that reflects on to the field because she doesn’t take anything too seriously. I think when she’s playing you can see that she’s having fun and the stuff that she does is creative. That positivity really comes out when she’s playing, and when she’s having a good time playing, she’s scoring.”</p> <p>This combination of determination, technical ability and a lightness of approach is borne out in what Catley considers to be Mead’s trademark move: the chop. “There’s a few moments I can think of that she does repetitively but I think the main one is where everybody thinks she’s going to shoot and then she just chops,” Catley says. “She’s so calm and composed that it looks like she’s got an hour on the ball, and she just calmly slots the ball into the net. It’s one of the hardest things to do in football but she does it so convincingly. And she does it often.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0447101e3111a6beac1b1f1253ce1e389a90a30d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0447101e3111a6beac1b1f1253ce1e389a90a30d/206_103_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beth Mead scores England’s second goal against Northern Ireland during the group stage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beth Mead scores England’s second goal against Northern Ireland during the group stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Lee/Uefa/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mead and Popp have already come into contact this season, in the first leg of Arsenal’s Champions League quarter-final with Wolfsburg in March. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/23/arsenal-wolfsburg-womens-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">1-1 draw</a> at the Emirates with numerous chances for both sides, Mead and Popp lined up against each other down Arsenal’s right side. Mead was an influential presence in the game, Popp quieter – still feeling her way back into form – but both showed the strength and versatility of their game, drifting in from the flanks with or without the ball to create trouble in the box. Both were booked for late challenges, and Popp’s was on Mead herself.</p> <p>With the German captain now spearheading her side, the players will not be direct opponents on Sunday, but stats from Opta show that both have been playing an expansive game during this tournament. They share touch maps that show a presence on both flanks as well as down the middle (though Mead’s strongest area is on the right side). Their shot maps, too, are similar. Mead has taken 15 shots to Popp’s 17, but both players have scored most of their goals and taken most of their shots in the area between the penalty spot and six-yard box. This is the optimum place for a striker to shoot from, and – in the manner explained by Catley – they have managed to find it after darting in from outside. See Mead’s goal against Sweden and Popp’s second against France – a dominant header – for proof.</p> <p>Popp struck an impossibly cool figure as she drifted through the mixed zone after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/germany-france-womens-euro-2022-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the semi-final win in Milton Keynes</a>. Players can often look harried after a match, or desperately eye their phone to avoid being questioned, but Popp seemed to almost be drifting above all the hubbub, showing the same calm as she does in front of goal. This is her, and one of the reasons why she has proven so valuable to Germany in this tournament, but it is all the more impressive given she is set to realise a goal she has been denied almost cruelly to this point.</p> <p>“It’s an incredible story,” is how Popp described it herself. “I can’t put it into words: we’re in the final against England and it doesn’t get any better than that.” Germany’s captain has won two Champions Leagues, seven league titles, 11 cups and Olympic Gold, has been a world champion at Under-17 and Under-20 level, played at three World Cups and in nearly 20 finals, but even she hadn’t experienced a moment quite like this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Germany weren’t supposed to make the final of the 2022 Euros, Popp wasn’t supposed to make the Euros at all. But then, as her national coach, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, says: “She always gets up again and again; she comes back from every crisis even stronger.”</p> <p>Aged 31, Popp has played 119 games for Germany and scored 59 goals. But until this summer she had never been to a European Championship. She missed out in 2013 with an ankle injury and 2017 with a knee injury and had the current competition gone ahead as planned last summer, she would have missed that too because of a potentially career-ending cartilage injury. After spending this season recovering her strength and sharpness, she got Covid three weeks from the start of the Euros.</p> <p>On the opening night, she was a substitute. But she came on and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/08/germany-denmark-womens-euro-2022-match-report\" title=\"\">scored against Denmark</a>. Once she had started she couldn’t stop. Every game, there was a goal and, on Wednesday, there were two to take Germany into the final. “It’s unbelievable what Poppy is doing,” said her teammate Lena Oberdorf.</p> <p>“I had the feeling people had written me off,” Popp admitted after the Denmark game. Voss-Tecklenburg was not one of them; she knew. She had been the striker’s coach when Popp joined FCR Duisburg 14 years ago. She could certainly play, that was for clear from the start. She could also fight. Listen to Voss-Tecklenburg and her teammates talk about Popp and it’s as much about temperament as talent.</p> <p>Growing up in the Ruhr Valley, Popp had only played with boys – women’s football would not be good enough for her, she thought – until she was 16, but she earned a place on the federation’s Berger Feld elite facility in Gelsenkirchen at 17, the only female there. The grant was not big and the money was given to keep her family afloat after her father’s butchers went under.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"610075f643f1c09e9a6760675ca8f656394a489f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/610075f643f1c09e9a6760675ca8f656394a489f/0_123_1843_1106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandra Popp scores Germany’s second goal against Spain during the group stage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandra Popp scores Germany’s second goal against Spain during the group stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Wolfsburg came for her, Ralf Kellermann, the sporting director, had arranged a job for her but there was no way she was going to sit around in an office. An animal lover – she has an Australian Shepherd called Patch – she did a three-and-a-half-year zookeeper’s qualification, working at Essehof zoo. There were lessons for football there, she said: in animal behaviour, solidarity, the pack as a workforce. It provided an escape too, the monkey cage a release.</p> <p>The goals kept going in, any which way: a relentlessness about her. Over and over again. The medals rolled in with them. Which isn’t to say she always won: sent off, she watched as Wolfsburg let slip a lead that cost them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/24/wolfsburg-lyon-womens-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the 2018 Champions League trophy</a> against Lyon, who she had turned down to join Duisburg. The cup wins, played on the same day and in the same stadium as the men’s finals, carried a significance perhaps even greater than the league titles. A first Germany goal came 12 years ago and she’s not finished yet.</p> <p>The injuries have not derailed her. Popp recounts the story of driving to Berlin for a test on her injured knee last year, never imagining she would fail, only for that to be what happened. She cried all the way home again. And then returned to work, more determined than ever before, telling herself over and over: “You absolutely<em> must</em> go to the Euros. It wouldn’t be me if I said: ‘Well, that’s it. I’ll just have to accept it.’ What I accept is the fight.”</p> <p>And it was one thing to get fit, getting in the team was another, for club and country. When she dived in to score a header against Denmark, she slipped to her knees, put her head down and hit the turf with her hands. It had actually happened.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-lionesses-blazing-a-trail-for-womens-football\">The Guardian view on the Lionesses: blazing a trail for women’s football | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turns out, that was just the start too. Turns out, it was better this way. “I’m enjoying these experiences a lot more: I like football even more than I did before,” Popp said after the semi-final. “It doesn’t mean I didn’t like football then. But now I appreciate the moments on the pitch more and that makes it very special to be here. Having the opportunity to perform like this and being fully fit at this stage makes me very proud.</p> <p>“I’ve become very dangerous, like I was in the past, but that hadn’t been the case for a while because I was injured.

Grazed by sheep under the wide Waikato sky, it gave no hint of its past – except perhaps that her labrador, Lucy, had an odd aversion to it. The dog would veer away from it, skirting the fence line.</p> <p>But out riding her horse, Alice, on a quiet Sunday in early 1991, Arrell was about to discover a grave on the 200-hectare farm she called home. Beneath the feet of the sheep, under the grass and soil, nearly 500 people lay buried.</p> <p>“I jumped Alice over the fence into this paddock and she tripped and fell, her rear foreleg disappeared down a hole,” she says. “I tumbled off. We were both OK, except I tumbled against a hard piece of rock – or so I thought. It was a metal plaque.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"409fa64f5973fedc12998ffd7ebe8398f83bf5c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/409fa64f5973fedc12998ffd7ebe8398f83bf5c4/184_336_3497_3098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black and white image of Tokanui hospital photographed from the air in 1963\" width=\"1000\" height=\"886\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of Tokanui hospital in 1963.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Library of New Zealand</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arrell pulled the plaque from the overgrown grass. It identified the resting place of a single woman – the only marker in the paddock. In reality, hundreds of others lay beneath the grass, their graves unmarked.</p> <h2>‘They were human beings, for God’s sake’</h2> <p>The graves were dug to receive patients who died at Tokanui hospital, a state-run institution that housed New Zealanders with intellectual disabilities or mental illness.</p> <p>While the last burials at the graveyard were recorded in the mid-60s, the institution remained open until the late 1990s, with much of its surrounding grounds – including the gravesite – converted into farmland. Like its graveyard, the institution slipped mostly out of public memory after it was shut down in 1998. Now, New Zealand is in the midst of a <a href=\"https://www.abuseincare.org.nz/\">royal commission of inquiry</a> into claims of abuse and neglect of those cared for by the state.</p> <p>Arrell, who worked at Tokanui as well as living at the farm, was one of those who shared their memories. </p> <p>Today, Tokanui’s dead lie at the centre of a dairy farm run by Agresearch, a crown research institute. To find the graveyard, you trudge up the chewed-up mud of a track, past the gaze of a cluster of bobby calves. The graves have been fenced off, to stop stock wandering in. A wreath of purple flowers has blown into the next paddock, and lies half concealed by grass. At the field’s centre is a small wooden cross, crusted with lichen, leaning a little crookedly in the wind.</p> <p>Maurice Zinsli came across the graveyard while researching his family tree. His great-aunt, Maria, had been committed to Tokanui at age 23, while grieving the sudden death of her fiance. She remained there until her death almost 40 years later. Zinsli had looked up where she was buried, and discovered it was nearby – in a cemetery he hadn’t heard of before. “I said oh – that’s just down the bloody road from me, I’ll go down and have a look.”</p> <p>He was appalled by what he found. “It was a farm paddock – that’s all it was, that’s all you could say. The cattle were in there, the sheep were in there … It was an absolute disgrace,” he says. He began a decade-long campaign for recognition and a proper memorial for the people buried there. On the hill there now stands a memorial wall, etched with the <a href=\"https://tokanuihospitalcemetery.weebly.com/about-uscontact.html\">467 names</a> of those Zinsli and genealogist Anna Purgar have spent almost a decade tracking down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07963047b55aac9121a68052a779f1e68fac1085\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07963047b55aac9121a68052a779f1e68fac1085/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cows on a muddy track in front of the grassy hills of the paddock grave\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘To find the graveyard, you trudge up the chewed-up mud of a track.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tess McClure/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Purgar also has an extended family member buried there, and says she’s saddened that no one took responsibility after the institution closed.</p> <p>“It’s quite sad really, if you see it, it’s quite emotional. You sort of stand there, and turn around and see all these people’s names. And you turn back again and think well, they’re in this paddock.”</p> <p>Zinsli says: “I couldn’t see why all these people that were buried there never got any recognition. I mean, they were human beings for God’s sake.”</p> <p>The forgotten graveyard strikes him as symbolic of a wider societal forgetting. “If you went into a mental home, no matter what you went in for, a stigma got attached – and then nobody wants to know about it.”</p> <h2>‘Tokanui ruined my life’</h2> <p>New Zealand is in the process of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/16/at-least-250000-suffered-abuse-in-new-zealands-state-care-system-inquiry-finds\">excavating the experiences and memories</a> of those who lived through its institutions, in an effort to understand how the country allowed abuse or neglect to occur, and to ensure it is not repeated.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/01/new-zealand-child-abuse-state-care-royal-commission\">royal commission</a>, which will deliver its final report in June next year, was established in 2018 and has been taking evidence since 2019. Over the past month, it conducted hearings on abuse in state psychiatric and disability care facilities, adding to thousands of hours of testimony from ex-staff, patients and family members.</p> <p>An ex-resident of Tokanui, Peter Keoghan, was sent to the hospital when he was five years old, and remained there for 20 years. Keoghan told the tribunal he experienced physical abuse from staff members and sexual abuse from other patients.</p> <p>“Tokanui ruined my life and it has affected me every day. It was not a nice place. The memories made me feel angry,” he said. “When I got out, I said ‘I’m free I’m free! I’m free!’ No one would kick me in the stomach or grab me around the neck.”</p> <p>One witness to the tribunal – identified as Mr EY – testified about the loss of his 12-year-old brother, Jimmy, who was sent to Tokanui after being diagnosed with “imbecility” and difficulty walking. The family visited Jimmy just once after his admission. In a little over a year, EY alleged he had transformed – he was severely overweight, heavily medicated, non-verbal and confined to a wheelchair. Attempting to lift him up, EY discovered he was bleeding from severe bed sores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/11/it-never-goes-away-new-zealand-survivors-of-abuse-in-care-hope-testimony-will-herald-change\">‘It never goes away’: New Zealand survivors of abuse in care hope testimony will herald change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“He couldn’t acknowledge us. He couldn’t even say anything. He was sitting there in a state of obvious anguish, in physical and mental pain,” EY testified. Jimmy died shortly afterwards, and was buried in an unmarked grave.</p> <p>“I believe Jimmy died unnecessarily. His <em>mana</em> [pride and dignity] needs to be restored but I feel that this cannot happen until his resting place is marked,” EY said. “My brother died in care. Jimmy didn’t have a voice to express his pain and suffering. So, I must carry his voice from beyond the grave to ensure justice.”</p> <h2>‘What was going on for that to be able to happen?’</h2> <p>Tokanui was built in 1912, when eugenics ideas were mainstream in New Zealand. A year earlier, the country had signed its “Mental Defectives Act”, allowing for the detention and segregation of people considered “mentally deficient”. <a href=\"https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/periodicals/KT19120101.2.19\">The New Zealand Nurse’s journal</a> celebrated the bill’s passing, saying it would help with “stemming the tide of race deterioration”.</p> <p>The idea developed “that it would be better to corral people with so-called ‘mental defects’ and take them away from wider society,” says University of Newcastle Prof Catharine Coleborne, who studied the history of Tokanui and other institutions like it. “A sense of protecting people from wider society, but also protecting wider society from them.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3391f478dd33c774d5513746fc44dda0d8c8304e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3391f478dd33c774d5513746fc44dda0d8c8304e/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At the field’s centre is a small wooden cross, crusted with lichen, leaning a little crookedly in the wind.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘At the field’s centre is a small wooden cross, crusted with lichen, leaning a little crookedly in the wind.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tess McClure/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“These kinds of institutions may become worlds unto their own,” says Coleborne – and their legacy is not black and white. “Institutions are complex places. They could be places where people found respite and asylum in the real sense of the word, and purpose. But they needed to have support from the outside world.”</p> <p>She says that beyond the institutions themselves, there is a wider question for New Zealand, around how it chose to care for those with disability, mental health, and others who needed assistance.</p> <p>“I would hate for institutions to receive all of the blame, because I think what was going on more broadly was a culture of silence around people who didn’t fit into a productive economy,” she says. “There’s a bigger question we have here … what was going on in wider society for that to be able to happen?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/jul/29/honor-society-review-a-sharp-surprisingly-dark-high-school-comedy","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T18:55:52Z","webTitle":"Honor Society review – a sharp, surprisingly dark high school comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/29/honor-society-review-a-sharp-surprisingly-dark-high-school-comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/jul/29/honor-society-review-a-sharp-surprisingly-dark-high-school-comedy","fields":{"headline":"Honor Society review – a sharp, surprisingly dark high school comedy","trailText":"The Paramount Plus film about a high school girl singularly obsessed with getting into Harvard is an enjoyably fanged journey through senior year","byline":"Adrian Horton","body":"<p>Honor Society, a dark comedy about prestige-obsessed high school students, opens with familiar faces of pop feminism: Beyoncé and Billie Eilish. They’re the faces Honor Rose (the Spider-man movies’ Angourie Rice) sees on her wall as she undergoes her lengthy morning routine before senior year – white strips for her teeth, jade roll on her face, straightener on her blonde bob. The montage recalls the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amq4kBfbqL8\">opening scene</a> of Booksmart, another sharp film about overachieving teenage girls. But whereas Booksmart’s ambitious protagonists sincerely worshipped RBG, Michelle Obama and Gloria Steinem with contempt for the less driven (“fuck those losers, fuck them in their stupid fucking faces,” is the mantra Beanie Feldstein’s Molly listens to before school), Honor’s posters are proudly utilitarian, her attitude pure disdain. “They’re all bullshit,” she says to us, “but these are the gods of my people, so I must worship them.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/29/vengeance-review-bj-novak-ambitious-but-overstuffed-satire\">Vengeance review – BJ Novak’s ambitious but overstuffed satire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s a surprising, deliciously delusional opener that underscores this deceptively cutting, darker than you’d expect film on the prestige-obsessed, directed by Oran Zegman in her feature-length debut. A senior in a small town in what could be anywhere in the north-east, Honor has one goal for high school – to get out of it – and one idol only: Harvard, whose acceptance rate (4.6%) she knows off-hand. Honor looks the part of the all-around good girl beloved by admissions committees – she founded the karate club, edits the student newspaper, captains the volleyball team, runs a food bank for the less fortunate, all while keeping her grades up.</p> <p>She also breaks the fourth wall, a la Fleabag, an overused trope of late which fortunately works here because we learn how everything, every blown kiss to her basic friends Emma (Avery Konrad) and Talia (Kelcey Mawema) or polite smile, is a chameleonic act in service to her singular obsession with Harvard. What could be a tiring focus on neuroticism becomes, in David A Goodman’s barb-laden script and Zegman’s slick direction, a refreshing portrait of a real, if overrepresented, American phenomenon – ruthless competition to get into elite universities – in comical isolation. It is enjoyable to have a female protagonist acknowledge that her sole motivation is to make other people envious, to see the ideal of being well-rounded made so villainous.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4z67u7TNFY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L4z67u7TNFY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There’s an element of Emerald Fennell’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/05/promising-young-woman-metoo-revenge-carey-mulligan\">Promising Young Woman</a> here, as Honor’s every move, like Carey Mulligan’s Cassie, derives from a demented, singular obsession (a satirical fixation with prestige as a cure-all, instead of #MeToo revenge). Both films cast Christopher Mintz-Plasse as a good-seeming, ultimately sinister guy – here, as Honor’s leery guidance counselor who picks one student per year to recommend to his best friend, a Harvard alum.</p> <p>When Honor learns that she’s one of four students in the running for his recommendation, she furiously schemes to ruin her rivals’ grades with a ludicrously complicated plan, the details of which she relishes for us, her audience. Said plan, which is mostly fun to watch Rice unfold, involves joining theater club, staging friendless weirdo Kennedy’s (Amy Keum) Tudor-themed play, casting sweet, closeted jock Travis (Armani Jackson) and seducing Michael Dipnicky (Stranger Things’s Gaten Matarazzo), a bullied nerd and her chemistry lab partner.</p> <p>The taut, excellent first half of the film sees Honor judging everything around her with ice-cold scorn. Her English teacher, an early-70s Smith graduate who marched for the ERA, is cautionary tale of pitiable hope. The school’s lacrosse coach, a formerly young and buff scholarship player at Syracuse, is now pitiably middle-aged and (gag) cares about his small-time job. Michael is an inexperienced boy “fantasizing about some porn star showing up and teaching him where to put it”. She should maybe feel bad about Kennedy’s ostracism, but “as I always say”, she notes, slamming her locker, “you can’t spell sympathetic without pathetic”.</p> <p>The wobblier second half, in which Honor begins to feel for the unpretentious Michael despite herself and her numerous spinning plates fall in unexpected directions, struggles to balance the cut glass of the first with Honor’s burgeoning personhood. Rice, who held her own as Kate Winslet’s daughter in Mare of Easttown, resembles Amy Adams’s wide-eyed vulnerability shot through with the relentless, overachieving perkiness of Election-era Reese Witherspoon; she’s convincing in every scene.</p> <p>But the final third of the film requires Honor to go from borderline sociopathic to seemingly sincere – a huge stretch for any character, even one as interestingly layered as Honor. A dark twist in the final act, though surprising, rocks the boat, and Honor Society struggles to stick the landing and thread the needle between sour and sweet, campy and sincere.</p> <p>The ending chorus of conclusions wraps up a bit too neatly, though that doesn’t invalidate the enjoyably deranged ride before. It’s perhaps foreseeable that Honor Society would ultimately conclude on the note that, hey, prestige isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be, but the twisted, fanged journey to that truth is a welcome surprise.</p> <ul> <li><p>Honor Society is available on Paramount Plus in the UK and US</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/29/premier-league-club-say-player-facing-allegations-is-available-for-selection","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T18:07:14Z","webTitle":"Premier League club say player facing rape allegations is available for selection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/premier-league-club-say-player-facing-allegations-is-available-for-selection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/29/premier-league-club-say-player-facing-allegations-is-available-for-selection","fields":{"headline":"Premier League club say player facing rape allegations is available for selection","trailText":"The Premier League club whose player has been the subject of three rape allegations has confirmed that it will continue to select him for first-team duty","byline":"Nick Ames","body":"<p>The Premier League club whose player has been the subject of three rape allegations has confirmed that it will continue to select him for first-team duty until further notice.</p> \n<p>A police investigation into one of those allegations was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/28/premier-league-footballer-has-one-allegation-dropped-by-met-police-bail-extended\">dropped on Thursday</a> after the Metropolitan Police confirmed they would not be taking action regarding an alleged offence in June 2021.

<strong>Russia</strong> and see room for the central bank to continue cutting rates as it tries to blunt the impact of major sanctions, a Reuters poll suggested on Friday. <br> </p> \n  <p>Russia’s economic landscape changed drastically after Moscow invaded its neighbour <strong>Ukraine</strong> in February, triggering sweeping western restrictions on its energy and financial sectors.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>The average forecast among 17 analysts polled in late July suggested the Russian economy was on track to shrink by 5% this year, after a similar poll in June had predicted a contraction of 7.1%. <br> </p> \n  <p>Analysts’ forecasts are becoming less pessimistic, although new data published this week showed industrial output, real disposable incomes and retail sales all fell in year-on-year terms in June, although the unemployment rate stayed at a record low. <br> </p> \n  <p>The economy ministry in April said gross domestic product could fall by more than 12% this year, in what would have been the biggest contraction since the mid-1990s, but forecasts have softened since then as Russia pushes back against restrictions. <br> </p> \n  <p>Primarily, the rouble soared to over seven-year highs in late June, supported by capital controls Moscow introduced in response to sanctions, but Russia is also benefiting from skyrocketing prices for commodity exports, while the Russian economy is boosted by falling imports. <br> </p> \n  <p>But the currency is seen as weakening in coming months as the government is expected to take steps to curb its strength. <br tabindex=\"-1\"> </p> \n  <p>The rouble is expected to trade at 75.00 against the dollar in a year from now, according to the poll, compared with a rate of 75.73 predicted by analysts in late June. Friday’s official rate was at 60.20 roubles per dollar. <br> </p> \n  <p>Inflation, one of the key concerns among Russian households, is expected to accelerate to 13.4%, from 8.4% in 2021, according to the poll, but below last month’s expectations of a 14.5% annual consumer prices increase, Reuters reports.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T16:15:56.465Z\">at 5.15pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e3fd148f08c0014732722b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T15:32:25.510Z\">4.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is a video from Sky News showing Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> at the port of <strong>Chornomorsk</strong> in the <strong>Odesa</strong> region on Friday, where vessels loaded with grain are ready to resume export to the world.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1553035116145811456\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to the Black Sea port of Chornomorsk in the Odesa region as Kyiv hopes to begin exporting grain.<br><br>Ukraine live updates: <a href=\"https://t.co/X3flQUk9BR\">https://t.co/X3flQUk9BR</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jmXGV2FNoV\">pic.twitter.com/jmXGV2FNoV</a></p>— Sky News (@SkyNews) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1553035116145811456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 29, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T15:43:25.388Z\">at 4.43pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e3f4178f08af33ff4a3959\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T15:23:03.881Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>British</strong> defence ministry has published its daily intelligence update on military positions on the battlefield in <strong>Ukraine</strong>.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1552988039680561153\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is continuing. <br> <br>The map below is the latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 29 July 2022<br> <br>Find out more about the UK government's response: <a href=\"https://t.co/elQG6o2bAt\">https://t.co/elQG6o2bAt</a><br><br>🇺🇦 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StandWithUkraine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StandWithUkraine</a> 🇺🇦 <a href=\"https://t.co/CiUXpcjNNL\">pic.twitter.com/CiUXpcjNNL</a></p>— Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1552988039680561153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 29, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e3f4f48f08730a1f7f3c47\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T14:58:27.373Z\">3.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>29 wounded <strong>Ukrainian</strong> servicepeople, accompanied by family members, have arrived on a special medical train in the southern Polish city of <strong>Krak</strong><strong>ó</strong><strong>w</strong>.</p> \n  <p>They will receive treatment or attend rehabilitation programmess in Polish hospitals.</p> \n  <p>According to the state news agency Polish Radio, 15 wounded servicemen were taken to hospitals in Kraków and the surrounding area.

It has taken huge numbers of losses and casualties”.</p> \n  <p>In his opinion, he said Russia was “certainly not able to occupy the country. They may be able to carry on killing indiscriminately and destroying as they go, but that is not a victory”.</p> \n  <p>“Putin hasn’t changed from his desire to occupy the whole of Ukraine, take Kyiv and Odesa,” he said, adding: “But his army has been effectively crippled by huge amounts of losses. Over 25,000 dead. Maybe twice as many injured.”</p> \n  <p>He likened the current tactics to the first world war, saying: “When I talk about meat grinder, which is what they’re doing, is that they are resorting to a sort of Soviet tactic of just a massive Russian meat grinder moving very slowly metres, not miles, a day, in some parts. </p> \n  <p>“And in the top of the meat grinder they’re shoving in, and this is the cruelty of that system, they are recruiting from the poorest districts in Russia, and the ethnic minorities, and they are using mercenaries, shoving these people in with very little regard to the outcome, grinding forward.”</p> \n  <p>He said that longer-range western weapons were “now having a material effect”, and the Russians “are operating their army at roughly about 40-to-50% combat effective.”</p> \n  <p>Wallace said the Ukrainian attack on bridges, which appears to have had an impact on the ability to resupply troops in Kherson north of the River Dnieper, had put them “in a very difficult spot” and left the Russians “in a defensive position” in the south.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T09:12:29.346Z\">at 10.12am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e38d358f08af33ff4a3379\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T07:37:05.688Z\">8.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"984c0c8e3d419b4309c96249c41e7f5ae6824195\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/984c0c8e3d419b4309c96249c41e7f5ae6824195/0_0_1280_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A residential house burns after a Russian military strike in the town of Bakhmut.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A residential house burns after a Russian military strike in the town of Bakhmut.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donetsk Regional Military Administration/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2769c58f8bda74b4c609141c4a7d3e714be4693\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2769c58f8bda74b4c609141c4a7d3e714be4693/0_0_8640_5760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medic volunteer Nataliia Voronkova, top right, gives a medical tactical training session to soldiers in a bomb shelter as air raid sirens go off, in Dobropillya, eastern Ukraine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medic volunteer Nataliia Voronkova, top right, gives a medical tactical training session to soldiers in a bomb shelter as air raid sirens go off, in Dobropillya, eastern Ukraine.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nariman El-Mofty/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8f961dff751b4fdb9b0aac4a695550fcdac00aa\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8f961dff751b4fdb9b0aac4a695550fcdac00aa/0_0_8024_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Ukrainian farmer stops for a cigarette, with an abandoned Russian APC nearby, on a field near the village of Mala Rogan, Kharkiv region.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Ukrainian farmer stops for a cigarette, with an abandoned Russian APC nearby, on a field near the village of Mala Rogan, Kharkiv region.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e3864f8f08c00147326b4d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T07:05:07.671Z\">8.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Oleksandr Syenkevych</strong>, the mayor of <strong>Mykolaiv</strong>, has just posted to Telegram to say that there has been “the arrival of cluster shells in one of Mykolaiv’s districts”. “There are victims.

The 35-year-old has of late had the demeanour of the demob-happy after 15 years in F1, having secured 53 wins, behind only Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton.</p> <p>He has had a carefree air that suggested F1 had ceased being the centre of his universe. Indeed as he grew his hair out and began sporting a tousled beard there was more than a little of the LA Woman-period Jim Morrison relaxed, swagger to him. Without Mr Mojo’s extra pounds of course.</p> <p>There had been statements of his increasing internal conflict in his feelings towards F1 and its contribution to the climate emergency, not least in admitting he felt like a hypocrite on the BBC’s Question Time.</p> <p>This was no simple Damascene conversion. He had devoted his life to F1, as driver, fan and scholar. Few could name all of F1’s champions. Vettel could, right back to the first, Giuseppe Farina in 1950. Yet his commitment to environmental issues had come to play increasingly heavily on his mind. He cited this, alongside a desire to spend more time with his family, as one of the reasons to call it a day.</p> <p>He will leave a legacy as, alongside Hamilton, one of the drivers that stood up to be counted, on racism, diversity, LGBTQ+ rights and the climate emergency. Yet while this activism has perhaps defined the latter part of his career, he burned brightest on track, a remarkable talent. The four titles with Red Bull between 2010 and 2013 displayed a dominance that had been off-putting for some as was the exultant pointing of his finger to indicate the number one on victory, the exuberance of youth, pumped up by success and adrenaline.</p> <p>Yet his racing career was really defined by being of two halves, the titles a peak he thought he could recapture, yet never did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7667348938b7b31b2409a505dec87ad559822109\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7667348938b7b31b2409a505dec87ad559822109/0_82_4428_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastian Vettel greets supporters in Hungary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vettel is acclaimed across the paddock and will be missed after his retirement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Szilagyi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He turned in some superb performances, not least his debut win in the wet at Monza in 2008 for Toro Rosso, outperforming his car to deliver notice of an immense talent. Similarly his victory in India in 2013, scything through the field, was a demonstration of relentless, precision driving. At Monza in 2011 he won having passed Fernando Alonso round the outside of the Curva Grande, putting two wheels on the grass to do so. It was breathtaking and put paid to suggestions he was a flat-track bully who could dictate only from the front.</p> <p>He could be ruthless, not least when passing teammate Mark Webber at Malaysia in 2013, disobeying team orders to do so in the “Multi-21” incident and petulant too as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/25/lewis-hamilton-sebastian-vettel-sort-face-to-face-azerbaijan-grand-prix-formula-one-motor-sport\" title=\"\">ramming Hamilton in Baku</a> proved in 2017.</p> <p>All too human then, as was demonstrated when the second half of his career proved disappointing and questions were raised about his ability to challenge when not in a dominant car. He had mastered the Red Bull and its blown diffuser, adjusting his style to devastating effect but when regulation changes removed them in 2014 he struggled.</p> <p>Switching to Ferrari and in the heat of battle with Hamilton, he was also found wanting. Crashing out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/23/german-grand-prix-best-win-career-lewis-hamilton\" title=\"\">while leading at Germany in 2018</a> midway through a fierce title fight, while the British driver pressured him into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/09/lewis-hamilton-canadian-grand-prix-vettel-penalty\" title=\"\">an error at Canada in 2019</a> that cost him a win as did his misjudgment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/17/lewis-hamilton-wins-singapore-gp-vettel-crashes#:~:text=Lewis%20Hamilton%20wins%20Singapore%20Grand,Formula%20One%202017%20%7C%20The%20Guardian\" title=\"\">in crashing at Singapore in 2017</a>. He enjoyed arguably the better car over Hamilton for much of 2017 and 2018 but the seven-time champion came out on top in both.</p> <p>That he is still held in such regard as a person is what stands out. His commitment to making a difference, as well as his sense of sportsmanship, was acclaimed across the paddock, not least by Hamilton, a rival who became a friend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\">  <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“He was incredibly quick, very, very intelligent,” Hamilton said. “Just a great all-round competitor.

In the afternoon session Charles Leclerc was quickest for Ferrari, with McLaren’s Lando Norris in second. Verstappen was fourth, with Hamilton 11th and his Mercedes teammate George Russell in eighth.

The action generated more heat and headlines than anything triggered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/25/liz-truss-pledges-crackdown-on-unions-but-is-accused-of-tory-fantasy\" title=\"\">Liz Truss’s</a> belligerent pledge this week to impose new legal restrictions on public sector strike action, or <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/07/26/prescription-end-rail-strike-chaos/\" title=\"\">Grant Shapps’</a> instant plan of 16 different measures that would emasculate unions’ rights to strike at all.</p> <p>There are several lessons here, but the main one is that the Conservatives are not being held to proper account for the spiralling effects of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/29/400-in-energy-bill-discounts-to-go-to-all-households-in-england-scotland-and-wales\" title=\"\">squeeze on living standards</a> over which they are presiding. They, not Labour, are the government. They, not Labour, set public sector pay policy. They have the formal power to change public finance rules. They also have the informal authority to bring pressure on the two sides to negotiate a settlement. As guardians of the public interest, if nothing else, the government should also avoid unnecessarily provoking the dispute or becoming a protagonist.</p> <p>Instead, ministers have gone out of their way to <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/transport-secretary-blocking-negotiations-could-end-rail-dispute-says-tuc\" title=\"\">keep the disputes going</a> while doing nothing to resolve them. They have done this for partisan reasons, judging that if the strikes become more bitter, they can turn the issue against Labour, rather than acting as a government representing the public interest for a fair settlement and reliable services. This week’s interventions by Ms Truss are perhaps a grim foretaste of the deliberately divisive way in which she would govern if she wins the Conservative leadership. Mr Shapps’s <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/tuc-grant-shapps-proposals-are-attack-fundamental-right-strike\" title=\"\">shabby suggestions</a> are equally opportunist. He should be trying to pour water not petrol on the rail dispute.</p> <p>The turmoil surrounding the ousting of Boris Johnson and the contest to replace him is no excuse for this neglect. The problem is underlying. Ever since the Margaret Thatcher era, the Tory party has felt empowered to ignore organised labour. This is no longer easy when inflation is gouging so deeply into workers’ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/cost-of-living-crisis\" title=\"\">living standards</a>. Under Theresa May, there was some effort to engage more practically with both sides of industry, but the more the Tory party has turned to the right, as it is doing at the moment, the more anti-union the party has again become. If nothing else, this stupidly subverts the government’s specious claims to be serious about tackling Britain’s poor productivity and low growth.</p> <p>None of this, however, can be any comfort to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/labour-party-cost-of-living-keir-starmer-striking-workers\" title=\"\">Labour</a>. Mr Starmer is entitled to play a long game towards the next election. But Britain has now reached the point in the political cycle where voters need to know a lot more about why Labour should be worth supporting. We know what Labour is against. Mr Starmer must do more to explain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/post-corbyn-vision-labour-keir-starmer-leadership\" title=\"\">what Labour is for</a>. This goes far beyond symbolic gestures such as sacking a junior spokesperson. Instead, it calls for an effective programme to grow the economy and bring businesses and workforces together. The central task for the coming weeks and months is to face directly into the brutality of the cost of living crisis, in the way that members of civil society, as Martin Lewis, Jack Monroe and Marcus Rashford have done, but which Labour’s team has not yet emulated, let alone led.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2022/jul/29/vengeance-review-bj-novak-ambitious-but-overstuffed-satire","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T17:29:06Z","webTitle":"Vengeance review – BJ Novak’s ambitious but overstuffed satire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/29/vengeance-review-bj-novak-ambitious-but-overstuffed-satire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/jul/29/vengeance-review-bj-novak-ambitious-but-overstuffed-satire","fields":{"headline":"Vengeance review – BJ Novak’s ambitious but overstuffed satire","trailText":"The Office alum’s directorial debut has some flashes of wit and an impressive desire to upend expectations but also suffers from a smug tone and a listless lead performance","byline":"Benjamin Lee","body":"<p>Positioning himself as the satirist we both want and need right now, the ex-Office actor and writer BJ Novak certainly deserves points for his chutzpah.

It’s not quite as scattershot as his aforementioned show but one still wishes he’d thrown something out to lighten the load, an unwieldy film that never quite sinks but only just keeps its head above water. It’s a directorial debut and very much feels like it, the work of someone desperate to show us both sizzle reel and mission statement but the aim is too high and so the result is less “here’s what I can do” and more “here’s what I shouldn’t try to do”.</p> <p>Novak plays an obnoxious New York journalist called Ben, shown in the first scene drinking on the roof of Dumbo House with his equally obnoxious friend, played by the singer John Mayer. In a too-obvious scene-setter, the pair share inane, self-assured observations about life, agreeing with each other on everything (“100%,” they keep chanting), an early sign that Novak prefers a hammer to the face when a tap on the shoulder would do. He then pitches a podcast to a nearby producer (Issa Rae) who tells him that he needs to be less thesis, more story and less head, more heart (advice that Novak himself would be smart to remember).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GT1jFsNnPw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1GT1jFsNnPw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>His search for something more substantial coincides with a strange call: his girlfriend is dead. Except he doesn’t have a girlfriend. Instead, the brother of a woman he hooked up with a few times is under the impression that they were more committed than they were and so he finds himself, with poorly justified reasoning, travelling to a small town in Texas to attend the funeral and meet her family. He then comes upon an idea, maybe trying to find out how she died could be the podcast pitch he’s been looking for.</p> <p>It’s a bells-and-whistles update of the classic “cold-hearted city slicker is initially repelled but ultimately charmed by the small town he gets stuck in” comedy, Doc Hollywood with Twitter jokes. Novak, the Harvard graduate son of a celebrity memoir author, is hyper-aware of how someone like himself could easily write a patronising and untethered version of this story and so goes to great lengths to subvert expectations. The locals (including Ashton Kutcher, Boyd Holbrook, Succession’s J Smith-Cameron and the funny but underused Disney star Dove Cameron) are not the simplistic hicks his character thinks they will be (they know what Raya is!) and so we get a learning exercise about avoiding snap judgments. But these lessons aren’t quite as surprising and refreshing as he seems to think they are. Updating an age-old fish out of water setup such as this with the internet as an obvious influence makes the world immediately that much smaller and Novak’s character explaining what a writer does and what a magazine is pushes the culture clash into cartoonish territory. As he shifts from comedy to thriller, with a rather banal crime plot taking centre stage, I’m not quite sure if Novak knows what he wants to say with a film that clearly, desperately wants to say something.</p> <p>Given the brutal boot camp training that is being in a network sitcom writers room for many years, it’s no surprise that Novak’s dialogue has a crisp efficiency to it and there are enough amusing moments to make one wish he would lower his sights a tad and try making something that’s more situation-based comedy and less of-the-moment satire. As a director, he’s mostly anonymous and as an actor, he’s rather listless, casting himself as the lead when he’s not quite got the natural charisma or, as things get weightier, dramatic chops for it.</p> <p>When a writer-director of some undeniable talent throws so much at the wall, it’s inevitable that elements will stick and in Vengeance, there’s just about enough to make us curious to see what happens when Novak learns to tighten his focus. Vengeance is less the film we need right now and more the one he thinks we do but hopefully next time, he’ll figure out how to make something we want instead.</p> <ul> <li><p>Vengeance is now out in US cinemas and in the UK on 7 October</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2022/jul/29/so-much-more-stuff-to-know-why-brain-of-britain-has-got-so-much-harder","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T17:27:59Z","webTitle":"‘So much more stuff to know’: why Brain of Britain has got much harder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/29/so-much-more-stuff-to-know-why-brain-of-britain-has-got-so-much-harder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/jul/29/so-much-more-stuff-to-know-why-brain-of-britain-has-got-so-much-harder","fields":{"headline":"‘So much more stuff to know’: why Brain of Britain has got much harder","trailText":"It’s not that Britons are becoming less intelligent, it’s that the quiz canon has expanded, say top quizzers","byline":"Esther Addley","body":"<p>As if everything wasn’t bad enough, now we’re all getting stupider.

Whether with revision or quizzing, the more you expose yourself to things from different angles, the more likely they are to stay in your long-term memory.”</p> <p>It can be treacherous to dip a toe into the psychology of memory, where one can find a study to back up any point one might wish to make about <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/24713-humans-losing-intelligence.html\">how</a> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1570677X09000057?via%3Dihub\">brainy</a> or <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/its-official-humans-are-getting-dumber-with-every-passing-day/articleshow/70175145.cms\">thick</a> we are progressively becoming. Much of this turns on how we define intelligence, notes the chartered psychologist and writer<a href=\"https://www.draudreyt.com/aboutaudrey\"> Audrey Tang</a>, a measure that still frequently relies on early 20th-century IQ theories that <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/iq-tests-are-fundamentally-flawed-and-using-them-alone-to-measure-intelligence-is-a-fallacy-study-finds-8425911.html\">many dispute</a>.</p> <p>IQ scores, such as BMI measurements and personality-type tests, can be useful tools, but are also necessarily limiting, says Tang. “You then have a very reductive approach to [the questions of] what is intelligence? And who gets the opportunities? And how might society be run?”</p> <p>Some may train themselves to remember lots of facts – “It’s a lot of work to be really, really good at general knowledge,” says Allen. Others, notes Tang, “use modern technology as a substitute for our memory. We don’t need to remember something because we can Google it – and then there’s no motivation to learn anything else”.</p> <p>The good news, according to <a href=\"http://www.lindablair.co.uk/index.html\">Linda Blair</a>, a practising psychologist and author based in Bath, is that we can, indeed, get better at remembering. She <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.070039597\">cites a study</a> which showed that the brains of London taxi drivers, who undertake extensive training to learn the streetmap of the city in detail, were different to those of a control sample. “We can change our brains in adult life. We don’t put effort into remembering things. And that’s all it takes – effort.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/momfluencers-should-make-room-for-the-reality-of-parenting","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T17:25:04Z","webTitle":"‘Momfluencers’ should make room for the reality of parenting | Letters ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/momfluencers-should-make-room-for-the-reality-of-parenting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/momfluencers-should-make-room-for-the-reality-of-parenting","fields":{"headline":"‘Momfluencers’ should make room for the reality of parenting","trailText":"Letters:<strong> Rosie Weir </strong>says we need to stop fetishising the ‘perfect mother’; <strong>Laura Cartwright</strong> finds that humour helps.

I think that mothers in general would really benefit from being able to just admit that it’s hard to be a mum.</p> <p>My son has just started crawling, so my days are now spent chasing him around the house, the housework is not done and I am exhausted. We need to stop fetishising the “perfect mother”, start celebrating every mother, and make it known that it is always OK to ask for help.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Rosie Weir</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Carrickfergus, County Antrim</em></p> <p>• I am the mother of two children, aged two and a half and 15 months, and I’m in my early 40s. Between lockdowns, after my first was born and I had just gone back to work, I asked my doctor, who also had a young child, how she had felt and managed when she went back to work. “I didn’t kill anyone, so I figured I was doing OK,” she semi-joked.</p> <p>For me, sleep is like a distant memory. The house is a mess, with children’s stuff everywhere. There are food stains all over the dining room wall, red pen scribbles on the door and walls around the airing cupboard, and crayon lines crisscrossing the TV, which appear to be etched into the glass.</p> <p>I often pity these people who put such a high value on making themselves and their lives look perfect. Life isn’t perfect, and that’s what makes it amazing. Perhaps the best thing to do when browsing Instagram and seeing a perfect picture of a mother and child is to put your phone down and go and play with your child, or look at them sleeping, and think how perfect they are to you.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• While I agree with Rhiannon’s article that social media can often represent an idealised and heavily filtered version of motherhood that bears little resemblance to reality, I do think this is starting to change. Sophie McCartney’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tiredandtested/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram posts</a> – under the name tiredandtested – were a beacon of light and humour for me in those dark days of lockdown when I was at breaking point. Her “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmenY9sI9bk\" title=\"\">I can’t teach this</a>” parody of the MC Hammer classic had me crying. It was heartening to see that she was right there in the midst of this hell with her own kids, and so were all the other mums who were commenting. Parenting is a joy and a privilege, and none of us would change it for the world, but sometimes it is bloody hard work.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Laura Cartwright</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Horsforth, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>• Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett’s article reminded me of the incalculable debt of gratitude that I and many other mothers owe to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/sep/08/guardianobituaries.health\" title=\"\">Erna Wright</a>. Her wonderfully commonsense books The New Childbirth (1964) and The New Childhood (1972) dispelled ignorance, myths and fear, enabling women to understand what was happening to their bodies and to their small children, and how to cope with those baffling phenomena. They were beacons of enlightenment and liberation, far from being the “secondhand books, at least one of which would end up thrown across the room” that Rhiannon’s mother recalls.

Banned by the Football Association until 1970, women’s football occupied a dismal, neglected space at the very margins of the nation’s sporting existence.</p> <p>Has any other sport come so far so quickly? On Sunday, 90,000 supporters will pack Wembley to watch the Lionesses play Germany. As with all the preceding games, the Euro 2022 final will be shown live on the BBC and the contest will be viewed around the world. Judging by the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/england-womens-football-david-beckham-b2132451.html\" title=\"\">9.3 million</a> who tuned in to England’s semi-final against Sweden, it may well be the most-watched TV broadcast of the year.</p> <p>Relishing affordable ticket prices, crowds have <a href=\"https://www.uefa.com/news/0276-15748cb0ba74-f342af5f57b8-1000--attendance-record-smashed/\" title=\"\">flocked</a> to the matches in record numbers. Stadiums have been filled with a new and more diverse type of football audience, significantly younger and far more female. The elan and technical prowess of players such as Alessia Russo – whose goalscoring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jul/27/alessia-russo-banished-all-fear-with-the-cheeky-backheel-that-foxed-sweden\" title=\"\">backheel</a> encapsulated the fearlessness of this England team – has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqTcZTpSj_s\" title=\"\">captivated</a> a generation of girls, giving them national heroines to adore and dream of emulating. This has been a summer in which women’s football has written itself indelibly into the national story, achieving a distinct identity and enormous popularity on its own terms.</p> <p>The challenge now, whatever happens on Sunday, will be to translate a breakthrough moment into progress in the club game and at the grassroots. Last year’s landmark TV <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/mar/22/a-huge-step-forward-wsl-announces-record-breaking-deal-with-bbc-and-sky\" title=\"\">deal</a> with the BBC and Sky Sports significantly raised the profile of the Women’s Super League, but crowds remain modest and have not returned to pre-Covid levels. Better promotion would help, and WSL teams should be enabled to play regularly rather than only occasionally at their respective men’s grounds. A growing sport <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/sep/07/wsl-arsenal-tottenham-everton-should-keep-staging-games-at-mens-stadiums-despite-small-crowds\" title=\"\">needs</a> the kind of affirmation and status that comes through being showcased at venues such as Old Trafford or the Emirates stadium.</p> <p>More fundamentally, women’s football needs to get on to the curriculum. All girls between five and 18 should get the chance to play at school. Fewer than half of secondary schools currently provide this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/alessia-russo-lionesses-instantly-iconic-backheel-goal-catalyst-for-more-euro-2022\" title=\"\">option</a>, which feels like a hangover from another age. The more girls play, the wider and more diverse the talent pool of the female game will become. From a public health perspective, using the profile and charisma of the Lionesses to promote sport and physical activity for girls should be a no-brainer. The government appears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/starmer-calls-for-a-bank-holiday-if-england-win-womens-euro-2022-final#:~:text=The%20country%20should%20get%20an,final%2C%20Keir%20Starmer%20has%20said.\" title=\"\">reluctant</a> to grant the nation a bank holiday in the event of an England victory on Sunday. A better tribute would be to give schools the resources to employ and train up female football specialists in PE departments.</p> <p>A tournament as thrilling as this one has been deserves to leave a legacy. This weekend, however, is all about the fierce urgency of now. Germany present a familiar obstacle to English footballing ambition, and their impressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/27/germany-france-womens-euro-2022-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">centre-forward</a>, Alexandra Popp, is in formidable form. In 1984, England’s women lost their final to Sweden on penalties. The vast majority at Wembley will be yearning for a different outcome this time – one that would deliver England’s first international football trophy since 1966. But irrespective of whether football “comes home” or not, women’s football has made itself at home in our lives this summer. In that sense, the Lionesses have already won.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/29/losing-faith-in-bishops-over-lgbtq-rights-and-their-lack-of-empathy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T17:24:43Z","webTitle":"Losing faith in bishops over LGBTQ+ rights and their lack of empathy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/losing-faith-in-bishops-over-lgbtq-rights-and-their-lack-of-empathy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/29/losing-faith-in-bishops-over-lgbtq-rights-and-their-lack-of-empathy","fields":{"headline":"Losing faith in bishops over LGBTQ+ rights and their lack of empathy","trailText":"<strong>Letters: Andrew Foreshew-Cain </strong>and <strong>Canon Dr Paul Oestreicher</strong> on Anglicanism’s culture war around sexuality","byline":"Letters","body":"<p>Though I welcome the changes to the text of the Lambeth conference “call on human dignity”, removing the offensive and wrong-headed attempt to reaffirm a resolution from 1998 and its homophobic attitudes towards LGBTQIA+ people and our relationships, I am left distressed and bruised, like so many faithful members of the Church of England (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/justin-welby-forced-to-allow-anglican-bishops-to-reject-statement-on-sexuality\" title=\"\">Justin Welby forced to allow Anglican bishops to reject statement on sexuality, 26 July</a>).</p> <p>For years we have listened to our bishops apologise for the hurt caused by the C of E’s stance, and lived in hope as we have worked our slow way through a process of “shared conversations” and most recently the Living in Love and Faith project. We have been promised that our voices would be heard, that all people are equally valued and that we have a secure place in the C of E as baptised and faithful followers of Christ.</p> <p>All human relationships, both personal and ecclesial, are based on trust – and trust requires honesty, openness and truthfulness. None of these are evident in the recent actions stemming from Lambeth as the car crash of recent days has unfolded. There remain significant questions about how the previous wording was approved and whether the archbishops knew in advance. None of the responses from Lambeth have addressed these pressing questions, and it is hard to see how trust can be restored unless some answers are given.</p> <p>But what is perhaps worse, and a sign of a deep malaise at the heart of the church, is that the vast majority of bishops in the C of E have remained silent, and those few who have commented have studiously avoided any apology or humility in recognising the hurt caused and the damage done. I find it deeply depressing and yet sadly familiar that those who lead the church are so incapable of genuine human expressions of pastoral care. I love the Church of England; in its parishes and communities there are vast resources of kindness, care and compassion.

In fact he does better than that. In his new book Reconciliation, he puts forward his conviction that Christians need not be ashamed of their profound differences but must learn to live and work together in reconciled diversity – to differ well. This is certainly not just about sexual ethics in a world threatened by wars, mass poverty and our spoliation of nature.</p> <p>A few weeks after the Anglican bishops meet in Canterbury, the next assembly of the World Council of Churches will meet in Germany in the midst of bitter conflict.

Welsh involves less tongue-twisting than Gaelic and is spelled phonetically; Jenny and her compatriots might find that it is easier to learn as a second language, and thereby gain access to its rich poetry and prose. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>John Edmondson</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Holywell, Flintshire</em></p> <p><strong>• <em>Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In an <a href=\"https://www.cage.ngo/from-former-guantanamo-prisoners-to-jihad-rehab\">open letter</a>, the men express their “discomfort with the content of the film and its methods of production.”</p> <p>The letter was published after the film <a href=\"https://docedge.nz/festival22/film/the-unredacted/\">was screened</a> at the Doc Edge festival in New Zealand under a new name, The UnRedacted. “Changing the title of the film doesn’t change its harmful narrative or lazy stereotyping,” says Moazzam Begg, a former prisoner and director of the Cage advocacy group. “Following widespread criticism, the team behind Jihad Rehab had an opportunity to listen and learn. Yet this has been met with little corrective action or even acknowledgment.”</p> <p>Filmed over several years, Jihad Rehab follows four ex-Guantánamo inmates, who are detained at a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudiarabia0809web.pdf\">rehabilitation centre</a> in Saudi Arabia. Despite not being convicted of any terror charges, the film introduces each of the men alongside a list of alleged crimes that were used to detain them without trial in Guantánamo for over a decade.</p> <p>The film was condemned after its Sundance premiere earlier this year, which resulted in two Sundance staffers <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2022/02/sundance-institute-staffers-resign-jihad-rehab-1234697522/\">resigning</a> in protest and a <a href=\"https://www.forkfilms.com/jihad-rehab-letter/\">public apology</a> from Abigail Disney, the film’s executive producer, as well <a href=\"https://www.sundance.org/blogs/a-note-from-joana-vicente-and-tabitha-jackson/\">as the festival itself</a>. In her apology, Disney said she regrets not insisting “on a full fact-checking process to ensure that the highest standards of accuracy were being met” and that the film’s interviewees “cannot freely consent to anything in a carceral system, particularly one in a notoriously violent dictatorship”. </p> <p>Critics have highlighted the ethics of interviewing the men after they have spent nearly half their lives at Guantánamo, where they faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/20/guantanamo-psychologists-cia-torture-program-testify\">physical and psychological torture</a>. One of the men still talks with his hands together as if they are in handcuffs. Jihad Rehab has also been criticised over its failure to dispel offensive stereotypes of Muslim men – and more serious claims that it jeopardises the safety and security of its subjects. </p> <p>Mohammed Al-Hamiri, one of the men featured in the film, told the Guardian that he wasn’t aware the film would be accessible internationally and only found out that it had been made available online after <a href=\"https://link/%20to%20https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/jihad-rehab/61ae07956c1de50b88c80c58\">its showing at Sundance</a>. “My life is already difficult but this film poses a serious threat to my life and that of my family,” said Al-Hamiri. Another man said that he had explicitly told the film-maker that he did not want to be featured in the film but his wishes had been disregarded. The film’s director Meg Smaker says that all the participants in the film signed consent documents and denied that the men expressed any fears in correspondence with her.</p> <p>After the film’s premiere, Smaker teamed up with FAIR (Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism) to <a href=\"https://fairforall.substack.com/p/fair-news-an-evening-with-bari-weiss\">argue</a> that her film is being targeted for being directed by a white non-Muslim woman; they claim they are standing up for free expression and against those trying to censor it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The interrogation-like interviewing and presumption of guilt is evocative of what we had to endure every single day</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/global/jihad-rehab-documentary-criticism-sundance-1235166635/\">In an interview with Variety</a>, Smaker said that Jihad Rehab seeks to humanise the men by allowing them to tell their side of the story. In the film, she asks: “Do you think you’re a good person or a bad person?” Yet the presumption of the men’s guilt is never in question. “Would you commit jihad <em>again?</em>”<em> </em>The line of questioning clearly upsets the men; at one point one gets up and leaves – and refuses any further contact with the film-maker.</p> <p>Mansoor Adayfi, who signed the open letter, says Smaker’s film was distressing for him to watch and brought back painful memories. “The interrogation-like interviewing and presumption of guilt is evocative of what we had to endure every single day,” says Adayfi. “The film is a stark reminder that even as free men, we are never truly free from the shackles of Guantánamo.”</p> <p>Human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith told the Guardian that he spoke with Smaker directly but felt his concerns were dismissed: “She appeared very defensive, although she admitted that elements of her film could put one of the men’s lives in jeopardy.” Smaker denies she made such comments.</p> <p>Smith added that he was shocked that Smaker’s team hadn’t engaged with any of the men’s lawyers regarding their involvement in the film. He said he feared that such an approach was “manifestly unethical”.</p> <p> Critics also suggest that Smaker’s questions are designed to invite criticism of the Saudi regime, ignoring the men’s obvious discomfort, and apparently oblivious to their situation as men held under a repressive, authoritarian government.</p> <p>In the film’s press notes, Smaker’s team emphasised the protections and procedures they put in place, including allowing a Saudi Arabian co-producer and film crew to remain anonymous, presumably to protect them from potential state persecution – unlike the film’s interviewees. </p> <p>Gail Helt, a former CIA analyst who supported efforts to close Guantánamo told the Guardian: “If the film-makers think this film will not get to people who could cause harm to these men, that’s just another indicator that they seem ill-equipped to tackle this subject matter. The failings of this film are enormous, and it should never be allowed to circulate or be shown to a wider audience.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jul/29/rebekah-vardy-loses-libel-case-against-coleen-rooney-wagatha-christie","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T16:51:24Z","webTitle":"Rebekah Vardy loses ‘Wagatha Christie’ libel case against Coleen Rooney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/rebekah-vardy-loses-libel-case-against-coleen-rooney-wagatha-christie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/rebekah-vardy-loses-libel-case-against-coleen-rooney-wagatha-christie","fields":{"headline":"Rebekah Vardy loses ‘Wagatha Christie’ libel case against Coleen Rooney","trailText":"Rather than clearing name, ruling leaves Vardy with legal defeat and destroyed reputation ","byline":"Jim Waterson Media editor and Caroline Davies","body":"<p>A “devastated” Rebekah Vardy has lost her libel case against Coleen Rooney, leaving her facing a bill for millions of pounds in legal costs as she claimed the judge had “got it wrong”.</p> <p>In a damning high court judgment in the “Wagatha Christie” case on Friday, Vardy was described as an “untrustworthy witness” who was likely to have destroyed potentially crucial evidence on purpose. </p> <p>Mrs Justice Steyn concluded Vardy probably worked with her agent, Caroline Watt, to leak stories from Rooney’s private Instagram account to the Sun, providing tips to tabloid journalists and aiding them with their inquiries.</p> <p>Vardy now faces a substantial legal bill, reportedly around £3m, after deciding to pursue the case to trial.

All my attempts to do so were knocked back by Mrs Vardy.” </p> <p>The saga began three years ago when Rooney, the wife of the former England footballer Wayne, conducted a “sting” operation to find out who was leaking stories from her private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun.</p> <p>Rooney identified the culprit with the now infamous words posted on Instagram: “It’s ……… Rebekah Vardy’s account.”</p> <p>Vardy, who is married to the Leicester City footballer Jamie, denied passing information to the Sun and sued Rooney for libel in an attempt to restore her reputation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ce9a72c8b2daa2043220c611441b1307bdba2af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ce9a72c8b2daa2043220c611441b1307bdba2af/0_179_2331_3321/702.jpg\" alt=\"Coleen Rooney leaving court during the trial.\" width=\"702\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coleen Rooney leaving court during the trial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her ruling, the judge concluded that “significant parts” of Vardy’s evidence were not credible and there were many occasions when her evidence “was manifestly inconsistent with the contemporaneous documentary evidence, evasive or implausible”.</p> <p>She also said that Vardy and Watt were likely to have deliberately destroyed potentially damning evidence. WhatsApp messages on Watt’s phone were lost after the device was dropped off the side of a boat in the North Sea, while Vardy’s own copy of the same messages was lost in the process of backing them up.</p> <p>The judge concluded: “It is likely that Ms Vardy deliberately deleted her WhatsApp chat with Ms Watt, and that Ms Watt deliberately dropped her phone in the sea.”</p> <p>She also found it was likely Vardy “knew of, condoned and was actively engaged” in the process of Watt leaking stories about Rooney to the Sun. </p> <p>Although Rooney’s defence succeeded on the matter of truth – after convincing the judge that the claim against Vardy was likely to be true – she failed on her public interest defence.</p> <p>This was, in part, because Rooney failed to follow standard journalistic practice by going to Vardy for comment before publishing the accusation.</p> <p>Bringing the case meant Vardy, 40, endured days of difficult cross-examination at the high court. This covered everything from her history of selling kiss ’n’ tell stories to tabloids about the singer Peter Andre, to allegations she had leaked details of her husband’s relationship with his teammates, and her own record of passing information to the Sun. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/19/wagatha-christie-britains-courts-celebrity-trials\">What did we learn from ‘Wagatha Christie’?

However, they defended the claim on two grounds: first, that the accusation was true based on circumstantial evidence available to Rooney; and second, that it was in the public interest for Rooney to make the accusation against Vardy.</p> <p>Vardy’s team had told the court her life had been made hell by Rooney’s public accusation, which left her open to widespread mockery, social media abuse and negative chants when her husband played football.</p> <p>Her barrister, Hugh Tomlinson, said his client would have had to have been “very clever or very cynical” to have undertaken the manual deletion of WhatsApp messages. He said it would be an “extraordinarily complicated conspiracy” to have deleted all the evidence.</p> <p>The process of assessing the pair’s legal bills could take a significant amount of time. The costs have been estimated at £3m, with Vardy having to pay the lion’s share.</p> <p>Jack Ridgway, the chair of the Association of Costs Lawyers, said: “Assuming there is no appeal, the costs process will now begin. As the loser, Mrs Vardy will undoubtedly be required to pay Mrs Rooney’s costs, but these will be subject to a court process called assessment … as a generalisation, winning parties recover about 70% of their costs.”</p> <p>The case has become a cultural talking point, with several TV projects based around the court case currently in the works. All of them will now be able to finish with the conclusion that, as Rooney originally claimed, “It’s ………. Rebekah Vardy’s account.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/29/england-begin-commonwealth-games-cricket-without-captain-heather-knight","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T16:39:58Z","webTitle":"England begin Commonwealth Games cricket without captain Heather Knight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/england-begin-commonwealth-games-cricket-without-captain-heather-knight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/29/england-begin-commonwealth-games-cricket-without-captain-heather-knight","fields":{"headline":"England begin Commonwealth Games cricket without captain Heather Knight","trailText":"A lingering hip injury has ruled the 31-year-old out of the Sri Lanka match as women’s cricket makes its first ever appearance at the Games","byline":"Raf Nicholson","body":"<p>The England captain, Heather Knight, will miss her side’s opening fixture at the Commonwealth Games against Sri Lanka on Saturday due to a lingering hip injury.</p> \n<p>Women’s cricket is making its debut appearance at the Games, in a Twenty20 tournament at Edgbaston between 29 July and 7 August.

England can be reasonably confident of securing a semi-final berth, but it is the gold medal match on 7 August which Knight has her heart set on.</p> \n<p>“When you’re a kid you watch the Olympics, you watch the Commonwealths, and you see the special moment that a podium medal ceremony is,” Knight said. “It would be super special to be a part of that.”</p> \n<p>While Australia are firm favourites to win gold at the Games, their preparations for the tournament have been disrupted by a series of washouts in their warmup series in Ireland. By contrast, England are fresh from beating South Africa 3-0 in the T20 leg of their series and appear to have regained some of the swagger that was missing from their winter Ashes campaign.</p> \n<p>“We’ll take a massive amount of confidence in,” Knight said. “The important thing is that we take the same mindset into a big world event and that we take what we’ve done so well and perform it under pressure.”</p> \n<p>“Hopefully we can continue the really good form we’ve had so far this summer, the dominant way we’ve played, and the aggressive intent that we’ve shown.”</p> \n<p>England gave debuts to 17-year-olds Alice Capsey and Freya Kemp during the South Africa series; Capsey in particular will have an important role to play in their batting lineup, especially in the absence of Knight. The 20-year-old seamer Issy Wong has also had an exciting summer to date, with eight wickets across the three formats, and may well be handed the new ball.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5ef4518b-fc68-48d6-bc9a-12445ff788d1\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>England:</b> Sophia Dunkley, Danni Wyatt, Alice Capsey, Nat Sciver (capt), Amy Jones (wkt), Maia Bouchier, Bryony Smith, Katherine Brunt, Sophie Ecclestone, Issy Wong, Sarah Glenn</p>\n    <p><b>Sri Lanka:</b> Vishmi Gunaratne, Chamari Athapaththu (capt), Harshitha Samarawickrama, Nilakshi de Silva, Kavisha Dilhari, Ama Kanchana, Anushkha Sanjeewani (wkt), Malsha Shehani, Oshadi Ranasinghe, Sugandika Kumari, Inoka Ranaweera</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Knight says the youngsters have added “energy, rawness and fearlessness” to her team. “For us older girls, it’s keeping us young and keeping us excited,” she said. “I’m loving being a part of the early stage of their career, and trying to help them as much as I can, and just let them loose and give them the confidence to go and do what they do and show off.”</p> \n<p>England will be optimistic of success on Saturday: Sri Lanka are ranked No 8 in the world in T20s and reached the Games only by virtue of beating Bangladesh in the qualifying tournament in Malaysia in January.

He will be best remembered for his indiscreet memoirs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/nov/13/biography.politicalbooks\" title=\"\">DC Confidential</a>, published in 2005 and serialised in the Guardian and Daily Mail, in which he produced a series of unflattering portraits of senior figures in the Blair government. It was unusual at the time for a civil servant to publish a book so soon after leaving government and to make such caustic personal remarks about ministers.</p> <p>He spared Gordon Brown, then chancellor, and John Reid, a defence secretary, but said such capable ministers tended to be an exception and “stood out like Masai warriors in a crowd of pygmies”. Among those he was scathing about were the then foreign secretary Jack Straw, another defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, and the deputy prime minister John Prescott. He ridiculed Blair’s Middle East envoy, Lord Levy, for having pretensions to be “a latter-day Kissinger”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/sir-christopher-meyer-former-uk-ambassador-to-us-dies-at-78\">Sir Christopher Meyer, former UK ambassador to US, dies at 78</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour viewed him as unfairly targeting party figures and suspected him of being a closet Conservative. Prescott dismissed Meyer as a “red-socked fop”, a reference to Meyer’s liking, in otherwise conventional attire, for bright coloured socks. Meyer defended himself by saying that politicians could write books about their time in office so he did not see why diplomats could not do the same, and noted that the Cabinet Office had given approval for publication. He said he would hand the serialisation rights to the book to charities, but would keep the royalties.</p> <p>He was ambassador to Washington from 1997 to 2003, coinciding with the Clinton and Bush administrations. Relations between Bill Clinton and Tony Blair were good and this helped Meyer establish his presence in Washington. But he was realistic about the importance of the UK to the US and banned the use around the embassy of the phrase “special relationship”, telling staff that Britain was much less important than a series of other countries. The Blair government had hoped that Clinton would be followed as president by the Democrat Al Gore, but Meyer warned them early on that George W Bush stood a good chance of winning the 2000 election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60630ce618daef4aab84b1662acccf47ebf87c8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60630ce618daef4aab84b1662acccf47ebf87c8b/0_311_3400_2040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Meyer presenging a bust of Winston Churchill to the US president George W Bush in the Oval Office, 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Meyer presenting a bust of Winston Churchill to the US president George W Bush in the Oval Office, 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Mathieson/Mai/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jonathan Powell, Blair’s chief of staff, ordered Meyer in 2001 to get close to the Bush administration: “We want you to get up the arse of the White House and stay there.” Meyer duly complied, establishing good contacts not only to Bush but also to those close to him, including the then national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, with whom Meyer played tennis, the vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/30/donald-rumsfeld-obituary\" title=\"\">Dick Cheney</a>, who was his next-door neighbour, and the defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, with whom he went white-water rafting.</p> <p>Meyer supported the war in Iraq, but argued in DC Confidential that Blair could have been more forceful in negotiations with Bush and could have persuaded him to delay the invasion to secure a second United Nations resolution. He was also critical of the US for its lack of post-invasion planning. Critics of Meyer quoted Rumsfeld, who had said that the US would have gone ahead with the invasion without the UK if Blair had threatened not to participate. In 2009, giving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/09/chilcot-inquiry-christopher-meyer\" title=\"\">evidence to the Iraq inquiry</a> led by Sir John Chilcot, Meyer made the case again, saying Blair had become so close to Bush that he effectively gave the US president a blank cheque for the invasion. Some of Meyer’s animus towards the Blair government seems to have been because he felt that at times he was cut out of the circle, with Blair dealing directly with Bush.</p> <p>Meyer was born in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. His father, Reginald, was in the RAF during the second world war and was killed in action in Greece in 1944, 13 days before his son was born. Christopher was raised by his mother, Eve, and a grandmother before being sent to boarding school at Lancing College in West Sussex, which he said later he hated for the first three years, but conceded had made him self-sufficient. He studied in Paris before going to Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he graduated with a degree in history. He went on to study at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Bologna, Italy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e3a844bdd4e7701923a5a0b4ae2216b56925de5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e3a844bdd4e7701923a5a0b4ae2216b56925de5/0_79_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Meyer, left, and the US chief of protocol Donald Ensenat, right, greeting the UK prime minister Tony Blair on his arrival in the US in 2002 for a meeting with President George W Bush at Camp David.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Meyer, left, and the US chief of protocol Donald Ensenat, right, greeting the UK prime minister Tony Blair on his arrival in the US in 2002 for a meeting with President George W Bush at Camp David.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1966 he joined the Foreign Office and, having studied Russian, went to Moscow for his first posting before serving in Madrid, Brussels and then another stint in Moscow.</p> <p>He was co-opted in 1994 to become Major’s press officer. It was a challenging time, with the Conservatives beset by a series of scandals and the prime minister regularly ridiculed. Major was especially sensitive to press criticism but Meyer failed to persuade him either to stop reading the papers or to stop taking the criticism so personally. Meyer’s dry sense of humour helped him through many awkward lobby briefings.</p> <p>He was rewarded for his efforts as press secretary in 1997 with an ambassadorship to Germany before moving later that year to Washington.

A spokesman for local, Russian-backed self-styled separatist forces put the death toll at 53. Both accused Ukrainian forces of striking the prison with US-made Himars rockets.</p> <p>Ukraine said it believed about 40 people were killed and 130 were injured. Its defence forces denied responsibility and said Russian artillery had targeted the prison to hide the fact that the men held there had been “tortured and murdered”. The country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Russia had committed a “barbaric war crime”.</p> <p>Ukraine accused of Russia of attacking the prison as part of an “information war to accuse the Ukrainian armed forces of shelling civilian infrastructure and the population to cover up their own treacherous action”.</p> <p>The county’s military intelligence said the strike was a “deliberate act of terrorism” and the domestic security agency the SBU said it had intercepted phone calls which point to Russia being responsible. Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, Andriy Kostin, said he had opened a war crimes investigation into the blast.</p> <p>There was no way to immediately verify either of the two versions of events. </p> <p>Footage broadcast on Russian television said to be from the scene at the prison showed military personnel examining a building with a hole in the roof, tangled metal from bunk beds and blood trails among personal effects. Other images showed charred bodies and dismembered limbs.</p> <p>Russian media later published pictures of what it said were fragments from a US Himars rocket, gathered together and placed on what appeared to be a bench rather than located in situ.</p> <p>The SBU, said it had intercepted phone calls “in which the occupiers confirm that Russian troops are to blame for this tragedy”. The intercepted conversations indicate that the Russians may have placed explosives in the prison, the agency said in a statement. “In particular, none of the eyewitnesses heard any missile flying towards the correctional facility. There was no characteristic whistling, and the explosions occurred on their own.”</p> <p>In addition, online video footage showed that the windows remained whole in some rooms of the facility, according to the SBU. That “indicates that the epicentre of the explosion was inside the destroyed building, and its walls took the hit from the blast waves, protecting some of the neighbouring rooms.”</p> <p>The Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, called for a “strict investigation” into the attack and urged the United Nations and other international organisations to condemn it. He said the Russians had transferred some Ukrainian prisoners to the barrack that was hit just a few days before the strike, suggesting that it was planned. The Russian allegations, he said, were “a classic, cynical and elaborate false flag operation” designed to discredit Ukrainian authorities.</p> <p>Olenivka is about 10km south of occupied Donetsk and close to the frontline. Establishing responsibility is likely to be highly challenging without independent access to the site.</p> <p>According to reports, the Ukrainian troops who died were among those taken prisoner after the fierce fighting for the Azovstal steel mill complex in the port of city of Mariupol. </p> <p>The Azov regiment and other Ukrainian units defended the steel mill for nearly three months, clinging to its underground maze of tunnels. They surrendered in May under relentless Russian attacks from the ground, sea and air.</p> <p>Scores of Ukrainian soldiers were taken to prisons in Russian-controlled areas such as Donetsk, a breakaway area in eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatist authorities.</p> <p>Some have returned to Ukraine as part of prisoner exchanges with Russia, but families of others have no idea whether their loved ones are alive, or if they will ever come home.</p> <p>Friday’s attack raises serious questions about where the prisoners were being held, in what circumstances, and why they had not been moved to a safer location.</p> <p>It also raises questions about the status of those killed. Under the Geneva conventions, registered prisoners of war would not be tried for legally participating in conflict.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The claims of the death of the prisoners comes amid continuing fighting.</p> <p>In the southern city of Mykolaiv, Russian shelling killed at least five people at a bus stop, with images from the city showing a number of bodies lying in the street.

The advert seems to have gone now which is a shame because it was very funny. What made it work was the strapline “I FEEL FANTASTIC”, pasted in throbbing alpha-dog script over a picture of Anderson staring balefully into the camera, looking chiselled and fit as ever, but wearing that familiar expression of a man marooned at a windswept rural bus stop in a pair of rain sodden plimsolls who has, just this moment, taken his first ever bite of celery.</p> <p>It was never really clear if Anderson was supposed to be saying <em>I feel fantastic</em>, which just doesn’t seem like the kind of thing that would happen, or overhearing someone else saying it and muttering and rolling his eyes, or if this was always intended as a highly sophisticated piece of double-take branding, like hiring Mark E Smith to scoot around in a Mini covered in stickers trying to sell you a portered new-build two-bed in Fulham.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/28/the-hundred-could-save-england-international-teams-says-eion-morgan\">The Hundred could save England’s international teams, says Eoin Morgan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The real reason it seems timely now is that Anderson’s longevity, his basic refusal to yield, has passed from a useful tool for selling vitamins into something genuinely startling. Cricket loves its milestones. Here’s another one, a marker that really does deserve its own flag. Anderson, England’s greatest ever wicket-taker, currently the sixth-ranked men’s Test bowler in the world, turns 40 on Saturday.</p> <p>Yes! Forty! Anderson hates talking about his age. He says it’s irrelevant, which is true, but also not true once you take a step back and absorb how much of an outlier he has become. By the time the first Test against South Africa rolls around in mid-August England will have, for the first time ever, a 40-year-old opening bowler – and not some creaking old sage, but this miraculously lithe figure still snaking in and sending down the odd 87mph delivery, surely the oldest person ever to bowl at these speeds in an international game.</p> <p>Frankly the whole thing is fantastical, a feat of will and athletic brilliance that, as has often been the case with Anderson, feels as though it really does have to mean something. But what exactly? There is a tendency in English sport to overdo the fond fuzzy eulogy stuff. A few weeks back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/18/ben-stokes-to-retire-from-odi-cricket-after-durham-farewell-appearance\" title=\"\">Ben Stokes retired</a> from a format he has played 10 times in the past three years, games nobody can remember, which are literally just coloured shirts doing things, a mumbled speech in front of a TV board, and was hailed like a viking king being sent off in his flaming longboat watched by the spirits of the noble warrior dead. The English are good at this. We do send-offs and speeches. Three cheers. Ladies and gentleman, the Queen. It’s a kind of status brag, subtly pitched. This is different though. Trying to work out what Anderson means. This has been a constant refrain since his emergence as a skunk-haired prodigy through to his enthronement as an indestructible embodiment of high summer craft.</p> <p>The search for meaning usually centres on greatness. It’s the easiest thing.</p> <p>Look at the numbers. When Anderson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/25/england-pakistan-third-test-day-five-match-report\" title=\"\">got to 600 wickets</a> two years ago he was hailed by some, in this country at least, as the greatest fast bowler of all time. But it is pretty hard to be the greatest. Malcolm Marshall, Dale Steyn, Wasim Akram, Curtly Ambrose, Pat Cummins, Richard Hadlee and Glenn McGrath all say hi. Eighteen pace bowlers have taken more than 200 wickets and averaged under 25 in the modern era, and Anderson is not one of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65069c9bffdac3024b4a9d1b5170d3baee1ac02f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65069c9bffdac3024b4a9d1b5170d3baee1ac02f/0_42_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Anderson acknowledges the crowd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Anderson acknowledges the crowd after taking his fifth wicket against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 2010. Since that summer he has taken over 500 Test wickets at an average of around 23.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Brown/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other hand Anderson’s body of work is such a vast data mine it isn’t hard to find outright greatness in there. The summer of 2010 is a Damascene moment in Anderson lore. Already 28 years old, scarred by injury and failure, Anderson was moved to trust his basic action, to focus on pressure and craft. Since then he has more than 500 wickets at around 23, evidence of absolute mastery of his skills, the ability to swing, wobble, reverse, bowl dry, to be more effective in the last three years overseas than in England. This is greatness, unarguable and hard-earned.But, it isn’t just that. Because people also love Anderson. There is something so fond and tender in his presence on an English field. Even the run-up feels intimate, with that reluctant first step, then a kind of shiver as he eases up into a sprint, feet splayed into the coil and whip, head still dipping like a maestro’s bow at the point of release. Anderson has sent down 68,970 deliveries this way, has run the length of Britain, with a ball in his hand.</p> <p>It feels significant too that he emerged outside the current closed world of age group systems and elite pathways, that his first incarnation was as an unskilled teenage tearaway, driven by the outsider’s curiosity to study and evolve and learn new forms. This is in part why people love Anderson. But it’s not just that either. Perhaps it’s about beauty, because if he does have claim on ultimacy it is this, that Anderson is the most aesthetically beautiful of all seam and swing bowlers. Even now there is something beguiling in the ease and grace of his movements, in the variations of wrist and fingertips.</p> <p>My own favourite bit of Anderson is still his five-fer on Test debut as a baggy-trousered kid, where he keeps on turning the Zimbabwe batters around the wrong way, making them chase ghosts, clipping to leg, then whirling back as off-stump clanks out of the ground, a street magician’s trick. Over time it became clear that he is basically English cricket’s Warne, all deception and control, but a Warne designed for cold days and cold fingers, softer English air.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-spin\" name=\"the-spin\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-spin\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-spin\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>And perhaps this is what Anderson means, if he means anything. Never mind the numbers, the beauty, the backstory. What he represents is a state of grace. There he is, still out there doing this thing in the dog days of a dying form. Let’s face it, one reason Anderson can do this is because only England really zeroes on Test cricket to this degree, because in the end the rest of the world has its eyes elsewhere.</p> <p>Another summer of Anderson: it is a kind of fever dream, with the promise that while he’s still running in we can pretend that this will always happen, that things will always feel fantastical, the last great silent movie actor cleaning up before the talkies wash all this away. There are many different reasons why. But we really will never see his like again. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/29/emma-raducanus-choice-of-coach-will-only-add-to-the-scrutiny","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T15:56:45Z","webTitle":"Emma Raducanu appointing Russian coach will only add to scrutiny on her | Tumaini Carayol","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/emma-raducanus-choice-of-coach-will-only-add-to-the-scrutiny","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/29/emma-raducanus-choice-of-coach-will-only-add-to-the-scrutiny","fields":{"headline":"Emma Raducanu appointing Russian coach will only add to scrutiny on her","trailText":"The US Open champion’s decision to work with Dmitry Tursunov has been called ‘a real shame’ by a Labour MP","byline":"Tumaini Carayol","body":"<p>For much of the past few months, as Emma Raducanu travelled the world without a permanent coach and assured all who asked that she could succeed while in full control of her destiny, her decisions were the subject of intense, constant attention.

The hiring of Tursunov has led to significant criticism of her decision to work alongside a Russian as the invasion of Ukraine continues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/29/emma-raducanu-begins-beautiful-friendship-in-defeat-at-wimbledon\">Emma Raducanu begins beautiful friendship in defeat at Wimbledon | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is another instance of the extreme scrutiny that has surrounded Raducanu’s every move since her US Open victory.

There are few things that Russia’s propaganda cannot twist to suit its narrative. In this case, a private citizen hiring the private services of an independent contractor who is Russian, with the simple hopes of improving her career, should not be grounds for such outrage or controversy.</p> <p>What is clear is that Raducanu has endured a brutal first full season on the WTA tour, with a series of injuries including a side strain that scuppered most of her grass-court season. She has won nine and lost 12 matches this year, and now faces the pressure and difficulty of a grand slam defence.</p> <p>As she heads to the US, Raducanu has chosen a coach with a proven record for a trial. Tursunov has enjoyed notable success in his short time coaching. In his first high-profile pairing, with Aryna Sabalenka in 2018, he guided the Belarusian from a world ranking of 45th to ninth before they split at the end of the following year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/26/how-wimbledon-spotlight-is-helping-cameron-norrie-plan-for-us-open-tennis\">How Wimbledon spotlight is helping Cameron Norrie plan for US Open | Tumaini Carayol</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last season Tursunov pulled off an even more impressive feat with Anett Kontaveit of Estonia, taking her from 29th to a career high of second at the time of their split after the French Open last month.

But both are memorials: Brahms was prompted to compose A German Requiem by the death of his mother in 1865, while Walshe’s The Site of an Investigation dates from 2018 (this was its London premiere) and is dedicated to her friend, the actor Stephen Swift, who died in that year.</p> <p>There, though, the similarities end. Walshe’s piece is part melodrama, part music theatre, part scena, with the composer herself delivering a text assembled from a huge range of internet sources. Text, she says, is “like the canary in the coal mine … an early-warning system of how culture is changing.” And so the 26 sections of The Site of an Investigation range across the obsessions and evils of modern life, taking in racism and misogyny, beach parties and microplastics, Mars landings and artificial intelligence. It’s delivered by Walshe in tones that range from hectoring declamation to the tenderest lullaby. There are surreal moments too: at one point two percussionists wrap a model giraffe in paper, their amplified rustling adding to the sound world; at another they assemble a wall of transparent bricks, like blocks of ice, which they then proceed to knock over.</p> <p>The orchestra’s role is mostly a supporting one – sometimes just providing suspended chords under Walshe’s monologues, but occasionally providing convulsive punctuation or wrapping itself sensuously around the more lyrical moments. There’s certainly beauty as well as provocation. The ending, with a text discussing whether artificial intelligence will ever be able to recreate those who have died, is deeply moving. In a strange, off-the-wall way, it is a really impressive achievement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"467a53c63a978e3a9b46aa97eb2eb7de4e623a07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/467a53c63a978e3a9b46aa97eb2eb7de4e623a07/0_163_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ilan Volkov conducts the BBCSSO and the National Youth Choir of Great Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ilan Volkov conducts the BBCSSO and the National Youth Choir of Great Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Allan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Volkov and the BBCSSO were just as convincing in Brahms’s dark-hued requiem as they had been in Walshe’s polyglot one.

But in a week where the legacy – or conspicuous lack thereof – of the most jingoistic, self-congratulatory opening ceremony in Olympic history has been high on the news agenda, it seems more imperative than ever before that the English women’s game continues to make hay while the sun shines on their sport.</p> <p>You see, The Fiver’s assorted cousins are rooting for England’s brave Lionesses before the final at Wembley, with only a handful of notable exceptions. By a handful, we mean everyone except our English cousin, Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver, whose offer of complementary tickets for the final to assorted relations have all been turned down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/28/mary-earps-business-euro-2022-final-de-gea-england\">Mary Earps ready to do the business in Euros final thanks to De Gea dealings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much to his chagrin, knobbly stick-waving stereotypical Irish cousin Theme Pub O’Fiver; bagpipes-playing, See You Jimmy-saying Scottish cousin Shortbread McFiver and valley-dwelling, cheese on toast-eating Welsh cousin Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch Fiver all seemed curiously unenthused about accompanying him to the game, and upon being asked why sheepishly confessed they’d had a better offer. Rather than banging out fat lines and sticking firecrackers where the sun don’t shine, they’ll be oompah-ing it up in the away end at Wembley with their ruthlessly efficient German cousin Vorsprung durch Tin und Lederhosen Fumfen instead.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the away end of a Fiver full of lazy stereotypes, Franz Beckenbauer has done his bit to ruin the Lionesses narrative by tipping his countrywomen to win in the most cliched style imaginable. The German legend expects Alexandra Popp and chums to rain on any prospective English Wembley parade by not only winning the final but doing so on penalties.</p> <p>“A draw after 90 minutes,” he predicted. “In extra time, both teams score one goal each. Penalty shoot-out. And that’s where our women win, because they are physically and mentally better.” While his comments are likely to look good stuck up on England’s dressing-room wall, the nagging concern for Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver and other England fans is that history suggests he’s probably right.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“I’m not having brie.

So many leaders of the LGBT community have also, weeks ago, asked for additional help and support and assistance,” said San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, who added that the city was in “desperate need of vaccines”.</p> <p>The declaration will allow local authorities to mobilize more resources and staff to confront the outbreak and accelerate emergency planning. The city has recorded 261 cases so far, out of about 4,600 across the US, according to the San Francisco department of public health.</p> <p>“San Francisco is an epicenter for the country. Thirty per cent of all cases in California are in San Francisco,” said the San Francisco health officer Susan Philip.

But local health organizations in San Francisco have been advocating for easier, broader access to testing and more vaccine doses. These calls are echoed by leaders in other large cities, where <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/06/21/monkeypox-testing-cdc-need-more/\">epidemiologists</a> warn that initial delays in rolling out tests mean that the actual number of cases very likely outnumber the confirmed cases.</p> <p>“In the face of a frustratingly slow federal response, it is all the more important that we be able to mobilize all available local resources to get vaccines into arms as quickly and equitably as possible,” San Francisco supervisor Rafael Mandelman said.</p> <p>So far, San Francisco has received 8,200 doses of Jynneos, the best vaccine against monkeypox. But officials had initially requested 35,000 doses to cover the most vulnerable residents.</p> <p>Residents have had to wait in long lines for scarce doses. “We should have been able to quickly control this outbreak,” Wiener <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/21/san-franciscos-lgbtq-monkeypox-vaccine-access\">told the Guardian last week</a>. “And instead it’s like Mad Max Thunderdome to get a vaccine.”</p> <p>Health workers argue that more local resources are needed to reach especially vulnerable residents, including unhoused populations.</p> <p>In New York, Bassett said: “Based on the ongoing spread of this virus, which has increased rapidly and affected primarily communities that identify as men who have sex with men, and the need for local jurisdictions to administer vaccines, I’ve declared monkeypox an imminent threat to public health throughout New York state.”</p> <p>New York City officials and other authorities nationally and internationally increasingly fear monkeypox <a href=\"https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/time-running-out-monkeypox-officials-warn-nycs-cases-triple\">becoming uncontainable</a>.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/29/drake-defends-short-private-jet-flights","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T15:50:19Z","webTitle":"Drake defends his short private jet flights – by saying plane was empty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/29/drake-defends-short-private-jet-flights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/29/drake-defends-short-private-jet-flights","fields":{"headline":"Drake defends his short private jet flights – by saying plane was empty","trailText":"The rapper’s explanation made his plane’s short hop flights even more of a climate disaster, critics pointed out","byline":"Oliver Milman in New York","body":"<p>Drake, the rapper, has attempted to defend his use of a large private plane for a series of flights that lasted less than 20 minutes – by revealing that the aircraft was being moved to a storage location with no passengers on board.</p> <p>The Canadian music star and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/21/kylie-jenner-short-private-jet-flights-super-rich-climate-crisis\">several other celebrities, including the socialite and business owner Kylie Jenner</a>, have recently been attacked online for using their private jets for short journeys that could easily be undertaken by car or public transport.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/21/kylie-jenner-short-private-jet-flights-super-rich-climate-crisis\">A 17-minute flight?

These egregious flights add climate-heating pollution all along their journey, from taxiing on the runway to the ground vehicles that service the aircraft.</p> <p>“Ultra-short, non-essential flying only multiplies the journey’s climate impacts and we hope celebrities will wake up to the damaging impact of their frivolous flying.”</p> <p>Drake’s climate impact is larger than many other celebrities with private jets because of the enormous size of his personal aircraft.

With atomic reactors generating the lowest share of the country’s power in 30 years, France faces an electricity ‘Waterloo.’</p> <p>The slump in nuclear availability is forcing France to rely more than ever on gas-fired plants, intermittent wind and hydro as well as imports. That’s pushing up the cost of electricity in the wholesale market for the whole of Europe, with French forward prices surging to almost 1,000% more than their decade-long average through 2020.</p> <p>In the middle of the summer, when French electricity demand hovers around 45 gigawatts per hour, that’s not an insurmountable problem.

There will be lots of offers, more than she has ever had before. The controversy has just made her more interesting,” he said.</p> <p>Rooney, meanwhile, who is making a documentary about the case, can expect offers from many brands keen to associate with the “vilified girl next door” persona she has acquired.</p> <p>“We live on pantomime. Reality TV and social media daily give us pantomime characters. So, here we have the ‘wicked witch’ and the ‘good fairy’. I think pantomime king Michael Harrison will be on the phone today,” said PR expert Mark Borkowski.</p> <p>Hartley said the verdict may seem a disaster for a “devastated” Vardy, but “nearly always people can come back from having had their reputation really badly trashed”.</p> <p>He added: “Coleen had won before the verdict in terms of PR. Everybody seemed to be on her side. The fact most people thought Rebekah Vardy was in the dock showed how badly it had gone for her. The snippets that came out in the trial were more damaging for Rebekah rather than Coleen.</p> <p>“But the British public is brilliant at forgiving. She [Vardy] has to create a long-term strategy. She has to do some <em>mea culpa</em>. She has to show some understanding of where it went wrong and why people were upset.”</p> <p>A sympathetic TV interview could be a start. “Piers Morgan would want her” but whether the gladiatorial arena was the best vehicle for Vardy at this stage was debatable, he added. Charity work was another option. But she should not rush into anything.</p> <p>Rooney, on the other hand, would be able to take advantage of the many offers bound to come her way. “If I was Coleen, I would absolutely use the profile and the good will she has got and take advantage of all the offers,” said Hartley.</p> <p>“In a strange way Coleen, PR-wise, is better off moving away from this story. Not because she has done anything wrong. But because she’s got the high moral ground and she doesn’t want to be seen to be exploiting that, and kicking Rebekah while she is down.”</p> <p>The Wag-type brands are, however, likely to steer clear of Vardy for a while. “The type of deals with the type of retailers that might go to a Wag are going to evaporate,” said Borkowski.</p> <p>“It’s massive for Coleen, and she’s got the people around her to market it. She remains the vilified girl next door. She came across as very strong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/14/wagatha-christie-the-sensational-court-battle-that-became-a-fashion-face-off\">walking into court with that big boot on, [Wayne] behind her holding her handbag</a>.</p> <p>“She’s back in play now. I think people will look at her and think: ‘She’s someone we want.’ And she will be in demand, but for totally different reasons to Vardy.”</p> <p>“It’s a disaster for Vardy,” he added. “She could go with the antics. I always remember Christine and Neil Hamilton would turn up at every chatshow with a brown paper bag, and they seemed to recover because they played into the comedy of the situation,” he said of the former MP’s downfall following the “cash for questions” scandal.</p> <p>“She [Vardy] can disappear without trace, or do private charitable things quietly in the background, a kind of John Profumo of the footballers’ wives world. She will be in demand, though. You name it – tabloid TV, reality TV. But, from the way she launched this action, I don’t think it will be a comfortable place for her to be in.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/29/oil-gas-company-profits-fuel-prices-shell-exxon-chevron","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T15:44:54Z","webTitle":"Oil company profits boom as Americans reel from high fuel prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/29/oil-gas-company-profits-fuel-prices-shell-exxon-chevron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/29/oil-gas-company-profits-fuel-prices-shell-exxon-chevron","fields":{"headline":"Oil company profits boom as Americans reel from high fuel prices","trailText":"ExxonMobil posts second-quarter profits of $17.85bn – four times last year’s figure – with Chevron making $11.62bn","byline":"Dominic Rushe in New York","body":"<p>The US’s biggest oil companies pumped out record profits over the last few months as Americans struggled to pay for gasoline, food and other basic necessities.</p> <p>On Friday, ExxonMobil reported an unprecedented $17.85bn (£14.77bn) profit for the second quarter, nearly four times as much as the same period a year ago, and Chevron made a record $11.62bn (£9.61bn). The sky-high profits were announced one day after the UK’s Shell shattered its own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/shell-posts-10bn-quarterly-profits-as-households-struggle-with-bills\">profit record.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jul/28/with-such-eye-watering-profits-shell-should-invest-more-in-low-carbon-transition\">With such eye-watering profits, Shell should invest more in low-carbon transition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Soaring energy prices have rattled consumers and become a political flashpoint. “We’re going to make sure everybody knows Exxon’s profits,” Joe Biden said in June. “Exxon made more money than God this year.”</p> <p>The record profits came after similarly outsized gains in the first quarter when the largest oil companies made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/13/oil-gas-producers-first-quarter-2022-profits\">close to $100bn in profits.</a></p> <p>High energy prices are one of the leading factors driving inflation to a four-decade high in the US. Gas prices have fallen slightly in recent weeks but are <a href=\"https://gasprices.aaa.com/\">now averaging $4.25</a> a gallon across the US, more than $1 a gallon higher than a year ago.</p> <p>Consumers are facing high fuel prices not just at the pump. Soaring energy prices are being baked into delivery costs, which is driving up the cost of everything from apples to toilet paper.</p> <p>One reason gasoline prices have been so high is that fewer refineries are operating in the US than before the pandemic, so there is a limit to how much gasoline can be produced.</p> <p>Biden has called for the companies to increase production and refining capacities in an attempt to bring down prices. On Friday Exxon said it was expanding refinery and production in Texas and New Mexico.</p> <p>Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, increased its oil and gas production as crude prices hovered above $100 a barrel. Revenue at Exxon soared to $115.68bn, up from $67.74bn during the same quarter last year.</p> <p>Natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices are also elevated due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ensuing sanctions against Russia, a large supplier of natural gas. Many European nations have been scrambling for alternatives to Russian natural gas, and have been competing for boatloads of LNG, driving up prices for natural gas globally and in the US.</p> <p>In addition to oil company executives, shareholders also reaped the benefits of high energy prices during the quarter. Since the start of 2022, Exxon and Chevron shares have risen close to 46% and 26%, respectively.</p> <p>Exxon’s CEO, Darren Woods, attributed the company’s success to its investments in oil and gas fields in Guyana and the Permian Basin, as well as its investments in liquefied natural gas, which has been in high demand globally.</p> <p>“We’re also helping meet increased demand by expanding our refining capacity by about 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023 – representing the industry’s largest single capacity addition in the US since 2012,” Woods said in a prepared statement.</p> <p>Chevron’s chief executive officer, Mike Wirth, sought to tamp down criticism that the company was profiteering at the expense of consumers.</p> <p>“We more than doubled investment compared to last year to grow both traditional and new energy business lines,” Wirth said in the statement. “Chevron is increasing energy supplies to help meet the challenges facing global markets,” he said.</p> <p>Exxon and Chevron’s bumper profits were announced a day after Shell posted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/shell-posts-10bn-quarterly-profits-as-households-struggle-with-bills\">record earnings </a>of $11.4bn (nearly £10bn) for the three-month period from April to June.</p> <p>Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of Britain’s Trades Union Congress, called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/an-insult-soaring-profits-at-shell-and-centrica-cause-outrage\">“eye-watering profits”</a> “an insult to the millions of working people struggling to get by because of soaring energy bills.</p> <p>“Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history.

Today’s recommendations leave no room for doubt: many of those infected or bereaved are ill and dying and need compensation now.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “We recognise how important this will be for people infected and affected across the UK, and can confirm that the government will consider Sir Brian’s report … with the utmost urgency, and will respond as soon as possible.”</p> <p>The inquiry, which began in 2018, is due to publish its final report in the middle of next year.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2022/jul/29/stephen-colbert-joe-manchin-climate-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T15:20:55Z","webTitle":"Stephen Colbert: ‘Manchin was visited by the ghost of climate future’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/29/stephen-colbert-joe-manchin-climate-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/jul/29/stephen-colbert-joe-manchin-climate-bill","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Colbert: ‘Manchin was visited by the ghost of climate future’","trailText":"Late-night hosts discuss Joe Manchin’s reversal on the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes $369bn to cut emissions","byline":"Guardian staff","body":"<h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2> <p>On Thursday’s Late Show, Stephen Colbert recapped the legislative bombshell that shocked Washington: Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat who has repeatedly thwarted the Biden administration’s efforts to pass the Build Back Better plan, announced on Wednesday that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/28/climate-bill-joe-manchin-whats-in-it\">support a bill to address the climate crisis</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-S-tU0F-a0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P-S-tU0F-a0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The $369bn package aiming to reduce US carbon emissions by 40% by 2030, part of a larger measure known as the <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_of_2022.pdf\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, pays for itself with a 15% corporate minimum tax rate on billion-dollar companies or larger and funding to beef up tax enforcement for the wealthiest Americans. “Finally, the mega-rich will have to pay any taxes at all,” said Colbert. “It’s got Elon Musk so scared, he is as white as a ghost.”</p> <p>Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/jul/28/joe-manchin-biden-democrats-climate-spending-bill-latest\">celebrated</a> the new bill in a statement: “This is the action the American people have been waiting for.”</p> <p>“Technically, sir, technically – that was Top Gun: Maverick,” Colbert corrected. “Cruise has still got it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/28/trevor-noah-instagram-late-night-tv\">Trevor Noah on Instagram: ‘Everything is an ad, and your feed is full of people you don’t follow’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Manchin’s support for the bill is a marked departure from his holdout positions even days earlier. “So what happened?” Colbert wondered. “Turns out Manchin was visited by the ghost of climate future.”</p> <p>In a statement, Manchin tried to distance himself from the Build Back Better name. “Build Back Better is dead, and instead we have the opportunity to make our country stronger by bringing Americans together,” he said. “Yes, Build Back Better is <em>dead</em>,” Colbert mocked. “Instead, Manchin’s going to … construct again, things more good.</p> <p>“With a little more hope for our planet, we can now rest easy and freak out about the economy,” Colbert added, amid news that the economy shrank for the second quarter in a row, raising fears that the US could enter a recession.</p> <p>That’s on top of record inflation, which has hit even the bacon, egg and cheese. The price of the beloved New York bodega staple has increased from $2.50 to $4.50 – “which is a tough blow to city consumers,” said Colbert, because the sandwich, a diet staple, has “all the essential food groups: bacon, foil and yellow”.</p> <h2><strong>Trevor Noah</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1552822768575647744\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Joe Manchin agreeing to vote for this bill is a huge win for Democrats.

And if so, what a boring dream.</p> <p>“What a week for Joe Biden – first he defeated Covid, then he defeated low expectations. Look at you, Joe!” he exclaimed.</p> <p>Noah also joked that Manchin insisted on calling the measure the Inflation Reduction Act. “I’ll be honest, I don’t think anyone cares what it’s called as long as it’s a good bill,” he said. “He could call it the ‘Everyone Except Joe Manchin Has a Small Dick Act,’ and I don’t care. I’ll be like, ‘OK well, at least my dick is going to see a better climate!’</p> <p>“I think this has taught us all an important message,” Noah continued. “Everyone was so mad at Joe Manchin, calling him names, letting their anger take over, writing him off as a villain. And it worked. Nice job, everyone, nice work.”</p> <p>The Inflation Reduction Act doesn’t include everything that Biden wanted with Build Back Better, but “it’s still a big deal,” said Noah. It lowers prescription drug prices, enforces taxation of corporations, and marks $370bn to fight climate change through tax incentives and grants.</p> <p>“This is a huge win for the Democrats, but remember, this is the Democratic party, so there’s still plenty of ways for this thing to fall apart,” Noah concluded. “House Democrats could come out against it. Kyrsten Sinema could come out against it. Joe Manchin could come out tomorrow and oppose the bill just out of habit.

On Saturday, firefighters prevented a serious blaze at Wanstead Flats [east London] caused using a disposable barbecue.</p> <p>“We need urgent action now to see a national ban on the sale of disposable barbecues.

Why can’t they ban disposable barbecues to protect the environment!”</p> <p>Rebecca Pow, who was an environment minister until she resigned in protest over Boris Johnson’s behaviour, said she would be sympathetic to a ban.</p> <p>She said: “The recent devastating wildfires have demonstrated what a risk portable barbecues can pose if not used responsibly. With more extreme weather events predicted, I support all efforts to address the dangers portable barbecues can present … while not restricting people’s opportunities to get out into our green space with all the benefits that brings.”</p> <p>The Labour party is also calling for a complete ban on their sale. Holly Lynch, the shadow security minister, said: “Given the damage disposable barbecues are having, the calls for a ban are getting louder and louder.</p> <p>“The government must take this seriously and take action on disposable barbecues now.”</p> <p>Retailers, including Waitrose and Aldi, have announced they will no longer stock disposable barbecues because of the detrimental impact they have on the environment and wildlife.

Commanche Falls, who beat Gulliver by a neck on heavy ground 12 months ago, is back for another crack and weighted to go well on just a 2lb higher mark.</p> \n<p>At the likely odds, however, his stable companion, <strong>Tinto</strong> <strong>(3.20)</strong>, makes more appeal. Dods picked up the six-year-old for just 21,000gns at Tattersalls in October and he has swiftly rediscovered the kind of form that saw him win a Newmarket handicap for Amanda Perrett off a mark of 100 two summers ago. He runs off 94 on Saturday, has a decent pitch in stall 18 with plenty of speed nearby and looks much too big at around 33-1.</p> \n<p><strong>Goodwood 1.05</strong> Maiden races are not the usual ITV fare and many punters will give this a swerve, but <strong>Classic </strong>is an obvious and worthy favourite after an eye-catching debut at Newbury earlier this month.</p> \n<p><strong>Goodwood 1.40</strong> <strong>Lethal Levi </strong>has been in winning form since the weights for the Stewards’ Cup were published and gets into this consolation race for horses balloted out of the main event on a mark of 91, 1lb lower than for his success at Newmarket last weekend.</p> \n<p><strong>Newmarket 1.55</strong> Kevin Ryan has an excellent strike-rate with runners making their nursery handicap debut and <strong>Transfer Affection </strong>is the type to go well at around 8-1.</p> \n<p><strong>Goodwood 2.10</strong> <strong>Cemhaan </strong>had a tricky passage at Royal Ascot last time and finished with running left to give. The step back up to a mile-and-three-quarters should help him regain his winning thread from earlier in the season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ed9e4c3b-4d9e-43bd-ac11-dd75f9048f29\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Goodwood</b> 1.05 Classic 1.40 Lethal Levi 2.10 Cemhaan 2.45 Emily Dickinson 3.20 Tinto (nap) 3.55 Positive Impact (nb) 4.30 Ajero<br><br><b>Newmarket&nbsp;</b>1.20 Luckin Brew 1.55 Transfer Affection 2.25 Star Fortress 3.00 Temporize 3.35 Azure Blue 4.05 Thunder Legend<br>4.40 Uzincso<br><br><b>Doncaster&nbsp;</b>1.47 Harswell Rose 2.17 Gabriella's Spirit 2.52 Laatansa<br>3.27 Protagonist 4.00 The Dunkirk Lads 4.35 Giogiobbo 5.10 Back From Dubai<br><br><b>Thirsk&nbsp;</b>2.06 Overnight Oats 2.38 Hilts&nbsp;3.13 Good Luck Fox 3.48 Substantial 4.20 All Are Mine 4.55 Open Mind 5.30 On The River 6.05 Ba Na Hills<br><br><b>Lingfield Park </b>4.25 Aiguillette&nbsp;5.05 King Lewlew 5.40 Bonnsie 6.15 G'Daay 6.45 Come On Girl 7.15 No Such Luck 7.45 Richard P Smith<br>8.15 Queen Of Change</p>\n    <p><b>Hamilton Park </b>5.45 Montelusa 6.20 Kats Bob 6.55 Zimmerman 7.25 Dragon Symbol 8.00 Smart Contender 8.30 Clan Jock 9.00 Lochnaver</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Newmarket 2.25</strong> <strong>Star Fortress </strong>was unraced at two and did not see a track until June this year but she showed an excellent turn of foot to secure her first win at Chelmsford earlier this month and is bred to appreciate this step up to 12 furlongs.</p> \n<p><strong>Goodwood 2.45</strong> <strong>Emily Dickinson </strong>ran well in the Irish Oaks a fortnight ago despite a drop in trip and this step back up to 14 furlongs should see a return to winning form.</p> \n<p><strong>Goodwood 3.55</strong> <strong>Positive Impact </strong>lost out by a short-head to the improving Jimi Hendrix at Newmarket last time and the booking of top apprentice Benoit de la Sayette should offset a 5lb rise in the weights.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2022/jul/29/will-smith-slap-apology-video","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T15:03:55Z","webTitle":"Will Smith posts emotional apology for the slap: ‘I am deeply remorseful’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/29/will-smith-slap-apology-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/jul/29/will-smith-slap-apology-video","fields":{"headline":"Will Smith posts emotional apology for the slap: ‘I am deeply remorseful’","trailText":"Actor releases video answering questions about the incident at this year’s Oscars where he slapped Chris Rock onstage","byline":"Benjamin Lee","body":"<p>Will Smith has posted an emotional video to his social channels expressing remorse over the Oscars slap.</p> \n<p>The 53-year-old actor caused controversy at this year’s ceremony after he slapped Chris Rock onstage after a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and her appearance.

My behaviour was unacceptable and I’m here whenever you’re ready to talk.”</p> \n<p>He then takes the opportunity to apologise to Rock’s mother. “One of the things about that moment, I just didn’t realise, I wasn’t thinking, but how many people got hurt in that moment,” he said.

It hurts me psychologically and emotionally to know that I didn’t live up to people’s image and impression of me. The work I’m trying to do is that I’m deeply remorseful and I’m trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself. I’m human.

It was fantastic for me to score in a major final and were in the match until half-time but Germany were fitter, faster and stronger, so it is no surprise they won 6-2. We did well to get to the final and got taught a lesson in the end.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/england-captain-leah-williamson-making-her-mark-without-having-to-tackle\">England captain Williamson making her mark without having to tackle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The comparative lack of coverage of England’s previous final does mean it can be a blind spot in history. During last year’s men’s tournament people were saying how it was the first time England had reached a major final since 1966, ignoring our achievements in 2009. That mistake will not happen in the future, whatever the outcome against Germany, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/28/england-germany-set-show-13-years-progress-euro-2022-final\">what this tournament has done</a> for the women’s game.</p> \n<p>In the 13 years since that final the game in England has changed beyond belief. The players are no longer required to arrange training sessions in the park or go to the gym in their own time – they are professional. Back then only a handful of players who had gone to America were full-time, including me. Now all the players are professional and the Women’s Super League, which has helped change the landscape, is one of the best competitions in the world.</p> \n<p>There is a survivor from that night in Helsinki all those years ago. My good friend Jill Scott started alongside me against Germany and will be part of the England squad on Sunday. I am so proud of everything she does and that she is still playing for her country is testament to her work ethic. She is a great person and human; I would always tell any young player to stick with Jill and learn from her about humility, hard work, her appetite to learn and better herself. That is why she has enjoyed longevity in a sport that has altered so much during her career.</p> \n<p>It is no coincidence she has been to all these major tournaments, that she is the second-most-capped England player, male or female, that she has won major trophies, played for big clubs, been there, done it and got the T-shirt. I want her to do well and whenever she enters the pitch I want the team to win just because of her. I want her to have a gold medal. One of the things that always reminds me about Jill is the Whitney Houston song Step by Step. I will not sing it for you, don’t worry. Jill does things brick by brick and day by day. That’s a good way of looking at things and keeping you on task. She is an example for anyone to follow.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce63f685333263ef3de002eb7354db30ceec5f65\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce63f685333263ef3de002eb7354db30ceec5f65/0_317_5063_3038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jil Scott celebrates England’s victory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jill Scott’s longevity has enabled her to remain part of the England squad since their European Championship final defeat in 2009.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With greater investment and coverage of this England team comes heightened expectation but I think this group is just going with it – no one needs to tell them anything.

On Sunday they are the home team, they will be in all white, they will have the home dressing room, the home crowd. It will, however, be different walking out to a full house waiting to cheer on the home nation in a major tournament final to their previous matches under the arch.

Asked about his <a href=\"https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/\">commitment</a> to “abolish the House of Lords” and “replace it with an elected chamber of regions and nations” last November, Starmer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcpolitics/status/1457316854741995521?lang=en-GB\">did not repeat it</a> but committed to “change” instead.</p> <p>Brown said the current appointments system “calls into question the unfettered patronage of the prime minister who alone can recommend appointments to the Queen”.</p> <p>Both he and Tony Blair declined a resignation honours list, which Brown said had “undermined the reputation of a number of past prime ministers”.</p> <p>“Johnson’s latest attempt to manipulate the Lords’ system is the culmination of years of constitutional vandalism,” Brown claimed, pointing out the “shameless” appointment of Conservative party donors and eight former party treasurers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although defeated in 2008 when he tried to press ahead with Lords reform, Brown said it was “time to flush out who really wants change and who does not”.</p> <p>“The abolition of the current House of Lords was one of the 10 commitments Keir Starmer made when assuming the Labour party leadership,” he wrote. “Now Boris Johnson and Lynton Crosby have handed him the strongest possible case for long overdue reform.”</p> <p>Starmer has faced similar pressure from, Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader who has said the Lords in its current form “has no place in 21st-century politics”.</p> <p>A Labour spokesperson said: “The Lynton Crosby plan to pack the House of Lords shows that fundamental reform is needed. Keir Starmer has asked Gordon Brown to lead a review of the UK’s constitution. It will report later this year and set out the options for change.”</p> <p>A CT Group spokesperson said: “The document you refer to was simply an early working copy of a discussion paper prepared for a thinktank.

Now, with the current prime minister also having been unceremoniously dispatched by Conservative backbenchers, his attempt in his final weeks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/23/boris-johnsons-plan-to-create-large-number-of-new-peers-comes-under-fire\">create multiple new peerages</a> is once again placing the House of Lords at the centre of scandal.</p> <p>A confidential document prepared by CT Group, the influential lobbying firm run by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/17/election-guru-lynton-crosby-attending-pms-morning-meetings\">Lynton Crosby</a> which advises Boris Johnson, and which I have seen, makes no bones about the defenestrated prime minister’s aim to pack the House of Lords. The document proposes that Johnson ride roughshod over every convention and standard of propriety in an effort to secure political nominees who will vote for the Tory government, especially its bill to disown the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/15/northern-ireland-protocol-what-is-the-uk-and-the-eus-standoff-about\">international treaty</a> it has itself signed over Northern Ireland.</p> <p>This draft plan to add 39 to 50 new Tory peers includes an extraordinary requirement that each new peer sign away their right to make their own judgment on legislation that comes before them. They have to give, the paper says, a written undertaking to attend and vote with the government.</p> <p>The plan also legitimises straightforward bribery. In a throwback to the<a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/archive/feature/old-corruption\"> Old Corruption</a> that was a feature of 19th-century Tory Britain, compliant lords will be “rewarded” with lucrative special envoy positions, and, while those who fail to attend votes will be placed on a “name and shame” list, CBEs and additional titles will be handed out, responding to what is an apparently insatiable demand for the already ennobled to be showered with additional honours on top of their peerages.</p> <p>But the cynicism of the Crosby firm’s paper plumbs new depths when outlining what it calls “useful cover from any media backlash”. The perpetrators of this coup will claim, wholly falsely, that their real aim is to redress the balance between the south-east, which has the largest number of peers, and the north of England, Scotland and Wales, which are underrepresented, as though the award of peerages is a genuine form of levelling up.</p> <p>The paper also suggests that the “perfect excuse” to flood the House of Lords with Johnson’s cronies will be the Lords’ doubts about a hard Brexit, “on the grounds that the ‘People’s Brexit’ can only be delivered by such a wedge of new Tories”.<strong> </strong>This will, it says, provide an “excellent cover” for railroading the nominations. The report is also useful cover for Crosby, whose firm has had close links with the tobacco industry, when it states that the creation of Tory peers is also justified by the refusal so far of the Lords to vote for a “laissez-faire attitude to tobacco manufacturers and importers”.</p> <p>The media, according to the Crosby firm’s paper, can be easily blindsided by the appointment of a few controversial figures or well-known celebrities, which will distract journalists away from the real issue, which is the sheer scale of the gerrymandering.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/22/truth-british-politics-liz-truss-tax\">Being ‘economical with the truth’ has a long history in British politics – but enough is enough | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the claims the House of Lords makes for its existence is that it is a revising chamber, willing to take an independent view and bringing in expertise on a non-party basis; but the Crosby firm’s plot would negate the nomination of such independent peers.</p> <p>Opinion polls show this plan would be opposed by the public: 71% of Britons back <a href=\"https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/latest-news-and-research/media-centre/press-releases/poll-support-for-house-of-lords-at-rock-bottom-as-public-overwhelmingly-back-overhaul/\">overhauling the House of Lords</a> and opposition to the current Lords is as strongly felt among Conservative as Labour voters, among remainers as well as leavers and in the south as well as the north. Support for the second chamber has declined to as low as 12% of the public; and with more than half of the British public thinking the House of Lords <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/confidence-in-the-house-of-lords\">does not work</a>, the solution is to reform the Lords, not reinforce its unrepresentativeness.</p> <p>The Crosby firm’s paper inadvertently makes the case for this radical overhaul. It is “not clear” why most of the members of the Lords were appointed, it says. The Tory ministers in the Lords are “inadequate” with “little to offer”. The leader of the Lords is “a poor political manager”. All of which raises profound questions about what the current appointments system has thrown up and calls into question the unfettered patronage of the prime minister who alone can recommend appointments to the Queen.</p> <p>Past prime ministers have realised that there have to be limits to the use of this power, and Tony Blair and I declined to submit the traditional resignation honours list, the abuse of which has undermined the reputation of a number of past prime ministers.</p> <p>There are, of course, many honourable, dedicated and diligent members of the House of Lords, who should be praised for doing their best for the country and whose contributions to public life make the case for a reformed second chamber.</p> <p>But Johnson’s latest attempt to manipulate the Lords’ system is the culmination of years of constitutional vandalism, during which he and his predecessors have been shameless in their appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/12/boris-johnson-faces-legal-action-over-peerage-for-billionaire-tory-donor-peter-cruddas\">Conservative party donors</a>, rewarding them for what they did to advance a narrow party interest, not the wider public interest.</p> <p>Since 2010, successive prime ministers have <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/want-a-seat-in-the-house-of-lords-be-tory-treasurer-and-donate-3m/\">elevated nine</a> of the party’s former treasurers, each of whom has donated at least £3m to the party prior to their nomination. This has included the Johnson cheerleader Peter Cruddas, whose nomination Johnson <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cynical-system-is-great-untold-scandal-say-former-ministers-hhvgsh0sp\">pushed through</a> even after he was deemed unsuitable by the independent House of Lords Appointments Commission. “Once you pay your £3m, you get your peerage,” one former Conservative party chair said.</p> <p>Money talks, and nowhere more so than in the Lords. Twenty-two of the party’s biggest donors – who together have donated £54m to the Conservatives – have been made lords since 2010. Not only do these 22 have peerages but, as one leading Tory donor, Mohamed Amersi, <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/conservative-party-funding-as-a-tory-donor-i-can-tell-you-the-system-is-undemocratic-access-capitalism-for-privileged-few-mohamed-amersi-3780486\">confirmed this week</a> when talking of “access capitalism”, large cash donations give “a privileged few unrivalled access to decision-makers”, adding up to “as I fear … an implied or expressed quid pro quo” that is “undermining our democracy”. He proposes “a new source of funding that would undermine the current system of the privileged few gaining access”. Indeed the party’s chief fundraiser and co-chair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/05/how-ben-elliot-supercharged-tory-donations-by-targeting-worlds-ultra-wealthy\">Ben Elliot</a>, he says, has taken “access capitalism to a new level within the party” without any proper transparency, which is why he is fittingly known as Mr Access All Areas. And we now know of investigations involving members of the House of Lords into the fast-tracking of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/31/lords-standards-watchdog-investigates-tory-peer-over-vip-ppe-contracts\">lucrative Covid contracts</a>.</p> <p>I tried in 2008 to press ahead with a major reform of the Lords but we were defeated – as previous attempts have been – by the combined weight of peers who favour no reform at all, those who found a reason to disagree with the specifics of our proposed reform and those who claim the only acceptable reform is total abolition. Now it is time to flush out who really wants change and who does not. The preamble to the 1911 Parliament Act stated that the power of the House of Lords was no more than an interim solution until a second chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis could be brought into operation. More than a century on, the modern constitution envisaged then still eludes us.</p> <p>The abolition of the current House of Lords was one of the 10 commitments Keir Starmer made when assuming the Labour party leadership. Now Boris Johnson and Lynton Crosby have handed him the strongest possible case for long overdue reform.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In Sheffield there’s a long, busy road called <a href=\"https://www.sheffieldwire.co.uk/2022/02/28/hearts-are-breaking-sheffield-council-stand-with-twinned-ukrainian-city-donetsk/\">Donetsk Way</a>. And it those links that are one reason the Yorkshire city is now bidding to host next year’s Eurovision song contest, which is coming to the UK but, everyone agrees, should really be in Ukraine.</p> <p>“We are planning to throw the kitchen sink at it,” said <a href=\"https://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=11558\">Ben Miskell</a>, a city councillor and lead on the Eurovision for Sheffield bid. “It is a great opportunity to profile our city but also an opportunity to show solidarity and celebrate the people of Ukraine.”</p> <p>The war is the reason the <a href=\"https://www.ebu.ch/news/2022/07/ebu-uapbc-and-bbc-agree-to-host-2023-eurovision-song-contest-in-the-united-kingdom#:~:text=25%20Jul%202022-,EBU%2C%20UA%3APBC%20and%20BBC%20agree%20to%20host%202023%20Eurovision,broadcaster%2C%20Ukraine%27s%20UA%3APBC.\">European Broadcast Union (EBU) this week announced</a> that with “great regret”, Ukraine, the 2022 winner, was not being asked to host “the largest and most complex music competition in the world”.</p> <p>Instead the UK and the BBC will host on behalf of Ukraine, and the contest to be the venue has already started. Contenders include Glasgow, the bookies’ favourite. Previous hosts in the shape of London, Brighton, Birmingham and Edinburgh. And a string of cities rich in cultural and music heritage including Liverpool, Manchester, Cardiff, Bristol, Belfast, Leeds, Newcastle upon Tyne, Aberdeen and Sheffield.</p> <p>“It was something we leapt at,” said Miskell of the competition to be host city. “Our view is that if it was in the UK then we had a responsibility to throw our hat in the ring. We’ve got a large and developing Ukrainian community in Sheffield and hundreds of families have taken in refugees.”</p> <p>Plus Sheffield has been twinned to Donetsk since 1956, he said. “We want to use the opportunity to demonstrate that shared heritage because really this Eurovision should be Ukraine’s. We are also the <a href=\"https://sheffield.cityofsanctuary.org/\">UK’s first city of sanctuary</a>, so welcoming people from around the world is something that is very close to out hearts.”</p> <p>Hosting Eurovision, this year’s event in Turin was watched by a mind-boggling 161 million people, is an immense undertaking. On Thursday the BBC and EBU sent potential venues details of what would be expected, including having a venue that can hold 10,000 people. Plus there is the security, the welcome party, the European “village”, and two semi-finals.</p> <p>It is a challenge but one Glasgow, fresh from hosting Cop26, could take on, said <a href=\"https://glasgow.gov.uk/SusanAitken\">Susan Aitken</a>, the leader of the city council.</p> <p>“Ultimately it comes down to the practical concerns of staging an event of this scale and complexity at short notice. Glasgow is the safest of safe hands in terms of being able to do that. We are ready to go,” she said.</p> <p>All the bidders know that they are hosting by proxy. “It is Ukraine’s Eurovision and we need to be absolutely clear about that,” she said. “We will be providing a venue on behalf of the people in the nation of Ukraine who won Eurovision 2022 fair and square.”</p> <p>Plus: which other city can say it features in an Abba song? It might sound like Tesco but the verse in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BshxCIjNEjY\">Super Trouper is: “I was sick and tired of everything/ When I called you last night from Glasgow.”</a></p> <p>Next year’s event will not be the usual Eurovision, but it still has to be fun. “If there is anywhere that can put on a party, then it’s Glasgow,” said Aitken.</p> <p><a href=\"https://sports.williamhill.com/betting/en-gb/tv-specials/OB_EV24359357/which-uk-city-will-host-the-eurovision-song-contest-2023\">The bookmakers William Hill make Glasgow the odds on favourite</a> to secure the song contest. Much longer odds, of 22/1, can be had for Leeds. But the passion and determination to get it is equally evident.</p> <p><a href=\"https://democracy.leeds.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=6006\">Jonathan Pryor</a>, the deputy leader of Leeds city council, said it started talking about the possibility of bidding on the night of the contest when it looked like the UK’s Sam Ryder could actually win it.</p> <p>In West Yorkshire there is “the largest and oldest Ukrainian community in the whole of the UK”, Pryor said. “In fact next year will be the 75th anniversary of the West Yorkshire community making their roots here. Connect that to it being <a href=\"https://leeds2023.co.uk/\">Leeds 2023, a year of culture</a> … it just seems to make sense that it comes here.”</p> <p>Whichever city is chosen will follow in the footsteps of memorable UK contests.

The new series by Darren Star is essentially a remake of his 1998-2004 megahit Sex and the City, which was itself essentially a comedy-drama about four gay men written as women – because at the turn of the millennium Ellen had only just come out on her sitcom, and Will &amp; Grace was very much considered as far as you could go with gay jokes and cultural truths and whatnot.</p> <p>Michael (charmingly played by Neil Patrick Harris, last seen on UK small screens breaking our hearts as Henry Coltrane in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/22/its-a-sin-review-russell-t-davies-queer-as-folk-aids-channel-4\">It’s a Sin</a>) is blissfully happy with Colin (Tuc Watkins), his partner of 17 years. Colin, however, is less so and abruptly leaves him on Colin’s 50th birthday – just as the doors are opened on a surprise party Michael has arranged. Whitney Houston’s I Will Always Love You plays, to save time in heightening the pathos and drama.</p> <p>If you also want to save time, you can think of Michael as Carrie Bradshaw – he, too, is needy and self-centred, but possessed of enough spark and warmth to keep his friends and his viewers engaged. His friend Billy (Emerson Brooks), a TV weather presenter with a different Grindr-sourced twink on his arm every night, is Samantha. His ex, Stanley (Brooks Ashmanskas), is Charlotte – a romantic, who helps keep alive Michael’s hope that Colin is caught in a midlife crisis and will soon come back to him. And his straight talking, take-no-prisoners-but-when-will-she-find-a-man-who-can-love-such-a-strong-woman partner at the estate agent firm, where he works, Suzanne (Tisha Campbell) is, of course, Miranda.</p> <p>All that’s missing are the zinging, effortless jokes and credible repartee between characters; unless you count Michael’s mother explaining what a metaphorical “curveball” is because it’s a baseball term, or the leaden exchange between Suzanne and Michael as she commiserates over his loss. “Who knew gay guys were just as awful as straight guys?” “Just with better haircuts,” Michael rejoins, presumably because no one realised that second drafts are rarely as awful as first drafts – and that’s why writers generally bother to do them.</p> <p>Oh, and a decent plot and pacing have gone awol too. Everything is slow, derivative and signposted from a fair few miles away, be it Colin’s pre-party bombshell, the pair’s doomed couple’s counselling session, or Michael’s tentative and equally doomed initial forays on dating apps (awkward dick pics, anyone?) after nearly two decades out of the game.</p> <p>There are bright spots. One of the main ones is the introduction of Marcia Gay Harden as Claire, a demanding middle-aged client who has 5,000sq ft of Manhattan real estate to sell because her husband has abruptly left her (he went off with his 25-year-old Pilates instructor to enjoy “the second half of his life – because clinically obese men often live to 130”). She livens up proceedings whenever she is on screen, although there is nothing innovative about her character or her storyline. Plus, there are occasional mesmerising turns from the likes of Broadway legend André de Shields (a lifetime of experience and overflowing charisma packed into one small scene in an elevator alone makes episode two worth watching.)</p> <p>But overall, Uncoupled feels flat and lifeless. It should have been a triumphant return to form for Star, who has been liberated by 2022 mores from all sorts of constraints, but of course it is not always the case that freedom brings out the greatest creativity. Still, we might have expected better than this.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/29/england-begin-commonwealth-games-netball-title-defence-with-easy-victory","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T14:44:40Z","webTitle":"England begin Commonwealth Games netball title defence with easy victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/england-begin-commonwealth-games-netball-title-defence-with-easy-victory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/29/england-begin-commonwealth-games-netball-title-defence-with-easy-victory","fields":{"headline":"England begin Commonwealth Games netball title defence with easy victory","trailText":"Jess Thirlby’s team defeated Trinidad &amp; Tobago 74-22 in England’s opening game of the 2022 Commonwealth Games netball competition","byline":"Chloe Merrell at NEC Arena","body":"<p>England shook off early jitters to get their Commonwealth Games title defence off to a winning start with a 74-22 victory over Trinidad and Tobago on Friday. A nervous start, marred by several shooting errors, were eventually brushed aside as the Roses found their rhythm in front of an approving home crowd.</p> <p>Shooting at just 43% in the first quarter, Helen Housby, who scored the winning shot in 2018, looked off the beat as the post repeatedly denied her in the opening stages. Forced to turn to the slightly more reliable hands of goal shooter Jo Harten, the continuing flow of gains from the Roses’ defending end enabled England to lead 15-6 at the end of the quarter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/23/england-netballer-eleanor-cardwell-people-tell-me-my-face-has-quite-a-lot-of-emotion\">England netballer Eleanor Cardwell: ‘People tell me my face has quite a lot of emotion’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Upsetting a home team with a title to defend was always going to be a tough ask for the Calypso Girls, who are without two of their best shooters in Samantha Wallace and Khalifa McCollin for the tournament. But the mountain got even harder for them to climb when a resolute Roses returned to court for the second quarter ready to persuade anxious onlookers they were not overawed by the occasion.</p> <p>An eight-goal goal run at the start of the next 15 minutes set the tone for the rest of the game as England wrestled control away from Trinidad and Tobago who, to their credit, were unrelenting in disrupting the Roses’ attacking structures.</p> <p>But their own sloppiness became their downfall as England’s defenders continued to capitalise on the loose balls falling their way. Starting goalkeeper Geva Mentor and local hero Layla Guscoth began by keeping their opposition shooters to single digits at the end of each quarter, which was a feat dutifully maintained by those who came on to replace them.</p> <p>Taking advantage of the growing scoreline gap in England’s favour head coach Jess Thirlby rolled out the changes, giving all 12 of her squad a chance to get a feel for the court and the home crowd. It was ultimately an unsurprising decision given the edginess that defined the first 10 minutes.</p> <p>Among the substitutions it was Commonwealth debutant Eleanor Cardwell who emphatically threw her hand up for a starting seven position with her ice-cold composure. As soon as she entered the court the shooter took on the bulk of the scoring load and with lethal accuracy; putting up all 30 of her shots on the first time of asking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52190e9cf67f268f824e00bbb38ffc82a9d64e0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52190e9cf67f268f824e00bbb38ffc82a9d64e0a/0_89_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Eleanor Cardwell and England’s Helen Housby interact during the Pool B Netball match between England and Trinidad and Tobago.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eleanor Cardwell and Helen Housby celebrate another England point.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isaac Parkin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cardwell’s performance will leave something for Thirlby to chew on as her clean sheet sits in stark comparison to that of Harten and Housby, who finished the game on 83% and 67% respectively. But when it came to their nervy starts the England coach maintained her confidence in her players.</p> <p>“On balance, it’s a good start. It’s a great settler,” said Thirlby after the game. “It would be easy to get derailed by a few uncharacteristic missed shots from Jo and Helen. They’re not rookies, they’ll fix that up.</p> <p>“Overall, we’ll be pleased but a little bit of healthy dissatisfaction as well so that keeps us spurred on to elevate that performance. It was brilliant to get all the girls out. We had five Commonwealth debutants there.”</p> <p>Mentor, who is competing in her sixth Games, added: “We were leaking a lot of energy just with nerves and anticipation.

The great surrealist’s untethered hybrid figures are also evoked in Tobias Gremmler’s hypnotic digital artwork <strong>Fields</strong> (<strong>★★★★☆</strong>), shown as part of the Dance Biennale directed by Wayne McGregor. The festival’s overall theme is “boundary-less” and serves as a rebuttal of any parochial destiny for Brexitland dance as well as a reaffirmation of international collaboration and the merging of artforms with new technologies.</p> <p>The shapeshifting virtual dancers that Gremmler has created for his scenographic installation are cast over parallel gauze screens. These looped sequences find wispy bodies slowly forming to give the briefest of solos, duets and group dances before dissolving within a swirl of motion that abstractly conjures twisting cords of sinew and flowing hair. As the energy builds, dissipates and resurges, it gradually comes to resemble a series of life cycles, one ethereal dance after another within a vortex of space and time.</p> <p>Fields achieves its greater power when two figures merge into one mass before separating, each left with an imprint of the other when they move on. As in a real pas de deux, the dancers colour each other’s performance and unite to become greater than the sum of their parts. These digital dances are devoid of the sweat, characterisation and sheer immediacy of human performance but, crucially, not the emotion. Fields’s poignancy is thanks in part to the soundscape’s eerily soothing notes offset against rumbling surges of bass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8264556d655724e2415be903503ddc66c6dbae2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8264556d655724e2415be903503ddc66c6dbae2e/0_0_2126_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virtual dancers in Fields by Tobias Gremmler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eerily soothing …Fields by Tobias Gremmler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Avezzù</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gremmler, whose previous motion-capture work has included collaborations with Björk, essentially frees these spirit-dancers who fly, float and at one point meet like trapeze artists in mid-air. Their limbs can become wings, we recognise a back bend or leg extension take shape before fading away, and the melting of so much virtual flesh is both playful and profound as the figures – shunted about by forces beyond their control – strive to connect during their brief existence.</p> <p>Elsewhere in McGregor’s programme there’s no shortage of living, breathing dancers. Fifteen of them can be found in Gauthier Dance’s <strong>The Seven Sins</strong> (<strong>★★★☆☆</strong>), a portmanteau show with an aptly enviable lineup of choreographers, one for each transgression. Dropping the “deadly” from the title hints at a compassion for some of these sinners, such as Marco Goecke’s portrait of a glutton, addicted not to food but heroin. It is a bare-chested solo with a kind of midnight energy, dancer Gaetano Signorelli’s skin itching and his chain belt jangling, although setting the piece to the Velvet Underground’s Heroin is too on the nose – you already feel the rush and run in Signorelli’s burning whirl.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9c4757469deea96f24bf60ac0cc69d5ef25a5d8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c4757469deea96f24bf60ac0cc69d5ef25a5d8b/0_0_7210_4724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Seven Sins – Pride, choreography by Marcos Morau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Seven Sins – Pride, choreography by Marcos Morau.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeanette Bak</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a choreographer, the sin of sloth is perhaps the short straw or the wild card. While the stark accompaniment to Aszure Barton’s duet suggests a pianist barely mustering the energy to play, her dancers are locked in a restless fidget: an embodiment of how sloth makes you feel rather than the behaviour itself. One dancer bangs his head on the floor; neither knows what to do with themselves. But their apathy can’t help but become infectious and it’s not the only piece to run out of steam. The same goes for Sharon Eyal’s otherwise lambent study of envy, which has the evening’s most balletic language, and Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s opening essay on greed, featuring philosophising voiceover and dancers with grabby hands, dressed in coin-coloured suits and banknote scarves.</p> <p>Several of the choreographers embed their sin in an everyday reality. Sasha Waltz’s raging strobe-lit dance of wrath between a couple, their screams on loop, spirals from an apparently domestic spat to an epic face-off and existential rage. When the houselights come up for Marcos Morau’s piece, you’re left reflecting on your own pride as well as that of five women in matching blue dresses, each ready for their closeup. Morau gives us pride as a kind of cult, with incantations that demand your attention; it bristles with angular arrangements and sharp elbows to the fore.</p> <p>You’d expect Hofesh Shechter’s exercise in lust to really thrum but the bulk of his movement is slow-motion, the dancers struck with shame by their desire. Shechter’s piece stands out for showing his subjects’ self-awareness of their sin. Despite being distractingly dressed in white outfits that recall Woody Allen’s comedic white-suited sperm, these are bodies convincingly overriden by urges – the trembling limbs of the opening movements leading to a finale in which half the dancers crawl helplessly towards the open legs of the others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"decff1ebfdcd3881898a2edf50baa44bff111363\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/decff1ebfdcd3881898a2edf50baa44bff111363/0_0_4016_6016/668.jpg\" alt=\"Carnación by Rocío Molina.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carnación by Rocío Molina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © Simone Fratini</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Together the pieces don’t gain quite enough collective power and you wish more of the choreographers had cut loose with the hamminess of the concept to match the schlocky whispering of each sin’s name in between the pieces.</p> <p>What they lack is known in flamenco as <em>duende</em> – a powerful hit of pure emotion and connection. That’s in no short supply in <strong>Carnación</strong> (<strong>★★★★☆</strong>) by the <em>bailaora</em> and choreographer Rocío Molina, who was awarded the festival’s Silver Lion.</p> <p>This is Molina’s own reckoning not with sin but myriad forms of desire, principally the sexual and spiritual. Juan Kruz’s elegantly stark set design has an installation of four benches toppling domino-like into a fifth that defiantly stands strong, going against the flow. It’s a neat symbol for Molina’s modus operandi as she upends traditions and expectations with impish humour and disarming openness.</p> <p>She goes headfirst into the material – literally so in the opening routines as, bathed in pink light, she repeatedly scales the back of a chair centre-stage, sliding downwards to caress its seat with her face, legs raised behind her in the air. This leaves the soles of her shoes on display – an arrestingly personal perspective which enhances the impact of Molina’s bursts of furious footwork. Later one of those shoes is hurled at the violinist, Maureen Choi.</p> <p>It takes a while to adjust to Carnación’s particular rhythms as it unfurls at an unrushed pace, most strikingly in scenes of rope-binding as Molina gags her superb singer, Niño de Elche, who tenderly takes part in a ritual of submission and dominance at odds with any assumptions about the artform’s machismo. Molina’s shiny plait becomes yet another rope as she places it in his mouth and leads him around the stage; later she undresses to bind her own body in scenes that, like those exposed shoe soles, help us feel the flamenco slaps on thigh and chest. In a production where clothes are to be bitten as well as worn, her costumes include a smock and a huge wicker basket that serves as a skirt and then a headpiece and even becomes her prison. Such outfits often obscure her arms, accentuating exceptional wristwork.</p> <p>Molina has an amazing controlled presence though the piece might achieve an even more distilled power if it fluctuated less in tone. But that is the milk of Carrington’s dreams and as the wicker-wearing Molina practically dissolves into a back wall amid this loving procession of fantasy, the bold <em>bailaora </em>turns<em> </em>surrealist too.</p> <ul> <li><p>Venice’s 16th International festival of Contemporary Dance <a href=\"https://www.labiennale.org/en/dance/2022\">runs until 31 July</a>.

Terese, who had previously kicked Paul out because he *checks notes* <em>bought a baby</em> is facing the reality of life without him, and she does not like it. Can they make it work? Personally, I’m hoping this dastardly fraudster and sometimes-murderer learns to enjoy his own company and stops ruining the lives of perfectly nice women, which would be a twist for the ages.</p> <p>They’re not the only older folk trying to navigate love, though. Jane (Annie Jones), who has been doing a fantastic impression of her interfering nan, Nell Mangel, has broken things off with Clive (Geoff Paine) and he is not taking it well. But just as Jane starts to come around, a familiar face appears – it’s criminally still-hot Mike Young (Guy Pearce), on an actual motorbike. Violins play. Everyone is in soft focus. Decades of yearning for the one that got away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84bc5244fdbd6c82ba49cea8ac7c801bb99fed91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84bc5244fdbd6c82ba49cea8ac7c801bb99fed91/0_0_2560_1689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Young (Guy Pearce) and Jane (Annie Jones) in a scene from Neighbours\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Mike Young and Jane Harris rekindle their old love story?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Network Ten</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After all this time, will young love be the winner on the day?

It’s the ultimate Neighbours quiz! </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ooh, and Izzy (Nat Bass) is back! Remember when she gave birth to Karl’s baby during Karl and Susan’s wedding? What a scream. She recently claimed to be in love with their son, Mal (Benjie McNair), who is her daughter’s half-brother. But all was not as it seemed, and she was easily wooed by a mid-range Mercedes-Benz containing Shane Ramsay (Peter O’Brien). Having broken Mal’s heart, Izzy realised what she has truly wanted this whole time – Susan’s approval (same, Izzy). Will she finally get it?</p> <p>In the meantime, young people are doing things. Kyle and Roxy, who only recently left the street, have returned to cause trouble and perhaps give birth early for the drama (this author speculates wildly). Elsewhere, the women are all pretty lovelorn: Mackenzie is a grieving widow, Kiri is a tossed-aside girlfriend and Chloe is pining for a friend who was more than that. But it’s not all doom and gloom – David, Aaron and Nicolette are heading to New York with David’s twin, Leo and Paul … unless things change with Terese, and we get the strong sense that’s very much the plan.</p> <p>And, as ever, there’s a Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) wedding on the horizon. The last time Toadie got married, his wedding blew up some of his friends before his wife died of ovarian cancer after he had cheated on her with Fake Dee (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/21/neighbours-jumps-the-shark-can-toadies-goatee-and-a-bonkers-plot-twist-save-the-soap\">an impostor of a previous wife Toadie had driven into the sea</a>). This time, he’s betrothed to Melanie (Lucinda Cowden), a character who first appeared on the show in 1987 when Toadie was merely a rat tail-sporting youngster, so good on her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b8aded8c624b93116d90a2bdcd8f465d37b635f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8aded8c624b93116d90a2bdcd8f465d37b635f3/0_0_11648_8736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and Melanie (Lucinda Cowden)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can Toadie and this woman he met recently make it down the aisle?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Network Ten</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course there is drama leading up to this latest wedding, with Amy (Jacinta Stapleton) having declared her love for Toad before fleeing to Far North Queensland. Will it go ahead? Of course it absolutely will, and if there’s no bizarre death scene afterwards we will descend on the empty studio at first light.</p> <h2>What can we expect?</h2> <p>The penultimate episode set the tone for a big night of tears in the finale. As the credits rolled, we were left with a sense of what Neighbours has always really been about: broken hearts, second chances and being there for one another.</p> <p>Many question marks remain. Will Scott and Charlene come home? Will Toadie marry yet another definitely-doomed wife? Will anyone embrace tradition and get in a taxi to move to Queensland? How is Guy Pearce still that fine? Will Afro Harold make a surprise appearance? WHO WILL EXPLODE? And, most importantly, did these beloved characters, some of whom you’ve just met, ever find the perfect blend?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"723ca9b0c132b0de907cafe2bc8e3db7d307e29b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/723ca9b0c132b0de907cafe2bc8e3db7d307e29b/0_0_2560_1703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott and Charlene in a promo image for Neighbours’ final week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will this window make Scott and Charlene truly happy?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Network Ten</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A promo of the finale depicts the good doctor and Susan Kennedy bewildered by the sudden listing of every house on the street. Inevitably, lives are changing – Aaron and David off to New York, Toadie moving on from the past, a new career opportunity for Terese, a fresh start for Chloe, and a change of heart for the newly arrived Rodwells. Will they really all sell up? Can the Kennedys keep living on the iconic street even after their friends are gone?</p> <p>As we close the TV guide on our beloved show for good, I’ll be watching – ready to suspend disbelief and probably cry.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Neighbours’ final episode airs </em><em>on Friday 29 July at 9pm on Channel 5</em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/29/us-to-hold-push-for-covid-boosters-until-fall-in-order-to-better-protect-against-ba5","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T14:11:52Z","webTitle":"US to hold push for Covid boosters until fall in order to better protect against BA.5","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/29/us-to-hold-push-for-covid-boosters-until-fall-in-order-to-better-protect-against-ba5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/29/us-to-hold-push-for-covid-boosters-until-fall-in-order-to-better-protect-against-ba5","fields":{"headline":"US to hold push for Covid boosters until fall in order to better protect against BA.5","trailText":"Pfizer and Moderna expected to roll out reformulated boosters, likely to be authorized for anyone 12 and older, in September","byline":"Sam Levine in New York","body":"<p>Instead of expanding eligibility for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/fourth-covid-jab-can-give-higher-immunity-than-initial-booster-study-finds\">fourth Covid-19 booster shot</a> now, the Biden administration will push this fall to get Americans to take another booster vaccination that is predicted to better protect against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/21/why-are-there-so-many-omicron-subvariants-and-why-have-ba4-and-ba5-taken-hold\">Omicron BA.5 subvariant</a> of the coronavirus.</p> <p>Pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna are expected to start rolling out the reformulated boosters, which are expected to be authorized for anyone 12 and older, in September.</p> <p>The decision comes amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/us-covid-surge-cases-rate\">a surge in cases of the virus</a> across the US – and Biden himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/biden-tests-negative-covid-ended-isolation\">recently recovered</a> from an infection.</p> <p>Some of the administration’s top health experts, including presidential adviser Anthony Fauci and White House Covid coordinator Ashish Jha, had advocated for expanding eligibility for a second dose of the current booster because of the latest spread.</p> <p>But public health officials worried that administering two different booster shots so close together could blunt their effectiveness.</p> <p>“You can’t get a vaccine shot August 1 and get another vaccine shot September 15 and expect the second shot to do anything,” Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/us/politics/covid-booster-shots.html\">told the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>“You’ve got so much antibody around, if you get another dose, it won’t do anything.”</p> <p>The decision means that adults over 50 and those who are immunocompromised remain the only ones <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html\">authorized for a second booster</a>, ie their fourth shot since the vaccine began being administered widely in 2021.

The NHS? Some of the key issues ignored by Sunak and Truss","trailText":"Tory leadership candidates have clashed bitterly but many pressing matters have been overlooked","byline":"Heather Stewart","body":"<p>Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have clashed vehemently over tax and spending, immigration and the UK’s stance on China in their acrimonious battle to become prime minister – but have had little to say about many other pressing issues. Here are some largely overlooked key issues of the contest so far.</p> <h2>Standards in public life</h2> <p>Boris Johnson was swept out of office when his own MPs could no longer defend or explain the repeated untruths emanating from No 10. He had breached Covid regulations, allowed an alleged serial sexual harasser to be appointed to the whips’ office and seen two ethics advisers resign in disgust.</p> <p>Yet cleaning up politics has barely featured in the debate – and indeed, Sunak and Truss have felt the need to defend Johnson, with Sunak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/12/dominic-raab-grant-shapps-back-rishi-sunak-tory-leadership-race\">saying at his launch event</a> that the outgoing prime minister has “a good heart”.</p> <p>There have been some hints at change – Truss said at Thursday’s hustings that she would move the Tory whips’ office back into No 12 Downing Street, to allow MPs’ conduct to be more closely monitored, and Sunak has said he would appoint a new ethics adviser. But neither has fully addressed the need to rebuild public trust in politics after the Johnson era.</p> <h2>The NHS</h2> <p>Before Tuesday’s TalkTV debate was brought to an abrupt halt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/26/tv-debate-between-truss-and-sunak-cancelled-after-presenter-faints\">by the presenter fainting</a>, the candidates were challenged by John, a cancer patient, who asked: “Why is the NHS broken?”</p> <p>It was one of the few moments in the campaign so far when the parlous state of the health service has been mentioned. Truss said she wanted to see layers of NHS management stripped away, and Sunak pointed to the importance of new technologies.</p> <p>But neither had a solution to the immediate, pressing crisis, with more than 6.6 million people waiting for care. Truss even admitted her local hospital was in such a bad state it was held up with “stilts”, but did not have much to say about how that could be rectified.</p> <h2>Social care</h2> <p>The NHS’s problems are closely entwined with the crumbling state of the social care system, which has barely featured in the leadership campaign.</p> <p>Truss has said she would go ahead with Johnson’s plans for an £86,000 cap on the amount individuals would have to pay towards their own care, despite cancelling the tax rise earmarked to pay for it. Sunak would presumably do so, too, given that legislation has already been passed enacting it.</p> <p>But neither has had much to say about how they would ensure the system provides a better quality of care.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Brexit realism</h2> <p>Brexit has been mentioned in the race, with the candidates promising to slash EU red tape – and Sunak ribbing Truss for having campaigned for remain.</p> <p>Truss has said she would press ahead with her confrontational Northern Ireland protocol bill, risking a trade war. Sunak suggested in Thursday’s hustings that the legislation would create “free-flowing trade” with no need for a border – echoing Johnson’s insouciance when he told Northern Ireland businesses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/08/boris-johnson-goods-from-northern-ireland-to-gb-wont-be-checked-brexit\">they should “bin” any forms</a> they were asked to sign.</p> <p>But there has been little realistic discussion of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jul/28/dover-brexit-travel-operators-demand-action-not-blame-over-cross-channel-delays\">queues at Dover</a> as families wait to have their passports stamped, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/30/brexit-uk-exports-fall-eu-goods-services\">decline in trade with the EU</a>, or a string of other practical challenges.</p> <h2>Covid</h2> <p>The pandemic has been invoked with hindsight during the campaign: Sunak boasted of his involvement in preventing a Christmas lockdown in December 2021, while Truss questioned whether schools should ever have been closed.</p> <p>There has been little discussion of managing current and future waves of Covid. While it has slipped out of the headlines, the virus has continued to cause mass staff absences and consume valuable NHS resources, despite Omicron and its subvariants being less dangerous than predecessors.</p> <p>With a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/15/covid-boosters-who-could-be-eligible-for-autumn-jabs-in-uk\">booster programme</a> coming in the autumn, and the ever-present threat of more deadly variants, the new prime minister may have to make vital decisions about tackling the virus.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/29/marc-cucurella-submits-transfer-request-in-bid-to-seal-manchester-city-move-brighton","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T14:04:01Z","webTitle":"Marc Cucurella submits transfer request in bid to seal Manchester City move","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/marc-cucurella-submits-transfer-request-in-bid-to-seal-manchester-city-move-brighton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/29/marc-cucurella-submits-transfer-request-in-bid-to-seal-manchester-city-move-brighton","fields":{"headline":"Marc Cucurella submits transfer request in bid to seal Manchester City move","trailText":"Marc Cucurella has handed in a transfer request in an attempt to force through a move form Brighton to Manchester City","byline":"Fabrizio Romano and Sachin Nakrani","body":"<p>Marc Cucurella has handed in a transfer request in an attempt to force through a move from Brighton to Manchester City.</p> <p>The Spanish left-back is determined to join the Premier League champions before the close of the window, having seen their offer of £30m for him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/21/brighton-reject-manchester-city-30m-marc-cucurella-bid-and-demand-50m\">rejected by Brighton</a>.</p> <p>The south-coast club want £50m for Cucurella, who has made a huge impact since joining from Getafe for £15.4m last year. The 24-year-old was named Brighton’s player of the season and has been targeted by Pep Guardiola for much of the summer. City’s decision to submit a bid way below asking price appears a classic case of a club attempting to unsettle a player in order to seal a transfer and appears to have worked, with Cucurella submitting his transfer request having again made clear to staff at Brighton that he wants to leave for life at the Etihad Stadium.</p> <p>Asked about Cucurella at his pre-Community Shield press conference on Friday, Guardiola said: “He’s a Brighton player, I cannot say anything else.” The City manager did admit, however, that left-back is an area where he is looking to strengthen following the departure of Oleksandr Zinchenko to Arsenal. João Cancelo is City’s only current senior specialist option in that position. “If it’s possible, yes [to strengthen at left-back],” said Guardiola. “If it’s not, we stay with what we have.”</p> <p>Brighton remain determined to keep Cucurella and are in a strong position to do so given he has four years remaining on his contract.

Not for the endless sari shopping, but because it involved snacks I wouldn’t often get at home: crispy potato bhajia, samosas, chaat, mogo, dokhla and falooda – a rose-flavoured dessert drink. It’s rare to get a really good falooda because it’s such a fine balance of rose syrup, generous quantities of basil seeds – which bloom into a frogspawn consistency when soaked – vermicelli noodles and vanilla ice-cream. In short, a thing of magic.</p> <h2><strong>Falooda</strong><strong> (Indian rose dessert drink</strong><strong>)</strong></h2> <p>Don’t skimp on the rose syrup. It can usually be found in litre bottles in international supermarkets.

Set this aside or in the fridge if you’re making it ahead.</p> <p>Rinse the basil seeds in cold water and put them in a large bowl with enough water to cover. Set this aside for five minutes; you will notice that they will “bloom” and start to look like frogspawn. (These can be kept in a container in the fridge for three days and strained before use.)</p> <p>Put a medium pan of water over a medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add the vermicelli and simmer gently for five to 10 minutes, until softened. Strain and set aside to cool. I like to keep the vermicelli relatively long for falooda, but not so long that they are hard to eat. Use a pair of scissors to trim them to your desired length – I cut them to 10cm.</p> <p>In a separate pan. make a sugar syrup : heat 60ml water and stir in the sugar. Once it has a syrupy consistency, add the strained vermicelli, remove from the heat and let them steep for half an hour.</p> <p>For the rose jelly, heat 350ml water with the remaining 20g rose syrup in a medium saucepan. When it has reached a gentle simmer, add the agar agar and whisk well. Remove from the heat and pour into a shallow heatproof container lined with clingfilm.</p> <p>Leave this to cool to room temperature, then put in the fridge to chill completely and set – about four hours. </p> <p>To assemble, take four tall glasses. Put a teaspoon of the basil seeds in the bottom of each glass, followed by a heaped tablespoon of the soaked vermicelli. Add the ice in large chunks on top (I like quite a lot – up to half the glass) and mix briefly. Add a tablespoon of the rose jelly, then the milk, and mix briefly. Finish with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream on the top of each glass. Garnish with chopped pistachios, if you like.

But a <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0166-2236%2822%2900101-1\" title=\"\">new scientific review</a> argues that “sleep debt” cannot always be paid back, with some of the damage from sustained sleep deprivation likely to be irreversible. Are lie-ins meaningless? On a sunny Monday, I asked Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, director of the University of Surrey’s sleep research centre.</p> <p><strong>Did you get a good night’s sleep?</strong><br>It wasn’t too bad, but studies show Sunday or Monday often aren’t good.</p> <p><strong>Is that just from worrying about work the next day?</strong><br>Yes, but also because most people sleep longer at the weekend. So if you wake on Monday at 6am with only a few hours of missed sleep – only a little sleep debt – because you napped at the weekend, your brain will let you stay up worrying on Monday night. By midweek you’ll have missed even more sleep so your brain won’t let you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>So some sleep debt is useful?</strong><br>Ultimately, there’s a payoff between how long you sleep and how deep you sleep. Not spending enough time in bed is one thing, but another way to induce poor quality sleep is spending too much time in bed. It’s about finding the right balance for you.</p> <p><strong>I honestly think if I found the balance I wouldn’t be able to recognise it anyway. Can’t you just tell me what to do? Please?</strong><br>Don’t ask me for an easy answer. There are none.</p> <p><strong>Ain’t that the truth! OK, back to this review – has it put paid to the idea we can repair our sleep-deprived selves?</strong><br>That study is about the neuro consequences of chronic sleep disruption. That’s different from: “Should I catch up on sleep at the weekend?” One<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsr.12712\" title=\"\"> study followed more than 43,000 subjects for 13 years</a> to look at sleep duration and mortality. Sleeping less than five hours is a predictor of mortality. But people who always miss out on sleep are different from those who catch up on weekends. To some extent, weekend sleep can compensate. It’s common sense.</p> <p><strong>Well that’s great!</strong><br>Now, in terms of chronic sleep disruption, we do see serious negative consequences, such as a risk of cognitive decline. But that’s not surprising, is it?</p> <p><strong>I’d still like to know more about the limitations of a lie-in: </strong><strong>if you have a newborn and aren’t sleeping, can that damage be repaired?</strong><br>There are mechanisms that allow us to sleep less under certain circumstances. It’s in other species, too, such as migrating birds. I’ve not seen any evidence that being a tired mother leads to long-lasting detriment. Studies on night workers show cognitive decline, but some recovery is possible once they move away from working those shifts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/15/why-do-people-attack-artworks-we-ask-an-expert\">Why do people attack artworks?

It is still, in spirit, a children’s story but contains all the grit and gore of war and feels far darker than the 1950 novel.</p> <p>Anxiety about the war swarms the lives of siblings Lucy (Delainey Hayles), Peter (Ammar Duffus), Edmund (Shaka Kalokoh) and Susan (Robyn Sinclair). A beautiful rendition of We’ll Meet Again opens the show to signpost the siblings’ evacuation from London to Inverness during the blitz, and underline their forced displacement to an alien world.</p> <p>The war follows them into the wardrobe which is full of repeated battle cries – everyone from the White Witch and Aslan to Mrs Beaver and Santa Claus reminds us that “war is upon us” – and Peter, the eldest child, speaks of his father flying planes, beyond Narnia.</p> <p>But there is the most riveting spectacle alongside this darkness. Michael Fentiman’s touring production fits this enormous West End stage like a glove. Tom Paris’s design is a wonder, with a giant clock face as a backdrop to mark the disparity between real-world time and Narnia’s parallel universe. The cut out circle at its centre visually builds on the idea of a portal to another world and is used to heighten the drama as figures appear in it in moments of extremis.</p> <p>Samantha Womack’s White Witch is all hard edges and glaring looks yet resists becoming a pantomime villain. Her wolves, played by actors, are comic grotesques that scuttle disturbingly, with Maugrim (Emmanuel Ogunjinmi) a terrifying mix of robot and growling animal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c797a5a4a96dfc4a44544af0ab00833c75672bab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c797a5a4a96dfc4a44544af0ab00833c75672bab/0_0_748_1070/699.jpg\" alt=\"White Witch … Samantha Womack in The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.\" width=\"699\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Note-perfect villain … Samantha Womack in The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aslan is a truly magnificent creation, represented both by an awesome puppet (manipulated by Oliver Grant, Sean Lopeman and Shaun McCourt, full of fluid leonine motions) and by an actor (Chris Jared) with a shaggy coat and mane of hair. This doubleness is ingenious and we believe in them both.</p> <p>Max Humphries’s puppetry design and Toby Olié’s puppetry direction are perfection, not least the professor’s house cat, mischievously called Schrödinger. There is fabulous hybridity to the animals: some played by actors, others by puppets, and it feels deeply considered. The magic is a marvel too, full of breathtaking tricks thanks to the help of illusionist Chris Fisher, with characters disappearing into thin air.</p> <p>The show is a development of a 2017 production directed by Sally Cookson and contains some of her signature aesthetics, including aerial work alongside white sheets that work their own homespun magic. There is one coup de theatre in which the White Witch transforms magnificently in shape and size. Even the smaller magic tricks – such as sneezes that produce flowers – bring delightful eccentricity.</p> <p>The central switch in setting from the professor’s home to the ice kingdom of Narnia, with the wardrobe as a gateway, is completed within seconds and the visual thrill of this transformation is exhilarating each time we see it.</p> <p>There is a magnificent gothicism to Jack Knowles’s elegantly creepy lighting and to Ian Dickinson and Gareth Tucker’s sound design. Musicians appear as ghostly spectres (they also double up as far cuter woodland animals); there is martial drumming and the dissonant chords of violins and cellos and voice distortion are used to sinister effect. Folk and ballad songs composed by Benji Bower and Barnaby Race bring a lovely musicality to the show, even if they slow the action down.</p> <p>The pace has a stately grandeur; nothing is rushed and some scenes come to feel a little inert. The siblings, played efficiently by adult actors, are a little featureless at first but these are quibbles in a show that is orchestrated masterfully.</p> <p>“Not all darkness can be conquered,” we are reminded and the happy ending does not feel like a foregone conclusion at all.

While many species that have left their habitats come back naturally, some need to be reintroduced by humans.</p> <p>Frans Schepers, executive director of Rewilding Europe, expressed his gratitude to the Arcadia Fund, saying that he was “thrilled, humbled and hugely gratified” by the continued trust placed in them by Arcadia.</p> <p>Schepers, who was one of Rewilding’s four co-founders more than a decade ago, said the grant would also contribute significantly to their “Strategy 2030”, a strategic plan initiated in 2021, that sets the year 2030 as a deadline to expand the number of rewilding landscapes across the continent from 10 to 15.</p> <p>While the new landscapes are yet to be announced, it has been confirmed that they will include marine and coastal ecosystems, a first for the project, and will bring the combined area to around 8m hectares, roughly the size of Scotland.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/29/latest-uk-covid-wave-past-peak-as-infections-fall-by-half-a-million-in-a-week","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T13:31:20Z","webTitle":"Latest UK Covid wave past peak as infections fall by half a million in a week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/latest-uk-covid-wave-past-peak-as-infections-fall-by-half-a-million-in-a-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/29/latest-uk-covid-wave-past-peak-as-infections-fall-by-half-a-million-in-a-week","fields":{"headline":"Latest UK Covid wave past peak as infections fall by half a million in a week","trailText":"ONS data shows rates nevertheless ‘still remain among the highest seen during the course of the pandemic’","byline":"Ian Sample Science editor","body":"<p>The UK’s latest wave of Covid appears to have passed its peak, with infections falling by more than half a million in a week, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/29july2022\">ONS estimates</a>, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, suggest the number of people infected in the UK fell by 586,400 in the week ending 20 July. Covid rates remain close to an all-time high, however, with an estimated 3,173,800 people, about 1 in 19, testing positive across the country in the most recent week surveyed.</p> <p>There has been a similar decline in Covid infections in hospitals, with the UK Health Security Agency <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2022-to-2023-season\">reporting on Thursday</a> that Covid case rates edged downwards across all age groups, regions and ethnic groups in the third week of July. Case rates are highest in the over-80s, the most vulnerable to severe Covid.</p> <p>According to the ONS data, the number of infections in England fell in the week ending 20 July, with 1 in 20 infected, compared with 1 in 17 the week before. In Scotland and Wales the estimated infection rates fell to 1 in 19, but in Northern Ireland the trend was uncertain, with 1 in 16 estimated to test positive, up from 1 in 20 the week before.</p> <p>“Our most recent data suggest that we may now be over the peak of the latest wave of infections across the UK, although rates still remain among the highest seen during the course of the pandemic,” said Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the ONS Covid-19 Infection Survey.</p> <p>“We have seen welcome decreases among most parts of the UK and in all age groups. With summer holidays starting and more people travelling, we will continue to closely monitor the data,” she added.</p> <p>The most recent wave of Covid is the third to hit the UK since December. The first wave, fuelled by the original Omicron variant BA.1, was swiftly followed by a second wave in March driven by the Omicron subvariant BA.2. At the peak of the second wave, a record 4.9 million people were infected in a single week, about 1 in 13 of the population.</p> <p>The most recent wave was fuelled by two more Omicron subvariants, namely BA.4 and BA.5, which started to gain ground in June, though BA.5 now accounts for more than three-quarters of UK cases. It is unclear whether BA.5 spreads faster because of higher transmissibility, its ability to evade immunity from vaccines and previous infections, or a mix of both.</p> <p>Covid rates fell across all regions of England except the north-east and in all age groups, the ONS found.</p> <p>Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said government testing data pointed towards a dip in Covid cases and the latest ONS results, which lag behind the real-time situation, confirmed this.</p> <p>“This is great news, but of course we will see future outbreaks as our immunity contracts and as new variants arise,” he said. “It’s always difficult to predict when the next wave will occur, but the chances will increase as we approach the autumn and winter periods – a time that many respiratory infections do the rounds.”</p> <p>Public health officials are concerned that the autumn and winter could bring a resurgence of influenza and another wave of Covid. On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/15/over-50s-in-england-to-be-offered-covid-booster-and-flu-jab-in-autumn\">advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation</a>, all those aged 50 and over, frontline health and social care workers, residents of care homes for older people, and others who are clinically vulnerable will be offered flu and Covid shots to reduce cases of severe disease.</p> <p>“Given the inevitability of a new wave of infections, it is incredibly important that the most vulnerable in our community get boosted, both for Covid-19 and for flu,” Ball added.</p> <p>Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said: “It’s encouraging that we appear to have reached the peak of infections, but prevalence remains incredibly high with something like 1 in 20 people being infected last week.</p> <p>“Hospitalisations have also seemingly peaked, but it is likely that the increase in deaths we are seeing will continue to increase. Moreover, this high prevalence will sadly translate into more long Covid cases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Looking forward, it’s pretty clear that we can expect further waves over the course of 2022, which may also coincide with a predicted influenza surge in the autumn.

But did anyone really win?","trailText":"The appetite to watch women fighting is infinite, and Vardy v Rooney has given us enough material to keep going for decades, says Guardian columnist Zoe Williams","byline":"Zoe Williams","body":"<p>The verdict has been reached in one of the most expensive libel cases in British history: Rebekah Vardy v Coleen Rooney, or to give it its proper name, Wagatha Christie. It was so dramatically nonsensical that for the court to merely put it up on its website feels rather inadequate. The judge should have delivered it in a self-destructing Snapchat, or at the very least, in skywriting.</p> <p>Nonetheless, here it is: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/rebekah-vardy-loses-libel-case-against-coleen-rooney-wagatha-christie\">Coleen Rooney won</a>. But before we drill into whether we agree with that, as a newspaper (joking! I speak only for myself, and I do agree with it), here’s a quick recap into what went down between Vardy and Rooney, and the social conditions that created their epic dispute.</p> <p>Between September 2017 and October 2019, a number of stories appeared in the tabloid newspapers which led Rooney to suspect that a member of her friendship circle had been leaking them. The details veered between the mundane (a flooded basement), the faintly embarrassing (a plan to revive her TV career) and the bizarre and potentially reputation-damaging (she’d travelled to Mexico to look into a gender-selected baby treatment).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/rebekah-vardy-loses-libel-case-against-coleen-rooney-wagatha-christie\">Rebekah Vardy loses ‘Wagatha Christie’ libel case against Coleen Rooney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through a complex social media process that probably has a name like “forensic triangulation”, Rooney spent five months considering likely culprits, before restricting her Instagram access to just one, and staging a car crash. She sat back and waited for the fake story to appear in the Sun. It duly did. She then dramatically told the world that the leaks were coming from Rebekah Vardy’s account. I will not trouble you with who these women are married to, it’ll take too long – let’s just say “footballers”.</p> <p>This all played out in late 2019, and was incredibly gripping, penetrating normally unbreachable barriers such as “I’m not interested in football” and “I’m too depressed about Brexit to be interested in anything”. This was in part because Rooney is a natural digital storyteller, her keen visual sense colliding with an innate understanding of the mechanisms of suspense.</p> <p>But it’s mainly because the media mines Rooney – indeed all these wives and girlfriends – as constant sources of banal copy. They’re fighting, or they’ve lost weight, or they’ve gained weight, or they’re showcasing a new eye shadow. The stories that are weird enough to be diverting – like that Mexico trip – are unlikely to be true, and the stories that are true usually don’t even pretend to meet a minimum standard of human interest. The women are treated as baubles, their personalities hollowed out by the tedium of the content derived from them.</p> <p>So then Rooney steps out with a view, a plan, a scheme, some feelings, and it restores her lost selfhood – a bit like staring at the Mona Lisa and her suddenly speaking to you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f11003aaf92d2a34f2b2d10d440d860b979b80e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f11003aaf92d2a34f2b2d10d440d860b979b80e/0_14_3513_2108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coleen Rooney arriving at the high court in London, 12 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coleen Rooney arriving at the high court in London, 12 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As far as Rooney was concerned, her job was done. But by June 2020, Vardy felt that her own reputation had been so profoundly tarnished that her only option was to launch libel proceedings. Perhaps she didn’t heed the advice she was given (she seems not to have been expecting so much damn <em>content </em>to be required by Mrs Justice Steyn in the establishment of the facts). Out they poured, the WhatsApp messages between Vardy and her agent, Caroline Watt. They honestly read like an anxiety dream we must all have had in our worst moments – quick to slur, slow on the uptake, right there in green and white for everyone to see.</p> <p>The libel case wasn’t a mistake because it was so revealing of Vardy, or because its costs look set to reach £3m, thanks to the reported £800 an hour fees of Rooney and Vardy’s barristers, as each woman raced to match the financial firepower of the other. It was a mistake because the appetite to watch women fighting with each other is infinite, and only ever limited by the finite amount of material. Now we have enough to keep us going for decades.</p> <p>In a week that could end with England winning the Euros, isn’t it interesting that we don’t care at all what the women’s team’s Habs (husbands and boyfriends) are like, never mind whether they get on with each other? Years ago, I interviewed Kim Cattrall at the height of Sex and the City, when there was a rumour that that four-way ensemble all hated each other, and I asked her about it. She said (I paraphrase) “Our show is made alternately with the Sopranos, and yet I have never seen anyone ask whether they got on with each other.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/wagatha-christie-from-serious-legal-argument-to-pop-culture-event-rebekah-vardy-coleen-rooney\">‘Wagatha Christie’: from serious legal argument to pop-culture event</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a fair point, succinctly made: the fascination with a bitch fight is rooted in garden variety sexism, a bid to infantilise women, erode their credibility and minimise their emotional range while amplifying their histrionics. And yet at the same time, I’m not at all interested in whether James Gandolfini got on with Tony Sirico. Just because you recognise that there’s shampoo in the water doesn’t mean you’re not also drinking it.</p> <p>Many lessons have been learned (by Twitter) through this trial: never do business with the Sun (fair); don’t try to destroy someone’s life with a lie if yours could be destroyed by the truth (couldn’t we all be destroyed by the truth, though, really?); and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/19/wagatha-christie-britains-courts-celebrity-trials\">never, ever go to court</a> if you can possibly avoid it (the soundest advice).

environmentalists.</p> <p>The coalition government on Thursday announced binding sectoral targets to slash overall carbon emissions by 51% by 2030, a daunting challenge for a country that has consistently missed climate goals, making it per capita one of the world highest emitters.</p> <p>Eamon Ryan, the environment minister and Irish Green party leader, called the announcement “hugely significant”.</p> <p>The most contested sector was agriculture. It causes about <a href=\"https://www.epa.ie/our-services/monitoring--assessment/climate-change/ghg/agriculture/\">37% of Ireland’s emissions</a> but farm groups lobbied hard for special treatment, citing its traditional role in society and food security.</p> <p>The 25% target was a compromise between farmers who hoped for 22% and environmentalists and representatives of other sectors who wanted agriculture to cut emissions by 30%.</p> <p>The agriculture cuts will be incentivised and voluntary, rather than mandated, but cattle farmers will face pressure to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/03/ireland-would-need-to-cull-up-to-13-million-cattle-to-reach-climate-targets\">cull cattle</a>.</p> <p>Tim Cullinan, the leader of the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA), said the target was about the survival of the government rather than survival of rural Ireland. “This is a potentially devastating blow for Irish farming and the rural economy,” he said.</p> <p>The Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association called the deal a “sellout” that would make many farms unviable.</p> <p>However, other sectors face higher targets, partly to compensate for agriculture’s dispensation. Transport must reduce emissions by 50%, commercial and public buildings by 40% and industry by 35%.</p> <p>Business groups accused the government – which includes many rural members of parliament from the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties – of buckling to the agriculture lobby. “Farming accounts for 1% of our national income. Even in regional areas its job creation effect is marginal. Farming is, however, an outsized part of our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions,” said Shane Conneely, of the business organisation Chambers Ireland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oisín Coghlan, the director of Friends of the Earth Ireland, said agriculture should have faced higher targets but that the priority now was transformative action. “The time for talking is finally over, it’s time for a relentless focus now on delivery, delivery, delivery.”</p> <p>Irish authorities admit they are climate laggards.

The accompanying poster, designed by the artist Arte Mapache, shows five women of different body types, ages and ethnicities. It also shows a topless woman who has had a mastectomy.</p> <p>“The campaign is intended as a response to fatphobia, hatred and the questioning of non-normative bodies – particularly those of women, something that’s most prevalent in the summertime,” the Women’s Institute said earlier this week.</p> <p>Despite the positive message of the campaign, social media users soon noticed some of the women in the poster bore a very close resemblance to real models.</p> <p>On Thursday, Arte Mapache <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArteMapacheArt/status/1552700880138420224\">issued a public apology for using the models’ likenesses without their permission</a>, and for using a typeface that she had understood to be free.</p> <p>“Given the – justified – controversy over the image rights in the illustration, I have decided that the best way to make amends for the damages that may have resulted from my actions is to share out the money I received for the work and give equal parts to the people in the poster,” the artist said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arte Mapache said she had never intended to “abuse” the models’ images, and had only sought to demonstrate how great an inspiration they had been.</p> <p>The artist also said reports that the commission was worth €84,000 (£70,500) were false, and that the fee had been €4,490.</p> <p>The British model Nyome Nicholas-Williams said she had no idea the image had been used until an Instagram follower sent her a news story about the poster.</p> <p>“It was nice to see the image initially but then I saw that it was for a campaign and I then felt annoyed as I hadn’t been asked to even be a part of this,” she told the Guardian.</p> <p>Nicholas-Williams said while it was good to know that she had inspired the artist, she would have appreciated being approached about the use of her image – and being paid for it.

For all the predictions of a post-pandemic headlong charge into illicit, sweaty basements, the opposite has been true.

These days we cook anything and everything outside: fish, veggies (even for a salad), halloumi … I suspect we’d grill pasta, if we could. (Someone will no doubt tell me you can.)</p> <p>So really there’s no such thing as a wine to go with a barbecue, <em>but –</em> and it’s a big but – other than what your friends expect, which is generally a big, boisterous red. Admittedly that happens to be the type of wine that goes with a sweet, smoky, spicy barbecue sauce, the only element of barbecuing that really causes a problem. But not everything you grill is slathered with that.</p> <p>What people expect to be drinking often gets in the way of what they might enjoy if they could open their mind to the possibility. A good example being red wine with cheese; in fact, white wine often goes much better, but cheese generally comes at the end of a meal when you don’t want to switch back to white. So in the interests of keeping your friends in their comfort zone, reds it is.</p> <p>Personally I like a fresher, lighter red, like the Gaillac or the Curioso tempranillo in today’s pick, with my barbecue rather than a full-bodied one, but I know that’s not universal. Many of my mates (mainly male) who are predominantly red wine drinkers are malbec lovers, and a bit sniffy about wines that are under 14.5%. But the downside to 14.5% plus wines is that the outside temperature tends to accentuate the alcohol and make them taste hot and soupy. Barbecue wines should be a refreshing contrast to the heat and spice of the food – hence the popularity of a cold beer – so try and keep your reds in a cool box or give them a dip in an ice bucket or trough. (If any resident buffers question it, point them to the back label which will generally advise the wine should be served at 17-18C.)</p> <p>It’s best to treat barbecuing like other more intense cooking methods, such as roasting or searing. The more char you have on a piece of meat or fish, the more spicy marinades and rubs, the more punchy accompanying salad dressings, the more robust your wine needs to be. Think rustic not refined, young and unoaked rather than mature and mellow. Summer wines, in other words.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"““\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 32px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Five </strong><strong>light reds to serve at a barbecue</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"12px\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"79258333c6af1fe41446f26cb41d695eb1b3ef67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79258333c6af1fe41446f26cb41d695eb1b3ef67/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Granite Earth Swartland Red 2020 14%\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Granite Earth Swartland Red 2020</strong> <a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/products/granite-earth-red-448083011\">on offer at £6.50 Morrisons</a>, 14%.

Then, my life was turned upside down by a cardiac arrest and I needed three shocks to revive me.</p> <p>While I was recovering in a hospital bed, Jim chose the perfect moment to say he was looking forward to sharing his life stories with me and added some words of encouragement. “I was also in my 50s when I had my first heart attack, but I’ve gone on to live past 100. There’s a lot of life in you yet.” He immediately became my inspiration for Life 2.0.</p> <p>With this beginning, the biographer-subject relationship was always going to be somewhat unusual. I was in no mood – in fact, in no physical condition – to push a provocative line of questioning. I simply wanted to listen and learn, and to make the experience for both of us as stress-free and enjoyable as possible. The location certainly helped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cdafd6867dea6d501d6419fb9ddd974c6974314\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cdafd6867dea6d501d6419fb9ddd974c6974314/0_0_5250_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Lovelock, with his wife, Sandy, in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Lovelock, with his wife, Sandy, in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Cuff/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jim, a connoisseur of nature who always preferred quiet, out-of-the-way locations free of uninvited distractions, lived with his wife, Sandy, in one of the most beautiful and remote spots in Dorset – a former coastguard’s cottage a stone’s throw from the shingle of Chesil beach. I would stay in a nearby caravan park or a thatched pub and walk down to the coast each morning, alongside the hedgerows and across the fields to Jim’s home, spend hours talking, and return in time for a late lunch. Over almost two years, I went up and down that slope 34 times.</p> <p>I came to see these visits as a form of mutual therapy. For Jim, I suppose it was a last chance to upload his life. In his last book, Novacene, he had outlined a theory that in the transition to a world governed by artificial intelligence, energy is increasingly converted into data.</p> <p>I saw myself as part of that process, recording every word and scanning memories for locked-away details. A couple of times, I asked Jim how he saw himself being transmuted after death. On the first occasion, he replied: “To die is to be part of Gaia. All atoms mixed with the rest, except the hydrogen of course, which escapes into space.”</p> <p>Later, I put the question in the terms of Novacene: would Jim become more a part of the landscape or the ideascape? The latter, he said only half-jokingly, “would be up to you”, meaning the biography. He was curious about death, as he was about everything else. When we were out for a walk by the sea, he wryly inquired whether I had any awareness after my heart stopped: “What’s it like over there?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"219558129e1babec04ebe3d1e31b73ff62384659\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/219558129e1babec04ebe3d1e31b73ff62384659/0_48_2047_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Lovelock pictured with his cats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Lovelock pictured with his cats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He had come close to finding out many times in his own life. Jim had been treated eight times for skin cancer, undergone open-heart surgery, lost a kidney, suffered pneumonia and tuberculosis and spent much of his career handling toxins, radioactive substances and explosives. He also used himself as a guinea pig for burn and asphyxiation tests during the second world war. (The only time Jim experimented on real hamsters was when he froze one and brought it back to life during a cryobiology phase in the 1950s.)</p> <p>In his last years, Jim’s health fluctuated. On bad days, he was clearly weaker, and would lean more on photos and documents. On good days, he would regale me with stories at such length and with such energy that I would have to call a halt, exhausted after almost four hours. His short-term memory was wayward, but his recall of names, places, chemical compounds, physics formulae and filthy limericks from more than 50 years ago was astonishing.</p> <p>To talk to Jim was to travel in time. I came to see him as a scientific genius version of Forrest Gump, who bounded across many of the 20th century’s most important scientific events, shaping the world at each turn.</p> <p>He was part of Nasa’s missions to find life on Mars, conducted atomic bomb fallout tests in California, issued some of the first warnings about climate disruption, and was the first to discover human-made gases were building up in the stratosphere, which led to a global debate about the ozone hole. He was also an unorthodox father who entertained his children Gandalf-style with customised fireworks and homemade bombs.</p> <p>Jim was the ultimate polymath: a doctor of medicine who conducted world-leading studies in fields ranging from chemistry and virology to exobiology and atmospheric physics. He worked for Shell, Nasa, Hewlett-Packard, Pye Chemicals, the University of Reading and the intelligence services, yet managed to be a prominent environmental as well as industrial thinker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6edeab14be7abe8f3dac256084b93e60d35579f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6edeab14be7abe8f3dac256084b93e60d35579f0/0_175_5250_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof James Lovelock in his laboratory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof James Lovelock in his laboratory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Cuff/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was at least as much an engineer as a theoretician. He bought a lathe to make his own instruments in a home laboratory he built in a barn. His invention of the electron capture detector played a key role in the evolution of the environmental movement because it was the most sensitive device in the world for measuring the buildup of toxins in the soil, water and air.</p> <p>Jim was modest. “I never considered myself even vaguely a genius,” he told me, but he looked back at his trajectory with incredulous wonder. “It’s an extraordinary life I have led.”</p> <p>He saw his real gift as the ability to cross boundaries and combine fields. “My role has been to bring separated things and ideas together and make the whole more than the sum of the parts.”</p> <p>This put him at loggerheads with many of his contemporaries in academia, who had built careers by specialising in ever more fragmented niches. “The trouble with science is that it is more and more about less and less,” Jim complained of his epic intellectual battles in the 1970s and 1980s with the likes of Richard Dawkins and Ford Doolittle.</p> <p>Their wrath had been provoked by the Gaia hypothesis, a new way of understanding theEarth as a self-regulating system. This was radical in the 1970s and 80s because it challenged the prevailing neo-Darwinist view that life was shaped by the environment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/02/beware-gaia-theory-climate-crisis-earth\">Beware: Gaia may destroy humans, before we destroy the Earth | James Lovelock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gaia Theory – developed by Lovelock in collaboration with Dian Hitchcock and Lynn Margulis – went a step further by suggesting the reverse was just as true: life shapes the environment. The idea that algae and other tiny, unglamorous creatures do most of the hard work in maintaining the chemical balance of the atmosphere was considered outlandish before Gaia, but is now a fundamental part of Earth system science.</p> <p>Jim went a step further in saying the planet behaved like a living organism – a metaphor that further infuriated the neo-Darwinists, but ensured this most holistic of theories spread far beyond the confines of academia to become a tenet in new age religions and part of modern popular culture.</p> <p>It also made Jim into something of a guru, with an influence that spread to Margaret Thatcher, Václav Havel, Richard Branson and Vivienne Westwood. “They all look to me for guidance on saving the world, but I’m not sure I can help,” Jim told me. “I can’t be responsible for the entire planet. I do my best.”</p> <p>Like anyone, he was a mass of contradictions. At different times over the past 30 years, he has declared himself pro- and anti-green, and he memorably prophesied imminent climate disaster only to chide himself for being too alarmist a few years later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"665280a1507a6ae3a1fef0d6ac3afb7ab32bb721\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/665280a1507a6ae3a1fef0d6ac3afb7ab32bb721/0_375_5232_3139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Lovelock in his laboratory at home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Lovelock in his laboratory at home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Homer Sykes/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Towards the end, he was once again filled with foreboding, and explored the possibility that the Covid pandemic was a Gaian negative feedback mechanism to reduce human pressure on the Earth system. More than once, he compared Gaia’s woes to his own health: “I can understand you old lady. We’re both in similar trouble.”</p> <p>I will miss those conversations enormously. Although Jim would often gently mock Guardian values and I would sometimes roll my eyes at his more conservative views, I cherished his company and was grateful for the hospitality he and Sandy provided. This was not my usual journalistic practice, but the closer we became, the more he opened up about sensitive topics.</p> <p>At this stage in life, he said, he could tell me things he had never told anyone before, which meant a much more personal and political perspective on the way scientific history is made. We never argued. I was there to ask, to listen and, most of all, to try to understand how Jim became Jim and how his views evolved.</p> <p>Curiosity drove him. Accuracy delighted him. But it was never just about science and data, but intuition and feeling. That’s why Jim’s theories continue to have appeal and relevance. One of his favourite poems was An Arundel Tomb by Philip Larkin. He could recite the final stanza, which now seems more apt than ever.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Time has transfigured them into</p> <p>Untruth.

He has savings from working over the summer, and lived with our parents during university – and still does – without being asked to pay any rent or bills, so he has gathered a tidy sum of money to pay for the odd meal out with friends etc. He’s still not asked to contribute at all. </strong><strong>My siblings and I have suggested to </strong><strong>our parents that they set a deadline</strong><strong> after which he will be charged rent, but I know they do not want to do this and worry that it would be damaging to him</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>When we are together he seems happy and his usual self, but this situation is not like him.

Nothing in your letter points to this or to him being depressed, so maybe he’s just enjoying a hiatus after always “doing things”. After all, finishing a degree marks the end of nearly two decades of formal education. It was only last year that he graduated, and the world has been pretty topsy turvy these past two years. I think it’s marvellous he feels he can take a bit of time out. I wonder if you had this opportunity.</p> <p>But you <em>are</em> worried enough to write in, so I went to psychotherapist Graham Music, author of the brilliant book Respark, which talks about the ways some people lose their way (“spark”) or have never found it.</p> <p>We wondered if, because he is your younger brother (and the “baby” of the family), you felt he’d always had things done for him. We noted that you and your siblings have asked for a deadline to charge rent but your parents don’t seem concerned, so why do you all feel you have to? “Maybe,” says Music, “he still needs something from his parents.” Maybe he still needs to feel looked after or have some emotional support. And isn’t that OK? He sounds as if he’s been pretty driven thus far.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>What is rarely helpful is just telling someone what to do, however tempting it may be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Incidentally, sometimes the youngest child doesn’t feel they can move out and “leave” the parents because all the others have already fled the nest, so it’s often more altruistic than it may appear.</p> <p>While no one wants a child who stays at home all day and does nothing, we also wondered if perhaps in your family success was measured by particular achievements.</p> <p>“Your brother,” says Music, “seems happy.

Those might be signs he’s avoiding something. But just ‘not looking for a job’ isn’t one of them. If there is emotional difficulty, the response needs to be sympathetic and curious. There needs to be room for difficult feelings.” How has your family dealt with difficult feelings in the past?</p> <p>What is rarely helpful is just telling someone what to do – as you’re seeing – however tempting it may be.

Given that, on Sunday evening, the ultra-poised 25-year-old could become the first England captain to lift a major trophy since Moore hoisted the World Cup in 1966 that seems rather fitting.</p> <p>Williamson is so good at winning possession cleanly that Uefa’s official Euro 2022 statistics show the part-time accountancy student has not only recovered the ball 46 times, more than any other player at the tournament, but that she has done so without making a single actual challenge.</p> <p>It is the sort of record Paolo Maldini would have treasured. “If I have to make a tackle then I’ve already made a mistake,” the former Italy and Milan defender once explained.</p> <p>Tellingly, Williamson’s distribution skills are also very much in Maldini mould. In the course of England’s five tournament fixtures a player who leaves the bulk of the rough stuff to her tougher-tackling central defensive partner, Millie Bright, has completed 411 passes, again more than anyone else involved in Euro 2022.</p> <p>“Leah’s been amazing this summer,” says the Lionesses’ centre-forward Ellen White. “Her passing’s incredible.

After all it cannot have been entirely easy for a captain much more about calm, quiet authority than shouting and finger-pointing to win the hearts and minds of three key senior England players. Significantly Lucy Bronze, Jill Scott and Demi Stokes started out with Houghton at Sunderland Ladies and remain close to the exiled centre-half.</p> <p>Not that they, or anyone else, doubted the talent of a player who started as a defensive midfielder and initially occupied that position under Wiegman. Indeed it was only when Alex Greenwood – the central defender England’s manager had paired, increasingly, with Bright – contracted Covid in June that Williamson reverted to the backline for the final pre-tournament friendlies.</p> <p>Although Greenwood was absent only briefly, she returned to find her place taken. At the time it was a slightly contentious switch but no one now questions Williamson’s late relocation.</p> <p>Joe Montemurro, Arsenal’s former manager, deployed her in defence and midfield but regarded the former role as the forte of a player whose stellar passing range compensates for a slight weakness in the air. “Leah’s maturity, understanding of the game and positional sense are like those of a 30-year-old,” says Montemurro, who encouraged England’s captain to study for her accountancy exams. “And she always finds the pass. She’s unbelievable. She has all the attributes to be an amazing footballing centre-back on the world stage for many years to come.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2022/06/euros-players/embed/England/8/player.html\" data-alt=\"Williamson\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2022/06/euros-players/embed/England/8/player.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>It is a measure of Williamson’s versatility that, while she operates as the right-sided centre-half at Arsenal, she is situated to Bright’s left in Wiegman’s team. Whereas many defenders are comfortable playing only on their preferred side her ability to seamlessly rotate positions explains why clubs across Europe and the United States are likely to be queueing up to sign her.</p> <p>Not that it will be easy to prise Williamson away from an Arsenal side Montemurro’s successor, Jonas Eidevall, is adamant he wants “to build around Leah”. Although Williamson grew up in Milton Keynes her family are Gunners fans and were suitably delighted when, after a year spent excelling as a striker in a boys’ team in Bletchley, the nine-year-old Williamson was invited to join the north London club’s academy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e4f1c3fc21959c0937ae73011340a4e1b4a64bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e4f1c3fc21959c0937ae73011340a4e1b4a64bb/0_105_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leah Williamson contests a header with Sweden’s Stina Blackstenius, an Arsenal teammate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leah Williamson contests a header with Sweden’s Stina Blackstenius, an Arsenal teammate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her heroine was the Arsenal and England forward Kelly Smith, whose signed photograph took pride of place in her childhood bedroom. Across the bottom of that picture Smith penned Williamson a special message her young fan would take to heart. “Dream Big,” she wrote. “That’s what every girl should be able to do.”</p> <p>Those words have become one of Williamson’s guiding principles and were oft repeated on her pre-pandemic visits to Jakarta, where she has played a key role in a project pioneering football coaching for girls in Indonesia and Jordan run jointly by Save the Children and Arsenal.</p> <p>“We all understand it’s a privilege to use football’s power to do good,” says Williamson. “Football can be used to achieve brilliant things; to develop confidence and resilience, those life essentials.

That dispute is likely to cause significant alarm from trade unions about Labour’s position, including those affiliated to the party.</p> \n<p>Tarry said on Friday: “This isn’t about me or Keir Starmer. This is about the Labour party demonstrating it’s on the side of ordinary British workers in this country.</p> \n<p>“I think it’s a fundamental mistake to ban Labour MPs from being on picket lines.

Here are 10 things you may not know about her:</p> <h2><strong>1) She really does talk a lot about cheese</strong></h2> <p>Truss probably first crossed over from political fringe figure to meme in the public consciousness with her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj49CogLemQ\">bizarre delivery</a> of the line “That. Is. A. Disgrace.” about the amount of cheese the country imports in her 2014 party conference speech. But she really does talk a lot about cheeses in interviews. In 2015 she told the Telegraph that one of her favourites was Stinking Bishop, and she has also sung the praises of Binham Blue and the Wells Alpine, both produced on the Norfolk coast (her constituency is South West Norfolk). In 2018 she joked at conference that she was forbidden from talking about cheese in that year’s speech. “When you eat a local cheese, you’re enjoying the traditions, livestock and the landscape special to that place,” she once said.</p> <h2><strong>2) It isn’t just cheese – she has a favourite potato</strong></h2> <p>There surely aren’t many cabinet ministers who could name their favourite potato, but for Truss it is the Norfolk Peer. Having been a minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and representing an area of agricultural production, food has loomed large in her career. She said in 2015 that she bases her philosophy on a sign in the window of a Chinese restaurant, recalling “growing up in Leeds quite often I would be stuck in the city centre next to the bus stop at Briggate and I would look at the Chinese restaurant over the road and the sign in the window, which said: ‘Enjoy life. Dine here often.’ That just struck me, it’s the philosophy I have now adopted for the way I live, because food is vitally important for all of us.”</p> <h2><strong>3) She </strong><strong>loves karaoke</strong></h2> <p>Truss is on record as an enthusiastic karaoke singer, and is known to have the Dirty Dancing anthem (I’ve Had) The Time Of My Life by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes in her repertoire, having been spotted singing it in Manchester at a party conference fringe event in 2021. You will need deep pockets to join her, though – the offer of a karaoke session with her was reportedly sold for £22,000 at a fundraiser last year.</p> <h2><strong>4) Whitney Houston is her (current) </strong><strong>No 1</strong></h2> <p>Brexit isn’t the only thing Truss has changed her mind on over the years. In recent weeks she has said in interviews that she loves 1980s music and that her favourite song is I Wanna Dance With Somebody by Whitney Houston. In 2001, as a 25-year-old Truss featured in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/labour_history/status/1550043106598338561\">a mini interview in NME</a> where she revealed that the most recent album she had bought was Toploader’s Onka’s Big Moka, and that her favourite song at that time was I Try by Macy Gray. It isn’t just 80s music she has a soft spot for – Truss once listed her favourite movies as Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, The Breakfast Club and St Elmo’s Fire.</p> <h2><strong>5) She isn’t a Twitter power user</strong></h2> <p>She once had her own “Ed Balls moment” on Twitter. Fifteen months after the former Labour shadow chancellor famously tweeted out his own name by mistake when trying to search for comments about him, Truss <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trussliz/status/229319956221788160\">simply tweeted</a> “Elizabeth truss”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ab66dede3916ba4b6fd5e84ad21b53e0c71b01e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ab66dede3916ba4b6fd5e84ad21b53e0c71b01e/0_0_2749_1273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Truss tweeting ‘Elizabeth truss’ in 2012, screengrabbed on 22 July 2022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"463\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Truss tweeting ‘Elizabeth truss’ in 2012, screengrabbed on 22 July 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter / Liz Truss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That tweet came from her BlackBerry, and she must lament their demise as in 2013 she described herself as “a BlackBerry person”.</p> <h2><strong>6) She used to make miniature gardens for flower shows</strong></h2> <p>In a 2016 interview with Countryfile magazine, asked about her favourite countryside pursuits, Truss said: “My best memory is when I use to stay with friends and attend their local flower show. I used to love entering my miniature gardens and rock cakes.” By contrast she cited “getting badly lost in the rain in the Lake District” as her worst countryside experience, recalling that her parents used to take her “youth hostelling” around the UK.</p> <h2><strong>7) She likes a cat </strong><strong>wearing a bow tie</strong></h2> <p>It isn’t entirely clear that she actually had anything to do with Gladstone’s bow tie personally, but the Treasury cat featured on her 2017 Christmas card in the snazzy attire, alongside a ministerial red box filled with Christmas decorations. Truss confused people last year by appearing to issue her Christmas Day greetings 10 days early, with a tweet that now very much looks like the image of someone gunning for the top job.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/trussliz/status/1471045885446533129\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wishing everyone in the UK and around the world a merry Christmas 🇬🇧 🌎 <a href=\"https://t.co/xPmsm2t7JH\">pic.twitter.com/xPmsm2t7JH</a></p>&mdash; Liz for Leader (@trussliz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trussliz/status/1471045885446533129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 15, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><strong>8) Her given first name is Mary</strong></h2> <p>In 2019 Truss recalled being absolutely furious at being given a name badge with Mary on it at her first day at school as, while that is the name she was given, she had always been called by her middle name, Elizabeth. She told an interviewer that she marched up to the teacher and demanded it be changed – then demurred and suggested that maybe she could just write her preferred name on the back of the badge.</p> <h2><strong>9) She is maybe not quite the familiar face she thinks she is</strong></h2> <p>This week her local newspaper, the Eastern Daily Press, went down to Downham Market and showed pictures of Truss to her constituents, asking if they could name her. “It might be Maggie Thatcher or Theresa May,” one 82-year-old, who said he was a Conservative supporter, told the reporter. In all, just nine people out of 30 asked could put a name to the face.</p> <h2><strong>10) If she was a Game of Thrones character, she </strong><strong>would be Arya Stark</strong></h2> <p>Listing her favourite TV shows in 2019 as Line of Duty and The Bridge, she went on to say that if she was a character from the fantasy epic Game of Thrones, she would be Maisie William’s character, the face-changing assassin Arya Stark. Truss didn’t give knife-wielding as her reasoning, though, preferring to say that she admires that “she refuses to conform to what’s expected of her at any point”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/jul/29/little-women-grosvenor-park-open-air-theatre-chester-pitlochry-festival-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T12:36:56Z","webTitle":"Little Women reviews – twice the delight for fans of Louisa May Alcott’s enduring novel ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/29/little-women-grosvenor-park-open-air-theatre-chester-pitlochry-festival-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/jul/29/little-women-grosvenor-park-open-air-theatre-chester-pitlochry-festival-theatre","fields":{"headline":"Little Women reviews – twice the delight for fans of Louisa May Alcott’s enduring novel ","trailText":"Separate adaptations in Chester and Pitlochry see one faithful to the original, while the other is boldly set 50 years later and on a different continent","byline":"Mark Fisher","body":"<p>It has turned into a summer of Little Women. Three years after film-maker Greta Gerwig <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/25/little-women-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-emma-watson\">raised the profile of Louisa May Alcott’s novel</a>, Mark Adamo’s adaptation is enjoying a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/25/little-women-review-adamo-opera-holland-park-classic-tale-struggles-for-momentum-on-opera-stage\">UK premiere at Opera Holland Park</a> in London, while there are stage versions outdoors in Chester and indoors in Pitlochry. In troubled times, this tale of resourcefulness, romance and sisterly solidarity offers warmth and reassurance.</p> <p>In Chester’s Grosvenor Park Open Air theatre production (<strong>★★★★☆</strong>), playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/17/princess-essex-review-anne-odeke-black-british-history-lesson-bush-theatre-london\">Anne Odeke</a> boldly sets her adaptation not in Massachusetts at the time of the American civil war but 50 years later – and on another continent. Her March sisters come of age in Chester as the nations of the triple entente are weighing up against Germany and Austria-Hungary.</p> <p>What you lose is the sense of small-town isolation; men might be in short supply as the first world war calls them away, but it is hard to think of the sisters being cut off from the world when they can pick up a job in a munitions factory or – in a self-referential touch – take the air in Grosvenor Park.</p> <p>What you gain is a historical motive for their independent spirit. We meet Paislie Reid’s Jo as a teenager finding her voice at a suffragette rally. Taking on traditionally male jobs during the war, women were finding a more vocal place in public life. In this context, Jo’s dream of being a writer, like the similar ambitions of her sisters, is a feminist act of self-determination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"83e3d7ce4c59989fa89cb6516fa7e2fd01137943\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83e3d7ce4c59989fa89cb6516fa7e2fd01137943/0_0_3200_4128/775.jpg\" alt=\"Winning smile … Paislie Reid as Jo March, at Chester’s Grosvenor Park Open Air theatre.\" width=\"775\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winning smile … Paislie Reid as Jo March, at Chester’s Grosvenor Park Open Air theatre. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark McNulty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reid is tremendous in the role; gobby, quarrelsome and loud, with an intelligence and winning smile that makes her impossible to dislike. She holds attention in the difficult outdoor space, whether she be leading Zoe West’s acoustic score with a spot of beatboxing or holding her own against the marriage plans of Samuel Awoyo’s Laurie, whose charm is no match for her fiery autonomy.</p> <p>Joëlle Brabban, Haylie Jones and Molly Madigan make strong impressions as Amy, Meg and tragic Beth in a production by Natasha Rickman that is as raucous as it is ultimately moving. Acknowledging the communal setting, she keeps us entertained with clap-along songs, an outsize bumblebee and even sweets thrown to the audience (oh yes she does) and, even if it is stronger at broad brush strokes than delicate detail, she establishes a clear enough sense of purpose for us to care about the characters’ fate, to welcome the play’s condemnation of prejudice and to be uplifted by its neat happy ending.</p> <p>Three hundred miles north in Little Women (<strong>★★★☆☆</strong>) at Pitlochry festival theatre, playwright Anne-Marie Casey has streamlined the <a href=\"http://itmarchive.ie/web/Reviews/Current/Little-Women.aspx.html\">version first seen in Dublin’s Gate theatre</a> for a cast of eight. She takes fewer liberties with the novel than Odeke but also, in a production by Brigid Larmour of Watford Palace theatre, hits fewer of the emotional high points.</p> <p>Despite the trees that populate Ruari Murchison’s set, Casey’s focus is on the domestic. We see the sisters’ journeys into the wider world always in the context of the home that pulls them back. It is the place where they sing Christmas carols in four-part harmony, where they bring their future partners and where they bicker or find consolation.</p> <p>Played by Rachael McAllister, this Jo March is bratty and precocious, a young woman finding her place in the world via her mistakes rather than her spirit of independence. The romantic stakes are low – it is not clear what either she or Jessica Brydges’ Meg see in Richie Spencer’s Laurie – leading to an ending that is comfortably resolved more than moving.</p> <p>• Little Women is at <a href=\"https://www.grosvenorparkopenairtheatre.co.uk/show/little-women/\">Grosvenor Park Open Air theatre, Chester</a>, until 29 August. Little Women is at <a href=\"https://pitlochryfestivaltheatre.com/whats-on/little-women/\">Pitlochry festival theatre</a> until 29 September and that production then runs at <a href=\"https://watfordpalacetheatre.co.uk/events/little-women/\">Watford Palace</a>, 11–22 October.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jul/29/former-met-officer-in-wayne-couzens-whatsapp-group-blames-training-for-offensive-texts","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T12:32:52Z","webTitle":"Former Met officer in Wayne Couzens WhatsApp group blames training for ‘offensive’ texts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/former-met-officer-in-wayne-couzens-whatsapp-group-blames-training-for-offensive-texts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/former-met-officer-in-wayne-couzens-whatsapp-group-blames-training-for-offensive-texts","fields":{"headline":"Former Met officer in Wayne Couzens WhatsApp group blames training for ‘offensive’ texts","trailText":"Ex-PC joked about raping a female colleague, court hears, but says ‘nothing in the training gives you a specific word that is offensive’","byline":"Ben Quinn","body":"<p>A former police officer who shared what are alleged to be “grossly offensive” messages in a WhatsApp group that included Wayne Couzens has told a court that his training failed to account for diversity and educate him in what words are offensive.</p> <p>“It seems like almost every week there is a word that is offensive. How are you supposed to know what is offensive?” said Joel Borders, who had joked with other officers about raping and beating a colleague and using Tasers on people with Down’s syndrome, who he referred to as “downys”.</p> <p>“There is nothing in the training that gives you a specific word that is offensive,” he said.</p> <p>Under questioning, he told a prosecuting lawyer: “I regret being in the group because of this, because of all the harm this has caused.

I don’t know why you are questioning it. It’s ridiculous,” he said.</p> <p>Borders also claimed that, when he posted another comment that referred to a female colleague, he didn’t believe she or others would be offended when he stated: “She will use me as an example. Lead me on then get me locked up when I rape and beat her! Sneaky bitch.”</p> <p>Records of the WhatsApp group also showed that Cobban referred to the London borough of Hounslow as a “fucking Somali shit hole”, to which Borders replied: “Feltham is worse! I went there the other week and I felt like a spot on a domino!”</p> <p>The trial previously heard about a message in which Neville told others in the group of a recent shift when he had pinned down a 15-year-old girl, referring to it as a “struggle snuggle”. Prosecutors alleged this to be the acting out of a rape fantasy.</p> <p>During the same exchange in August 2019, Cobban added that such an approach was “always useful” and that these were “good skills” for a police officer, the court heard.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2022/jul/29/fighter-francis-ngannou-on-migrant-deaths-in-melilla","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T12:27:51Z","webTitle":"‘It’s barbaric’: UFC champion Francis Ngannou on being smuggled into Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/29/fighter-francis-ngannou-on-migrant-deaths-in-melilla","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/jul/29/fighter-francis-ngannou-on-migrant-deaths-in-melilla","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s barbaric’: UFC champion Francis Ngannou on being smuggled into Europe","trailText":"The fighter knows the city on the Spain-Morocco border where 23 migrants were killed in June – he crossed there himself","byline":"Ashifa Kassam in Madrid","body":"<p>The bright lights of the Las Vegas strip shimmered in the background as Francis Ngannou clicked on the video.

By his 20s, he was convinced that a career in professional boxing lay in the cards for him. “But I knew that in order to succeed I had to leave.”</p> <p>Getting a visa to travel abroad was out of the question. “Coming from a small village and a very poor family, you don’t have any family you can call, you don’t have a bank account, you don’t have a regular job,” he said.</p> <p>Instead, he set off on foot, following a path trodden by thousands of sub-Saharan Africans hoping for a better life in the west. He crossed through Nigeria, at times catching rides, other times walking for miles and sleeping wherever he could.</p> <p>“Every single step you took, it was tough. And then the next one was tougher,” he said. “And then you find yourself at some place and there’s no way back. You’re trapped in your own dream.”</p> <p>The full weight of what he was doing hit him as he stared down the Sahara. “That was the first time I started to ask myself, ‘What the hell did I get myself into? Where am I?’”</p> <p>Smugglers packed him into the back of a pickup truck alongside 24 others, all of them jostling for space as thick clouds of sand swirled around them. The drivers were indifferent to whether they had enough water or could bear the conditions. “We were just goods that they were delivering.”</p> <p>The desert landscape was dotted with reminders of what was at stake. “You get to some places and just see a bunch of skeletons. You don’t even need an explanation because you are in the same situation,” he said. “If your car breaks down, it’s over. If you fall off the back of the truck, it’s over.”</p> <p>25 days after leaving Cameroon, he made it through Niger and Algeria, arriving in Morocco. He made his way to Nador – the city that borders Spain’s Melilla and the site of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/26/calls-investigation-deaths-moroccan-spanish-border-melilla-enclave-crossing\">last month’s deadly tragedy.</a></p> <p>He launched himself into the daunting task of trying to cross into Europe. Attempts to scale the six-metre chainlink fences that straddle the border left his skin sliced by barbed wire. Despite not knowing how to swim, he tried to cross the western Mediterranean in a dinghy, steeling his nerves each time he clambered into the flimsy inflatable raft with as many as nine other people.</p> <p>“You’re shitting yourself; you’re scared. You’re going into the ocean with this little boat that people use in swimming pools,” he said. “You’re seeing these violent waves and you’re like ‘Man, I might not make it. This might be it.’ But what else can you do?”</p> <p>His attempts to cross in a dinghy were foiled six times by Moroccan forces, who penalised him by dropping him in the desert or temporarily jailing him. As the months dragged on, he learned to live in the shadows, avoiding Moroccan police as he spent his days in internet cafes, researching how best to get across the border, and his nights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/oct/14/migrants-gurugu-mountains-melilla-in-pictures\">sleeping rough</a> in nearby forests. “You have to just sleep in the bush, like an animal.”</p> <p>Ngannou made it to Spain on the seventh try, stepping foot on European soil exactly one year after leaving Cameroon. After nearly two months in a migrant detention facility, he was released thanks to the <a href=\"https://extranjeros.inclusion.gob.es/es/normativa/internacional/readmision/index.html\">absence of any repatriation agreement </a>between Spain and Cameroon.</p> <p>Homeless and without papers, he made his way to France and found a covered parking garage to sleep in – “I had been through hell. The parking lot was like a four-star hotel” – and began canvassing for a gym willing to take a gamble on him.</p> <p>His perseverance landed him a gym with a coach who persuaded him to switch to MMA – a career change that would catapult Ngannou on to the world stage as the “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ufc/status/1376025306125885445?lang=en\">baddest man” on the planet.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26bb75ee80f822b74c484eb045be992d4fdafb88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26bb75ee80f822b74c484eb045be992d4fdafb88/0_99_3549_2131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francis Ngannou holds the flag of Cameroon and his Ultimate Fighting Championship belt after winning the UFC 270 event in California in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Francis Ngannou holds the flag of Cameroon and his Ultimate Fighting Championship belt after winning the UFC 270 event in California in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Roach/Zuffa LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was these conflicting facets of his life – his celebrity status as a top-ranked athlete and the hellish, 3,000-mile journey that he had been forced to take in order to get there – that came crashing together as he watched footage of the tragedy in Melilla.</p> <p>“It could have been me,” said Ngannou, his hulking frame filling the screen of a videochat from his home in Las Vegas. “What happened in that video, that’s what happens there all the time. It’s some of the most barbaric, inhumane treatment you could ever imagine,” he said. “It’s not [a journey] I would recommend to my worst enemy.”</p> <p>Ngannou drew a direct link between the treatment of migrants and the EU’s policy of externalising control of its only land borders with Africa, providing Morocco with several hundred million euros in the past few years to counter illegal migration. “Europe is the one that finances this,” Ngannou said.</p> <p>“Yes, it’s illegal but it’s our only way out,” he said. “Was that enough to cost them their lives?”</p> <p>More than a month after the deadly incident, at least <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EnassMedia/status/1550047025860861952\">64 people remain missing,</a> according to the Moroccan Association for Human Rights, suggesting that the death toll is likely higher than 23 people.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-africa-sudan-migration-north-f86afcbc0f8dddac017fb764581a5897\">investigation by the rights group </a>suggested that the deaths occurred as Moroccan and Spanish authorities lobbed smoke bombs and teargas at the migrants in an attempt to deter them from crossing the border, leading many to die of asphyxiation while others were trampled in the ensuing panic. Neither country responded to the report, and generally blame deaths on human traffickers.</p> <p>“These are people’s brothers and sisters, they are sons and daughters, they are fathers and mothers,” said Ngannou, a gold pendant in the shape of the African continent dangling around his neck.</p> <p>While the images had stayed with him for weeks, he had been shocked at how fleeting global interest had been in the tragedy. “They act like nothing happened; like we are worthless. What have we done that’s so bad to deserve this treatment?” Ngannou asked. “Are we not human enough for you?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/jul/29/ukrainian-freedom-orchestra-heads-for-the-proms","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T12:25:08Z","webTitle":"‘Channelling our anger’: Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra heads for the Proms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/29/ukrainian-freedom-orchestra-heads-for-the-proms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/jul/29/ukrainian-freedom-orchestra-heads-for-the-proms","fields":{"headline":"‘Channelling our anger’: Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra heads for the Proms","trailText":"Ukraine’s 74-person ensemble, most of whom had spent war at home, begin European tour to rousing reception in Warsaw","byline":"Shaun Walker in Warsaw","body":"<p>With a stirring rendition of the Ukrainian national anthem, the first concert of the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra came to an end in Warsaw late on Thursday evening amid thunderous applause from a packed house at the Polish National Opera.

But that doesn’t make their shows safe spaces, writes Sofie Hagen","byline":"Sofie Hagen","body":"<p>I was spying anonymously in a Facebook fan group for a well-known comedy podcast when I saw a post alleging that a popular feminist comedian was making really offensive fat jokes as part of her show. It was a warning to others, advising them not to go and see the show. The author also asked the group if anyone could recommend comedians who don’t do “fat jokes”.</p> <p>I started thinking: who would I recommend? (Apart from myself, of course, but if I recommend myself too many times in that group, they’ll start to realise that it’s me behind the fake name.)</p> <p>A “fat joke” is a joke about fat people where the fat people are the punchline. It’s when a thin actor dresses up in a fatsuit, to mock fat people – such as in Friends, when we see a young Monica, AKA Fat Monica. It’s the comedian who said that the only competitive sport fat people should ever participate in is a pie-eating contest. I once heard a comedian joke that fat people can only ever get laid after meeting someone in a nightclub if it’s past 3am, because, you know, then maybe people would be drunk enough to have sex with them. I had slept with this very comedian six months before, both of us very sober. </p> <p>As with all jokes that rely on boring stereotypes, there are no new<em> </em>ideas or angles: we eat too much; we don’t exercise; we are unintelligent, desperate and lazy.</p> <p>Coming up with fat jokes is the easiest thing in the world – I know, because that was all I did when I first started out in comedy. My jokes were exclusively about how much I ate, how I never did exercise, how wobbly my stomach was. What I was really saying was: “Don’t worry, I know it’s not OK that I look like this. I’m not here to challenge the status quo.” Then we could all relax.</p> <p>When I educated myself on body positivity and the fat acceptance movement, I started seeing myself as worthy of being alive – and when I stopped seeing fatness as an inherently bad thing, I stopped doing those jokes. I did not, and still do not, wish to harm people with my material.</p> <p>I also realised that comedians who do make fat jokes never<em> </em>actually address the fat people in the audience. We will happily say: “the women in the audience …” or: “Is anyone from Ireland?”, to acknowledge the presence of the group we are about to mock. But, never when it is about fat people. It’s <em>they. Those </em>fat people, <em>they </em>are like this and <em>they </em>are like that. Fat people are never expected to be<em> </em>in the room.</p> <p>It’s one thing hearing a person with a microphone making a joke that dehumanises you, but it’s another thing to hear 400 people around you laugh at it.</p> <p>So I have been trying to come up with the name of a single comedian I would fully trust not to make fat jokes. There are plenty I would trust to not do it intentionally, and there are those I am 95% certain wouldn’t do it. But I never watch a comedy show without expecting something<em> </em>fatphobic to come up. The comedian might not even mock fat people directly, but they might announce that they have lost weight and the audience cheers: good on you for not being as fat.</p> <p>I love (most) comedians and I respect anyone who attempts standup as a career, as it’s an incredibly weird job that can get really lonely; we need each other. Which is why it sucks that even some of my heroes have internalised fatphobia. It makes it hard not to feel very, very tired and unwelcome.</p> <p>I am proud when fat people say they feel safe in my audience. Would I also like to be told that I am the funniest comedian in the whole world? The sexiest and smartest and prettiest? Sure, but I have to assume that’s implicit. For now, I’m happy just to see myself recommended in Facebook groups, where they don’t know I’m watching, as the comedian whose show it is safe to go to as a fat person.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sofie Hagen is a writer and comedian.

The choreographer Sharon Eyal creates such a distinctive world (producer Gai Behar is credited as co-creator, but the steps are all Eyal’s). The bodies are long and lean, always clad in some skintight Lycra (the better to define its ultra-specific lines) genderless in steps and costume. The dancers seem not quite human, moving into AI territory, yet there’s something unsettlingly carnal about it. The movement blends forms from club culture to classical ballet into an arresting hybrid: you will see tight little struts on tiptoes, like vogue dancers in heels; heavy beats of the soundtrack plucking at their sinews to make bodies twang; and hypnotic riffs amplified by the dancers being magnetised together in unison. But with each new show there’s a sense of diminishing returns. Once you’ve got used to the extraordinary movement and marvelled at the bodies before you, then what?</p> <p>Dark in the House is a programme specially made for the brute concrete space of Bold Tendencies, a former multi-storey car park and a venue that suits the Ballardian dystopia of L-E-V’s world. It draws on material from previous works, newly cloaked in deliberate darkness: black stage, black curtains drawn, dim lighting, black catsuits that turn bodies into silhouettes or make the dancers disappear into the space, the light catching just a curve of a spine or leg. Frames hunch and warp with taut resistance, limbs extend in insect-like fashion, torsos move in jagged isolation, but the human core is hollow. There are moments that hint at the darkness of the world beyond – a dancer clutching their throat, a woman bent double with arms outstretched as if begging – but they quickly evaporate behind intensely blank faces.</p> <p>A second act brings a crack of light, some colour on the stage, closer proximity to the performers, flesh glimpsed through lace catsuits, sweat glistening on skin. They fall into seductive, looping phrases that become intoxicating. This is a company to be seen, for sure, and seven incredible dancers, but it is just possible Eyal’s spell is wearing thin.</p> <p>• At <a href=\"https://boldtendencies.com/events-tickets/\">Bold Tendencies, London</a>, until 30 July.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/29/cecil-rhodes-nadine-dorries-listed-status-plaque-oxford-college","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T12:12:01Z","webTitle":"Nadine Dorries grants listed status to Cecil Rhodes plaque at Oxford college","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/cecil-rhodes-nadine-dorries-listed-status-plaque-oxford-college","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/29/cecil-rhodes-nadine-dorries-listed-status-plaque-oxford-college","fields":{"headline":"Nadine Dorries grants listed status to Cecil Rhodes plaque at Oxford college","trailText":"Culture secretary overrides Historic England’s judgment on controversial plaque for Victorian imperialist","byline":"Rachel Hall","body":"<p>The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has been accused of stoking culture wars after deciding to grant listed status to a controversial plaque commemorating the Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes at a University of Oxford college.</p> <p>The decision to grant the plaque Grade II listed status overrides an earlier judgment by Historic England determining that the plaque lacked the “richness of detail” required for listed status.</p> <p>The plaque is located near the statue that thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/the-real-meaning-of-rhodes-must-fall\">Rhodes Must Fall</a> campaigners have lobbied fiercely to have removed because of the businessman and politician’s views on colonialism and race.</p> <p>Academics and experts in colonial history have accused the government of deliberately stoking culture wars and “whitewashing” the brutality of colonialism.</p> <p>Kim Wagner, professor of imperial history at Queen Mary University of London, said: “This is simply what one would expect from Nadine Dorries and a discredited government, which has nothing left but the pursuit of its inept culture-war project. </p> <p>“Cecil Rhodes has become a rallying point for imperiophiliacs, and the slogan to ‘retain and explain’ is just part of the ongoing effort to whitewash his legacy and that of the empire more generally.

Why ‘Wagatha Christie’ may be last libel case of its kind","trailText":"Analysis: Coleen Rooney controlled her public persona through social media, leaving Rebekah Vardy’s tipping off the tabloids look out of touch","byline":"Jim Waterson","body":"<p>If intrusive wall-to-wall coverage of the lives of footballer’s wives and girlfriends (so-called Wags) was a creation of tabloid newspapers in the 2000s, then the “Wagatha Christie” libel trial acted as a season finale for that particular era of celebrity culture.</p> <p>The endless WhatsApp messages sent by Rebekah Vardy – in which she discussed how she would love to leak stories to newspapers, tipped off the Sun about the drink-driving arrest of a footballer and talked about relations with paparazzi photographers – came across as not only grubby but dated.</p> <p>As the court heard how Vardy collaborated with her agent, Caroline Watt, it felt more like a historical account than an accurate depiction of the current media world.</p> <p>It was clear that the duo believed it was enormously beneficial to Vardy’s public profile for her to have a strong relationship with tabloid journalists. What was less clear was why they placed so much emphasis on this. At best, Vardy stood to gain a few thousand pounds for providing a story (she texted her agent with a tip accompanied by the note “i want paying for this x”), or the hope of favourable coverage in future.</p> <p>Vardy also appeared to be operating in the belief that a legal victory at the high court would clear her in the court of public opinion. Instead, she has found there is no PR agency in the land – and no court ruling – that can compete with the internet’s ability to turn serious legal arguments into a pop-culture event where everyone is forced to take sides.</p> <p>Almost every quote and piece of evidence from the seven-day trial in May was screen-grabbed or turned into a meme to be rapidly forwarded around the UK’s WhatsApp groups or paraded on Twitter.</p> <p>The way that Coleen Rooney controlled her public persona felt more in line with the approach taken by the modern influencer-celebrity. Giving evidence, she made clear her loathing for the tabloids and paparazzi photographers who had followed her since she was the teenage girlfriend of Wayne Rooney.</p> <p>Instead, she set out the expectation of privacy she felt she had with regards to her social media accounts – and exposed how the law struggled to deal with modern internet norms.</p> <p>Rooney operated a two-stream social strategy. On one side was her private locked Instagram account where a few hundred close acquaintances, including Vardy, were trusted to see her unvarnished family life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The general public were then allowed to see a handful of sanitised posts on a different Instagram account. In Rooney’s mind it was morally unacceptable that the line between the private and public accounts had been crossed, when stories from the personal account ended up in the Sun.</p> <p>Even the rollout of Rooney’s public accusation against Vardy was very modern. She told the court she had conducted her sting operation in complete secrecy without telling her husband, writing the statement herself, and only sending it to her brother to format before posting it straight on to Instagram.</p> <p>While a media lawyer on a mainstream news outlet might have peppered Rooney’s text with a few adjectives such as “allegedly” or “apparently”, it was her direct phrase saying she had concluded one person was responsible – “It’s........... Rebekah Vardy’s account” – that made it infamous.</p> <p>Yet the law has struggled to keep up with changing public attitudes to privacy and libel law. Based on the public response to the case there is still bafflement among some that Rooney’s social media post could be held to the same journalistic standards as an article on a mainstream news website – even though Rooney’s post was read by far more people than most newspaper articles.</p> <p>But perhaps more damning for the media is that Rooney and her husband are working on a documentary around the case, with their full collaboration. Celebrities are realising there is no need to collaborate with external media outlets to get their message across and it’s much easier to retain editorial control.</p> <p>While the modern wife or girlfriend of a footballer still cares about media coverage – and some still pass private information to journalists – they are just as likely to be building a far bigger audience on TikTok and Instagram, where they can profit from sponsored content.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the public, who delighted in every twist of the Vardy-Rooney libel trial, that means we’re less likely to see a case like Wagatha Christie again in the near future.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/paper-girls-review-amazon-prime","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T12:00:05Z","webTitle":"Paper Girls review – a hugely fun sci-fi caper that’s like an all-female Stranger Things","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/paper-girls-review-amazon-prime","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/paper-girls-review-amazon-prime","fields":{"headline":"Paper Girls review – a hugely fun sci-fi caper that’s like an all-female Stranger Things","trailText":"It’s set in the 80s and follows suburban kids who get drawn into a reality-warping battle, but its feminist approach to time-hopping makes it feel genuinely fresh","byline":"Lucy Mangan","body":"<p>Paper Girls (Amazon Prime Video) is a good if unseasonal yarn. This adaptation of Brian K Vaughan and Cliff Chiang’s comic-book series begins on 1 November 1988, the day after Halloween and a date known to the locals of Stony Stream – a fictional suburb of Cleveland – as Hell Day. At half four in the morning, when our protagonists are getting up for their paper rounds, they are less worried about the spirits who have only just fled back from whence they came than the masked and drunken louts who have not yet gone home.</p> <p>It is 12-year-old Chinese-American Erin’s (Riley Lai Nelet) first time out. When she is confronted with an enraged and racist customer, belligerent tomboy Mac (Sofia Rosinsky, giving off a huge Edward-Furlong-in-Terminator-2 vibe) comes to her rescue and quickly introduces her to the rest of the delivery gang: KJ Brandman (Fina Strazza), whose family name is on most of the public buildings in town, and Tiffany Quilkin (Camryn Jones), who is very into gadgets.</p> <p>It is Tiffany who supplies the walkie-talkies that enable them to split up and stay in touch – until one is stolen by a mysterious disfigured man. As they give chase, the sky turns purple, lights go on the fritz, voices speaking in a strange language start coming through the remaining radio –and Mac grabs her dad’s gun for self-defence and accidentally shoots Erin in the stomach. Then they are grabbed by more mysterious strangers and taken into a steampunky craft that deposits them in a forest … in 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db97417eb75700a91bc06f837abfec35ab6bf499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db97417eb75700a91bc06f837abfec35ab6bf499/453_467_3447_2068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paper Girls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reluctant resistance …Paper Girls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anjali Pinto/Prime Video</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People in metallic costumes wielding laser guns stalk the wood (bad) and a swarm of robotic hornets heal Erin’s wound (good).

There they meet Erin, aged 43 and very perturbed to be confronted with her pre-pubescent self.</p> <p>The girls have become embroiled in a time-war. The metallic soldiers – The Watch – are on one side, trying to preserve the timeline in which time-travel is outlawed and they stay in power. The steampunky people are the resistance. There is more, but that’s the basic premise.</p> <p>It is tremendous fun. It has great Stranger Things energy (or should that be The Goonies and Stand By Me meta-energy?) but everything feels fresh. Partly because of the all-female gang, still such a rarity, and the sense of genuine sorority among them. They band together first in the face of men’s aggression, and this awareness of the common dangers that connect them, even when they differ superficially and challenge each other, gives the whole thing an unusually firm grounding. At its best, it even edges towards Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s unspoken omnipresent feminism.</p> <p>There are moments when you wonder whether it might have worked even better tweaked for a younger audience (the language being toned down, for instance), who would identify more directly with the excellent young cast. But this may fade as the quartet fan out further into the future, meeting their older selves and relatives, and the great questions of fate and free assert themselves.

She said the bank was “not currently seeing any immediate signs of distress”.</p> <p>She added: “What we’re seeing is a squeeze on disposable income. We’re not seeing a credit event.

But there are a group of men who cannot forget. They cannot forget how a club that seemed to have limitless potential descended into anarchy, and left them without life-changing sums of money.</p> <p>For almost two years, the players and staff of what proved to be the final Toronto squad have been trying without success to recoup six months of unpaid salaries. They are still looking for answers. “We aren’t Premier League footballers,” the club’s former winger, Matty Russell, who now plays for Toulouse, says. “This is money that guys need to feed their families which has just never materialised. We need it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/28/blake-ferguson-from-japan-troubles-to-loving-lancashire-life-inside-turbulent-year\">Blake Ferguson: from Japan troubles to loving Lancashire life within turbulent year | Aaron Bower </a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is almost two years to the day since Toronto withdrew from the 2020 Super League season. That year started with promise and hype aplenty, headlined by the signing of the former All Black Sonny Bill Williams. The world would change forever within weeks of their debut season in the top flight though thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, but that was merely the start of the Wolfpack’s off-field problems.</p> <p>Citing catastrophic financial impact caused by the pandemic, Wolfpack pulled out of Super League in July as the competition planned to restart, never to appear in the domestic game again. A reincarnation of the Wolfpack has since appeared in the North American domestic leagues under new ownership but the players who were contracted for 2020 – and beyond, in many cases – have still not received the outstanding six-month salaries owed to them from two years ago.</p> <p>Time and again they have been promised the money would arrive by the club’s former owner, David Argyle, who has not responded to this reporter’s persistent efforts to contact him about the missing wages. The money has never materialised. With the help of the Rugby League Players’ Association, a scheduled payment date of October is now tentatively planned and the union has said that if there are any more delays,it will not hesitate to take the matter to the courts.</p> <p>“We are, along with the Rugby Football League, at a stage where we will have no choice but to take legal action should there be any more delays,” the RLPA’s chief, Garreth Carvell, said. “All clubs need to watch this situation because when it comes to our members being owed wages, there is no way we will give up fighting for them, no matter how long it takes. It’s been a long slog but, if David sticks to his latest promises, it looks like our members will get paid towards the back end of this year.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"af0b4999b259840f2b786581ab04a30a84cfe8b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af0b4999b259840f2b786581ab04a30a84cfe8b3/0_0_4200_2795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toronto Wolfpack’s team mascot prowls the touchline at the Lamport Stadium before a match against London Broncos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toronto Wolfpack’s team mascot prowls the touchline at the Lamport Stadium before a match against London Broncos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the players waiting for that money have been given false hope before. Gareth O’Brien is, by his own admission, one of the lucky ones. Some of the Wolfpack players still owed money struggled to find contracts elsewhere in Super League and had to go part-time. Others walked away from the game altogether. O’Brien ultimately secured a deal at Castleford Tigers, where he still plays today. His frustration has not diminished, though.</p> <p>“It got to a year down the line and you had to write off that money in your head for the good of your own sanity,” he says. “You were just tormenting yourself over and over again. I’ve tried not to stress about it because I’ve got a contract at Castleford, and I can support my family. Others weren’t so fortunate. Six months wages, regardless of the salary you’re on, is a lot of money, isn’t it?</p> <p>“It doesn’t reflect well on us as a sport. I don’t know who the blame lies with either. Is it the governing body? Is it the owners? There’s nobody you can definitively point the finger at as a player and that’s frustrating. Something has gone wrong, though. Was the proper due diligence done on the owners? It’s shambolic, really. Absolutely embarrassing.”</p> <p>There has been some progress of late, with players paid a “goodwill” sum of £1,150. But when you consider the average salary for a Super League player is £70,000 it is understandable how that initial payment does not even skim the surface. “It’s quite embarrassing for us as a sport that it’s dragged on this long,” Russell, who dropped down to the Championship with Leigh before signing with Toulouse, says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Lads are owed extraordinary sums of money: it’s really quite sad and it’s been so stressful. Some lads were on very good money at Toronto and they went from that to absolutely nothing. One of the lads we played with had two years left on a big contract and he just walked away from the game. The union are doing their absolute best, but we just have to play the waiting game a bit longer.</p> <p>“We’re used to that now, but it doesn’t make it easier for guys who were left unemployed. It’s been a very tough period.”</p> <p>The end could now finally be in sight, however. While many have consigned Toronto’s brief sojourn to the annals of history, nobody in this game should overlook the travails one group of players have had to endure, merely for what they are owed. It is a story rugby league should never forget.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"games/2022/jul/29/bear-and-breakfast-review","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T11:34:55Z","webTitle":"Bear and Breakfast review – a cute management sim … if you bear with it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jul/29/bear-and-breakfast-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2022/jul/29/bear-and-breakfast-review","fields":{"headline":"Bear and Breakfast review – a cute management sim … if you bear with it","trailText":"There is delightful presentation as you set up a dysfunctional B&amp;B – but in a genre that usually keeps players busy, this requires real patience","byline":"Malindy Hetfeld","body":"<p>One day while running an errand, Hank the bear and his friends happen upon a derelict cabin and turn it into a pretty terrible B&amp;B: they’ve got the bed part figured out, just not the breakfast.

Your first guest eagerly takes pictures of the nearby gas station and leaves a five-star review.</p> <p>While this happens, Hank hasn’t actually done much to make their stay more pleasant. He has traded trash with a possum for some decorative knick-knacks for the cabin (“humans just love knick-knacks!”), but then he’s off on an entirely different mission for the local mouse mafia.</p> <p>For anyone who expects a management simulation game where your guests’ happiness and expansion of your B&amp;B empire are your top priorities, Bear and Breakfast will soon prove a disappointment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jul/25/vinyl-fantasy-how-gamers-fell-in-love-with-records\">Vinyl fantasy: how gamers fell in love with records</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Developer Gummy Cat instead prefers to tell Hank’s story and introduce you to the many quirky inhabitants of the forest, which is fun, but doesn’t fit with the mechanics and time investment usually required of a management game.

You can leave guests entirely to their own devices – and often have to, as progress regularly depends on a certain number of them completing a stay: there is often nothing for you to do but wait.</p> <p>Whether your customers’ experience is pleasant or not rarely makes a difference, so the management elements feel like stepping stones to the story Bear and Breakfast actually wants to tell. Hank is a sweet Bear and his friends are memorable enough, but in its storytelling the game seems to introduce and abandon characters for long periods of time. It is a simulation that requires patience in a genre that usually gives players loads to do – a management game that’s obsessed with managing its players, rather than letting them exercise control.</p> <p>• Bear and Breakfast is out now; £15.49.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/29/the-rebel-thrill-of-claires-accessories-is-lost-now-liz-truss-is-wearing-its-wares","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T11:32:45Z","webTitle":"The rebel thrill of Claire’s Accessories is lost now Liz Truss is wearing its wares | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/the-rebel-thrill-of-claires-accessories-is-lost-now-liz-truss-is-wearing-its-wares","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/29/the-rebel-thrill-of-claires-accessories-is-lost-now-liz-truss-is-wearing-its-wares","fields":{"headline":"Rebel thrill of Claire’s accessories lost now Liz Truss is wearing its wares","trailText":"First Blair ruined cufflinks, then May leather trousers, now cheap earrings are making an unwanted statement","byline":"Zoe Williams","body":"<p>Why do politicians have to ruin everything?

Liz is salt of the earth, was Dorries’ message. If Sunak spent as much in Claire’s as he does on his suits, he wouldn’t be able to carry the amount of jewellery he’d bought and would probably also own the shop.</p> <p>It must strike a chill into your heart, seeing Dorries charge to your rescue, like the arrival of a fire engine that is itself on fire. Her words did not have the desired effect. Nobody liked Truss more after this detail, and everyone bemoaning the lack of civility in the contest used this as its emblem.</p> <p>Spare a thought, though, not for those of us enduring the leadership race – we are at least adults, and should each take some complex responsibility for the wreckage – but for the UK’s 10- to 14-year-old girls. They don’t go to Claire’s to look “salt of the earth” or thrifty or down with the kids. They go because it’s basically Aladdin’s cave if your pocket money is measured out in coffee spoons. Just when you think you’ve blown the lot, there’s a three-for-two or a Bogof. They spend ages there, trapped in exquisite indecision: the foxes sitting on tiny toadstools, or the earrings in the shape of the pina colada that they are not yet old enough to drink but are damn well old enough to memorialise?</p> <p>After maybe an hour of rudimentary maths, it turns out they can afford both and still have change for a lipgloss the colour of rigor mortis. It’s just not the same if Truss is also wearing them; now they’re a statement that you don’t want to make. Never mind her politics, the statement is: “Also worn by adults.”</p> <p>Boris Johnson could never ruin anything, because whatever he wore he always looked as if he’d rolled in a pile of jumble and stood up.

She once in 2010 wore it every day for a fortnight, by the end of which the whole “statement”, “difficult piece” genre was ruined if you were anywhere near 50, unless you were happy for people to think you were paying homage to the then home secretary.</p> <p>The original fashion saboteur was Tony Blair, who stepped out at a Commonwealth summit in 2002 wearing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/mar/04/redbox1\">Paul Smith cufflinks</a>. It tainted the brand ever after – yes, even the wallets – with the unfortunate vibe of a man who wanted to look broadly serious on the world stage while at the same time a tiny bit metrosexual because he’d read it in GQ.

They have lost, arguably, their two best players in Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha but the money has been wisely reinvested in a new-looking squad. Ensuring there is greater depth to a side that struggled to cope with injuries was the focus over the summer because another season of square pegs in round holes when things get tough is unlikely to end well.</p> \n<p>The teams that have come up look better equipped for the Premier League than those they have replaced, so the club that finished 17th last time need to improve. The notable arrivals come from abroad and could take time to settle in the Premier League. How quickly they adapt to England could determine how the season goes for Leeds.

This summer he is putting his mark on a team that needed a facelift regardless of who is in charge. His predecessor dismissed a number of targets in January, resulting in an injury-ravaged squad squeaking their way to survival. Those who know and have worked with Marsch speak of a highly intelligent man who knows football inside and out. Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams are well-known to the manager and jumped at the chance to work with him again, a sign of the loyalty he earns from players. Despite keeping Leeds up, he is yet to find popularity with the fans but a good start to the campaign would see that change quickly. Last season was about survival at all costs, now he can finally implement his blueprint for the long-term.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cae9fcc51b3ddf465d11d368edfd0c3afa57033f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cae9fcc51b3ddf465d11d368edfd0c3afa57033f/0_279_4207_2525/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Marsch watches on during Leeds’ friendly at Blackpool in early July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesse Marsch watches on during Leeds’ friendly at Blackpool in early July.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Davies/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>Luis Sinisterra. The estimated £100m earned by Leeds from the sales of Phillips and Raphinha has been wisely invested in players with potential. At 23 years old the Colombian winger has already shown what he can do in the Eredivisie with Feyenoord. He bounced back from a serious knee injury in 2020 to become an integral part of the side that made it to the Europa Conference League final last season. Full-backs will be fearful of his speed and ability to beat players one-on-one – it is up to him to show it on a consistent basis.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>The Americans Aaronson and Adams will be off to face, among others, England in Qatar. Daniel James will be in the Wales squad and Spain duo Diego Llorente and Rodrigo will be hopeful of call-ups if they start the season well. Apart from that the Thorp Arch car park could be pretty full throughout the month.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:34:54/embed.html\" data-alt=\"f\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:34:54/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p>The Leeds defenders left in England could try to get some inspiration from the Royal Armouries Museum. Three thousand years of history when it comes to armoury and weaponry are covered by the museum. Liam Cooper could do with a mace.</p> \n<h2>Leading the shirt sales</h2> \n<p>Home town hero Phillips and the magical Raphinha have departed, meaning a new favourite is required in West Yorkshire. Patrick Bamford is loved by the Elland Road faithful and they will be longing for his return after he missed the majority of last season through injury, a major reason behind their struggle to score goals. To have their No 9 back will be a great boost to the supporters and Marsch because finding someone to score enough goals to keep a team in the Premier League is no mean feat.</p> \n<h2>Social climber</h2> \n<p>PR-driven social media accounts are very much the order of the day at Elland Road. Poland international Mateusz Klich stands out somewhat by showing a bit of personality in his output, even producing a mini-documentary about himself among the photos of his holidays, days on the golf course and meals with the family, which is slightly more enjoyable than images of dejected footballers with the tagline “we go again”.

Celebrations at home for one, praise across the continent for the other. </p> <p>Rangers supporters had cause for frustration as they left the Estadio Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán in May after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/18/eintracht-frankfurt-rangers-europa-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Europa League final defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt</a>, knowing their team may never have a better chance to land a European trophy, but there was pride in an outstanding run.

This has been an era of domestic dominance by Glasgow’s green and white, a point not typically recognised, including by their own support.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/12/ange-postecoglous-celtic-appointment-not-the-reckless-gamble-it-was-once-painted\">Ange Postecoglou’s Celtic appointment not the reckless gamble it was once painted | Emma Kemp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a new season dawns, Rangers are in the midst of necessary revolution. The sales of Joe Aribo and Calvin Bassey have fuelled a recruitment drive, seen by seven first-team options – John Souttar, Tom Lawrence, Malik Tillman, Antonio Colak, Rabbi Matondo, Ben Davies and Ridvan Yilmaz – arriving at Ibrox.</p> <p>There is excitement about this but it should be tempered by the fact Rangers are the club playing catch-up. Ange Postecoglou’s eye-catching progress across the city returned Celtic to the position of finest team in Scotland, and the Australian did not need to preside over major summer surgery, with the permanent signings of Cameron Carter-Vickers and Jota, both successful loanees, the priority before the new season.</p> <p>Intrigue surrounds what Giovanni van Bronckhorst can offer by way of a challenge. The Dutchman can provide mitigating circumstance for the events of last season – he arrived mid-season and European exertions took a toll – but the fact remains Rangers failed to successfully defend the Premiership from a front-running position at Christmas.</p> <p>It would be unfair to praise Rangers’ squad for their Europa League progress while simultaneously castigating the manager because the league was tossed away. Nonetheless, hard statements about the suitability or otherwise of Van Bronckhorst for this job cannot yet be made.</p> <p>The former Rangers midfielder will be relying on the dealings of his sporting director, Ross Wilson, whose signing record is patchy. This was the man, after all, who shouted loudly as Amad Diallo and Aaron Ramsey arrived at Ibrox in January. Four months, negligible impact and a title concession later, both shuffled quietly out of the door.</p> <p>In Wilson’s defence, the Rangers squad that begins the new season has increased options. In contrast, having turned around the fortunes of Celtic in a matter of months, it is Postecoglou’s job to further develop existing players. Kyogo Furuhashi, the most gifted attacking player in Scotland, will inevitably attract lucrative bids if he maintains fitness and form. Matt O’Riley, Jota, Carter-Vickers and Reo Hatate delivered enough last season to suggest they will improve in familiar surroundings. Celtic have a capacity to concede goals but a routinely relentless attacking style is capable of offsetting that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8e4430b890d18d5ee78263cbf1f8833cb14cb3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8e4430b890d18d5ee78263cbf1f8833cb14cb3d/0_210_3575_2146/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Ramsey (far right) of Rangers is comforted by Leon Balogun after the Europa League final match against Eintracht Frankfurt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rangers will aim to bounce back after defeat in last season’s Europa League final – but have to do so without Aaron Ramsey (far right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If it seems unfair to depict the championship as a two-horse race, this reflects the depressing reality. We are hurtling towards the 40th anniversary of a club outside the Old Firm winning Scotland’s top flight. The scale with which Celtic and Rangers continue to spend means that run is unlikely to end any time soon. Motherwell’s embarrassing European elimination by Sligo Rovers did nothing for the wider reputation of the Scottish game.</p> <p>Hearts can look to close the gap courtesy of European revenue – the Edinburgh club are guaranteed group stage football – but scheduling challenges may take a little getting used to for Robbie Neilson and his players. It can be assumed that Aberdeen will improve under Jim Goodwin but serious questions linger over the direction of Hibs.</p> <p>A black mark against Celtic’s last campaign – and a recurring feature in their recent history – was their struggles in Europe. By the time Bodø/Glimt bundled Postecoglou’s team out of the Conference League, they had been ejected from three separate continental competitions. Celtic have earned their right to feature in the Champions League proper but to what extent they can compete will prove a stern test not only of the manager but of players who have hero status at home. Postecoglou’s own aspirations will not end in Glasgow; he will view Europe’s premier club tournament as an opportunity.</p> <p>First, domestic business. On the simple basis of what came not so long ago, Celtic should be the favourites to prevail.<br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2022/jul/29/energy-bills-support-scheme-who-is-eligible-and-when-will-it-be-paid","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T11:17:20Z","webTitle":"Energy bills support scheme: who is eligible and when will it be paid?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/29/energy-bills-support-scheme-who-is-eligible-and-when-will-it-be-paid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/jul/29/energy-bills-support-scheme-who-is-eligible-and-when-will-it-be-paid","fields":{"headline":"Energy bills support scheme: who is eligible and when will it be paid?","trailText":"The lowdown on the £400 discount as households in Great Britain come under more financial pressure","byline":"Jess Clark","body":"<p>Energy bills <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/27/uk-energy-bills-forecast-to-hit-3850-pounds-russia-cuts-gas-supply-further-europe-pipeline\">could hit £3,850 a year by Christmas</a> – three times what households were paying at the start of 2022 – according to the latest estimates by experts.

It is one of the most intriguing British bouts of the year as Chamberlain steps into the champion’s home town for a contest fraught with risk and danger.</p> <p>We sit on Chamberlain’s bed in the house he has rented for his small team in Birmingham. It feels a long way from Brixton, where he grew up amid poverty and strife, drug-running and knife crime, but Birmingham has been the site of Chamberlain’s fight camp for six weeks. He is 28, a doting father to a little boy and perhaps the most thoughtful and generous boxer I know. Chamberlain also writes, voicing his doubts and fears with vivid eloquence , <a href=\"https://hannibalboxing.com/isaac-chamberlain-from-brixtons-streets-to-life-as-a-young-boxing-millionaire/\" title=\"\">as he reflects deeply on life</a>.</p> <p>Since becoming a father, and feeling so much happier and more settled, there has been no need to articulate his pain as he had done previously in passionate bursts of writing.

A points defeat that night derailed Chamberlain for a long time but he now has another chance to reach world championship level.</p> <p>His training has been gruelling and Chamberlain is pining for his eight-month-old son, Zion, whom he won’t see until after this weekend’s fight when he returns to south London. “I know what I’ve sacrificed,” he says as he props himself against the wall. “I’m not doing all of this to think: ‘Oh, maybe I might lose.’ I’m not doing all this hard work not to bring hell with me.”</p> <p>I’ve known Chamberlain a long time and his powerful story gathers resonance the more he unpeels the layers of all he has endured. We have had time to go even further today and Chamberlain sounds suddenly fierce. “It will be a cold day in hell before I let him beat me,” he says of Billam-Smith, who is just as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lorOmqLjY9w\" title=\"\">amiable and respectful</a> as Chamberlain usually is outside the ring. “He will also have sacrificed a lot – but I sacrificed more. People are finally going to see the real me and they’re going to say: ‘This guy is definitely a diamond in the rough.’”</p> <p>Chamberlain was born in the rough in Brixton. “My real dad left us when I was four and I remember vaguely how he and my mum would tell me to go to my room where I had a little PlayStation. I’d put the volume up because in the next room I’m hearing: ‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’ They were hitting each other and my mum was mostly winning. She had fast hands, so I probably get my boxing and aggression from her.”</p> <p>Was he scared? Chamberlain shakes his head. “When you’re growing up everything is a cartoon. In that environment you think it’s normal. Sometimes there was no food so you think: ‘OK, it’s sleep for dinner.’ Your stomach wakes you up because it’s growling so much but you get used to it.”</p> <p>That deprivation was part of the reason why, aged 12, Chamberlain became a drug mule who would deliver cocaine, crack and heroin on his bicycle in Brixton. “I always heard my mum on the phone saying: ‘I’ve got no money.’ When you’re young it stresses you out. So I reached out to one of the older [dealers] and said: ‘Yo, put me on the shit.’ He said: ‘You sure? OK, cool.’ That’s how it started.”</p> <p>Did the dealers seem glamorous? “Yeah. They all had cars, clothes, money and the girls loved them. So you’re thinking: ‘I want to be like that. I want to be the man having money and the chicks.’ You know them from the area but they’d be chilling on the street like they owned it.”</p> <p>Was he nervous before his first job? Chamberlain laughs. “Shit, no. I had some run-down trainers with the tongue hanging out. I couldn’t wait to get some nice Air Max or white Air Force trainers. But I didn’t understand they were robbing me, not giving me my fair share, because to those guys I was just a kid. Some of them were getting £500 but I was getting so little. But it was better than stealing from the pick &amp; mix at Woolworths.</p> <p>“I only really understood the dangers when I had to pick up a bag of coke. I was on the bus and I shoved the bag down my pants. But when I got off the police were stopping and searching everyone. I froze. The guy I was with said: ‘Just walk this way.’ But that’s when I heard the policeman coming. He shouted: ‘Stop right there!’”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I had been caught I would have 100% gone to jail. I was only a kid but these were Class A drugs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Chamberlain’s face scrunches up in the terror he felt 14 years ago. “Oh my gosh! I was faster than Usain Bolt as I ran down a long road between Brixton and Kennington. Even if they gave up chasing me I didn’t stop running until I dropped the bag off at my friend’s house and said: ‘I’m not doing this no more.’ He was like: ‘C’mon, man, we’ll do it together.’ I refused and went home and had a shower straight away. There was so much coke down my leg and I knew I had to get out of that life.</p> <p>“If I had been caught I would have 100% gone to jail. I was only a kid but these were class A drugs. So when those guys kept calling me I took the sim card out of my phone and broke it. They couldn’t get hold of me then. If I hadn’t done that it would have got worse, in and out of jail and that’s where you find more connections to do bad things or you make enemies. It’s a vicious cycle.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>His cousin was stabbed to death in a Brixton and Kennington “beef” between rival gangs and <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/video/2022/06/13/meet-the-british-boxer-trying-to-end-knife-crime-in-london\" title=\"\">young Isaac carried a knife</a> for protection. “You never know who might be after you, bro. But my stepdad saw the knife and threw it in the bin. He said: ‘Don’t ever bring it into the house again.’”</p> <p>The murder of his cousin prompted Chamberlain’s mum, who had given birth to him at 17, to take him to Miguel’s boxing gym in Brixton. Boxing offered him a safe place away from drugs and gangs. “I fell in love with boxing,” Chamberlain says. “I saw two 50-year-old guys sparring and thought: ‘These guys are laying into each other and not getting in trouble. This is crazy!’ I picked up the gloves and they stank. The gym walls were sweaty, the mirror was humid and the first time I got punched I saw a white flash – pow! I didn’t stop punching the guy after that, out of fear. I was like: ‘Flipping heck, this is crazy. And people want to do this?’”</p> <p>Chamberlain rocks with laughter. “Now look at me.”</p> <p>The first day he stepped into the gym he also met the man who helped change his life. “I have to give Delroy Lewis, the janitor at Miguel’s, so much credit because he saw something in me that no one else did. Whenever I’d finish school, he’d come and get me, bring me to the gym, because I never really had a childhood. People were telling him: ‘Oh, Isaac won’t be anything, why bother with him?’ But Delroy saw me as his little project and he would take me running at 5am in Camberwell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c9e8eeac7ef651ef12d55cad6def573076d51f22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9e8eeac7ef651ef12d55cad6def573076d51f22/0_26_4311_2587/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isaac Chamberlain celebrates after beating Dilan Prasovic in December 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isaac Chamberlain celebrates after beating Dilan Prasovic in December 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Chance/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“He also gave me jobs to do in the gym. I would sweep the ring, wipe the windows and mirrors and he’d give me £5. I would get pilchards, brown bread, some chickpeas, a Lucozade and, if I had any money left, a KitKat Chunky. That kept me going the next morning as I’d have something to eat before my free school dinner. Delroy helped so much.</p> <p>“He told me: ‘Isaac, you have a hard road ahead but you can be one of the best. You can be very special.’ Nobody had ever said that to me before. Nobody had ever praised me. But when I try and give him some money now as a thank you he’s like: ‘Oh no.’ He’s a proper Jamaican man and used to be in the army so he doesn’t like to show any emotion. But I see it coming when I say: ‘You’re my real dad.’”</p> <p>Chamberlain still picks up Delroy in Brixton so that he can take the old janitor for a drive or introduce him to his son. The boxer likes to contrast the life he’d had as a boy with the much warmer and happier world in which he will bring up Zion. It’s moving to hear Chamberlain remember that he had never been taken to the zoo or on holiday as a kid – and how he will ensure his son enjoys everything of which he had been deprived.</p> <p>Boxing gives him this opportunity. “It’s changed everything – from my life to my son’s life.”</p> <p>Chamberlain shows me a video of his little boy reaching out to touch the screen as the boxer talks on the phone to his partner, Zaila, whom he started dating eight years ago. He coos over the delight on Zion’s face and then, as the reality of Saturday’s fight settles over us again, he says: “My life is the happiest it’s ever been but it’s also made me think that, in the ring, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/27/boxing-in-the-bubble-isaac-chamberlain-interview\" title=\"\">I’ve got to be more sinister</a>, more vicious and just darker.

The shocking reality of his tears is just one of the ways this painting sets out to harrow you with the most painful, pitiful, direct encounter it can create with the suffering of God’s incarnate son. His eyes are bloodshot with sorrow and suffering, their redness mirroring the dark blood pouring down his forehead as the crown of thorns cuts into him. Flemish painters discovered a raw eye for reality in the late middle ages that allowed them to create a work like this where matter-of-fact physical detail builds up to nightmarish intensity. Bouts, whose apprentices or assistants probably painted this in his style, takes this cocktail of the fantastic and real to a disturbing extreme in his masterpiece <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Dieric_Bouts_-_Hell_-_WGA02967.jpg\">The Fall of the Damned</a>.

Although abortion is still illegal in the state, the passing of the Grace Act will redirect the city’s budget to focus on going after more important crimes such as sexual assault, theft and burglary.</p> <p>Local politicians in Waco, a city halfway between Austin and Dallas, followed suit and put forward their own version of the Grace Act for consideration.</p> <p>Other cities such as San Antonio are also gearing up to protect those who receive and provide abortions.

Lacey wonders if Moehringer’s pen can be detected in those words.</p> <p>“One would anticipate a book that sets new standards in royal analysis. I am hoping [Moehringer] will be analysing the institution as well. On Agassi, he not only demolished Agassi’s parenting and upbringing, he had a hard knock at the world of professional tennis. Therefore, one would anticipate the same sort of dual attack in what he writes about Harry and the monarchy,” said Lacey.</p> <p>“He does not write books that can be easily dismissed as scandal-seeking, They have substance.”</p> <p>Moehringer’s intense interviews with Harry will probably have mostly been conducted before the Sussexes’ public reconciliation with the royal family over the platinum jubilee, “at just about peak rage, with the chapters getting locked up some time ago,” said Lacey.</p> <p>“So Harry himself may regret what he discovers he has said – given that the Sussexes appear to have dialled back on their hostility to the family.”</p> <p>No members of the royal family are understood to have seen the manuscript. But it can be assumed, anything considered defamatory – especially in light of racism accusations levelled by the couple – would undergo strict legal processing before publication.</p> <p>Royal observers expect it to cover the controversial areas of his parenting, his mother’s death, his reportedly less than easy relationship with the Duchess of Cornwall and the emotionally fraught exit of Harry and Meghan as working royals with all the tensions with the palace guard at the time. The couple’s version of the bullying allegations against Meghan may also be touched on.</p> <p>“But we can also expect absolute respect and deference to the Queen, This will demonstrate his loyalty to his grandmother and the monarchy, and that will be his line of defence, I should imagine, and then everyone else on the field of battle is a legitimate target,” said Lacey.</p> <p>He hopes it will shed light on the Queen’s role as foster mother to William and Harry after Diana’s death. “I would also be fascinated in what Harry feels he got from his uncle and aunts – [Diana’s siblings]– at this difficult time,” said Lacey.</p> <p>If publication is on course for the autumn, Harry would find himself going head to head with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/21/michelle-obama-announces-second-book-the-light-we-carry\">Michelle Obama’s new book</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harry has said he is writing the book: “not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become”.</p> <p>Buckingham Palace is unlikely to comment in detail about any allegations contained in it unless absolutely necessary.

She went to Winchester county grammar school for girls (1968-75) and after graduating in languages from York University (1978) completed a master’s degree and then a doctorate at the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex (1989).</p> <p>Her first post was as a lecturer at the School of International Development at the University of East Anglia, a job she held from 1990 to 2000.

Recitatif, Smith explains, was planned by Morrison as “an experiment in the removal of all racial codes from a narrative about two characters of different races for whom racial identity is crucial”. In telling the tale of Twyla and Roberta, who meet as eight-year-old roommates in an orphanage, Morrison never reveals which girl is Black and which is white, an omission that forces us to confront our racial biases. “When [Morrison] called Recitatif an experiment, she meant it,” Smith says. “The subject of the experiment is the reader.”</p> <p>Actor Bahni Turpin goes on to narrate Morrison’s story, which was first published in 1983 and which charts the lives of the girls through a series of chance encounters. It opens as they meet for the first time and discuss how they ended up in an orphanage. “My mother danced all night and Roberta’s was sick,” Twyla says. Turpin expertly captures the bluntness of the protagonists’ childhood selves: “All I could think of was that she really needed to be killed,” Twyla says when her mother groans loudly in church.</p> <p>In adulthood, they discuss a kitchen worker at the orphanage named Maggie who was mute and “bow-legged”, and an object of ridicule among the children. Roberta remembers her as Black while Twyla insists she was white. Memory is selective, Morrison tells us, often yielding incomplete pictures of the past. That Twyla and Roberta can remember the details of Maggie’s disability but can’t recall her race shows how bias comes in many forms.</p> <p>• Recitatif is available via Penguin Audio, 1hr 54min</p> <h2><strong>Further listening</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/05/mean-baby-by-selma-blair-review-negotiations-with-adversity\" title=\"\">Mean Baby: </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/05/mean-baby-by-selma-blair-review-negotiations-with-adversity\" title=\"\">A Memoir of Growing Up</a> <br><em>Selma Blair, Hachette Audio, 9hr 43min</em><br>The Cruel Intentions actor narrates her memoir, looking back on her years in Hollywood and her life-changing multiple sclerosis diagnosis.</p> <p><br><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/29/crossroads-by-jonathan-franzen-review-a-fine-start-to-a-family-trilogy\" title=\"\">Crossroads</a></strong><br><em>Jonathan Franzen, 4th Estate, 24hr 22min</em><br>David Pittu reads Franzen’s sixth novel – the first volume in a trilogy – about a midwestern family navigating secrets and social change.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/billy-bragg-and-tim-martin-dine-across-the-divide-brexit-racist","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T11:00:04Z","webTitle":"Billy Bragg and Tim Martin dine across the divide: ‘Not everyone who voted Brexit is racist, but every racist voted Brexit’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/billy-bragg-and-tim-martin-dine-across-the-divide-brexit-racist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/billy-bragg-and-tim-martin-dine-across-the-divide-brexit-racist","fields":{"headline":"Billy Bragg and Tim Martin dine across the divide: ‘Not everyone who voted Brexit is racist, but every racist voted Brexit’","trailText":"In our celebrity Dining across the divide special, the singer-songwriter meets the JD Wetherspoon founder.

In Boris Johnson you had someone who has never been accountable for anything, in his political or his private life.

I think the prize of more democracy will pay off, because it always has around the world.</p> <p><strong>Billy</strong> Brexit was sold on less red tape, less regulation; it’s actually led to more. For example, I don’t make money selling records any more because of streaming; the only way we do it is through mail order. But mail order into Europe is totally messed up now.

After all, we saw Her Majesty in a big hat, dutifully cutting a ribbon, heralding that Maidenhead and the likes of Twyford and Slough are now in extra-fast reach of the capital. Puzzlingly, this is not the case.</p> <p>Seasonality is very much up and running, serving smoked lardo rillettes and peach bavarois on Queen Street in the town centre. But it will be 2023 before the Elizabeth Line starts to do the useful, commuter-enticing, home buyer-attracting things it promised, as it is still a thing of three separate parts. Presently, Seasonality, by Wesley and Francesca Smalley, has the feeling of an intimate house party just before things get a bit hectic.</p> <p>On the day we visited, we were one of just three tables, and Wesley was serving the food as well as plating it up, on a gorgeous, highly covetable freestanding island in the centre of the room. The menu was dainty, ornate and thoughtfully sourced, similar to the sort one might get in a fancy, arduous-to-book, London spot. The Smalleys offer the likes of sea trout tartare flecked with cucumber and ginger, sweetened with a white soy ponzu; and ginger-cured mackerel with oyster custard, radish and lemon verbena. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16060f49f1bd815e31381585fb3b9f2a2d9613f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16060f49f1bd815e31381585fb3b9f2a2d9613f0/250_150_3933_2789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Dainty, ornate and thoughtfully sourced’: Seasonality’s sea trout tartare with white soy ponzu, cucumber and ginger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Dainty, ornate and thoughtfully sourced’: Seasonality’s sea trout tartare with white soy ponzu, cucumber and ginger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clare Lewington/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seasonality is more than a restaurant, incidentally. It first opened as a carefully curated produce store, from which you could – and still can – leave armed with posh balsamic and jars of exemplary cashews. They also offer meal delivery boxes at weekends, which have been a local hit. Now, however, is the time for Seasonality the restaurant to shine. This is patently a small, independent set-up, operating in tricky times; a true labour of love, involving much perspiration, pivoting and grit. At some point, after a round of Carlingford oysters laced with shichimi togarashi spice, then moving on to a bowl of very good aubergine caponata, I thought: this is a place that deserves to prosper.</p> <p>Caponata is a perilous thing to get right because it is little more than a ratatouille with delusions of grandeur, made with capers, olives and garlic. We all know how hard it is to make ratatouille or caponata presentable to anyone other than oneself, and maybe the dog. Oh, we begin with fine intentions, but 10 minutes into stewing that aubergine, we’re left with a pile of dark, bitter mush. But at Seasonality, the caponata was a feat of architecture, gloriously generous on the black garlic and littered with a vibrant sesame crumble. I’ve never eaten anything like it before and possibly won’t again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e7eb33fc481063718c6267f85dc8d68b44217b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e7eb33fc481063718c6267f85dc8d68b44217b7/360_261_4379_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cornish sea bass with shellfish ‘lasagne’ and a bouillabaisse sauce, at Seasonality, Maidenhead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cornish sea bass with shellfish ‘lasagne’ and a bouillabaisse sauce, at Seasonality, Maidenhead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clare Lewington/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other mains included a rather brief but delicious piece of Denver steak, sitting on a puree of parsley with fresh peas, garnished with summer truffle. Portions are certainly small, albeit perfectly executed, which is the tale across the land as prices of ingredients shoot up and energy bills increase. Nevertheless, we raved about a chunk of Cornish bass, now served with a lettuce velouté, a soft stew of earthy puy lentils and datterini tomatoes. When we went, the bass came with a shellfish lasagne filled with scallop, mussels and cockles, which was gloriously rich, chewy and soft in all the right places. This is delicate, imaginative and painstaking cookery.</p> <p>There’s a two-course set lunch for £18, featuring those homemade rillettes and the option of orecchiette with lamb ragu, which feels like decent value to me – although, it would be a travesty to miss out on Seasonality’s pudding list because there’s a lot of joy to be had there. The fine art of making a fuss over pudding is in a slippery state across the British restaurant scene (such is the pressure to turn tables), so praise should be heaped on Seasonality’s poached cherry, marshmallow and pistachio financier option, which is dreamy and homespun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d66cec30580b560faff458d19b5e24188de8b3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d66cec30580b560faff458d19b5e24188de8b3f/305_194_4316_2873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seasonality’s financier of Cookham cherries, marshmallows and pistachios.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seasonality’s financier of Cookham cherries, marshmallows and pistachios.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clare Lewington/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We ate a dark chocolate cremeux, sticky with fragrant banana caramel with vanilla ice-cream made from scratch.

Part of Donald’s childhood was spent with his family in Iraq and Bahrain, where his father worked for a period as a lecturer at the technical centres of Iraq Petroleum and then Bahrain Petroleum<strong>. </strong>His secondary schooling took place back in Scotland, at Mackie Academy in Stonehaven, and then he did his medical training at the University of Aberdeen, where he met Fiona Carswell, a fellow student, in 1972. She became a languages teacher, and they married in 1978.</p> <p>Four years later they moved to London, where Donald completed his postgraduate medical training at Hammersmith, Charing Cross and St George’s hospitals. From 1989 he was a research fellow at St George’s Hospital Medical School, before becoming a senior lecturer and reader in clinical pharmacology and therapeutics. In 2003 he moved to the University of Warwick, and while there was also co-director of the European Society of Hypertension Centre of Excellence until his retirement at the end of 2013.</p> <p>Donald was active in many medical societies and committees, including the British and Irish Hypertension Society. His interests were in looking at new approaches to personalising medicine; in chemical and genomic research for the discovery of medicines and their harmful effects; the prevention and treatment of hypertension and other disorders of the heart and circulation; and in public understanding of health.</p> <p>In 2009 he co-founded, with the poet <a href=\"https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/michael-hulse\">Michael Hulse</a>, the <a href=\"http://hippocrates-poetry.org/\">Hippocrates prize for poetry and medicine</a>, which became an annual international competition.</p> <p>After retirement Donald was president of the Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine and worked in Rwanda as a member of the faculty of Yale School of Medicine. He was also a member of a working party of the European Medicines Agency, and contributed to a number of medical journals.</p> <p>He had a remarkable breadth of knowledge of the arts and sciences, which was never more on display than during weekly family Zoom calls to do the Guardian quiz, which kept us all connected during lockdown.</p> <p>He had a huge range of interests, enjoying birdwatching, playing the violin, golf, bridge and tennis, and he threw himself wholeheartedly into each one. Just before his death he had his first fishing lesson, and on a recent trip to a stately home, where harness-assisted tree-climbing was on offer – though probably intended for children – he joined in with glee.</p> <p>He was unfailingly kind, helpful, polite, and discreet at all times.</p> <p>Donald is survived by Fiona, his three children, Ramsay, Eleanor and me, and two grandchildren, Freja and Angus.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/29/sam-tarry-rail-workers-are-covid-heroes-im-proud-to-be-on-the-picket-line-with-them","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T10:54:37Z","webTitle":"Rail workers are Covid heroes – I’m proud to be on the picket line with them | Sam Tarry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/29/sam-tarry-rail-workers-are-covid-heroes-im-proud-to-be-on-the-picket-line-with-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/29/sam-tarry-rail-workers-are-covid-heroes-im-proud-to-be-on-the-picket-line-with-them","fields":{"headline":"Rail workers are Covid heroes – I’m proud to be on the picket line with them","trailText":"It would have been a dereliction of duty to refuse to join them in their struggle for a fair wage, says Labour MP Sam Tarry","byline":"Sam Tarry","body":"<p>The rail workers I stood with on the picket line told me harrowing accounts of how they and many of their colleagues are routinely forced to collect donation parcels from food banks at the end of shifts.

The plan was eventually frustrated by a landmark ruling of the European Court of Justice in November 2004, shortly after Savill left office, in a case brought by the bookmaker, William Hill.</p> \n<p>Savill <a href=\"https://inthemoneypodcast.com/nick-luck-daily-ep-536-savill-outlines-plans-for-radical-fixture-reform/\">told Nick Luck’s Daily Podcast</a> last week that he had returned to the fray on racing’s behalf because “I felt that it needed to come from not just one sector of the industry, it needed some general support from across the industry.” The “key players” involved include both racecourses and those closely connected with the horses: owners, trainers, jockeys and breeders.</p> \n<p>Savill identified two major problems that need to be addressed: small field sizes, and what he described as “basically a horse drain, or a loss of horses at the top end.”</p> \n<p>As Savill sees it, “British prize money has gone up to the point when in 2022 it’s going to be £170m [but] the problem is that all other countries have gone up a lot faster than ours, particularly in America, where betting off-track is now legalised.</p> \n<p>“Those horses that are rated in the 80-85 [official ratings] range are getting offers of up to £200k to £250k to go off to America and run straight off the plane and win maidens that are worth $100,000.”</p> \n<p>Savill’s answer seems to be a major redirection of prize money towards the biggest tracks and meetings, at the weekends in particular.</p> \n<p>This feels very much like what used to be called “premierisation” of racing, with some smaller tracks facing an uncertain future as a result, though Savill insists that the overall number of fixtures would be cut. “I don’t see this as an elitist thing,” he told the Racing Post. “I see this as something that the industry needs to do to identify what its top product is.”</p> \n<p>The BHA played the straightest of bats to the news of Savill’s initiative, with a spokesperson saying that “we welcome any proposals from those who have the interests of the sport at heart,” and that the Savill group’s ideas “would be considered as part of the [current] development … of an industry strategy which has the sport’s financial future, prize money, international competitiveness and the appeal of the racing product to our various customers at its core.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ea8c06bfaa082d46b60c03ce44b9715823e6c98\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ea8c06bfaa082d46b60c03ce44b9715823e6c98/410_100_1271_763/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Savill in his days as chairman of the British Horseracing Board.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Savill in his days as chairman of the British Horseracing Board.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Baron/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But Savill’s former status in the sport gives his views rather more weight than those of, say, a random racegoer “with the interests of the sport at heart”. And the emergence – or re-emergence – of a form of premierisation as a possible future for the sport does nothing to improve the BHA’s uneasy position as arbiter in the eternal struggle between racing’s actors and impresarios.</p> \n<p>In essence, owners and trainers, who supply the actors for the narrative, believe – or suspect – that racecourses are pocketing a bigger slice of the pie than they deserve for supplying them with a stage. The tracks, without which a £3m thoroughbred is just another horse with time on its hands, insist that it’s not that simple. They know what they are doing, times are tough and prize money alone will not pull in an audience if the theatre itself is falling to bits.</p> \n<p>This is British racing’s most fundamental structural issue and unless or until it is resolved, simply pushing prize money towards the bigger tracks will make little difference in the longer run. The same arguments will come around again in a few years’ time (though probably in an industry shorn of many of its smaller tracks).</p> \n<p>Savill’s intervention this week highlighted serious issues that the sport needs to address, but a narrow focus on prize money and its distribution ignores the unique attractions of British racing that have kept owners, big and small, interested for generations.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"aa9a5a16-8932-4cbb-9a78-d7c9e5987da9\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Wolverhampton</b> 1.00 Giant Steps 1.35 Bold Territories 2.10 Boasty 2.45 Bora Bora 3.20 Jahoori 3.55 Grace Angel 4.30 Hotter In Time 5.05 Fair Star</p>\n    <p><b>Bangor-On-Dee</b> 1.25 Bird On The Wire 2.00 Mr Yeats 2.35 Last Of A Legend 3.10 Bucko's Boy 3.45 Neville's Cross 4.20 Geromino 4.55 Steady The Ship 5.27 Cawthorne<br><br><b>Goodwood</b> 1.50 Withhold 2.25 Bayside Boy 3.00 Blue For You (nap) 3.35 Khaadem 4.10 Fancy Man 4.45 Felix Natalis 5.20 Omniscient</p>\n    <p><b>Southwell</b> 4.50 Oriental Spirit 5.23 Zabbie 5.55 Fantasy Navigator 6.30 Scale Force 7.05 Typewritten 7.35 Three Start 8.05 Aussie Warrior 8.35 La Yakel</p>\n    <p><b>Newmarket</b> 5.10 Noble Style 5.45 Rattling 6.20 Mrembo 6.55 Night Sparkle 7.30 Mashaaer 8.00 Nizaaka 8.30 Bossipop<br><br><b>Musselburgh</b> 6.10 Chief Craftsman 6.45 Howyadoin 7.20 Mereside Diva 7.50 Palazzo 8.20 The Thin Blue Line 8.50 Sugar Baby</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The US might have $100,000 maidens but they don’t have Royal Ascot, the Derby, Glorious Goodwood or the Knavesmire, and there is an enduring value in that heritage and prestige.</p> \n<p>The US does not have an immensely popular and lucrative National Hunt industry, either, which makes planning from the sole perspective of the Flat feel a little myopic, to say the least.

David was a man ahead of his time. In his approach to food, as to so much else in life, he followed the mantra to “keep it simple”. Whether his recipes were for lobster or offal, or a fresh green salad, they were always demonstrations of simple food, perfectly executed.</p> <p>He was born in Navan, Co Meath, the eldest son of David Byrne, a civil servant, and his wife, Noleen, and after early education at local schools, went to St Finian’s in Mullingar as a boarder. There David developed a great passion for classical music, undertaking roles in school operas. </p> <p>He then trained at the Shannon School of Hotel Management, Ireland’s first school of its kind, which included a formative period of study in Zurich, Switzerland. David was one of a cohort of talented young graduates of the school, and he was only 23 when he became general manager at the Great Southern hotel in Kenmare in 1966. He was a natural and gifted host.</p> <p>Inspired by the exquisite seafood and shellfish local to the region, he served fresh sea urchins at the hotel bar and specialised in oysters by the dozen. David was instrumental in establishing the Kenmare seafood festival in the late 1960s in which great displays of seafood dishes were judged for competition. </p> <p>In the 70s David married Deirdre Igoe, a tourist guide. After a brief stint in Hastings, East Sussex, they returned to Ireland with their young family and ran an outdoor catering business. Then in 1988, in the basement of our family home at 1 Martello Terrace in Sandycove, Co Dublin, they founded the South Bank restaurant. The restaurant commands a panoramic view of the Martello tower in which Joyce stayed for a few days in 1904 with his friend Oliver St John Gogarty. It is this Martello tower, now home to a <a href=\"https://joycetower.ie/\">James Joyce museum</a>, that is immortalised as the early morning starting point for Leopold Bloom’s celebrated perambulation of Dublin in Joyce’s novel Ulysses.</p> <p>David and Deirdre spotted an opportunity for the South Bank and conceived of Bloomsday as a gastronomic event. Together with his friend John Kieran, David extracted the culinary references in Ulysses and produced a Joycean breakfast menu of “nutty gizzards, urine-soaked kidneys and snot-green soup” to enjoy as an alternative to sausage, bacon and eggs by guests who were sewn up in Joycean costume and treated to readings from the novel, with Molly Bloom’s erotic soliloquy a memorable standout.</p> <p>The first event, in 1991, was a great success and in subsequent years attracted enthusiastic news coverage. Other hospitality businesses joined in and the culinary event has now grown beyond all imagination as part of a large-scale annual festival in Dublin.</p> <p>The clientele at the South Bank were a broad church who frequented the restaurant to enjoy the food and the charming company and service of David, and they would be disappointed not to find him out on the floor. But in 1998, David and Deirdre retired and relocated to Co Limerick. There he continued to employ his service skills as visitor host at the Limerick Concert Hall, where he was also able to indulge his interest in classical music.</p> <p>He is survived by Deirdre, four children, Charlotte, Garrett, Stephanie and me, six grandchildren, Jack, Dylan, Magnus, Matthew, Ethan and Holly, and three siblings, Michael, Patricia and Patrick.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/2022/jul/29/martin-durham-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T10:50:37Z","webTitle":"Martin Durham obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jul/29/martin-durham-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2022/jul/29/martin-durham-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Martin Durham obituary","trailText":"<strong>Other lives</strong>: Former lecturer in American studies and politics at Wolverhampton University","byline":"Wendy Thomas","body":"<p>My friend Martin Durham, who has died aged 70, was a kind, generous and committed academic with a lifetime interest and expertise in the British far right.</p> <p>Born in Plymouth, to Phyllis (nee Ransome), a librarian, and Russell Durham, a motor mechanic, Martin grew up to be a voracious reader. After leaving Devonport high school for boys, he became the first person in his family to go on to higher education, studying politics at Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University). His fantastic sense of humour, hippy hair and ability to entertain won him many friends. Martin always had a stock of hilarious stories, often told at his own expense. </p> <p>His interest in both leftwing and rightwing groups grew, and also in feminist history and abortion rights. Unfortunately, his research solicited an early Sunday morning visit from the security services who searched his room. They concluded that he presented no threat, merely that he was “an irrelevant bookworm”.</p> <p>He went on to study for a PhD at Birmingham University, with a thesis titled Sylvia Pankhurst and Women in the Early Communist Movement. He was a supportive friend and colleague, and would share his sources and research. He was deeply committed to supporting and promoting feminist history and politics at a time when this was often not considered a priority by academic institutions.</p> <p>While meeting a friend for a drink one evening in November 1974 Martin was one of those badly injured in the IRA pub bombings in Birmingham. Martin and his friend were both hurt and traumatised by the event.</p> <p>Martin gained a lecturing post in 1981 at the University of Coventry and in 1984 moved to be lecturer, later senior lecturer, in American studies and politics at Wolverhampton University, where he remained until his retirement in 2014. Full of enthusiasm, he continued to research far right-wing groups, and also communicated with campaigners such as Victoria Gillick, who argued for parental rights, and Mary Whitehouse, determined opponent of the “permissive society”.</p> <p>He published four monographs and numerous articles. Interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour when his book Women and Fascism (1998) was published, he maintained a calm and considered approach. Despite not sharing the politics of those whose causes he was researching, Martin never condemned anyone, insisting that they were entitled to a point of view.</p> <p>A creative, inspirational and highly regarded lecturer, Martin instantly engaged with everyone he met. In later years, he studied rightwing and militia groups in the US and developed an encyclopedic knowledge of Donald Trump.</p> <p>Martin met Stephanie West in the 1980s when he was lecturing at Wolverhampton. They met again in the early 90s and were married in 1995.

Neighbours has been on our screens for just shy of 40 years, and many of us can’t recall a time when it wasn’t occupying the teatime TV slot (literally in my case – it first aired in Australia a week or so before I was born). But Neighbours’s demise also feels symbolic, delivering the final shovel of dirt on the grave of daytime TV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the Guide to get the best pop-culture journalism direct to your inbox.\">  <iframe id=\"the-guide-staying-in\" name=\"the-guide-staying-in\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-guide-staying-in\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-guide-staying-in\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the Guide to get the best pop-culture journalism direct to your inbox.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s strange to think now, in the age of streaming, but daytime TV was, for a period in the 1980s and 90s, a market worth fighting over. Until the mid-80s two of the four channels – BBC Two and Channel 4 – didn’t even bother to broadcast for the entirety of the day, but that soon changed. Network heads noticed the potential value of that unloved chunk of airtime between 9am and 6pm, and set about wooing a burgeoning demographic – retirees, housewives, unemployed people, people off sick, home-workers and, of course, students – with a smörgåsbord of shows.</p> <p>It was a strange melange to reflect the jarring tastes of those groups: live light entertainment programmes, imported US chatshows, educational TV, a flotilla of Aussie soaps and dramas (The Flying Doctors, eternal bane of all children stuck at home with the flu), gameshows, gardening shows, renovation shows, repeats of 50s US comedies and basically anything else schedulers could inelegantly cram in. In the large, it was never terribly edifying stuff – the subject of endless newspaper columns bemoaning it as the end of western civilisation – and even those tuning in did so with some shame.</p> <p>But tune in they did. There’s a great quote from a BFI project marking 50 years of TV, (recounted in Joe Moran’s history of television, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/26/armchair-nation-joe-moran-review\">Armchair Nation</a>), where a housewife from Worcestershire notes that “daytime viewing must be the most socially unacceptable mass participation sin of the 1980s. We all watch, we all pretend we don’t”. In the boom times that meant that ratings were strong: Neighbours famously reached up to 20 million viewers a day after BBC One controller Michael Grade started repeating it at teatime <a href=\"https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/neighbours-schoolgirl-getting-trouble-helped-083800461.html\">at the urging of his teenage daughter</a>.</p> <p>But it couldn’t last. Digital TV and freeview, with its endless conveyor belt of syndicated shows, chipped away at the terrestrial daytime ratings, and then streaming came along to offer an even more compelling alternative: brand new primetime-quality shows that you could watch whenever you fancied. These days it’s hard to imagine any student opting for an ironic viewing of Homes Under the Hammer over a box-fresh season of Stranger Things or another skip through TikTok. Daytime TV’s main appeal was as a space-filler amid a dearth of other options, the opposite is true today.</p> <p>The retiree audience is another story, of course – more loyal to broadcast television, more likely to be at home in the daytime. For vulnerable older people it is a crucial companion, and the schedules have been tweaked to reflect that: more well-made rural shows like the handsomely shot <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00196r2\">A Countryside Summer</a>, more cosy detective dramas like <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0013d6b\">Father Brown</a>. But aside from the odd breakout hit like The Repair Shop, or This Morning, which has moved impressively into the social media age, the days of daytime TV targeting a wide cross-generational swathe of the viewing public have largely gone.</p> <p>So should we mourn its demise? A lot of it was pretty dire – air-headed talkshows, rickety-backdropped dramas, inane imports. Still, there were moments of innovation born from the low-budgets and lack of media attention. You occasionally got a great show like the anarchic Light Lunch, which launched the careers of Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, or Jimmy McGovern’s anthology series Moving On, which boasted better storytelling and casts than a lot of the primetime shows.</p> <p>And if nothing else there was a surreal energy to daytime TV that felt compelling, at least to student eyes. You’d be watching chintzy light entertainment show Pebble Mill and suddenly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcarchive/status/1387790024029073410?lang=ca\">Bill Hicks would rock up</a>, pointing out he “found it ironic that Christians were against the death penalty, because if it weren’t for capital punishment there’d be no Easter.”</p> <p>That was the thing about daytime TV: you’d tune in out of hope of something decent rather than expectation, and if you were greeted with wall-to-wall dross, well at least it passed the time. You didn’t watch it because it was good – you watched it because it was <em>there</em>.</p> <p><em>If you want to read the complete version of this newsletter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/sep/14/guide-signup\">please subscribe</a> to receive The Guide in your inbox every Friday.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/29/mediterranean-ecosystem-suffering-marine-wildfire-as-temperatures-peak","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T10:47:53Z","webTitle":"Mediterranean ecosystem suffering ‘marine wildfire’ as temperatures peak","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/29/mediterranean-ecosystem-suffering-marine-wildfire-as-temperatures-peak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/29/mediterranean-ecosystem-suffering-marine-wildfire-as-temperatures-peak","fields":{"headline":"Mediterranean ecosystem suffering ‘marine wildfire’ as temperatures peak","trailText":"Parts of Mediterranean are 6C warmer than usual for time of year due to global heating, say scientists","byline":"Jon Henley Europe correspondent","body":"<p>Parts of the Mediterranean are more than 6C warmer than normal for the time of year, scientists have said, sparking fears that the sea’s fragile ecosystems are suffering the equivalent of a “marine wildfire” and being permanently altered by global heating.</p> <p>Water temperatures have been well above average since May and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeraunosObs/status/1551247512522063874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1551247512522063874%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bfmtv.com%2Fmeteo%2Fla-mediterranee-en-surchauffe-la-temperature-de-l-eau-atteint-localement-les-30deg-c_AV-202207260102.html\">hit a peak of 30.7C</a> off the eastern coast of Corsica last weekend, meaning the summer of 2022 is likely to set new records for both the intensity and duration of the marine heatwave.</p> <p>Several areas of southern France this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/18/heat-apocalypse-warning-western-france-thousands-flee-wildfire\">experienced record air temperatures</a>, which combined with low winds has produced a layer of surface water that is significantly hotter and much deeper than usual, marine ecologists say.</p> <p>“A water temperature of 28C or 29C may feel pleasant to bathers, but it is worrying for the Mediterranean’s ecosystems,” <a href=\"https://www.bfmtv.com/environnement/mediterranee-en-surchauffe-quelles-menaces-pour-la-biodiversite-marine_AN-202207260435.html\">Frédéric Denhez told BFMTV</a>. “The Mediterranean is starting to resemble the Red Sea, and its species are not adapted to that.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a588177eabfdc7027a66071cb63c1a08fd054f3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a588177eabfdc7027a66071cb63c1a08fd054f3f/0_343_5148_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mediterranean sea and sunbathers in Corsica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water temperatures hit a peak of 30.7C in Corsica last weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Pochard-Casabianca/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rubén del Campo of the Spanish national meteorological service <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2022/07/29/en-mediterranee-la-canicule-marine-accelere-le-remplacement-des-especes_6136530_3244.html\">told Le Monde</a> that with cooler deep water no longer rising to the surface, the Mediterranean’s native populations of “corals, of shellfish and of fish are suffering enormously”.</p> <p>Scientists consider the Mediterranean a biodiversity hotspot, accounting for less than 1% of the world’s ocean surface but home to about 10% of all marine species.

And people who are low-earners earn too little to pay much or any income tax, so Liz Truss’s vaunted cuts barely touch them. Here’s the truly staggering tax cut fact that she hasn’t been challenged on. Of Truss’s colossal £30bn cut, <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/talking-tax/\">£19bn would go to business</a> through the cancelling of the corporation tax rise. And 85% of the £8bn cost of scrapping the national insurance rise would go to the top half of all earners, with the top 5% getting 28% of it; the bottom half of earners would get just 15%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/25/rishi-sunak-liz-truss-britain-class-tory-leadership\">What the absurd class cosplay of Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss tells us about Britain | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet here’s what Truss had the nerve to say in the TalkTV debate: “I do think it’s morally wrong at this moment when families are struggling to pay for food, that we have put up taxes on ordinary people.” Her notion of “morally” and “ordinary people” is enough to make any presenter faint.</p> <p>Have those people on benefits been especially cushioned, as that audience member suggested? Far from it. There was some easing for those in work with a softening of the universal credit taper – the rate at which they lose benefits for every extra pound they earn: they used to lose 63p in the pound, now it’s 55p – still a mighty high penalty. </p> <p>Earlier in the pandemic, a crucial emergency £20 was added to universal credit. Withdrawing it plunged millions into deeper poverty. The story of benefits since 2010 has been miserable cuts. A four-year freeze, an overall cap, the two-child limit, the bedroom tax and other acts of spite ensured benefits fell even further below inflation. While pensioners – overwhelmingly Tory voters – were pork-barrelled with a £510-a-year real pension rise, <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/comment/how-britain-became-a-gerontocracy/\">families with children lost £375</a>.</p> <p>Anyone out of work was hit hardest, with a growing number of people sick and disabled post-pandemic, including some of the 2 million long Covid sufferers and those languishing on NHS waiting lists. Unemployment pay is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/05/families-income-growth-greece-cyprus-global-britain\">pitiful 13% of average pay</a>, while in Sweden it’s 80% of a worker’s previous earnings.</p> <p>To be poor in Britain is far worse than across the Channel. As this country falls behind in GDP growth (worst bar <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee2ce542-eb19-48c1-9a1d-57a8200a47ae\">Russia</a>) and inequality (worst bar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/05/families-income-growth-greece-cyprus-global-britain\">Bulgaria</a>), our decline is reflected too in making us the worst place to be poor. But remember this: poverty is measured internationally, as relative to the rest of a nation’s wealth, as anyone living on an income below 60% of a country’s median rate. So despite declining, Britain needn’t consign those with the lowest incomes to such grinding poverty. The Resolution Foundation puts it clearly: “Low-income households in the UK are now 22% poorer than their counterparts in France, and 21% poorer than low-income households in Germany.”</p> <p>Taking the pulse of the world, Ipsos Mori finds us exceptionally mean-minded. Across the world, poverty and inequality come <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/what-worries-world-july-2022\">a close second</a> in global public concerns, after inflation. How about the UK? Here we really don’t care much. We rank inflation as our top worry, but poverty and inequality are in a <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/ipsos-issues-index-june-2022\">lowly joint fifth</a> place in our concerns.</p> <p>That’s who we are. Until a hero like Marcus Rashford forces people to confront the reality of hungry children – who will go very hungry these holidays – the myth that British benefits are generous comforts the complacent or causes ill-founded resentment among others who feel they are struggling. And, of course, most people do struggle under wages that fell back in the past 15 years, which is why there should be general support for strikers who speak for almost everyone.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Thursday’s HMRC figures may embarrass Rishi Sunak, revealing how more than 68,000 people escape their fair share of taxes through non-dom status; economists’ estimates vary wildly, but it’s billions lost. Hannah Tarrant, research officer at the LSE’s International Inequalities Institute, says despite non-doms owning substantial wealth in the UK, “One in seven of the billionaires lives in a tax haven.” With lists of lucrative tax loopholes in her sights, Labour’s Rachel Reeves says she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/25/rachel-reeves-promises-labour-will-close-non-dom-tax-loophole\">will shut down</a> the non-dom scam. Don’t expect to hear a word about these shameless tax reliefs for rich people from either Tory leadership contestant.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 1 August 2022.

The room cost £35 an hour to hire but only three schoolboys, each of whom paid £4, turned up to his first session, including a 12-year-old Harry Watling, who this week joined Beale’s coaching staff at Queens Park Rangers tasked with a focus on set plays.</p> <p>“He was one of the first people to walk into that hall,” Beale says, smiling. “When he was 16 or 17, I went full-time at Chelsea and he paid me £150 for the soccer school – the balls, goals, and four after-school clubs for £150, so he got a good deal – and he still runs that business now and has about 32 staff.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/26/championship-2022-23-preview-the-contenders-hopefuls-and-strugglers\">Championship 2022-23 preview: the contenders, hopefuls and strugglers | Ben Fisher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From Bromley to Blackburn, where on Saturday Beale will take charge of his first game as a first-team manager after working as an assistant to Steven Gerrard at Rangers and, more recently, Aston Villa. Beale loved his three years in Glasgow, though he lived out in the sticks. “After the Covid lockdown, after not seeing people for months, we won the league, and then when I went out things were a lot different. I got sent off in the Old Firm which put my face more in the public domain, shall we say?” The 41-year-old grins.</p> <p>Before that, he worked in the academies at Liverpool and Chelsea, and spent six months as an assistant to Rogério Ceni at São Paulo. Beale turned down “five or six” managerial opportunities in England, Scotland and abroad but had a different answer when the call came from QPR in May. “Steven always knew we would get to that day,” Beale says. “After the move to Aston Villa, I just felt overly ready.”</p> <p>Gerrard must be a hard person to disappoint? “It was really difficult and it was more difficult because we were not face to face. I felt like I was cheating a little bit. We were both away on our holidays. But he was magnificent and made it much easier for me in terms of saying: ‘We’ve been great together, there’s an opportunity and maybe in the future we’ll come back together; you never know with the game. But we don’t owe each other anything and if you feel this is the opportunity for you and your family then go and give it a go.’</p> <p>“It’s hard for me to respect someone in football more than I respect Steven. A lot of people bring staff in but they’re the main guy and they want to be front and centre of everything.</p> <p>“Steven wasn’t like that at all. I’m delighted he’s gone and recruited one of my best friends in Neil Critchley [as assistant]. I’ll be supporting them. They’re like my football brothers.”</p> <p>Beale is absorbing company at QPR’s new Heston training base as he discusses everything from witnessing the trajectory of Trent Alexander-Arnold and learning the politics of the game in Brazil – “they won the election by bringing in Rogério but then everything we got promised faded very quickly” – to feeling ready to “take on the world” with Gerrard, and sampling a three-course menu courtesy of his Under-23s in a Liverpool version of Come Dine with Me.</p> <p>“We wanted to go round and snoop a little bit to make sure they were living OK and that the apartments were clean and in a good area. We made up this thing that if you moved out, that within two months you had to have me and an assistant round, and had to put a menu on the noticeboard. I remember the first time I met Jürgen Klopp. It was Jürgen, me, Pepijn Lijnders, who I’d recruited to Liverpool, and Alex Inglethorpe on the balcony on Jürgen’s first day [at Liverpool] … When I came up the stairs, he greeted me and was like: ‘I cannot believe you’re still alive. I watched you eat that spaghetti bolognese!’”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dc3a5237bee5f3986b66ef4ec4e3984f4173938\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dc3a5237bee5f3986b66ef4ec4e3984f4173938/0_129_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Beale (second right) with Jürgen Klopp (left) the day after the German was unveiled as Liverpool’s manager in October 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Beale (second right) with Jürgen Klopp (left) the day after the German was unveiled as Liverpool’s manager in October 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beale watched a Liverpool under-14s side featuring Alexander-Arnold the day before he began as under-16s coach. “He was quite erratic, all arms and legs at the time, very skinny, playing at centre-back, but he’d dribble into midfield, hit a cross-field ball and the next minute he’d miscontrol it. But that was the genius.”</p> <p>Beale coached Alexander-Arnold as he progressed through the academy. “We had very good wide players; Harry Wilson, Ryan Kent, Sergi Canós, Sheyi Ojo, and they were all 18 months older than him. We would line them up and want to see when Trent quit. He was quite a tenacious so-and-so. There were times where he would give you that look,” Beale says, with a soft glare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/26/premier-league-wants-championship-to-house-loan-players-in-new-finance-deal\">Premier League wants Championship to house loan players in new finance deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’m not quite sure about the people giving feedback about his defending … he is truly world-class. If he was Spanish or German, we would just be wowing about him, so it’s interesting that he’s in and out of the England team.”</p> <p>Beale, who coached Declan Rice, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham at Chelsea, has something of a conflict of interest when it comes to England and their rich reserves of right-backs. “I’ve worked with Reece James, he was [initially] a little centre-forward, Tariq Lamptey who is down at Brighton, Tino Livramento [now of Southampton] … so I’d like one or two to move positions so they could all play together!</p> <p>“People build them up to be these superhumans, but they’re not. They are just young boys or girls and they go through lots of ups and downs, lots of insecurities, so it’s nice to see them fulfilling their dreams.”</p> <p>Another busy day – Beale left Leamington, where he and his family have settled, at 5.30am – ticks into the afternoon, a 3pm board meeting on the horizon, but he is happy to be back working in the city he calls home, closer to his sister and grandparents. At the same time, a typically manic pre-season schedule has little sentiment for special occasions, including his daughter Alba’s third birthday.</p> <p>“We had to make her birthday yesterday, like all ‘bad dads’ have to do in football,” Beale says, breaking into laughter. “You have to lie about your daughter’s birthday to her … we had the day together at home yesterday. She helps me a lot. The boys still want to talk to me about football – they’re eight and 10 – but my daughter just wants dad time. It is great to say you switch off but equally it is nice to know you’re outworking your peers. I take safety and comfort from outworking people.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a58ef170c991148d4a3fe6f6f1e1499fbd088738\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a58ef170c991148d4a3fe6f6f1e1499fbd088738/0_38_1752_1051/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Beale with Steven Gerrard during Aston Villa’s Premier League game at home to Leeds in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Beale with Steven Gerrard during Aston Villa’s Premier League game at home to Leeds in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coaching overseas and following in the footsteps of two of his idols, Terry Venables and Sir Bobby Robson, always appealed.

It always sounds impressive to the secondary person you’re not talking to. They think: ‘Wow, he talks good Portuguese.’ The reality is it’s terrible, but I get that it looks cool.</p> <p>“It was a big hint for me at Chelsea when all those foreign managers came in. They weren’t just elite managers but they spoke three or four languages and they were elite people. What I would say to young coaches now is you have to upskill yourself.

Her commitment to her future calling is total. She carries a notepad around wherever we go, jotting down times and notes and possible clues, drawing elaborate maps, squinting her eyes and looking off into the distance as she tries to connect the dots to figure out where the missing piece of chalk went (her one-year-old brother ate it) or why she keeps waking up so early (a mystery I’d pay someone gobs of money to solve).</p> <p>Her bedside table is piled high with kid detective books: Nate the Great and Cam Jansen for when she’s reading to herself, and Enid Blyton’s Famous Five series, which we’re making through together. In them, three siblings, their cousin and a trusty dog, largely free of adult supervision, wander around on vacation catching criminals in between teatimes. I’ve found myself looking forward to our nightly escapades with Blyton’s five, not just because of the nostalgia that’s part and parcel of remembering how voraciously I devoured the series myself, years ago, but also because of something much deeper: in a day-to-day in which so many things, trite and not, remain a mystery to me – from where the socks go, to how to achieve the proper work-life balance, to if my grandchildren’s planet will more closely resemble Tatooine than Earth – it’s comforting to immerse myself in a world in which problems have solutions.</p> <p>Like any escape into fiction, it is a childish comfort, willfully ignoring the nuances and messiness of the world. The bad guys always get caught, the good guys always triumph, the loot is always returned to its rightful owner.

The contemporary forms – whether the true crime podcast, the streaming Netflix show, or the YouTube videos uploaded by a viral sensation who talks about depraved killers as she teaches viewers how to put on makeup (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61948546\">seriously</a>) – consistently break download records left and right.</p> <p>My friend who teaches reading to elementary school-aged children told me that the Nancy Drew series is “back in a big way”. And during the pandemic, media speculated that the <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/convergent-tv/true-crime-has-quickly-become-one-of-netflixs-most-popular-genres/\">precipitous rise</a> in our collective interest in true crime was due to any number of understandable factors, from seeking <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/why-do-we-love-true-crime-it-healthy-us-ncna1269720\">a sense of control</a> (however false) to a pure desire <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/wicked-deeds/202203/serial-killer-tv-shows-are-escapism-true-crime-fans\">for escapism</a> (particularly compelling during lockdowns). Poe called his early detective stories “tales of ratiocination” – a search for truth in a complex and muddled world. And what are all of us trying to home in on, from our first day on earth, if not for that? Perhaps now in a particularly acute way, as the country fractures, the planet burns, a new pandemic wave crests, and the socks continue to go missing in the wash?</p> <p>Auden posits, after an extensive review of the elements of detective fiction, and an exploration of the detective story’s inherent “dialectic of innocence and guilt”, that “the phantasy, then, which the detective story addict indulges is the phantasy of being restored to the Garden of Eden, to a state of innocence, where he may know love as love and not as the law.” This may indeed be true for some readers but is not true for my first-grader, who prefers to indulge in the fantasy of gummy bears growing on the tree outside her window.</p> <p>For her, the appeal is likely more simple. First, there is the fun of suspense – something that children’s author, educator and lauded critic May Arbuthnot noted way back in 1947 was “the most tempting of all bait for nonreaders”, a built-in story element which encourages children, she believed, to speed up their reading pace. That’s as good a reason as any for parents of new readers to reach for detective books in the library, and something David Adler, the author of the Cam Jansen series, hooked to immediately.</p> <p>“Often children puzzle out words but have no idea what they’re reading,” he told me when I reached him by phone. “With mysteries, the hope is that children pay attention for clues.”</p> <p>In fact, curiosity has been shown to lead to <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40575128.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A050d0cf0865cf0a20644035ac3084383&amp;ab_segments=&amp;origin=&amp;acceptTC=1\">more minds-on brain activity</a>, suggesting that the more curious a child is about a given story, the more they will pay attention and learn.</p> <p>Then there’s a more psychological component, the one we adults tack towards when we pick up a detective book, the reason I speed-read Louise Penny with my girlfriends: the satisfaction of putting disparate pieces together, and the comfort in knowing that, indeed, pieces <em>can</em> come together to form a whole, that justice can prevail, that hard facts and inductive reasoning can make sense of a world that is rarely straightforward.</p> <p>The other day, my daughter invited a friend over for a playdate, which ended up consisting of one, long, drawn-out sleuthing adventure. They stopped to refuel with snacks in the kitchen, where I was preparing dinner.</p> <p>“We’re about to crack the case,” I overheard my daughter say, excitedly. After a pause, she added, “But, I’m a little scared!”</p> <p>In our household, as in the households of so many with little children, it’s less Auden’s dialectic of innocence and guilt and more one of innocence and adulthood. And when I heard that, I could almost feel her sliding away from that clear, open, guileless plain of childhood and down to the messy valley of maturity, a place where even if you crack the case, or bring the disparate pieces together, or find yourself on the cusp of imposing some sort of order to the world – in a small, digestible way, like in a detective game of your own making, or in a more profound way, in an ever-present quest for ratiocination – you might <em>still</em> feel a little scared and uncertain.</p> <p>But before I could comfort her, she scampered off to close another case, and face her fears.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sophie Brickman is a contributor to the New Yorker, the New York Times and other publications, and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Unplugged-Mothers-Balance-Digital/dp/0062966480/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">Baby, Unplugged: One Mother’s Search for Balance, Reason, and Sanity in the Digital Age</a></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/29/as-more-space-junk-falls-to-earth-will-china-clean-up-its-act","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T10:24:13Z","webTitle":"As more space junk falls to Earth, will China clean up its act?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/as-more-space-junk-falls-to-earth-will-china-clean-up-its-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/29/as-more-space-junk-falls-to-earth-will-china-clean-up-its-act","fields":{"headline":"As more space junk falls to Earth, will China clean up its act?","trailText":"Parts of a 23-tonne piece of rocket will come crashing down – somewhere – in the next few days","byline":"Helen Davidson and Chi Hui Lin in Taipei","body":"<p>In the next few days, a 23-tonne piece of rocket will plummet to Earth at about 15,000 miles an hour.

The bus-sized launch section then travels through orbit for days or weeks before re-entering Earth’s atmosphere. Somewhere. </p> <p>In May 2020, two villages in Ivory Coast were hit by objects – including a 12-metre section of pipe – that appeared to have come from a Chinese Long March 5B expected to land that day. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78833919c9356772e7148ca8616a31a81040ba83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78833919c9356772e7148ca8616a31a81040ba83/0_480_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debris that fell from space in the village of N’Guessankro, in central Ivory Coast, in 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debris that fell from space in the village of N’Guessankro, in central Ivory Coast, in 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the second 5B launcher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/09/chinese-rocket-debris-earth-indian-ocean\">harmlessly landed in seas near the Maldives last year</a>, a Nasa administrator, Bill Nelson, accused China of “failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris”. </p> <p>China’s authorities reject the accusation. This week its foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Chinese space exploration had always acted “in accordance with international law and … customary practice”, and the probability of the debris causing harm was “extremely low”.</p> <p>Zhao said the unit had been designed with unspecified “special technology”, and the “overwhelming majority” of its components would burn up on re-entry into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Walsh said: “They claim to have learned from the last two launches and added some method of control, but the EU tracking network showed this unit is tumbling, which means it’s not controlled.” </p> <p>Prof Chao Chi-Kuang, the head of the space science department at Taiwan’s National Central University, noted there had been other uncontrolled re-entries with debris hitting Earth, and not just by China. Famously, Nasa was fined $400 for littering when parts of its Skylab space station hit Western Australia in the 1970s. (It still has not paid.)</p> <p>Chao said China’s launches were more unpredictable, and with larger pieces, and “of course people are scared in this case”, but he also accused the media of alarmism. “People think that there is something very heavy and big above our heads. But I think if China can prevent damage, they will prevent it,” he said.</p> <p>Should the debris hit something or, worse, someone, people affected will be liable for compensation. But otherwise there are no international rules to prevent or restrict uncontrolled re-entries.</p> <p>“It’s an interesting quirk of space law that if you do damage you’re liable for it, but if you do something risky and get away with it … then you get away with it,” said McDowell.</p> <p>The US and the EU have embedded risk assessments and will not launch if there is a greater than one in 10,000 chance of causing injury. China appears to have a much lower bar.</p> <p>In April, villagers in a remote part of India found what appeared to be <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/photos-show-rocket-debris-india-chinese-rocket-chang-zheng-3b-1695217\">large parts of a Chinese Long March 3B rocket</a> launched in February. Launches from the inland Xichang satellite launch site <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/26/chinese-rocket-crushes-houses-after-government-warning-to-residents.html\">routinely rain debris down on communities</a>, with officials issuing evacuation notices for residents to “adjust your location quickly”. </p> <p>Walsh said China was rightly proud of its space programme, and the launches should be a PR coup. Instead there are global headlines of varying levels of alarm.</p> <p>McDowell and Walsh hope the bad publicity will encourage changes to future launches. “I do think they’re a bit embarrassed by the bad publicity,” McDowell said. “I think they know this is considered a problem now. They may never admit it but maybe we’ll see – without them mentioning it – that the next generation [of rockets] will be better behaved and re-enter more safely.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/jul/29/rupert-murdochs-flagship-australian-newspaper-deletes-story-on-sex-life-of-british-royal","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T10:16:11Z","webTitle":"Rupert Murdoch’s flagship Australian newspaper deletes story on sex life of British royal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/29/rupert-murdochs-flagship-australian-newspaper-deletes-story-on-sex-life-of-british-royal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/jul/29/rupert-murdochs-flagship-australian-newspaper-deletes-story-on-sex-life-of-british-royal","fields":{"headline":"Rupert Murdoch’s flagship Australian newspaper deletes story on sex life of British royal","trailText":"The Australian’s online youth section, The Oz, published salacious gossip about a royal based on an unverified online rumour site","byline":"Amanda Meade in Sydney","body":"<p>It is known as the most conservative newspaper in Australia but on Friday Rupert Murdoch’s national masthead ventured into the surprising territory of highly salacious and unsubstantiated gossip about the British royal family.</p> <p>Minutes after the Guardian asked the editor-in-chief of the Australian, Christopher Dore, to comment on why the unusual article purportedly about a royal’s sex life had been published, it was taken down.</p> <p>Published by the Australian’s new online youth section, The Oz, the article discussed in graphic detail the alleged sex life of a royal, based on a single “blind” item of gossip from a notorious Instagram account that did not name the subject.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/28/abc-to-move-300-staff-from-ultimo-to-western-sydney-after-securing-lease-on-new-parramatta-studio\">ABC to move 300 staff from Ultimo to Parramatta after securing lease on new Sydney studio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was followed up by a jokey TikTok video of the Queen “reacting” to the sexual gossip, as News Corp Australia pushed the story to its social media accounts.

Kyaw Min Yu had asked the family for some money to spend in the prison, and staff had told them to pay on Monday. But on Monday, the family read in the news that he had been executed.</p> <p>The family, and relatives of the three other men, have been denied access to the bodies.</p> <p>Ma Nilar Thein said the public must not give up their fight for democracy. “I want people to go forward with a victory spirit that we will win for sure,” she said.</p> <p>The execution of Kyaw Min Yu, Phyo Zeya Thaw, Hla Myo Aung and Aung Thura Zaw provoked condemnation around the world, as well as mourning and shock in Myanmar.</p> <p>Sithu Maung, 35, an MP for Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party, described Kyaw Min Yu as “an artist, a poet and a songwriter and a revolutionist”.</p> <p>The killings would only drive activists forwards, he said: “We are not the water in their palms, we are the shattered pieces of glass in their palms … They can hold it in any way they want.

There’s no evidence of fraud or that the results were inaccurate in any way, but the ballots recently became open to public inspection and the group wants to see for themselves. John Raymond, a volunteer with the group conducting the effort, <a href=\"https://tarrantelectionintegrity.com/\">Tarrant County Citizens for Election Integrity</a>, told Votebeat the effort was just a start. “A lot of people don’t have faith in our elections, so we’re just here counting, making sure that what the secretary of state’s numbers say are right,” he said.</p> <p>It’s not clear, however, what exactly the group is looking for or how they’re doing it. At the elections office, volunteers are going through the ballots, comparing them to data on their laptop and occasionally holding them up to the light (it’s not clear what they’re looking for). The elections office, which is required to comply with the group’s request for public information, has had to provide space and supervision for the process.</p> <p>It’s the kind of activity that Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who assisted Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/30/republican-recruit-poll-workers-election-integrity\">is encouraging citizens around</a> the US to take up (it’s unclear if the Texas group is affiliated with her effort). There’s nothing wrong or unusual about concerned citizens wanting to check the results of an election. But there’s worry that shoddy methodology and misunderstandings will produce an impression that the election was stolen. That’s essentially what happened in Arizona, where a months-long review of the 2020 race produced no evidence the election was stolen, but those overseeing the review said they had several more questions. Election officials <a href=\"https://elections.maricopa.gov/asset/jcr:a9e03750-0a8f-4162-859f-1d46ac54b485/Correcting%20The%20Record%20-%20January%202022%20Report.pdf\">later debunked</a> every single claim they made.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Volunteers in Colorado are going door-to-door checking voter registrations to see whether people really voted in the last election, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/21/1107023599/colorado-canvassing-election-integrity-plan\">NPR reported last week</a>. After the 2020 election, those who pushed some of the baseless conspiracy theories have encouraged this kind of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/30/1107868327/trump-election-fraud-jan-6\">door-to-door canvassing</a>. Again, there’s nothing wrong with this on its face, but voter data is messy and it’s easy to get a false impression of what it shows. It’s also an activity that can easily slip into voter intimidation. The NPR story notes that canvassers asked one woman whom she voted for (even though all voters in the US are entitled to a secret ballot).</p> <p><strong>3</strong> In Georgia, citizens are relying on a new provision in Georgia law that allows any Georgian to bring an unlimited number of voter challenges, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/politics/voter-vs-voter-right-wing-residents-target-thousands-for-cancellation/WORGNRFPWJAF3D2PVFWP346BGI/\">according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>. So far, more than 25,550 voter registrations have been cancelled, and 1,800 people have been removed from the rolls in some of the state’s most populous counties, according to a tally by Fair Fight, a voter advocacy group. There’s no evidence of fraud in Georgia in 2020, and critics worry that the process is flagging eligible people on the rolls.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Kansas <a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article263649223.html\">is set</a> to have a high-stakes ballot referendum on Tuesday to remove the right to an abortion from the state’s constitution. Supporters of the amendment are already objecting to the presence of absentee ballot drop boxes in Sedgwick county, home to Wichita, <a href=\"https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article263649223.html\">according to the Wichita Eagle</a>.</p> <p>Critics worry that some people could use the boxes, which are under video surveillance, to cast fake votes against the amendment. They haven’t offered specific evidence for those claims, instead pointing to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-covid-technology-health-arizona-e1b49d2311bf900f44fa5c6dac406762\">debunked film</a> 2000 Mules, which makes outlandish claims about drop boxes. Trump and allies have railed against ballot drop boxes, even though there’s no evidence fraudulent votes were cast using them in 2020. This is the first time I’ve seen a political group point to their availability and call out the possibility of fraud before an election.</p> <h2>Also worth watching …</h2> <ul> <li><p>Amy Weirich, the Memphis prosecutor who brought charges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/25/pamela-moses-new-trial-voting-memphis-judge\">against Pamela Moses</a>, is in a <a href=\"https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2022/07/12/shelby-county-district-attorney-election-2022-amy-weirich-steve-mulroy/10037677002/\">tough re-election bid</a>.

A staple in Nashville’s country music scene since moving from her native Texas in 2004, she broke through with 2016’s intimately observational My Piece of Land, reflecting on her pregnancy and the bittersweet realities of stay-at-home parenting. In 2019 she co-founded the country supergroup the Highwomen alongside Maren Morris, Brandi Carlile and Natalie Hemby as a direct response to their frustrations with country rock radio sidelining women. Alongside her demands for greater racial and gender inclusivity in the genre, she has also been frank on the matter of abortion, not least with The Problem, a 2020 duet on the subject with musician husband Jason Isbell (since re-recorded as Our Problem with a notable cast of guests: Cyndi Lauper, Angie Stone, Linda Perry, Peaches). Although fans have heralded her as a punk kind of country artist, for Shires, her progressive stance comes as a matter of fact, as <a href=\"https://ew.com/music/amanda-shires-our-problem-interview/\">she told one US magazine</a>: “Fuck it, who needs a career if we have no rights to our bodies?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fb7f8c79f8eb712f2b4f0e4b1c47b9c0c0398f45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb7f8c79f8eb712f2b4f0e4b1c47b9c0c0398f45/0_0_1500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amanda Shires: Take It Like a Man album cover\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amanda Shires: Take It Like a Man album cover</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Music PR handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shires’ seventh album may well be her biggest “fuck it” moment yet, motivated by a desire to present an empowered and multifaceted picture of womanhood. It’s one she largely fulfils. Opener Hawk for the Dove subverts music that sounds like an old-timey movie score by pushing against antiquated standards of female sexuality. Shires, 40, recently told an interviewer that she wanted to prove that women her age can be “more than just a character in somebody else’s life”; here, she sings with raunchy reassurance: “Come on put pressure on me / I won’t break.” Elsewhere, it’s her powerful vocals that assert her strength. On the title track, Shires digs deep to unleash a chorus that swells with each hefty, determined repetition: “I know the cost of flight is landing / But I know I can take it like a man,” she sings in an epic crescendo that nods to Queen.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmotVv9vjq0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pmotVv9vjq0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Amanda Shires: Hawk for the Dove – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It’s rousing stuff, and with indie-pop producer Lawrence Rothman on hand, her vivid, intentionally raw fiddle-playing is balanced well with expressions of her softer side, seemingly taking inspiration from peers who are blazing trails beyond country’s traditional bounds. The warm Motown horns of Stupid Love channel the playfulness of Kacey Musgraves, while the sad-yet-soulful easy listening of Lonely at Night shares a kinship with Adele’s 30. Empty Cups is pure Dolly Parton, and makes up for its predictable melody with well-turned couplets worthy of a soap opera: “You’re leaving now through the hole of an argument / I guess for a while you’ve been looking for the exit,” she sings. Backed up by her Highwomen bandmate Morris on guest vocals, it’s a torrid breakup song of diverging paths, rich in storytelling tradition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her extended bid to prove that the roles of wife, woman and mother need not be prescriptive, Shires does occasionally over-egg her point. Here He Comes aims for sassy eye-rolls about an unpredictable lover, but its chorus is uninspired, simmered down to a cheesy mid-tempo plod. Bad Behavior builds on the same sinful-lustful dynamic that many of her sexier songs employ, but the jarring trap-rap mutterings in the middle distract from the steamily mischievous tone of her voice as she teases a sorry-not-sorry one night stand: “Maybe I like strangers / So what if I do?” Fault Lines is similarly direct, but far more surprising. An exploration of a difficult time in her marriage, it is starkly honest and strikingly simple, capturing her psychological thunderstorms during a moment of doubt: “You could say it’s all my fault / We just couldn’t get along / And if anyone asks I’ll say what’s true / And really it’s: I don’t know.” She hints at a resolution on Stupid Love: “You were smiling so much you kissed me with your teeth / I thought: long live the unknown machine.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2ikIP4rqU13HUOASXbhbuy?si=43Cqg7n1S42T1vVyieuaEA\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"456\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2ikIP4rqU13HUOASXbhbuy?utm_source=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>If there’s a takeaway to be had, it’s this sense of embracing life’s “unknown machine”. At times overzealous but always sincere, Shires subverts the idea of “taking it like a man” as one of rote strength or stoicism. While there’s toughness and discerning here, she is also captivatingly vulnerable as she addresses, without apology, how a person’s whims, desires and autonomy may fluctuate throughout a life. Rather than a source of fear, she seizes every one of these character-building risks and possibilities yet to come. “You might be my ruining,” she sings on Stupid Love. “I lean into it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/29/foreign-office-admits-multiple-errors-in-uks-exit-from-afghanistan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"Foreign Office admits multiple errors in UK’s exit from Afghanistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/foreign-office-admits-multiple-errors-in-uks-exit-from-afghanistan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/29/foreign-office-admits-multiple-errors-in-uks-exit-from-afghanistan","fields":{"headline":"Foreign Office admits multiple errors in UK’s exit from Afghanistan","trailText":"Officials say they can not provide hope of resettlement for Afghans who worked for UK civilian schemes","byline":"Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor","body":"<p>The UK Foreign Office has admitted a catalogue of errors over its handling of Britain’s exit from Afghanistan, but has shut the door on many Afghans who helped the UK prior to the Taliban takeover last August, saying it will not provide false hope that they will be given the chance to come to the UK.</p> <p>Foreign Office officials say it is difficult to judge whether Afghans who worked on UK-funded civilian schemes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/04/fears-for-british-council-staff-trapped-in-afghanistan-despite-breakthrough\">such as the British Council</a>, are truly in danger from the Taliban, saying the evidence is that the threat primarily applies to those who provided security support to the UK.</p> <p>Officials said the slow progress in processing cases this year had been caused by the high number of rejected applications, as well as legal cases challenging UK refusals to provide a right of abode.

He has said he regretted not returning to work earlier, and in its formal response the Foreign Office admitted it needed to improve its worst-case scenario planning, since at no point was such a rapid collapse of Kabul to the Taliban considered.</p> <p>The Foreign Office refused to disclose detailed intelligence assessments to the committee. Officials also admitted the UK was unable to influence the US to change its decision to withdraw troops, and so had to work within the parameters set by the US.</p> <p>It said in its written response that “the government had no illusions about the chances of success, but it wanted to do everything possible to try to avert the sort of outcome that eventually followed”.</p> <p>UK officials were at a meeting with the Taliban in Tashkent in Uzbekistan earlier this week, along with about 30 other countries involved in Afghanistan. The UK was struck by the absence of voices calling for the Taliban’s recognition, due to the lack of a plural government that respects women’s rights.</p> <p>In its response to the select committee, the Foreign Office said it supported the US opposition to releasing billions of dollars of Afghan central bank assets currently frozen in the US.</p> <p>It said there were “currently significant risks in facilitating the flow of reserves held overseas, arising from the Taliban’s appointments to leadership positions in the central bank of unqualified and UN-sanctioned personnel, the loss of experienced staff from the central bank, and uncertainty around the central bank’s implementation of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing controls”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/houseplant-of-the-week-ruffled-fan-palm","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"Houseplant of the week: ruffled fan palm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/houseplant-of-the-week-ruffled-fan-palm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/houseplant-of-the-week-ruffled-fan-palm","fields":{"headline":"Houseplant of the week: ruffled fan palm","trailText":"Native to the Solomon and Vanuatu islands, this extraordinary palm will thrive in a shady spot in your front room","byline":"Gynelle Leon","body":"<p><strong>Why will I love it?</strong><br><em>Licuala grandis</em> is a spectacular and extremely rare palm.

Long papered-over windows hide its internal workings and lend a gloomy presence to a street otherwise bustling with brunchers. A hopeful shopper stands over the threshold, taking stock of shelves lined with Doritos, Kettle Chips and sodas as a worker explains that it’s closed to the public. “You can order on the app for delivery, though,” he says.</p> <p>This store-like expanse is a micro-fulfilment center, or “dark store”, for Gopuff, one of numerous hyper-fast delivery companies to launch over the last few years in large cities across the US as the pandemic switched consumer focus – for those who could afford it – to ordering in.</p> <p>These companies offer delivery in 10 to 30 minutes of everything from candy and alcoholic beverages to coffee filters and batteries.

The economic trend that has led to so many precarious jobs “is unethical and actively harmful to people”, Herman says.</p> <p>They also benefit from the “casualization” of labor, he says. Once upon a time, a delivery job could offer decently paid hourly work with employers absorbing risks such as on-the-job injuries. These jobs now look very different.</p> <p>At first glance, ultra-fast delivery companies appear to offer their workers a better deal than many other delivery companies. Classified as employees, workers receive hourly wages and are promised a 100% payout of tips.</p> <p>It’s a contrast with restaurant delivery companies such as DoorDash, whose gig workers – classified as “independent contractors” – can end up earning <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/nyregion/nyc-gig-workers-pay.html\">less than minimum wage</a>. (A DoorDash spokesperson said workers make “more than $25 per hour on average while on delivery”.)</p> <p>But workers at instant delivery apps have said that when <a href=\"https://www.nysfocus.com/2022/05/05/buyk-delivery-wage-theft/#:~:text=Before%20the%20Russian%2Dfunded%20delivery,say%20it%20failed%20to%20deliver.\">tips or paychecks</a> go missing – a consistent worker complaint – it’s often unclear who to go to, making it hard to ensure they are paid all they are owed. “I got tired of them just giving me the runaround,” a delivery worker for the now defunct Buyk <a href=\"https://www.nysfocus.com/2022/05/05/buyk-delivery-wage-theft/#:~:text=Before%20the%20Russian%2Dfunded%20delivery,say%20it%20failed%20to%20deliver.\">told New York Focus</a> in May. “They told me to speak to my manager about the tips. When I spoke to my manager, he told me he had nothing to do with our tips.”</p> <p>The companies treat workers, “not as a source of profit that keeps the company going, but just another expense on a spreadsheet to minimize the costs of and reduce when times are slow”, says Shelly Steward, director of the Future of Work Initiative at the Aspen Institute.</p> <p>“One of the things that has kept people turning to this kind of work is how broken the larger labor market is,” says Steward. There aren’t enough good jobs, she says, meaning workers have nowhere to turn except “jobs where the conditions are horrible, the risks are high, and the income is volatile and unpredictable”.</p> <p>Rapid delivery companies also have impacts on the communities in which they are sited.

You’re selling this for $5 and they’re selling it for $3. At that point he said, ‘It’s a problem.’”</p> <p>Bello says there are some apps that seem to want to help smaller businesses. He was in talks with Gorillas about selling bodega sandwiches through their app. “Their founder is also an immigrant and he didn’t want to harm bodegas,” Bello says.</p> <p>Sharon Zukin, a professor emerita of social anthropology and author of The Innovation Complex: Cities, Tech, and the New Economy<em>, </em>says “there’s this enormous contradiction that’s built into all kinds of digital businesses”. While they operate locally, the money they make often “goes out of the neighborhood, goes out of the city, goes out of the region”, she says.</p> <p>Companies and investors feel little connection to, or responsibility for, the communities they operate in, says Zukin. “You really can never look for ethics on their part,” Zukin says, “beginning at the lowest level with not … cleaning the sidewalk, [or] contributing to local events, or limiting … noise.”</p> <p>Gopuff and FastAF did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Gorillas said: “From day one, we have opted for permanent jobs and hourly wages above the minimum wage.” Riders are provided with e-bikes, have access to sick-leave, paid vacation and fair wages, said the spokesperson, adding that the company also supports small businesses, including bodegas, “amplifying their community-driven missions and allowing them to compete with established industry giants”.</p> <p>Adam Wacenske, Gorilla’s US general manager, said “we strongly contest suggestions that we are not part of the New York City community”, and added, “we always comply with all applicable laws … including zoning regulations”.</p> <p>Langston Dugger, head of US operations at Getir, said its employees “earn benefits and retain 100% of their tips” and receive training, “high-quality safety gear” and e-bikes and e-mopeds. The company has integrated stores into cities, says Duggan, “by encouraging walk-in shopping in many of our stores, getting to know our neighbors, and beautifying our storefronts”.</p> <p>Getir “welcomes regulations” around dark stores, says Nico Probst, head of government relations and is “compliant with all applicable laws”.</p> <p>But worker groups are pushing for more of a spotlight on these instant delivery companies and their impact on workers and neighborhoods.</p> <p>Hildalyn Colón Hernández, director of policy and strategic partnerships of advocacy group Los Deliveristas Unidos (LDU), wants rapid-delivery grocery companies to be clearly defined – whether as grocery stores or something else – and then made to comply with existing guidelines. Food stores in NYC have to follow a <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/businesses/Supermarkets.pdf\">host of rules and regulations</a> that the apps have been able to skirt, Hernández says, “it’s like the law doesn’t apply to them”.</p> <p>In July, New York’s city council <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/work/2022/7/14/23219410/fast-grocery-delivery-nyc-dark-stores#:~:text=City%20Council%20members%20on%20Thursday,and%20promote%20delivery%20worker%20safety.\">introduced three bills </a>to regulate these businesses, including the ability to issue violations for misleading advertising and prevent apps from guaranteeing delivery in 15 minutes or less. Outside the US, European cities such as Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the Netherlands have implemented a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/rotterdam-joins-amsterdam-freezing-new-dark-stores-2022-02-03/\">freeze on new dark store openings</a> for a year, after complaints about their impacts.</p> <p>The experts that spoke to the Guardian called for better local and national regulation and advocated for workers to unionize.

But this time the city really does seem to be getting something tangible, as well as a hope that the attention will last longer than the time it takes for a US president to drink a pint of mild.</p> <p>Alongside the additions of some transport infrastructure and the venues, there has been an explosion of culture covering the city. In some cases that’s literal: Guyanese-British artist Hew Locke’s <a href=\"https://www.ikon-gallery.org/exhibition/foreign-exchange\">Foreign Exchange</a> takes liberties with the statue of Queen Victoria in the square named for her. She will not, of course, be amused that she is crated and placed in a boat with five smaller clones. Locke says he has placed the monarch “as if she is about to be shipped off, like so many of these Victoria statues sent all round the world”.</p> <p>The Birmingham 2022 festival has created, co-opted and repackaged a huge variety of what Brum has to offer culturally this summer. One such exhibition is <a href=\"https://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/bmag/whats-on/in-the-que\">In the Que</a> (Gas Hall, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, every day until ​​30 October, free). Described as “a sensory celebration of one of the UK’s greatest music venues”, this exhibition is a heartfelt homage to a uniquely Brummie nightlife legend. With its home the gothic Grade II-listed Methodist Central Hall for many years, the Que Club was a live music venue, hosting acts such as Pulp and Primal Scream. Possibly more importantly, it was the home of rave and dance culture, with club nights such as House of God. Birmingham, this exhibition says, is more than UB40 and heavy metal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3271023382898bc747318de5e4c350464ce948f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3271023382898bc747318de5e4c350464ce948f1/0_391_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A recreation statue of King Kong unveiled in Birmingham for the Commonwealth Games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A recreation statue of King Kong unveiled in Birmingham for the Commonwealth Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To catch the vibe in the city centre, visit the <a href=\"https://cordiablackswan.co.uk/king-kong-park/\">Commonwealth Games festival park</a> in the nearby Jewellery Quarter (Great Hampton Row, free).

If you trust the online chatter there’s nothing Brummies are more excited about.

At the height of the Bradford Movie Makers’ powers there was a seven-year waiting list for membership, hundreds attended the organisation’s annual film festival and every year bus loads of immaculately dressed members would descend on the seaside town of Bridlington for their summer trip.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2019 and former club president Colin Egglestone, now 89, was outside in the middle of winter in pitch darkness determinedly painting over the graffiti on the doors of the clubhouse. It would barely last the evening before a fresh set of scribbles appeared. Bradford Movie Makers – set up in 1932 as Bradford Cine Circle – was in trouble. It had an ageing membership that barely reached double figures, with no new blood coming in. The organisation was five years behind on the rent, its premises a constant target for vandalism, break-ins and fly-tipping, and its backyard a convenient dumping ground for anything from fridges to condoms to used needles. The end looked imminent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, with the aid of a Covid small business grant and a truly dedicated membership, things are looking healthier. The grant paid for a wall to be erected to keep vandals out, along with a refurb of the clubhouse, and soon new members began to join. The group and its history are now the subject of a documentary, A Bunch of Amateurs, which has just premiered at the Sheffield international documentary festival. It quickly became a word-of-mouth sensation, receiving standing ovations and winning the Audience award. It is a profoundly moving and funny film that acts as an extraordinary document of the power of community and art.</p> <p>The film paints a portrait of a disparate group of characters who are bound together, not only through a love of film but also a deep friendship. “I was quite touched because people were asking which friends we’d be bringing to the 90th party, and Phil said: ‘I’ve got all my friends here at the club,’” says 86-year-old Harry Nicholls, before Phil Wainman, one of the youngest members at 49, dryly retorts: “What I meant was that I have no other friends outside the club.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52abdd1393da8d7291b783b514ca2574a2a06e12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52abdd1393da8d7291b783b514ca2574a2a06e12/254_42_1360_995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Bradford Cine Circle shoot in Bradford Street in 1938.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"732\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Let’s roll … a Bradford Cine Circle shoot in Bradford Street in 1938.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bradford Movie Makers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nicholls’s history with the club goes back decades. If you were wandering the streets of Bradford back in 1979 you may have stumbled on him in front of a camera dressed as Captain Marvel in his wife’s pink tights. While the club primarily makes original films, short and long, from comedy to drama, Nicholls has a taste for remakes that extends to recently playing Superman, superimposed flying over the flickering lights of Bradford at night. He also recreated the opening scene of Oklahoma!, riding a white stallion and singing Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’, complete with Stetson hat and neckerchief. When he proposed that they remake the scene, however, he overlooked one problem: “How’s he going to get on a horse? He’s 80-odd,” someone points out in the documentary, before a suggestion comes. “We could get a Shetland pony, I suppose?” The end result was weeks of work at home for Joe Ogden, who had the task of CGI-ing Nicholls’s head on to the body of a woman who rode a white horse around a field in Nicholls’s outfit.</p> <p>It’s a scenario that captures the essence of the group: something that may seem comical is also underpinned by talent, creative problem-solving and a collaborative approach to film-making that has seen the club produce hundreds of films over the years. These vary from Wainman’s more arty experimental shorts, such as Halloween horror The Haunted Turnip, to local history documentary Bradford in the Frame. Ogden alone is currently working on around 16 films of varying length and genre. “The club is very prolific,” says Nicholls. “A lot of us have really studied the art of movie-making, the proper language of film.” They all chip in too. “I will do anything for someone else’s film,” says Wainman.</p> <p>The club has proved to be personally significant for many of its members. “I’m trying to occupy my nights because I lost my dear wife,” says Nicholls. “Then I lost my younger brother and what really shook me is that I lost my daughter. So I’m trying to keep myself occupied creatively, making films and staying with my friends. You’ve been used to having a family and you’re left on your own. The next-door neighbours are having a barbecue and they’re all laughing and joking and the people on the other side have children out playing and I’m just in on my own. To be able to go to the club is an outlet socially.”</p> <p>Similarly for Wainman, who is a carer for his disabled brother, the club means a lot. “It’s leaving the problems of the real world,” he says. “We go in and we lock ourselves in our own little world. My dad died and my care responsibilities have got tougher, so I’ve become more isolated and it’s harder for me to get out. I live for my film-making. I want to be a professional film-maker. I know bugger all else about life but that creative thing of wanting to write scripts, work with actors, edit films … that’s there. And if I lost that, there would be nothing there.”</p> <p>Having followed the organisation around at the club and at home, including during some of the most testing and isolated moments of their lives during lockdown, A Bunch of Amateurs director Kim Hopkins has seen how important the club is up close. “Where social services have failed people, I think the club has stepped in and kept that community going,” she says. “Thousands of people have been up those rickety stairs and had a lot of pleasure out of that place. It’s really valuable. In the pandemic we all got a taste of what it might be like to feel isolated.

The title of the film refers to a split in the club a few years ago, when it was put to a vote that they move from their dilapidated clubhouse to a Conservative club. “I wouldn’t be seen dead in a Conservative club,” says Wainman. “But some older members wanted it to be like a gentleman’s private film club, where they just show old films and talk about the old days.” The majority voted to stay put, causing several members to leave and one to proclaim, on storming out: “You’re a bunch of amateurs.” But, in the title of the documentary,<strong> </strong>it’s a badge of honour, not an insult. “Professional films need to make money, but as amateur film-makers we can actually tell stories,” says Ogden. “Our stories are just as important as any big Marvel film or any other stuff around.”</p> <p>The group’s current president, Marie McCahery, is feeling optimistic about the future of the club ahead of its major milestone. “It’s rejuvenated,” she says. “With the Covid money, the documentary and Bradford <a href=\"https:///%20%20https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/31/bradford-named-as-the-uk-city-of-culture-2025\" title=\"\">becoming city of culture</a> in 2025, I feel confident of our future.” Many film clubs have closed in recent years, including one in Leeds, but there are still many dotted around the country, from Burnley to Newcastle upon Tyne. “I’m hoping the film will encourage the rejuvenation of other clubs,” says McCahery. “We don’t want to be the only one left standing.” One of the aims of the 90th party is “to do Colin proud”, she says, of the member who is only one year younger than the club itself. On the day his wife died, he still made it to the club out of a sense of commitment, as well as to seek comfort. “I’ll keep going until I’m in my coffin,” he says.</p> <p><em>A Bunch of Amateurs will be released later this year.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/war-and-justice-the-case-of-marine-documentary-al-blackman","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘If you restrain yourself, you get shot’: The Marine A documentary tackling the hypocrisy of war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/war-and-justice-the-case-of-marine-documentary-al-blackman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/29/war-and-justice-the-case-of-marine-documentary-al-blackman","fields":{"headline":"‘If you restrain yourself, you get shot’: The Marine A documentary tackling the hypocrisy of war","trailText":"Film-maker Chris Terrill trained with the marines before embedding in the unit of Al Blackman – where he saw loved ones killed, PTSD and the impossible strain put upon soldiers","byline":"Zoe Williams","body":"<p>On 15 September 2011, a wounded Taliban insurgent was shot by a Marine, Al Blackman. That much is undisputed: later, at a court martial in 2013, Blackman would argue that he shot the man when he believed him already to be dead, but this was not credited and he was found guilty of murder, dismissed from the marines and sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 10 years. In 2017, he was released from prison, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/15/alexander-blackman-royal-marine-a-judges-quash-murder-conviction\">successfully argued on appeal that a mental health condition known as an “adjustment disorder”</a> had significantly impaired his rational decision making.</p> <p>Blackman was the first British soldier to be convicted of a battlefield murder on foreign soil since the second world war. And in the Channel 4 documentary War and Justice: The Case of Marine A, one prosecuting lawyer still takes the view that “it was a murder, by an armed soldier, of somebody who was injured, who’d been dragged down in front of him, and was shot in cold blood”. Yet this story of his trial and eventual (partial) exoneration, directed by Stephen Bennett, told through the footage and testimony of anthropologist and film-maker Chris Terrill – who was embedded in Blackman’s unit – doesn’t even leave you with enough solid ground to know exactly what you think about murder.</p> <p>Terrill, speaking over Zoom from his home in London, describes how he came to be embedded in Helmand province. Generally, a journalist has to be babysat on the frontline, they need six soldiers looking after them and it interrupts their connection to the unit, essentially because they’re a bit annoying. To sidestep this, Terrill trained as a Marine himself, 32 weeks of grindingly hard physical and mental toil, by the end of which, he says, “you are at the level of an Olympic athlete, both in terms of cardiovascular and upper body strength,” and you have the green beret’s “way of seeing: loyalty, unselfishness, determination and perhaps the most important, cheerfulness in the face of adversity”.</p> <p>There was something in the training that other soldiers in the unit, along with Terrill himself – even though he remained a journalist and was never a combatant – all describe. “A form of love between us,” Terrill says. “I’ve never experienced it before. I did that brutal, gruelling training at 55, most of the people I was training with were in their early 20s, but they became lifelong friends.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec25f3f0b57026e17b81f2b746fc187211c2742a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec25f3f0b57026e17b81f2b746fc187211c2742a/0_0_1824_1368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Terrill when embedded with Marines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Terrill when embedded with Marines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Chris Terrill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He’s not making a schmaltzy point about brotherhood, but rather a point about the impossibility of reacclimatising, once you’ve been torn out of the normal world and regrown in this petri dish of love and violence. “When we came back to Brize Norton,” Terrill remembers, “waiting for our families, our blood families, wives, children, mothers, fathers, the Marines would always hesitate because they had become the primary family themselves. They wanted one last man hug. When you go to war, you’re not actually fighting for Queen and country or for the Afghan government or for a flag, you’re fighting for the man on your left and the man on your right.”</p> <p>When the argument was successfully made that Blackman was suffering from an adjustment disorder, one of its core elements was the emotional impact of this doomed comradeship. It’s something Terrill describes as: “When you see people that you love in that way, people that you know would die for you, as you would for them, when you see them killed or maimed, it goes very deep.” You cannot, in precis, see your best friend’s head blown off and think straight afterwards. “The signature casualty which people never talk about,” Terrill says, “is loss of genitalia. IEDs are not necessarily designed to kill you, they’re designed to maim you. Death is easier for the military to cope with.” The language we use to describe the knock-on effects – that soldiers “dehumanise” the enemy, “seek revenge”, lose control in their rage – lends itself quite easily to moral and legal adjudication; revenge is bad, dehumanisation is wrong. But the more this documentary digs into the reality of fighting, and what soldiers’ lives are like afterwards, the more insistently the idea emerges that the human brain is just too complicated for war.</p> <p>Counterinsurgency warfare has specific aspects that are hard to make moral sense of, partly because they don’t make rational sense. The man Blackman killed was referred to at one point as a “$10 Taliban”, men who five minutes before were labourers, recruited by economic necessity or force. The terrain is so unnavigable it sounds like an anxiety dream. The Taliban weren’t even in uniform. “The rules of engagement that generally operated in Afghanistan,” Terrill says, “was something called Card Alpha, you can’t shoot until you’ve been shot at. It’s part of what’s broadly referred to as courageous restraint. It’s very difficult to apply in practice, because often if you restrain yourself courageously, you’re going to get shot.” All of which sounds like quite a circular apologia for Blackman’s actions, but that’s not really the case Terrill or the documentary are making; rather, we need to ask more searching questions about battle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2a89eea58330a57c323faa0fc53d7f6570807681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a89eea58330a57c323faa0fc53d7f6570807681/0_37_1800_2250/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Terrill with his green beret.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Terrill with his green beret.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The military diagnosis we’re more familiar with, of course, is post-traumatic stress disorder, which Terrill has had treatment for in the past two years, thanks to several tours of Helmand, visits to war zones in Africa and covering famines as a journalist. Although we don’t always understand it quite as well as we might think. “There’s a form of PTSD people don’t know much about,” says Terrill. “It’s not the night terrors, being haunted by what you’ve seen and done. It’s that the adrenaline isn’t there any more. War is horrible but it’s bloody exciting. You can get addicted to the rush of combat.” The men who fought alongside Blackman, who were acquitted, describe lost, rootless lives afterwards, unable to see the point of either the time served or the aftermath.</p> <p>This vexed coalition formed the people who joined Claire Blackman, Marine A’s wife, in fighting his appeal. As a result, it encompassed the best and worst of the ex-forces. “[There were] people who genuinely supported him and thought he’d been wronged, but also people who didn’t even think about the ethical implications,” says Terrill. “He just became a poster-boy for the right wing. He knew that, and he didn’t like it. That’s not what the Royal Marines that I knew would stand for.” Green berets, marching on Downing Street, tell the camera that it’s what any of them would have done. Soldiers told Terrill privately that the case of Marine A was isolated only in so far as it had been caught on film.</p> <p>By the time he was released, Blackman had served four years, a model prisoner. “He’s a Marine: he’s neat, he’s tidy, he knows how to say ‘yes, sir, no, sir.’ They thought they might have to put him in isolation, to protect him from Muslim inmates, but he said no.” Though his conviction was reduced to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility, Blackman remains dismissed from the Marines. Terrill takes the incredibly long view, that this dilemma has been around since Aristotle first noticed it, “basically, soldiers are human beings. They are civilians, they are citizens, they have frailties, they have vulnerabilities. We can’t see them as supermen. But because they’re invested with the right and the ability to kill, they have to have a greater moral character than the rest of us.” It’s only because we’re prepared, collectively, to make this unreasonable demand – be like us, only better – that we get to sleep in our beds at night.</p> <p>Yet those timeless questions, can a soldier ever be moral enough, can a society ever be grateful enough, are particularly difficult when considered in today’s context. With another five years’ of perspective, we can see that Afghanistan itself has been brutalised, that this irreversible havoc written into the psyches of the combatants has no greater social good to show for itself.</p> <p>“It’s interesting,” Terrill says, “my first venture into Afghanistan was on the hippy trail in 1969. I went into Helmand never thinking that so many years later, I would return to this place of peace and love and it would have become the killing fields, completely turned on its head.” He finds it “beyond frustrating” from a political perspective that by the mid 2010s, there were green shoots of development, it seemed as though hearts and minds had been won, and all that was torched by the premature withdrawal of troops. “Four-hundred and fifty-three British lives lost. And that’s just British lives.” There is a loud, unspoken “for nothing”.</p> <p>If you look at the war through a geopolitical lens, you get sucked immediately into questions of strategy, tactics, expedience and competence. If you look at it through the case of Marine A, you get to different moral questions: fundamentally, I think, the better we understand the mind, the more impossible a concept a “just war” becomes.</p> <p><em>War and Justice: The Case of Marine A airs on Sun 31st August at 9pm on Channel 4.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2022/jul/29/i-dont-want-my-career-resurrected-the-last-orders-of-pub-rock-pioneer-mickey-jupp","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘I don’t want my career resurrected!’ The last orders of pub rock pioneer Mickey Jupp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/29/i-dont-want-my-career-resurrected-the-last-orders-of-pub-rock-pioneer-mickey-jupp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/jul/29/i-dont-want-my-career-resurrected-the-last-orders-of-pub-rock-pioneer-mickey-jupp","fields":{"headline":"‘I don’t want my career resurrected!’ The last orders of pub rock pioneer Mickey Jupp","trailText":"After emerging from the 60s R&amp;B scene, the songwriter skirted greatness before all but retiring to Cumbria.

With a population of just 15, the tiny village is reached via the hazardous, winding Hardknott Pass, which shares the title of England’s steepest road. It is inaccessible in winter months and a challenging drive even in summer. “The Woolpack pub at the bottom does a good trade from people who come over,” chuckles Mickey Jupp, who has lived here for 39 years. “They come in and say: ‘Can I have a large brandy?’”</p> <p>Before moving to Eskdale, “Juppy” was a quietly but profoundly influential figure in British pop music: a pioneer of 1970s pub rock, he was cited as an inspiration by Dr Feelgood, whose guitarist Wilko Johnson called him “the best white singer I’ve ever heard”, and his songs have been covered by artists ranging from Nick Lowe to Elkie Brooks. However, becoming disaffected with the industry, his career stopped abruptly after his brother gave him the opportunity to look after a cottage in the area they had loved visiting as children. “I knew it was a bad career move,” Jupp admits over a pint in the Boot Inn, where locals know him well. “’Cos you’re supposed to ‘stay close to London’, but look at the beautiful hills. After nearly 40 years I still think: wow, I live here.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d72b53f3084a9ee6ad06758d32fb51f236e7b41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d72b53f3084a9ee6ad06758d32fb51f236e7b41/0_0_2940_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mickey Jupp on tour by train in 1978.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"794\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mickey Jupp on tour by train in 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fowler/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jupp insists he was “running to something, not running away”, but, under the radar, he kept writing songs, squirrelling away home recordings and playing occasional gigs at the Woolpack to locals, tourists and travelling hardcore fans. Eventually, word reached Alan Bambrough of the Hastings-based label Conquest Music, who was astonished to discover that Jupp had amassed a vast secret archive – now estimated at 500 songs – of heartfelt, observant R&amp;B.</p> <p>“It was far too good to be restricted to a small corner of Eskdale and a group of faithful Scandinavian and German fans on Facebook,” Bambrough says. It took him several years to persuade Jupp to put them out – the forthcoming Up Snakes, Down Ladders will be his first new album in four decades – and only on condition that there will be little promotion, no touring and no appearances on Later … With Jools Holland. “The money was useful, but the most important thing was to find a good home for the songs,” says Jupp, 78. But he is adamant: “I don’t want my career being resurrected.”</p> <p>Jupp initially emerged in the 1960s Southend-on-Sea scene that spawned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKs_l5wPh1A\" title=\"\">the Paramounts</a> – “who the Rolling Stones called the best R&amp;B band in the country”, Jupp says – the band that morphed into Procul Harum. Jupp was in the Orioles when he was “gently pushed” into prison over unpaid maintenance payments to his first wife. “The longest six weeks of my life,” he shudders. “For years afterwards, I would dream that I was still inside. Then I’d wake up and think: am I awake or am I still dreaming?”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_kZrtRLf_Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n_kZrtRLf_Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Mickey Jupp: I’d Love to Boogie – video.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He charts his life in “turning points”, starting with his first management and recording contract. “The number of times I’ve thought: I should have said no,” he sighs. “For my own mental health. I was happier working in a builder’s merchants.” Instead, his band Legend recorded for Bell and then Vertigo; their <a href=\"https://www.repertoirerecords.com/artists/legend/legend-legend-aka-red-boot-lp/\" title=\"\">eponymous 1971 album</a> for Vertigo influenced Paul Weller. “But the record company weren’t promoting us and then Marc Bolan sort of stole our drummer [Bill Fifield AKA Bill Legend] for T Rex,” Jupp says. Soon afterwards, Legend imploded after an “awful” gig. “That was April 1972. If we’d have stuck together another six months, we’d have been right there on the first wave of pub rock. That’s the story of my life.”</p> <p>Instead, he became a godfather to the back-to-basics scene spearheaded by the likes of Kursaal Flyers from Southend, Ducks Deluxe from London and Dr Feelgood from Canvey Island.

I never had the same enthusiasm for anything afterwards.”</p> <p>As a solo artist, Jupp appeared on bills with Ian Dury’s pre-Blockheads band <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhFaSuRP1uE\" title=\"\">Kilburn and the High Roads</a> – “A drummer on crutches, fronted by a guy [Dury] who couldn’t sing a note, but absolutely fantastic” – and a pre-Clash Joe Strummer, who was in the 101-ers. “He said to me: ‘Great gig man!’ That’s what you’ve got to say to get anywhere. ‘Great gig, man!’”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvRNRiA_h34\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uvRNRiA_h34?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Dr Feelgood: Down at the Doctors – video.<br></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When punk happened, Stiff Records released the Mickey Jupp’s Legend compilation, but when the Be Stiff tour (Jupp, Jona Lewie, Wreckless Eric, Lene Lovich and Rachel Sweet) toured the UK by train he was “32, 33, the oldest one aboard”. He opted out of the Stiff special at Bottom Line in New York, telling the label he preferred to go home for Christmas. “My name was on the poster, but crossed out,” he chuckles. Jupp also turned down joining Dave Edmunds’ hit band Rockpile, although Edmunds subsequently co-produced 1978’s acclaimed Juppanese, with Nick Lowe.</p> <p>From 1979, Long Distance Romancer was very expensively produced by 10cc’s Godley and Creme (“£28,000 back then”), but Jupp felt they overpolished his songs. Status Quo’s Francis Rossi was behind the desk for 1983’s Shampoo, Haircut and Shave: “He spent most of his time sniffing stuff. The album had a funny sound to it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"22ee9a4b46fb1426dca63d5b5b34d6bd2cbaa38b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22ee9a4b46fb1426dca63d5b5b34d6bd2cbaa38b/0_385_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mickey Jupp outside the Boot Inn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mickey Jupp outside the Boot Inn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were more rewarding interactions. When the Elvis Presley songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller wanted to include a verse of their own in Elkie Brooks’s cover of Jupp’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s00V9y3HFGk\" title=\"\">He Could Have Been an Army</a>, which they were producing, he felt like saying no. “But I thought: come on, Juppy, you can have a record with ‘Jupp, Leiber, Stoller’ on it!” Another “magic moment” came when Ricky Nelson covered Jupp’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxBOQGLCXYs\" title=\"\">You Know What I Mean</a>, backed by Presley’s old band, the Jordanaires. “To me, as a kid, Ricky Nelson was second only to Elvis.” His personal life has been equally colourful. “Three wives, four kids. A lot of them out of wedlock.”</p> <p>In 1978, NME described Jupp as “stubborn. He won’t compromise his principles, fly in a plane to a gig or join the Musicians’ Union. That means he can’t appear on Top of the Pops.” Jupp admits his career has been one of near misses, but he doesn’t regret how it has turned out. “It would have been easier if my frame of mind had been different,” he concedes, draining his pint. “I just didn’t have whatever you need to click with people in this business. I never actually wanted to be famous. All I’ve ever really wanted to do is write songs.”</p> <p>• Up Snakes Down Ladders is released 5 August on Conquest Music.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 29 July 2022 to correctly refer to Godley and Creme, not “Godfrey and Creme” as an earlier version said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2022/jul/29/post-your-questions-for-idris-elba","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T09:54:34Z","webTitle":"Post your questions for Idris Elba","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/29/post-your-questions-for-idris-elba","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/jul/29/post-your-questions-for-idris-elba","fields":{"headline":"Post your questions for Idris Elba","trailText":"Ahead of the release of new film Beast, the actor, musician, podcaster and possibly the next James Bond will take on your questions","byline":"Rich Pelley","body":"<p>Faces and voices don’t come more famous than 49-year-old Idris Elba.

She had also recently discharged her own legal representatives.</p> <p>At a hearing on 28 July, a request was made to dismiss the case with prejudice.</p> <p>Dylan’s lead lawyer, Orin Snyder of Gibson Dunn, said in a statement: “This case is over. It is outrageous that it was ever brought in the first place. We are pleased that the plaintiff has dropped this lawyer-driven sham and that the case has been dismissed with prejudice.”</p> <p>Dylan, 81, is yet to comment on the outcome.</p> <p>The case was originally filed in New York state supreme court on 13 August 2021, alleging that the abuse occurred in Dylan’s room at the Chelsea Hotel between April and May 1965, when the musician would have been 23 to 24 years old.</p> <p>Dylan denied the allegations in a statement shared by his spokesperson: “The 56-year-old claim is untrue and will be vigorously defended.”</p> <p>Her lawsuit argued that Dylan had “exploited his status as a musician by grooming JC to gain her trust and to obtain control over her as part of his plan to sexually molest and abuse JC”.</p> <p>It further claimed that Dylan aimed to “lower her inhibitions with the object of sexually abusing her, which he did, coupled with the provision of drugs, alcohol and threats of physical violence, leaving her emotionally scarred and psychologically damaged to this day”.</p> <p>After Dylan’s lawyers called it a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/19/bob-dylan-movements-not-inconsistent-with-alleged-sex-abuse-says-lawyer-for-accuser\">“chronological impossibility”</a> that Dylan – possibly one of the most documented and scrutinised musicians of all time – was in New York City during the alleged timeframe, the woman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/07/bob-dylan-lawyers-abuse-lawsuit\">updated her lawsuit</a> claiming that the alleged abuse took place during “several months in the spring of 1965”.</p> <p>In response, Dylan’s legal team called it a “brazen shakedown … false, malicious, reckless and defamatory”. It continued: “Mr Dylan will not be extorted. Mr Dylan will vigorously defend himself against these lawyer-driven lies and seek redress against all those responsible, including by seeking monetary sanctions against persons responsible for manufacturing and bringing this abusive lawsuit.”</p> <p>They claimed that the woman “told a very different story about her alleged interactions with Mr Dylan to a journalist, Mr Daryl Sanders, in 2017” and attempted to discredit JC by highlighting her work as a psychic.</p> <p>Dylan recently announced his first UK tour in more than five years.

After shaping the Hollywood architecture for more than a decade, the Disney-owned superhero studio has in the past nine months released a trio of movies – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/04/eternals-review-chloe-zhaos-indie-nuance-cant-power-the-marvel-machine\">Eternals</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/03/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review-benedict-cumberbatch-alt-reality\">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/05/thor-love-and-thunder-review-taika-waititi-hammers-home-franchise-fun\">Thor: Love and Thunder</a> – that if not quite duds, certainly came nowhere near the top ranks of the critical pantheon.</p> <p>With a lingering sense that any movie not part of the Multiverse Saga (now officially concocting phases four, five and six) might as well have been subheaded “a filler you needn’t have bothered catching”, the studio seemed to be going through a sticky period. But let’s put this in perspective: we are talking about a few under par episodes in a series that now stretches to 29 films, the majority of which have received critical acclaim. Like Real Madrid falling to the occasional defeat, or the Beatles recording Rocky Raccoon, it was bound to happen sooner or later.</p> <p>If we were starting to feel like doubters, Comic-Con turned us into believers. It wasn’t necessarily <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlOB3UALvrQ\">the release of the trailer for November’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a> (intriguing and inspiring, but you wonder how it’s all going to work out post-Chadwick Boseman) or even the announcements of Captain America: New World Order and Thunderbolts for May and July 2024 respectively, it was the overall sense that Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige does, after all, have some idea of where this is all going.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlOB3UALvrQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RlOB3UALvrQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Everything from Black Widow onwards is now part of the Multiverse Saga, with the previous 23 movies (culminating in 2019’s Spider-Man: Far from Home) now renamed the Infinity Saga. This might seem like mere creative accountancy, the studio equivalent of a small child dividing his toys into Lego and Duplo, but it helps to make sense of the chaos.</p> <p>Moreover, we now know where this is going to end up, just as we did with the first two dozen movies. Back then we were all waiting for the final climactic battle with Thanos, and wondering quite how badass the giant purple Titan might end up being. This time we know that phase six (and the Multiverse Saga) will climax once again with a pair of ensemble movies: 2025’s Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars.</p> <p>Who will be taking charge of the ultimate superhero team this time around is the question films such as 2023’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, Blade and The Marvels will be hoping to answer. The new Fantastic Four movie is due to debut in November 2024, six months before The Kang Dynasty, which means there’s still a chance the awesome foursome could play a part in events.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b173f43df2456da9d35b4ec720f109a83fdf0ed0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b173f43df2456da9d35b4ec720f109a83fdf0ed0/0_229_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Time-travelling supervillain … Jonathan Majors is due to play Kang the Conqueror.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Time-travelling supervillain … Jonathan Majors is due to play Kang the Conqueror.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aude Guerrucci/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With those Avengers films arriving just six months apart, it seems likely that Kang the Conqueror will be the villain of both movies. Comic book aficionados will be aware that the time-travelling supervillain often finds himself up against the Fantastic Four in print: it’s perhaps not surprising that we’re due to meet the MCU version (played by Jonathan Majors) in Quantumania, since it was the fluctuation of time dynamics in the Quantum Realm that first inspired Tony Stark and Bruce Banner to begin dabbling with time travel in Avengers: Endgame. Will Kang also be the powerful figure that transports all Marvel’s superheroes to a strange planet named Battleworld in Secret Wars (replacing the comic books’ The Beyonder?) It seems a fair bet.</p> <p>What we can certainly expect to see in the Marvel movies (and TV shows) released between now and 2025 is a slow build to that final double whammy of a finale. Perhaps new superheroes such as Mahershala Ali’s Blade and Tenoch Huerta’s Namor the Sub-Mariner (Marvel’s version of Aquaman who will appear for the first time in Wakanda Forever) are being lined up to start encountering the evil arch-manipulator. Or maybe he’ll turn up somewhere else.</p> <p>Whatever happens, the sense that Marvel is treading water has been banished. The studio may not yet have restored its reputation but at least we know there’s a plan – even if only Kang himself knows what it is.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/29/nepal-bengal-tiger-numbers-recover-attacks-people","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T09:33:13Z","webTitle":"Nepal’s tiger numbers recover but attacks on people cause alarm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/29/nepal-bengal-tiger-numbers-recover-attacks-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/29/nepal-bengal-tiger-numbers-recover-attacks-people","fields":{"headline":"Nepal’s tiger numbers recover but attacks on people cause alarm","trailText":"Nepalese population of Bengal tigers has nearly tripled in 12 years and conflict with humans is increasing","byline":"Patrick Greenfield","body":"<p>Nepal’s tiger population has nearly tripled in 12 years, the country’s prime minister has announced.

He has found that cases of predators are rare, with the majority of incidents caused by accidental encounters.</p> <p>“People end up bumping into tigers much more often, so it results in accidental encounters where tigers get startled when they’re resting and they respond by attacking.

Or would you be more surprised to learn this from a Predator film? At the same time as giving us the usual invisible alien-inflicted butchery, Prey, the fifth and latest instalment of the franchise, delivers its first history lesson.</p> <p>This lithe, primitivist reinvention takes place in 1719, when a band of Comanche find themselves becoming quarry for one of the intergalactic trophy-hunters who has turned up a few centuries too early to run into Arnold Schwarzenegger. Packed with authentic period detail (such as the Indigenous oral hygiene), it’s probably the first big-budget film about Native Americans since 1992’s Last of the Mohicans.</p> <p>Representation is the kind of woke buzzword that would have had Arnie and his meathead brigade reaching for their grenade-launchers back in the 80s. And Prey doubles down by making its hero a woman. Amber Midthunder, a 25-year-old Assiniboine Sioux actor who plays lead character Naru, says that she has been selective in the past when it comes to Indigenous roles. “A different level of care goes into choosing them because often the representation is not the best, especially for people who get so little representation.” But, spaceships aside, she says Prey felt different. “For a period piece, it showed so much more cultural accuracy, instead of boiling us down to something one-dimensional, like that hyper-spiritual side or something overly violent.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ7LytagKlc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wZ7LytagKlc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That this Hollywood-produced film doesn’t step into any cultural mantraps is down to its Comanche producer, Jhane Myers. She was hired by the director, Dan Trachtenberg, to ensure this frontier sci-fi remained grounded in Native American reality. With her CV – Comanche and Blackfoot advocate, traditional artist and craftsperson, and world-champion buckskin dancer – she reminded him of the film’s resourceful protagonist. “He said talking to me was like talking to the grownup Naru,” says Myers.</p> <p>The kind of cultural consultancy work she had done before on the likes of The Lone Ranger and Wind River can be limited in scope, she says. “A director may have something written, and that’s just the way it’s going to be whether it’s true or not. You can voice that, but doesn’t always mean that’s going to happen.” Having full producer status on Prey was a major step up, she says. “If somebody’s a consultant, they’re not on there full-time – maybe they’re on the phone or whatever. But when you’re there in person and hands-on, it makes a big difference.”</p> <p>Myers compiled a hefty manual of Comanche customs that Prey’s various production departments could make reference to: everything from the earth pigments used to make the tribe’s signature black, red and white colours, to how they cured meat. The plot device of a young woman who wants to break custom and become a warrior sounds like a modern concoction. But in fact, Myers points out, there are many precedents in Native American history, including Buffalo Calf Road Woman, who killed General Custer, according to some sources, and the Apache warrior Lozen. To match up to these illustrious predecessors, Midthunder, along with the rest of the cast, attended the Native American version of the now-traditional Hollywood bootcamp, learning archery, tomahawk and spear-fighting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71486925174031fa035ee4bff9e305978bcb9462\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71486925174031fa035ee4bff9e305978bcb9462/0_0_3000_2282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jhane Myers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jhane Myers, who helped reshape the script from the inside out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Working alongside Juanita Pahdopony, another Comanche educator, Myers’ influence helped reshape the script from the inside out. Naru was originally named Kee, which means “no” in the tribe’s language. But Myers felt she should be named for what she did; in this case, “fight”. She also objected to the practice of giving Indigenous characters generic names, such as Comanche No 1; even the most disposable of French trappers got to enjoy being called the likes of Rambert in the three seconds before they were eviscerated by the Predator. “So I assigned them names,” says Myers. “It gave the actors more spirit to get into their character. If I’m Native Woman No 1, I don’t know what that feels like. But if my name is Naru, and I have fight and I have that kind of spirit, I know what that’s like, right?”</p> <p>You believe she does. Myers says she moved into producing in order to change “everything” about the way Hollywood depicted her people. From the earliest westerns, Native Americans have been, in her eyes, “romanticised by people that really didn’t know our culture”. When Indigenous people look for films in which they feel well-represented, there are only “bits and pieces” in the canon that do the job. A friend of hers says that Hollywood discovers Native Americans every 20 years; two rounds back saw perhaps the most prominent example, Kevin Costner’s Dances With Wolves. She concedes that film was respectfully done, but points out that the subtitled Lakota was often completely mistranslated. She still sees the same kind of corner-cutting. “A lot of times when you try to add Native content or correct things in a script, you come up against: ‘Oh, we don’t have the budget for that. Oh, it would be too hard.’ So I want to shift that paradigm.”</p> <p>Midthunder believes that Native American opportunities on screen are slowly expanding. She compares the situation to that of her actor father, David Midthunder, who was offered only a series of what she calls “feathers and leathers” roles: trackers, hunters and scouts. (Billy, the laconic point man in the original Predator played by the part-Cherokee actor Sonny Landham, was in that vein.) “Only recently are we getting projects that have Native characters afforded things like personalities and relationships, and be seen in urban societies,” says Midthunder. She points to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/01/why-reservation-dogs-is-the-funniest-and-most-groundbreaking-new-tv-show\">teen comedy Reservation Dogs</a> – co-created by Seminole film-maker Sterlin Harjo with Taika Waititi – and her own role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/08/legion-review-marvel-mental-health-superhero\">X-Men spin-off Legion</a>, where her mutant character’s Native heritage is mentioned but not defining.

Johnson/20th Century Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before it was finalised, Myers screened Prey to the various departments of the Comanche nation. They loved it, but what they loved most of all was the fact that, for once, they were being screened an unfinished film – when they still had the chance to reshape it. One thing the studio wouldn’t budge on was putting the film out as standard in the Comanche dub (the language only features sporadically in the English version) – a shame when you consider the likes of Apocalypto have shown that that level of immersive authenticity can work for mainstream audiences.</p> <p>But the most important thing, as its producer points out, is that it exists in the mainstream arena at all. “Because it’s sci-fi, it’s action, yet it has Native culture in it, there are young film-makers that will watch it and be excited to do something of their own. We’re barely scratching the surface of the Native content market. It’s untapped. Imagine if somebody does something totally off the hook just because they watched this.” Hopefully soon, camouflaged aliens will be the only kind of on-screen invisibility Native Americans have to contend with.</p> <p>• Prey is available on Disney+ on 5 August.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2022/jul/29/can-you-make-hair-gel-from-that-superfood-star-the-chia-seed","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T09:00:02Z","webTitle":"Can you make hair gel from that superfood star the chia seed?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jul/29/can-you-make-hair-gel-from-that-superfood-star-the-chia-seed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2022/jul/29/can-you-make-hair-gel-from-that-superfood-star-the-chia-seed","fields":{"headline":"Can you make hair gel from that superfood star the chia seed?","trailText":"Packed with vitamins, this home treatment promises a lot – if you’re willing to invest the effort","byline":"Anita Bhagwandas","body":"<p><strong>The hack </strong><br>Can I make a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEScErd6CwI\" title=\"\">hair gel from chia seeds</a> and warm water?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jul/15/can-micellar-water-clean-your-hair-as-well-as-your-face\">Can micellar water clean your hair as well as your face?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The test </strong><br>Sprinkled on porridge, chia seeds are like that friend who is annoyingly good at everything – they’re packed with soluble fibre (good for digestion) and also provide a whack of protein, omega-3 and -6 oils and <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/chia-seeds#vitamins-minerals\" title=\"\">vitamins</a>.

I had finished a postgrad in sustainable agriculture and was working in a cafe while living with my parents in Stirling. It was the middle of the last recession and I was finding it hard to get a job. My parents were trying to sell their house and, as I had a bit of time on my hands, they asked me to sort out the garden.</p> <p>It was a jungle. I cleared all the weeds, and began to plant it – things like lobelia ‘Queen Victoria’ and hollyhock. Then I began a vegetable plot – mangetout, swede, beetroot, purple potatoes – and even revived their tiny greenhouse. I became obsessed. Horticulture combined all sorts of things I found interesting – both ecology and science, but it also had an artistic side; it’s not something that’s talked about in schools.</p> <p>I couldn’t afford to go back to university, but fortunately, most of the training opportunities for horticulture are paid. I managed to get an apprenticeship at an RHS garden in north Devon and it all started from there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>I’ve worked at Kew for four and a half years. At first I worked in the Temperate House, which has a Mediterranean climate. But then I was given the opportunity to move to the Palm House, where the tropical plants live, and I jumped at the chance. It is home to a plant that is, as far as we know, the oldest pot plant in the world. It is a giant cycad or <em>Encephalartos altensteinii</em>, native to the Eastern Cape province of South Africa and brought to the UK in 1775 by the botanist Francis Masson. In 1848, the Palm House was completed at Kew Gardens and this giant cycad was moved there.</p> <p>He is toxic all the way through: very spiky, very stoic. We see him as a gentle giant, really – he just gets on with life. When you get to know a person very well, you can tell instantly if they look a little off colour. Caring for plants is the same. As I walk through the Palm House, I’m looking out for how the different plants seem, their colour, texture, the angles of their leaves, and I’m also paying attention to the quality of the air – is it too dry, or too hot?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea089ab6e6fab8fe8b529cb581e94b540c73b154\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea089ab6e6fab8fe8b529cb581e94b540c73b154/112_0_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The giant cycad, or Encephalartos altensteinii\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The giant cycad, or <em>Encephalartos altensteinii</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew McRobb, Kew Gardens/Kew Gardens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some plants are very dramatic, and will droop significantly or start to yellow as soon as something is wrong, but the giant cycad isn’t one of those. He’s more like a grumpy grandfather, who sits by the fire and doesn’t say much except, “Leave me be; I’ll be fine.” He just keeps on growing, slowly, approximately 2.5cm a year. Today, he’s about 4 metres long, and held up by a series of metal supports so his trunk doesn’t break.</p> <p>Over the winter we probably water him once a week, and in the summer months he’ll get a little bit more. We’ll water him all the way through his pot, give him a good soak, which is a useful tip for most pot plants – give them a good soak through the pot rather than sprinkling a bit of water on top. Apart from that, he gets sprayed with water every morning like all the other plants, and is fed every week with fertiliser. It is sometimes seaweed-based but we like to change it up so the plants get all their minerals. Though generally we just leave him to do his thing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/01/experience-i-led-a-renters-rebellion-and-won\">Experience: I led a renters’ rebellion – and won</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s unavoidable in this line of work to personify plants and begin to feel for them. I think that’s something that humans always do. You might remember that one plant flowered fantastically one year, but then the next year it doesn’t do so well, and you think, “Oh god, what’s wrong?” So there is some anxiety. But equally in horticulture there’s a requirement to be detached – because something will always go wrong. Plants will decide whether or not they want to grow. And there’s nothing we can do about it. We just have to get over it.</p> <p>The giant cycad is so chill that he’s not usually the source of this anxiety – the only danger he faces is when he needs moving or repotting. He’s been moved before, but when it’s on your head, that’s really nerve-racking. You think, this is something that has been part of people’s lives for hundreds of years. If the worst happened and the end of the trunk did come off, it would probably still survive. But, obviously, you don’t want that to happen. I’m sure it’ll be fine.</p> <p>• As told to Felix Bazalgette</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

If we elect a couple of attorney generals who refuse to certify the 2024 elections, it essentially means our democracy is gone. It couldn’t be more stark, so these elections really matter for the whole country,” said Mayes, in an interview with the Guardian at her Phoenix home.</p> <p>In 2020, Trump pressured Republican officials to overturn Biden’s victory in swing states including Arizona, where multiple investigations and lawsuits have ruled out fraud. Last week, House speaker Rusty Bowers, who testified in front of the January 6 congressional committee about Trump’s efforts to force him and other local officials to overturn the results, was <a href=\"https://www.azfamily.com/2022/07/20/arizona-gop-censures-house-speaker-rusty-bowers/\">declared “unfit to serve”</a> by the state Republican party.</p> <p>The sanction, which Mayes described as a “travesty”, reaffirmed her decision to leave the party.</p> <p>“I was a lifelong Republican but the party left me and many moderates like me.

There’s been a very clear trend to curtail voting rights and as attorney general I will use my bully pulpit and the courts to fight those efforts.”</p> <p>Mayes’ opponent will be decided in next week’s primary, with the six Republican candidates vying for the nomination each having made border security and election integrity central to their platforms.</p> <p>But it’s abortion that has brought increased scrutiny to the attorney general race since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and handed back power to the states.</p> <p>Shortly after, Mark Brnovich, the outgoing attorney general and senate candidate, tried <a href=\"https://kjzz.org/content/1795171/brnovich-files-motion-allowing-charges-against-doctors-who-do-abortions-what-could\">to revive a statute from Arizona’s territorial days</a> that bans abortion in almost all circumstances.

As attorney general I should not and will not enforce laws I believe are unconstitutional and therefore will not prosecute any woman, doctor, midwife, pharmacist under these laws.</p> <p>“I think our founding fathers would be appalled by these laws,” added Mayes, who can use her supervisory authority over county attorneys to advise them that prosecutions would be unconstitutional.</p> <p>Arizona’s constitution is one of the most individually oriented in the country, but if Mayes wins, abortion will almost certainly end up in the state supreme court – which the outgoing governor Doug Ducey has packed with a conservative super majority.</p> <p>Ultimately, abortion rights advocates will probably attempt to give Arizonans the final say through a ballot initiative, though recent changes by the Republican controlled legislature has made this harder. <a href=\"https://kjzz.org/content/1796549/abortion-ruling-puts-new-focus-arizonas-attorney-general-race\">Almost nine out of 10 Arizonans</a> want abortion to remain legal at least in some circumstances.</p> <p>Mayes said: “Republican leaders are in a race to bottom to satisfy a base which doesn’t represent many moderate Republicans or independents who are repulsed by the criminalization of abortion.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Donald Trump has endorsed a bunch of big lie proponents in the state including attorney general hopeful Abe Hamadeh, 31, the son of Syrian immigrants and former Maricopa county prosecutor, who has indicated that <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/10/arizona-attorney-general-candidates-share-their-stances-abortion/7706590001/\">he supports the pre-statehood abortion law</a>, describes the humanitarian crisis at the border as an “invasion” and does not <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/06/abe-hamadeh-arizona-attorney-general-primary-2022-candidate/9747331002/\">believe Biden won the 2020 election</a>.</p> <p>The attorney general’s office has been held by a Republican for the past decade, but Mayes says she doesn’t fear any of the candidates. “They’re all the same – all six have said they would not have certified the 2020 election and to a person they seem almost giddy about prosecuting women and doctors after the fall of Roe. I know Arizonans are going to reject this brand of anti-democratic and anti-woman Republicanism.”</p> <p>Mayes says she will use the state’s $5bn surplus to target the huge explosion of fentanyl trafficking into the state, which mostly arrives from Mexico through legal points of entry, but is otherwise light on details about the southern border.</p> <p>Unlike most of the Republican candidates, Mayes does not have experience in the criminal justice system, but argues that her background in environmental law and consumer protection makes her uniquely qualified to tackle the state’s climate challenges.</p> <p>“We are in the midst of an epic drought, escalating heat and dwindling water supplies.

In 2017, Big Little Lies<em> </em>spilled<em> </em>the scandalous secrets of wealthy women in multimillion-dollar beachside properties, and inspired a slew of imitators – most of them also starring Nicole Kidman. Few, though, have distilled the sub-genre’s appeal as crudely as Surface<em> </em>(Apple TV+). What do we want? Gorgeous, rich people being miserable. When do we want it? Now. (Or at least, the first three episodes on demand, with the rest debuting weekly.)</p> <p>In Surface the main gorgeous rich person is Sophie (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), the indifferent owner of a grand San Francisco home (one of those Lower Haight Victorians, for architecture fans), a walk-in wardrobe brimming with designer clothing and a diary packed with nothing but social engagements. Some months ago, Sophie lost her memory after – <em>apparently</em> – jumping off the side of a ferry in an attempted suicide. And herein likes the series’ central mystery, as Sophie helpfully signposts during a therapy session: “If my life was so perfect, why did I try to end it?”</p> <p>Of course, under that placid surface, the woman is a-swirl with nebulous emotions and treacherous undercurrents. She has similar problems to Nicole Kidman’s character in Big Little Lies<em>, </em>and indeed Nicole Kidman’s character in The Undoing<em>,</em> in that her model-handsome husband may well be plotting to murder her, but – bad luck – she fancies him anyway. That’s the show’s secondary mystery: how this marriage endures in the near-total absence of sexual chemistry, especially as husband James (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) has an annoying habit of blinking really slowly during moments of stress.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH3yylTyB8M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dH3yylTyB8M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Who can Sophie confide in about her troubles? Not the sexy undercover cop (Stephan James) who she always seems to bump into on her daily, sweat-free jog – his interest in her case may be more than merely professional. Not her bestie Caroline (Ari Graynor), whose pseudo-sympathetic head tilt is a body language red-flag. And certainly not the disapproving therapist, Hannah, played by Marianne Jean Baptiste. Those thick-rimmed specs may inspire confidence (they’re reminiscent of the Guardian’s own agony aunt, Philippa Perry), but this woman clearly can’t be trusted.</p> <p>All this is obvious since, from the opening shot onwards, Surface is a paint-by-numbers psychological thriller. That initial image of Sophie sinking down, down into the sea’s murky depths, then waking from her nightmare, head nestled on a silk pillow is the same “drowning woman” visual metaphor, rendered in the same watery blues and greys, that we’ve seen a hundred times before. And that repetitive imagery would be more forgivable if Surface’s slow plot didn’t feel equally waterlogged.</p> <p>It’s no surprise to see an exec producer credit here for Big Little Lies’ Reese Witherspoon (her 2020 show Little Fires Everywhere was more of the same), but creator-showrunner Veronica West should have been an unpredictable element. She’s best known for the 2020 TV adaptation of Nick Hornby’s High Fidelity, which had its moments, despite egregiously miscasting Zoë Kravitz (another Big Little Lies alum) as a nerdy, lovelorn muso. Surface, to West’s credit, does not repeat the error. Mbatha-Raw, with her brittle elegance, makes perfect sense as this polished-yet-pained tabula rasa of a woman, a stranger even to herself. Every character in this show has superficial charm, but only she can convincingly hint at depths beneath.</p> <p>Unfortunately it takes until episode five for Sophie to so much as smudge her eye makeup, never mind display a dark side. Her tastefully insipid world is crying out for a splash of chaos, but these characters are so inert they make the Italian marble kitchen island look lively. Even Sophie and James’s wild nights of abandon are tragically starched. An impulsive all-nighter, early on in their courtship, involves sipping at high-end spirits, shuffling to bland jazz and never undoing so much as a top button.</p> <p>Such terminal vibe-lessness must be God’s way of punishing the ultra-rich, but that doesn’t explain why we TV viewers must also suffer. As its mystery unfolds, Surface plays more like a cautionary tale for chippy social climbers, who dare to claim their share, than a thoughtful look at one woman’s shifting sense of self. The message is clear: it doesn’t matter how far you run – or how svelte you look in your athleisure running gear – you can never escape your past.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/jul/29/garma-anthony-albanese-inflation-jim-chalmers-covid-omicron-death-rate-cost-of-living-aukus-commonwealth-games-john-barilaro-stuart-ayres-linda-burney","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T08:55:37Z","webTitle":"Karen Andrews links June asylum seeker boat arrivals to Labor policy – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/29/garma-anthony-albanese-inflation-jim-chalmers-covid-omicron-death-rate-cost-of-living-aukus-commonwealth-games-john-barilaro-stuart-ayres-linda-burney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/29/garma-anthony-albanese-inflation-jim-chalmers-covid-omicron-death-rate-cost-of-living-aukus-commonwealth-games-john-barilaro-stuart-ayres-linda-burney","fields":{"headline":"Karen Andrews links June asylum seeker boat arrivals to Labor policy – as it happened","trailText":"This blog is now closed","byline":"Nino Bucci (now) and Natasha May (earlier)","body":"<div id=\"block-62e3964e8f08c00147326bd3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-29T08:36:34.258Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">That's it for today, thanks for reading</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are the main stories on Friday, 29 July:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The infrastructure minister, <strong>Catherine King</strong>, says a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/coalitions-115bn-regional-grants-program-favoured-liberal-and-national-seats-audit-shows\">regional grants scheme</a> that was “contaminated” by the Coalition may need an overhaul, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/29/garma-anthony-albanese-inflation-jim-chalmers-covid-omicron-death-rate-cost-of-living-aukus-commonwealth-games-john-barilaro-stuart-ayres-linda-burney?page=with:block-62e3879b8f08c00147326b52#block-62e3879b8f08c00147326b52\">it has been defended</a> by the former deputy PM <strong>Michael McCormack</strong>;</li> \n   <li>At least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/29/garma-anthony-albanese-inflation-jim-chalmers-covid-omicron-death-rate-cost-of-living-aukus-commonwealth-games-john-barilaro-stuart-ayres-linda-burney?page=with:block-62e367af8f08730a1f7f352a#block-62e367af8f08730a1f7f352a\">157 Covid deaths recorded</a> across Australia (including 105 in Victoria that were not previously reported because of a data issue);</li> \n   <li>Former home affairs minister <strong>Karen Andrews</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/29/garma-anthony-albanese-inflation-jim-chalmers-covid-omicron-death-rate-cost-of-living-aukus-commonwealth-games-john-barilaro-stuart-ayres-linda-burney?page=with:block-62e36f788f08af33ff4a3299#block-62e36f788f08af33ff4a3299\">links the interception of four asylum seeker boats</a> from Sri Lanka to the immigration policies of the new Labor government;</li> \n   <li>Independent ACT senator <strong>David Pocock</strong> has his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/29/act-senator-pocock-denied-auslan-interpreter-for-maiden-speech-in-senate\">request for an Auslan interpreter</a> in the Senate to translate his first speech denied by the major parties, who are worried about the “precedent” it would set;<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Jacqui Lambie </strong>and <strong>Tammy Tyrrell </strong>are the latest two senators to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/29/garma-anthony-albanese-inflation-jim-chalmers-covid-omicron-death-rate-cost-of-living-aukus-commonwealth-games-john-barilaro-stuart-ayres-linda-burney?page=with:block-62e383e28f08c00147326b39#block-62e383e28f08c00147326b39\">staffing levels restored</a> by the Albanese government;</li> \n   <li>The ALP national executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/29/garma-anthony-albanese-inflation-jim-chalmers-covid-omicron-death-rate-cost-of-living-aukus-commonwealth-games-john-barilaro-stuart-ayres-linda-burney?page=with:block-62e352978f08c001473269da#block-62e352978f08c001473269da\">takes over the Tasmania branch</a>, saying it needed to intervene to rebuild the culture of the party;

\n  <p>The party on Friday announced the operations of the state conference and current administrative committee would be suspended for up to three years.<br></p> \n  <p>Labor has been in opposition in Tasmania since 2014, with the party suffering a swing against it at the May federal election despite widespread success on the mainland.<br></p> \n  <p>State Labor leader Rebecca White, who has led the party to election losses in 2018 and 2021, said the party’s culture needed to improve.<br></p> \n  <p>“We need all arms of the party to be working smarter, and better together.

They both wear their African hair in braids.</p> \n<p>The Highview College principal, Melinda Scash, confirmed the students had not been in attendance at the school and were cut off from all resources. She said their mother had also been banned from the site due to “aggressive” behaviour. “They’re choosing not to come,” she said.</p> \n<p>“We will never acquiesce to aggression, threats or vilification.”</p> \n<p>Scash said the college’s uniform expectations were “transparent and constantly … updated”, including in “direct response” to the Rowe family’s advice.</p> \n<p>She said the word “brushed” had recently been removed from the requirement for “neatly brushed hair” after recognition it was culturally insensitive to many students, while the college had also removed “multiple braids” and “dreadlocks” from definitions of “extreme hairstyles”. Shoulder-length hair can be worn out.</p> \n<p>Scash said the two students were “choosing” not to accommodate school expectations, which continued to require that beads, glass and adornments were not embedded into hairstyles, and had never previously raised concerns with staff about head pain.</p> \n<p>“Amayah was calmly, consistently and persistently asked by staff to tie her braids back, and she most often did comply; reluctantly, but without protest,” she said.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Scash said the uniform requirements only became a “point of contention” when Rowe arrived with her girls on Tuesday and asserted they would not comply with college requirements. The dispute was first reported by the ABC.</p> \n<p>“Following this dramatic and unexpected exclamation, the girls most definitely were directed by me not to attend their classes and to go home and to take some time to reconsider their choices,” she said.</p> \n<p>“As principal, I never negotiate when ultimatums are being demanded … I …suspended their access to on-line resources and access to their teachers.</p> \n<p>“Attendance at school is important and Highview teachers are not required to cater specifically for students who are choosing not to comply with college expectations.”</p> \n<p>Their mother, Rebecca Rowe, said she had tried to discuss the matter with Scash and was told if they did not like it they could leave.</p> \n<p>Rowe said Amayah had been pulled aside by the principal on Monday to discuss the uniform code and she had arrived to pick her up early on Tuesday when Scash emerged from her office. She said while the meeting was “emotionally charged”, nobody was aggressive.</p> \n<p>“I never said they wouldn’t comply, I said they couldn’t,” she said.</p> \n<p>“It’s frustrating, we’re in a rural area with limited schools, and [leaving] has been the only option anyone’s given.</p> \n<p>“There’s no resolution in sight. The whole situation is crazy.

As a teenager, she was told to get rid of her braids because they would “prevent her from getting a career”.</p> \n<p>“African people need to be supported to be who they are … hair is our identity, part of us.

Difference isn’t a bad word.”</p> \n<p>Cynthia Simango is an afro texture and curly hair educator and founder of Embrace For Every Curl.</p> \n<p>“Most white Australians with short hair have never thought about their hair when they wake up,” she said. “They can take a shower, blow-dry their hair and tie it back.

For me, a lot of my faith has to do with that and the legal documentation of that. But I do know that a lot of people are still continuing to have those discussions.”</p> <p>Noem, the first woman to hold the governor’s office in South Dakota and up for reelection this year, resisted significant lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic and accused other state governors of having “overstepped their authority”. In <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/event/true-grit-tough-times-governor-kristi-noem-shares-lessons-learned\">her address to the Heritage Foundation</a> on Wednesday, she also lambasted Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert.</p> <p>“He, out of anybody in this country, should never be given one minute of airtime ever again for the devastation that he has wrecked on so many families,” she said. “He has wiped out their livelihoods, he has destroyed kids’ education – we have kids that forever will struggle because they’ve been forced to wear masks that has hurt their development. It is a tragedy what that man was allowed to do to the United States of America.”</p> <p>Fauci, who is President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, has repeatedly hit back at his rightwing critics in kind.</p> <p>Last year <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-anthony-fauci.html\">he told the New York Times</a>: “‘Fauci has blood in his hands’ – are you kidding me? … Here’s a guy whose entire life has been devoted to saving lives, and now you’re telling me he’s like Hitler?

Bush’s national security adviser Condoleezza Rice became his tennis partner, reflecting his charm and ability to circulate across the political spectrum.</p> <p>Despite having been given the job as ambassador by Blair, he told the inquiry into the UK invasion of Iraq led by Sir John Chilcott that he believed the prime minister’s relationship with Bush became so close that he in effect gave a blank cheque for the president to press ahead with the invasion.</p> <p>He told the inquiry there was “a large chunk of time” when Bush and Blair were in effect alone at the Crawford summit in Texas in April 2002.</p> <p>He said there were clues to Blair’s thinking in a speech he gave in the US at that time speaking of regime change.</p> <p>In his autobiography, DC Confidential, he became more critical of the Blair modus operandi, and of some of Blair’s cabinet ministers including the then foreign secretary, Jack Straw. He described Straw as a B-list politician more to be liked than admired. His critics in the Blair administration later said he had thrown a wobbly because he had been excluded from critical meetings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Famous for his red socks, Meyer as press secretary tried to project the Major administration at a time when the Conservative government was falling in part due to sleaze.</p> <p>He was married to Catherine Meyer, the founder of the charity Parents and Abducted Children Together.

Some passengers snooze, others read or chat or simply gaze at the meadows flashing past.</p> <p>Daisy Arrey, a 19-year-old student heading to Longford, finds the journey relaxing and cheap. Karen Mulligan, 38, returning home to Mullingar after an excursion to the capital, is glad to have avoided motorway tolls and parking hassles. Tom and Marita, a couple in their 60s on their way to Edgeworthstown, appreciate not having to navigate twisting rural roads.</p> <p>This train, which terminates in Sligo on the Atlantic coast, seems a showcase for public transport and progress in Ireland’s effort to wean people off cars to reduce carbon emissions.</p> <p>Fares on Irish public transport were <a href=\"https://media.ireland.com/en-gb/news-releases/global/ireland%E2%80%99s-public-transport-fares-reduced-by-20\">cut by 20%</a> in April until the end of this year and halved permanently for those aged 19 to 23 – the first such reductions in Ireland since 1947. Anecdotal evidence suggests increased ridership on several routes, according to analysts.</p> <p>It is part of a Europe-wide experiment. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/18/germany-faces-calls-extend-9-month-public-transport-ticket\">Germany’s “€9 ticket” project</a> grants a month of unlimited travel on urban and regional networks.

Arrey has experienced harassment on buses and hopes to get a car.</p> <p>The only way Mulligan, who lives in an isolated area, can reach her job is by driving.

This train journey is the exception, not the rule.</p> <p>That is the reality for many people in Ireland, and one reason its greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, imperilling climate targets.</p> <p>“There has been a lack of investment in public transport over the past decade to provide an alternative to the car,” said Brian Caulfield, a Trinity College Dublin professor and authority on transport policy. Rural areas tend to be served, if at all, by infrequent buses, he said. “In that case the car will always win.”</p> <p>The challenge is urgent. Ireland’s emissions rose 4.7% last year, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://www.epa.ie/publications/monitoring--assessment/climate-change/air-emissions/irelands-provisional-greenhouse-gas-emissions-1990-2021.php\">disclosed last week</a>, exceeding pre-pandemic 2019 levels and casting doubt over ambitious and legally binding 2030 targets. Under sectoral targets transport, the second biggest emitter after agriculture, must reduce emissions by 50%.</p> <p>Ireland has the fourth highest level of transport emissions per capita in Europe, with private cars the largest contributors. Seventy-four per cent of all journeys are by car and just 7% by rail and bus, according to the <a href=\"https://www.greenparty.ie/campaigns/all-campaigns/public-transport\">Green party</a>, which is part of the coalition government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09f2f8460573c4505660597912cf3c2106b408ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09f2f8460573c4505660597912cf3c2106b408ae/0_16_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Congestion on the M7 near Naas, in County Kildare\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Congestion on the M7 near Naas, in County Kildare, as drivers protest about fuel prices in November 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The noose around transport will gradually tighten,” said John Sweeney, a climate expert and geography professor at Maynooth University.</p> <p>Part of the strategy is to dramatically increase the number of electric cars but people in rural areas are proving hesitant because of cost and lack of charging points. “If you were in the countryside you’d be banjaxed. You can’t plug it into a ditch, you can’t plug it into a cow,” said Derek Desmond, 50, a handyman from Tipperary.</p> <p>That puts further pressure on buses and trains to fill the gap – a tall order. “We’re not like Germany, we don’t have a very good public transport infrastructure,” said Cara Augustenborg, an environmental scientist at University College Dublin.</p> <p>Encouraging use by making public transport free, as in Luxembourg, is not viable, she said. “We need money to make the infrastructure great. We need the revenue.” In any case erratic connections, speed and reliability deterred passengers more than cost, said Augustenborg. Loutish behaviour – ranging from loud music to sexual and racial harassment – doesn’t help.</p> <p>For people like John Cullen, 78, who has underlying health conditions, Covid is another deterrent. He appreciates the climate role of trains and buses but has shunned them since the pandemic despite public transport being free for those over 66. “Non-death comes first.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9e736a05cbc184402646fdcfbbc3cb0a57e37ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e736a05cbc184402646fdcfbbc3cb0a57e37ff/0_151_2016_1210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Cullen near the ticket barriers at Connolly station in Dublin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Cullen waits to meet a friend at Connolly station in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dublin, and to a lesser extent other cities such as Cork and Galway, have growing public transport options.

You can’t plug an electric car into a ditch, you can’t plug it into a cow</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The main challenge is in rural areas where unplanned ribbon development has scattered homes across the landscape, far from bus routes. “More imagination will need to be shown,” said Sweeney. He cited other European countries that have introduced small mobile buses and turned postal vehicles into de facto shuttle buses. “Frequency and reliability are crucial. It will need a radical overhaul.”</p> <p>Back on the Dublin to Sligo train, passengers could only agree. “I’d take the bus or cycle to work if I could,” said Mulligan, who lives six miles from her job, on a busy road with no bike lane.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24f737fe4b08cdf54bb1895830e5f75185c88e4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24f737fe4b08cdf54bb1895830e5f75185c88e4b/0_151_2016_1210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marita and Tom, a couple from Limerick, travel on the Dublin to Sligo train\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marita and Tom, a couple from Limerick, travel on the Dublin to Sligo train.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory Carroll/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From their Limerick home Tom and Marita had taken a bus and a train to Dublin and crossed the capital in a tram to catch this other train to their destination.

From <a href=\"https://mobilitegratuite.lu/en/press-room/\">1 March 2020</a> it made all public transport free – for its 650,000 residents, commuting workers and tourists alike. A fortnight later the country went into lockdown, leaving all those free buses, trams and trains sitting idle for months.</p> <p>Two years on however, with the climate emergency deepening and Europe facing a winter energy crisis, Luxembourg’s world-first move seems prescient if not visionary. The country’s minister for mobility, François Bausch, a Green party politician, <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:2EM_dnv6bK0J:https://download.rtl.lu/2022/05/24/c43e63613e60aea7001ea126af839015.pdf+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=\">told MPs</a> recently that the government’s aim was to achieve a transport “revolution” and ticketless transport was the “cherry on the cake”. The scheme costs €41m annually in lost revenue, which is less than 10% of the network’s €491m operating costs, he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdd1c0c91173002692c08a466da8fdc5b7f5a00b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdd1c0c91173002692c08a466da8fdc5b7f5a00b/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers inside a tram as Luxembourg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers inside a tram as Luxembourg becomes the first country in the world to offer free public transport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: François Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the Liberal-Socialist-Green coalition abolished fares as a social and environmental measure, ministers know it won’t on its own solve Luxembourg’s dire road congestion.

High housing costs in Luxembourg are blamed for the mass commute and most cars carry a single occupant.</p> <p>Nor has free transport yet done much to improve Luxembourg’s <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?most_recent_value_desc=true\">seventh place ranking </a>among the world’s largest carbon emitters, with 4.8m tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent produced in 2020 (15.3 metric tonnes per capita).</p> <p>Indeed, trucks and cars from surrounding countries cross into Luxembourg every day for<a href=\"https://www.luxtimes.lu/en/luxembourg/resurgence-of-fuel-tourism-in-the-grand-duchy-6213731fde135b9236a0f77b\"> “fuel tourism”</a>, taking advantage of cheap petrol and diesel and generating more than €1bn in tax revenues for the Grand duchy’s treasury.

He also finds that people are less aggressive: “Because there is less interaction with the bus drivers and ticket inspectors.” One regret he has is that pedestrians seem less keen to walk anywhere: “If a tram or a bus stop is close by, they will get on, rather than walking further to their destination”.</p> <p>Promoting Luxembourg’s global image is also a factor in the decision to abolish fares. In 2013, the Grand-Duchy launched a <a href=\"https://luxembourg.public.lu/en/toolbox/brand/approach.html\">nation branding exercise</a>, to enhance its international reputation. It regularly announces measures that make the buzz: <a href=\"https://delano.lu/article/parliament-begins-work-to-lega\">decriminalising the growing of weed</a> in 2018 and offering <a href=\"https://www.luxtimes.lu/en/education-and-family/childcare-options-602d6ba8de135b9236b15a50\">free daycare</a> and school lunches from September on.</p> <p><em>Marc Auxenfants in Luxembourg City</em></p> <h2>… and in Spain <br></h2> <p>The Spanish government announced this month that some commuter routes on the state-owned rail-network, Renfe will be free from September until the end of the year.

From September to December 2022, a 10-trip metro travel card that will take passengers almost anywhere in the city will cost a mere €5.70, compared with the current fare of €11.30. A monthly ticket will go from €40 to €20.</p> <p>No one knows how it will function in practice. For example, how do travellers buy a free ticket from a machine?

This Booker-longlisted novel is a multilayered interrogation of ‘the fiction of money’","byline":"Jonathan Lee","body":"<p>How is reality funded?” asks the wealthy tycoon at the centre of Hernan Diaz’s Booker-longlisted second novel. His answer is “fiction” – specifically, the “fiction of money”. The value of any commodity comes from us buying into its wider narrative. Unless we trust that a banknote “represents concrete goods”, it is just a piece of printed paper, as open to distortion as a novel, or a memoir, or a diary.</p> <p>Trust incorporates all three of these literary forms. As with David Mitchell’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/mar/06/fiction.asbyatt\" title=\"\">Cloud Atlas</a> or Richard Powers’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/23/the-overstory-by-richard-powers-review\" title=\"\">The Overstory</a>, its structure relies on interconnected narratives which deepen and destabilise one another. Diaz’s first novel, the Pulitzer prize finalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/06/in-the-distance-hernan-diaz-review-western\" title=\"\">In the Distance</a>, was about a penniless young Swedish immigrant meeting swindlers and fanatics in California. In Trust, he has built a postmodern version of a historical novel around a character at the other end of the economic scale – a Gatsby-like tycoon in 1920s New York who dutifully hosts lavish parties at which he is rarely glimpsed. His name is Andrew Bevel, a guy who becomes “a wealthy man by playing the part of a wealthy man”. At his side is his seemingly longsuffering wife, Mildred, a figure occasionally reminiscent of Zelda Fitzgerald. The Bevels’s marriage is built around a “core of quiet discomfort”, a shared awkwardness which for them is “inherent to most exchanges”. If every get-rich tale is ultimately a crime narrative – a story of whodunnit, how and why – the central heist in Trust is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1929/oct/24/archive.theguardian\" title=\"\">Wall Street crash of 1929</a>. By embracing the American spirit of “fake it till you make it”, Bevel finds that the financial crisis makes him even richer. Indeed, some New Yorkers start to claim that he caused it.</p> <p>There is nothing wealthy individuals love less than a scandal – a moment when the reins of narrative-making slip out of their hands. Diaz’s own structure enacts this. The first part of Trust is a novel-within-the-novel: a fictionalised telling of the New York power couple’s lives. But that’s just the setup for the book’s second section, which presents itself as an autobiography by Mr Bevel himself. Like all vanity projects by unintentionally amusing millionaires, the purpose is “to address and refute” the fictions about him, setting the historical record straight once and for all. What unfolds is a hilarious send-up of the celebrity memoir, complete with a generic and self-aggrandising title (My Life), a heavy dose of misleading platitudes (“my wife was too fragile, too good for this world”), and occasional glimpses of the unabashed capitalist mentality underneath (“what matters is the tally of our accomplishments, not the tales about us”). Bevel’s later chapters descend into random notes towards a future draft we know this big shot mercifully lacks the self-awareness to finish (“WHOLE SECTION: <em>‘Clouds Thicken’</em>?”).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A Borgesian sense of play imbues Trust, along with a dash of Italo Calvino’s love of exploring different versions of a city</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The third section of Diaz’s book brings about another change of weather: it is a young Brooklyn woman’s account of meeting the ageing financier during the Great Depression, and being hired to help tell his story. At this point we begin to feel we are getting a handle on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/citizen-kane\" title=\"\">Citizen Kane</a>-style mystery driving the book: who <em>was </em>this tycoon, actually? And was his wife really just an accessory on his arm? But the novel’s fourth and final section pulls the rug from under us one last time, offering us fragments from Mildred’s long-withheld diary. Trust poses questions of authorship and ownership at every turn: when did wealth become the defining element of every American success story? What values and costs can be ascribed to the “Great Man” theory of history? And to whom do such men owe their greatest debts? If you imagine a brilliantly twisted mix of Edith Wharton’s The Age of Innocence, Virginia Woolf’s journals, JM Coetzee’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/aug/30/bookerprize2003.highereducation\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Costello</a>, and Ryan Gosling’s breaking of the fourth wall in The Big Short, you’ll get some sense of the surprising hybrid Diaz has created.</p> <p>It is perhaps telling that Diaz started his writing life with a scholarly text about Jorges Luis Borges, who once wrote that money represents “a panoply of possible futures”. A Borgesian sense of play imbues almost every page of Trust, along with a dash of Italo Calvino’s love of exploring different versions of a single idea or city. Through perfectly formed sentences and the skilful unpicking of certainties, Trust creates a great portrait of New York across an entire century of change – a metropolis that is “the capital of the future”, yet consists of citizens who are “nostalgic by nature”. A city that, in other words, looks backwards and forwards at the same time – as any place that mixes old money and new money must. Trust is so packed full of ironies that it can sometimes feel airless. But it is also a work possessed of real power and purpose. It invites us to think about why the category of imaginative play we most heavily reward as a society is the playing of financial markets, often at a heavy cost. It’s a testament to Diaz’s cunning abilities as a writer that you end his book thinking that – if truth is your goal – you might be better off relying on a novelist than a banker.<br></p> <p><em>• </em>Trust is published by Picador (£16.99).

The idea is not so fanciful as it sounds. In fact, in recent years comparisons between this part of the country and foreign expat hotspots like the Costa del Sol have begun to look more and more apt, not least due to the warming climate.</p> <p>But all is not well in this picturesque corner of England. Last month, residents of the seaside town of Whitby – in effect the capital of the Yorkshire tourist trade – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/14/whitby-votes-to-limit-sales-of-second-homes\">voted overwhelmingly</a> in favour of making all new-build homes in the town full-time primary residences. The parish-level vote was, as the Scarborough borough council website <a href=\"https://www.scarborough.gov.uk/latest-news/whitby-parish-poll-results\">drily notes</a>, “no more and no less than an expression of the views of the electorate”. But while the result is not binding, it shows that Whitby locals are increasingly feeling the burn of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/23/second-homes-uk-government-britain-housing-crisis\">“frenzy” for second homes</a> in British coastal areas.</p> <p>On the surface, Whitby has done well out of tourism – but look closer and you’ll see that its story embodies a wider sense that Britain’s social fabric is fraying at the seams. Asa Jones, a 21-year-old charity worker and founder of the Facebook group Whitby Homes for Whitby People, said the second homes problem had developed into a full-blown civic crisis. “If you go back to the 1990s, there were a lot of holiday lets in the centre of town,” Jones said, “[and] even in the early 2010s, there were still local residents in those areas.” But more recently, he said, “the last remnants of local housing in the centre of town have disappeared.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/23/second-homes-uk-government-britain-housing-crisis\">Second homes are a gross injustice, yet the UK government encourages them | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jones’s comments conjure images of a town centre turned into a virtual theme park for Whitby’s tourist offering of jewellery shops, seaside kitsch and <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/whitby-abbey/history-and-stories/dracula/\">Dracula souvenirs</a>. But he is most concerned about the spread of holiday lets into the outskirts of the town, leading many residents to seek cheaper housing as far away as Teesside. For Jones, a tipping point was reached in the last five years: “The big change since maybe 2016 has been in the suburban areas, where I currently live. Opposite me there used to be a big family home. They moved away, and now it’s a holiday let that’s only occupied for half the year.”</p> <p>In some ways, the fact that Whitby has managed to attract such a high level of outside interest and investment makes it seem like a rare example of a flourishing northern seaside resort. Between 2009 and 2018, 50% of British coastal towns <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/tourismindustry/articles/coastaltownsinenglandandwales/2020-10-06\">saw a decline</a> in employment (a figure some 13% higher than in non-coastal towns). Population has declined in almost one in three smaller seaside towns over the same period. Indeed, much ink has been spilt by researchers and commentators over the last decade in trying to work out why British coastal areas in general are on the wrong end of such socioeconomic statistics.</p> <p>As manufacturing industries such as shipbuilding have mostly faded into memory, and as the fishing industry has undergone several major downgrades since its early-20th-century heyday, there has been a widespread sense in government and business that tourism is the only game in town when it comes to regenerating Britain’s once-thriving ports and fishing villages. Cue endless initiatives to promote the holiday trade all around the coast, some of which have produced success stories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cdc3d36348c27b62f955cc8fd8781660f38a61e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cdc3d36348c27b62f955cc8fd8781660f38a61e/0_100_3000_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An estate agent in Tavistock, Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An estate agent’s window in Tavistock, Devon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From large swaths of Devon and Cornwall (where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/18/st-ives-battle-second-homes-cornish-town-investment-buyers\">the fight against second homeownership</a> is well under way) to the “<a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldseaside/320/32006.htm\">honeypot</a>” stretch of the Yorkshire coastline that includes Whitby, the post-austerity rise of the “staycation” has enormously boosted the profit margins of holiday-home landlords and some small business owners. Over the last few years, the combined effects of Brexit and Covid have further stimulated demand for domestic holidays, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/17/uk-holiday-bookings-boom-as-britons-think-twice-about-trips-abroad\">now undergoing yet another surge</a> in a chaotic summer for foreign travel.</p> <p>And yet, in a local narrative that highlights a <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2022/06/britain-sick-man-of-europe-uk-zero-growth-oecd-economic-forecast-2023\">deeper malaise</a> in the economy, even apparently elite tourist resorts such as Whitby are not working very well for their citizens. In the view of Neil Swannick, a Labour councillor for the Whitby Streonshalh ward, the rise of the staycation economy has done little to tackle the sorts of inequalities that have blighted small towns all over the country in recent decades.</p> <p>“There are certainly people that have done well out of tourism in Whitby,” said Swannick, “but that benefit hasn’t been evenly spread across the residents of the town.” He highlighted the fact that in his ward, there are two areas that are among the <a href=\"https://www.datanorthyorkshire.org/JSNA/articles/indices-of-deprivation-summary/\">20% most deprived in England</a><strong> </strong> (male life expectancy, he tells me, is about 10 years lower there than in the rest of North Yorkshire). “When the heating crisis and food prices start to bite in the autumn,” he said, “the situation in those pockets of poverty will only get worse.”</p> <p>Whitby’s superficial resurgence in the 21st century shows that the post-Thatcher consensus that saw finance, property and leisure as viable replacements for the vanished industries of the past may have achieved a partial kind of success for a time. But, as in so many other walks of modern British life, these forces are also producing ever more fragmented communities, with an increasingly stark divide between owners and workers. For the former, rental and commercial profits have guaranteed standards of living ranging from mere comfort to exorbitant wealth. For the latter, even the high employment rate in a “honeypot” seaside town can do nothing to mitigate the combined effects of rising costs, low pay and a broken housing system.</p> <p>The irony for Whitby itself is that although it appears to have avoided the fate of other seaside “ghost towns”, where social deprivation is even more widespread, the fact that both the owners and the workers in its economy increasingly live elsewhere means that its civic environment is, in one sense, just as hollowed-out as <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/4w5wdj/seaton-carew-hartlepool-funfairs-photos\">somewhere like Hartlepool</a>, a few miles up the coast.</p> <p>In both cases – and indeed in many seaside towns throughout Britain – what is glaringly absent is a viable social infrastructure and system of rights for local residents. In the rush to do everything possible to encourage the private sector to lead the charge for coastal regeneration over the last few decades, there has been a widespread feeling that local and national government must simply get out of the way and let the market work its magic.</p> <p>As a tawdry Conservative leadership contest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/11/tory-chancers-leadership-contest-extremists\">raises the prospect</a> of yet more deregulation and slavish devotion to the market’s invisible hand, the opposing idea that firm government intervention is needed to support the empowerment of local communities is only faintly audible in public outbursts like the vote to regulate Whitby’s second homes. It is these voices from below – far more than the multimillionaires and career politicians of the latest Westminster talent contest – who must be listened to as we head towards a social cliff edge on all sides of the country.</p> <ul> <li><p>Alex Niven is a lecturer in English literature at Newcastle University and the author of New Model Island</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/29/ben-wallace-attacks-rishi-sunak-cabinet-resignation-after-backing-truss","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T07:54:01Z","webTitle":"Ben Wallace attacks Rishi Sunak’s cabinet resignation after backing Truss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/ben-wallace-attacks-rishi-sunak-cabinet-resignation-after-backing-truss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/29/ben-wallace-attacks-rishi-sunak-cabinet-resignation-after-backing-truss","fields":{"headline":"Ben Wallace attacks Rishi Sunak’s cabinet resignation after backing Truss","trailText":"Defence secretary, who backed Liz Truss overnight, says public might never have forgiven Tories","byline":"Ben Quinn","body":"<p>The British public would never have forgiven the Conservatives if the financial markets had crashed after Rishi Sunak quit as chancellor, Ben Wallace has said as he stepped up attacks on the Tory leadership candidate after endorsing his rival Liz Truss.</p> \n<p>Wallace, the defence secretary, also suggested he was throwing his weight behind Truss because she recognised that the “threats we face every day” needed to be “funded properly”.</p> \n<p>Speaking after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/28/sunak-says-as-pm-he-would-back-creation-of-new-grammar-schools\">coming out for Truss overnight</a> in an article for the Times, Wallace continued to go on the offensive against her opponent, telling Sky News that Sunak’s decision to cut entrepreneurs’ relief when he was chancellor was not a way to create “either wealth or indeed growth”.</p> \n<p>Sunak was the second senior cabinet minister to resign from Boris Johnson’s government this month, after Sajid Javid, triggering Johnson’s downfall a few days later.

The company says it would be its best pay award given in two decades.</p> <p>“The problem for the unions is that if Royal Mail goes on strike we don’t get letters, if railway workers strike the trains stop, but if telecoms workers go on strike the system doesn’t switch off because it requires little manual intervention,” said one industry source. “The figure the unions never mention is the £4.8bn direct cost of its 100,000 workforce annually. BT’s post-tax profits are £1.3bn; its wage and pension bill is not far off four times bigger.”</p> <p>As well as the battle within, part of a painful £2bn restructure that includes reducing BT’s physical footprint from 300 to 30 sites across the UK and staff numbers by more than 13,000, Jansen is facing the strategic uncertainty of having the telecoms billionaire Patrick Drahi as BT’s biggest shareholder.</p> <p>Drahi, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/14/altices-billionaire-owner-sends-bt-a-clear-reminder-of-his-intentions\">built up an 18% stake</a>, has not pushed for strategic change or asked for a seat on BT’s board to match that of the second biggest shareholder, Deutsche Telekom. The move by Drahi’s Altice UK is being investigated under the National Security and Investment Act, which is designed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/nov/29/bt-on-war-footing-as-it-tries-to-guess-biggest-investors-intentions-patrick-drahi-take-over-telecoms\">protect assets of strategic national importance</a> from foreign takeover.</p> <p>The act set the threshold for “control” of a company at as low as 25%. City sources say the fact that Drahi is being investigated while controlling a smaller stake is a warning shot across the bows, and when the government does report back he will not be made to divest his stake.</p> <p>“The expectation is that Drahi owning an 18% stake with no board representation will be fine,” said one City source. “The investigation is more about signalling ‘we are going to use this act to check things are OK’. Of course, I do not think it would be OK for Drahi to try and buy BT – as a strategic national asset, it simply wouldn’t be allowed now.”</p> <p>Now in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/25/worldpays-philip-jansen-named-bt-chief-executive-gavin-patterson\">fourth year as chief executive</a>, Jansen has been unable to drive BT’s market value, with the company’s share price still stubbornly down more than a fifth from when he took over from Gavin Patterson on 1 February 2019.</p> <p>And yet after decades of feet-dragging by bosses to protect BT’s market position and commercial revenues, at the cost of becoming an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/08/average-uk-broadband-speed-europe-germany-spain-singapore?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">embarrassing global laggard</a> in next-generation broadband, Jansen has received plaudits for investing in national communications infrastructure.</p> <p>Early in the pandemic, Jansen suspended BT’s annual dividend for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e529f661-abba-4704-9d88-d46c6944df15\">first time since the company was privatised in 1984</a> to help free up £15bn to upgrade the UK’s slow copper-based internet network to full fibre for all homes and businesses, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/23/the-cost-of-boris-johnson-pricing-up-the-next-prime-minister-pledges\">pledge made by Boris Johnson</a> while campaigning to be prime minister.</p> <p>BT, which after years of regulatory wrangling has managed to secure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/18/bt-to-invest-12bn-in-faster-broadband-and-reaching-remote-areas\">guarantees of favourable commercial returns</a> from Ofcom on its investment upgrading the network, has pledged to get full fibre to 25m of the UK’s 32m premises by the end of 2026.</p> <p>“I think BT is doing all right, actually, in terms of doing what they said they would,” said Carl Murdock-Smith, a senior telecoms analyst at Berenberg. “BT has significantly increased investment in fibre since Jansen has come in. They have moved from debating the regulatory regime, creating a model for economic return, to execution mode. Now it’s ‘let’s go out and do this’. The share price languishing lower than when Jansen walked in is largely because the company is investing more, and telecoms investors like near-term cashflows.”</p> <p>BT has finally managed to engineer an exit from its expensive foray into pay-TV sport, which has cost it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/01/amazon-and-bbc-break-bt-stranglehold-on-champions-league-football\">billions for UK rights to competitions such as the Champions League</a> while achieving the aim of stemming the loss of millions of broadband customers to Sky.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/bt-and-warner-bros-discovery-join-forces-to-create-pay-tv-sport-business\">£633m joint venture with Warner Bros Discovery</a> (WBD), which owns Eurosport, significantly cuts its financial commitment to BT Sport – which is one of a number of broadcasters being investigated by the competition watchdog for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/13/cma-launches-investigation-sports-broadcasters-purchase-freelance-services\">“cartel-like behaviour” fixing freelance rates for workers</a> – while also allowing WBD to potentially take full control within four years.</p> <p>The biggest headache now facing all telecoms providers is the cost of living crisis. Earlier this year BT and its rivals increased bills by almost 10% – the consumer price index rate of inflation in January plus 3.9%. The company attributed the majority of the sales growth announced on Thursday to the price hike.</p> <p>While telecoms companies came in for some criticism for pushing through this year’s rise, it came before inflation hit a 40-year high and the real impact of soaring food and energy prices had begun to be felt by households.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“This year the focus is on gas and electricity rises, much larger cost increases for consumers, but by the time we get to the next general election we will have had two more rises compounding bill increases,” said Murdock-Smith. “With the cost of living crisis front and centre, I think it will become a political football.”</p> <p>As Jansen attempts to reshape the image of the company for the future – in April the company quietly announced that after more than three decades the BT brand would take a back seat in favour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/bt-unveil-plans-to-make-ee-its-consumer-facing-brand\">pushing the more youthful EE</a> to the fore – he will need to balance the potential fallout from continuing to push through hefty bill increases while managing its soaring cost base.</p> <p>“The next big discussion going forward is the mechanic used for annual price increases for consumers,” said Murdock-Smith. “In the medium term, how politically acceptable is it as a pricing dynamic, and will it become a focus in the next general election?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/29/pro-israel-lobby-aipac-andy-levin-democratic-races","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T07:00:50Z","webTitle":"Pro-Israel group pours millions into primary to defeat Jewish candidate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/29/pro-israel-lobby-aipac-andy-levin-democratic-races","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/29/pro-israel-lobby-aipac-andy-levin-democratic-races","fields":{"headline":"Pro-Israel group pours millions into primary to defeat Jewish candidate","trailText":"Aipac says Democrat Andy Levin, a self-described Zionist, is insufficiently pro-Israel – alarming some because much of the money comes from wealthy Trump donors","byline":"Chris McGreal in Detroit","body":"<p>It is in Andy Levin’s nature to pick fights.</p> <p>The forthright Detroit congressman and former trade union leader has built a political career on confronting big oil, the gun industry and anti-abortion campaigners.</p> <p>But as the scion of a distinguished Jewish political dynasty, a committed Zionist and the former president of his synagogue, Levin has been stung by the largest pro-Israel lobby group’s campaign to paint him as an enemy of the Jewish state because he has spoken up for the Palestinians.</p> <p>The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) has spent more than $4m to defeat Levin in next Tuesday’s Democratic primary for a congressional seat in north-western Detroit with a twin strategy to discredit him within the city’s sizable Jewish community while funding an advertising blitz aimed at the wider electorate that avoids mention of the Israel lobby’s involvement.</p> <p>Aipac and its allies have poured millions of dollars into opposing candidates deemed not to be pro-Israel enough in this year’s Democratic primaries, a move that has alarmed some in the party because much of the money comes from wealthy Trump donors and other rightwing billionaires including Jan Koum, the inventor of WhatsApp, who <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/whatsapp-founder-jan-koum-donates-record-2-million-to-aipacs-campaign-efforts/\">recently donated</a> $2m.</p> <p>Levin said Aipac’s involvement also raises the spectre of the entire primary process being hijacked by well-funded lobbies from big oil to the gun industry.</p> <p>“This strategy to gather millions from rightwing billionaires and other Republican sources to try to determine the outcome of Democratic primaries is deeply troubling.

Hardline pro-Israel groups have proclaimed these victories as evidence of American voters’ support for its positions. But the campaigns, funded through Aipac’s political action committee, the United Democracy Project (UDP), rarely mention the Jewish state or US policy on Israel.</p> <p>Other critics note that while Aipac opposes Levin and other candidates deemed to be out of line on Israel by accusing them of working against America’s interests, it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/20/donna-edwards-maryland-democrat-defeat-aipac-israel\">endorsed</a> 109<strong> </strong>Republicans who voted against certifying Joe Biden’s victory after the storming of the Capitol on 6 January 2020.</p> <p>Levin is running for a newly created district after his existing one was scrapped with boundary changes. He is competing against another sitting Democrat, Haley Stevens, whose constituency has also been abolished.</p> <p>Aipac turned its guns on Levin, a member of the House foreign affairs committee, after he introduced the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5344\">Two State Solution Act</a> in September, intended to promote a peace agreement including by preventing US aid being used to tighten Israel’s grip on the occupied Palestinian territories, and to block expansion of Jewish settlements and the demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank.</p> <p>The legislation also infuriated some by defining East Jerusalem as occupied territory, which much of the world says it is, when Israel claims sovereignty over the entire city.<br>Aipac portrayed the act as “anti-Israel” and Levin as an extremist.</p> <p>“Andy Levin represents the fringe wing that is working to undermine the US-Israel relationship,” the lobby group said in an email to supporters last week. “Defeating Andy Levin would remove one hostile voice, but as important, ensuring Haley Stevens wins would cement a pro-Israel champion in the Democratic party.”</p> <p>Earlier this year, David Victor, a former president of Aipac who lives in the Detroit area, wrote to prospective donors saying that the redistricting “presents a rare opportunity to defeat arguably the most corrosive member of Congress to the US-Israel relationship”.</p> <p>“To make matters worse, Andy sincerely claims to be a lifelong Zionist, proud Jew and defender of Israel. So when Andy Levin insists he’s pro-Israel, less engaged Democratic colleagues may take him at his word,” wrote Victor.</p> <p>The email, which raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of Stevens, was denounced by other current and former Jewish Democrats in Congress.</p> <p>“It is fair to disagree on and debate policy approaches. But it is out of bounds to malign the only Jewish candidate in this race by impugning Andy’s love for the State of Israel or his community bona fides, which run strong and run deep,” they wrote in <a href=\"https://forward.com/opinion/letters/484513/members-of-congress-including-aipac-allied-condemn-comments-rep-andy-levin/\">a letter</a>.</p> <p>The lobby has since poured millions of dollars into supporting Stevens who admits she knew little about Israel until she visited the country three years ago on an Aipac-sponsored trip. Since then she has put an emphasis on “Israel’s right to defend itself” and has expressed scepticism about the US rejoining the Iran nuclear deal.</p> <p>Levin, on the other hand, comes from a line of politicians with strong ties to Israel including his father, Sander, who served 36 years in Congress, and uncle Carl Levin, who was a US senator for nearly four decades.</p> <p>Levin accused Aipac of attempting to impose a single hardline view of what it is to be pro-Israel when he has a “proud record” of supporting the Jewish state and a two state solution while also advocating for Palestinian rights. He says his position “has been the position of every Democratic and Republican administration besides Donald Trump”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s just assumed that they’re afraid to cross Aipac</p> <footer> <cite>Andy Levin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“They’re the rightwing Israel lobby. They’re not more pro-Israel than me. In fact, they’re worse for Israel. If you want to be the best friend of Israel, you better give an honest opinion about what needs to happen for your best friend to be secure and safe, and to thrive in the future instead of supporting whatever the Israeli government of the moment does right or wrong,” he said.</p> <p>“This is the politics of intimidation. When I wrote the Two State Solution Act, I can’t tell you how many of my colleagues came up to me and said, ‘Oh, Andy, I read your bill, it’s great. But of course, I’m not going to co-sponsor.’ They didn’t even need to say why. It’s just assumed that they’re afraid to cross Aipac.”</p> <p>Much of this fight has gone unnoticed by the average voter in the Detroit district. But they have nonetheless felt its effects.</p> <p>The UDP has spent heavily on television spots for Stevens that featured President Barack Obama in 2018 praising her work as chief of staff for the taskforce that saw the US auto industry through bankruptcy during the recession. Another focuses on her stand for abortion rights. None of them makes mention of Israel.</p> <p>Opinion polls show the impact. In February, a Target Insyght poll had the two candidates tied at 41% support each. At the time, Levin led among groups likely to be key to victory, including union workers and women.</p> <p>A poll by the same company last week showed Stevens at 58% to Levin on 31%. The number of women who said they would vote for Levin fell sharply.</p> <p>Target Insyght’s director, Edward Sarpolus, said Levin was vulnerable in a number of ways including being a progressive in a new district with a more conservative demographic than his old one.</p> <p>But Sarpolus said UDP and other pro-Israel lobby money was a gamechanger because it paid for advertising to pound away at those differences in support of Stevens.</p> <p>“Aipac and the other [pro-Israel] groups kicking in the funds put her over the top because they’re dominating the airwaves with ads and mailings and that type of thing,” he said.</p> <p>Levin has the backing of a more moderate pro-Israel group, J Street, which has spent about $700,000 to support him with advertising attacking Stevens for taking Aipac money.</p> <p>Aipac is targeting another Detroit Democratic primary race too. The UDP has spent nearly $2m running ads against a member of the Michigan state legislature, Shri Thanedar, who backed a resolution to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.</p> <p>Aipac supporters say it is not doing anything other pressure groups do, such as those advocating for abortion rights or environmental policies. But critics say those groups are open about their intent whereas most voters targeted by UDP funded-ads have no idea it is run by Aipac or that it’s goal is to elect a member of Congress it sees as more sympathetic to Israel.</p> <p>A fellow Democratic member of Congress, Mark Pocan, accused Aipac and its allies of deceiving voters.</p> <p>“It’s not just dark special interest money that’s spent on candidates. It’s the sketchy, anonymous misleading nature of the money that needs to get called out in the strongest of terms,” he said.</p> <p>“Now we have groups in Democratic primaries doing this in the most Trojan horse way. First, their values aren’t stated as an organisation. But second they’re raising money from Republican multimillionaires and billionaires to do this. It’s stealth campaigning combined with dirty oppositional money to create a Trojan horse within a Trojan horse.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/29/readers-on-euro-2022-and-womens-football","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T07:00:50Z","webTitle":"‘So refreshing and joyful’: readers on Euro 2022 and women’s football","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/readers-on-euro-2022-and-womens-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/29/readers-on-euro-2022-and-womens-football","fields":{"headline":"‘So refreshing and joyful’: readers on Euro 2022 and women’s football","trailText":"Girls, boys and older longtime followers of the sport have lapped up a tournament that looks like a breakthrough","byline":"Alfie Packham and Clea Skopeliti","body":"<p>Interest in women’s football has surged during the Euro 2022 tournament, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/27/englands-euro-2022-win-over-sweden-drew-peak-tv-audience-of-93-million\">consistently high viewing figures</a>.

There were a few people who were interested and we got summoned to the deputy head who said there was no way girls were playing football in that school, so forget it.</p> <p>It was all quite interesting when women’s football started to take off, and now it’s really got momentum and I really hope it goes on.

Her crowdfunding page, which raised more than £500,000 for legal costs, pointing the finger at the latter with the title: “I am suing Stonewall.”</p> <p>She won the case against GCC – which has said it is considering an appeal – but lost against Stonewall, having failed to show that the charity, which was among those to complain about her tweets, had induced or instructed discrimination by her chambers.</p> <p>Nevertheless it was Stonewall Bailey reserved her harshest words for following the decision, accusing it of “creating the environment in which discrimination against gender-critical women and lesbians has been allowed to flourish”.</p> <p>For its part, Stonewall said it was committed to creating a workplace “where everyone can thrive” and placed responsibility for organisations’ culture in the hands of their leaders. “Stonewall’s resources, support and guidance is just one set of inputs they use to help them as they consider how best to meet the needs of their own organisation,” the charity said.</p> <p>Lewis said the fact that some people within an organisation did not agree with Stonewall did not mean that businesses should not engage with the charity but it would require careful management.</p> <p>“There are lots of businesses that continue to engage with Stonewall even though employees within their organisations say they are uncomfortable about that because they have made their own assessment and they are comfortable with that,” she said.</p> <p>“I think if you bring in any kind of external advice you need to take a measured approach to what you are looking to achieve and how that external organisation is going to help you achieve that.”</p> <p>Her words were echoed by Georgina Calvert-Lee, employment law and equality expert at Bellevue Law, “There is no harm in employers engaging with third party interest groups – it often helps keep them aligned with current sensibilities which may affect their staff – but they should still ensure their workplace is tolerant of differences,” she said.</p> <p>Calvert-Lee added that another lesson of the case was that where employers have mission statements or the like “they should stand back and consider objectively how proposed policies or statements may impact different members of staff, depending on their beliefs and other protected characteristics, and then try to plot a neutral path that avoids this different impact and treats everyone with respect”.</p> <p>The tribunal heard that GCC, with a motto of “Do right, fear no one”, prided itself on supporting trans rights since 1988 but Bailey’s views on the matter were very different.</p> <p>Echoing Calvert-Lee, Lewis said employers should “avoid taking a kneejerk reaction because somebody is expressing a view which is different from the organisation’s stated objective or stated position on a certain matter”.</p> <p>But given there was still a debate at the time of Bailey’s tweets over whether or not gender-critical views were protected, she said it was a mistake organisations were less likely to make in the wake of the tribunal’s decisions.</p> <p><br>• This article was amended on 29 July 2022.

But is Lara just stirring?","byline":"Interviews by Georgina Lawton","body":"<h2><strong>The prosecution: Lara</strong></h2> <p><em>Having five different kinds of milk open is ridiculous. Beatrice isn’t even lactose</em><em>-intolerant</em></p> <p>The world has gone milk-mad in my opinion. No one needs such a vast selection of options for every type of beverage, but that’s exactly what we’ve got in our fridge at home. I live with my little sister, Beatrice, and she’s obsessed with having milk for every occasion. Almond, soya, coconut, oat and some flavoured and barista ones, too. But she’s not lactose-intolerant and also keeps normal milk in our fridge to cook with. It’s absolutely nuts.</p> <p>It takes up too much space in our fridge, because they are all open at the same time. She also keeps unopened plant-based milk in our cupboards. It’s annoying as it eats into my shelf space.</p> <p>Beatrice is a bit coffee-obsessed and I think the milk habit feeds into that. She saved up for a barista-style coffee machine and asked our parents for a coffee grinder before. I think it’s all a bit over the top. What happened to a normal cup of coffee with a dash of cow’s milk?</p> <p>Beatrice gets annoyed at me for using her milk (the first one I grab) when I’m at home, but there’s no way I’d buy more milk and clog up our fridge further. If there’s a milk open, I’ll use it – otherwise they will go off before she can finish them. I’ve had to throw away a couple in the past.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Shunning dairy products seems to be a trend, to make you sound cool and ethical</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Beatrice is one of those people who goes into a coffee shop and asks for an oat milk frappa-something, and when the barista says, “Oh, so you don’t want the cream as it is dairy?” she says “No, I do”. It doesn’t make sense. Why bother having milk alternatives in your drinks if you’re just going to keep the cow’s cream on top? I’m a few years older than Beatrice, who is in her early 20s, and just missed the obsession with shunning dairy products. It just seems to be a trend, something that makes you sound cool and ethical. </p> <p>Beatrice needs to relax on milk-buying and just stick to one or two. It’s more economical, and saves space. Beatrice has just started working after graduation. She should be saving some of her cash instead of frittering it away on fancy drinks.</p> <h2><strong>The defence: Beatrice</strong></h2> <p><em>Coffee is a highlight of my day, and everyone my age enjoys different milks. Lara needs to chill out</em></p> <p>I love having a selection of milk alternatives at home. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/24/the-perfect-milk-alternatives-for-every-purpose-from-cocktails-to-custard\" title=\"\">It’s good to have one for each mood</a>, or drink. I have oat milk for my morning coffee, coconut milk for iced coffee, almond milk for tea, and soya milk just because it’s good for everything. I also have barista versions of all of these, to go with the expensive coffee machine I have in our flat. Perhaps it’s a bit of an obsession but I pay for it all myself.</p> <p>I am working part-time from home as a marketing assistant, and I see keeping a variety of milk in the house as good for motivation. The best part of my day is making a fancy drink after getting up and answering my emails. I like an oat milk latte made with coffee that a friend bought me back from the Galápagos Islands. I grind it there and then, so it’s extra fresh. I want to buy a milk frother next. I think it will give my drinks that extra edge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Lara keeps it quiet that she spends a small fortune on Pret drinks, whereas I rarely buy coffees now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lara complains, until I make her one of my fancy drinks at the weekend or after work. Then she’s like, “Oh wow!” She also keeps it quiet that she spends a small fortune on Pret drinks each day, whereas I rarely buy coffees now. My way is more economical but she doesn’t want to admit that.</p> <p>I do keep a lot of different milks open in the fridge because I don’t know which one I’ll need at any given time. They rarely go to waste. And the ones in the cupboard don’t take up that much space – Lara’s exaggerating there. I buy plant-based milks in bulk as it’s cheaper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/15/you-be-the-judge-should-i-let-my-boyfriend-have-three-games-consoles\">You be the judge: should I let my boyfriend have three games consoles?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I’m not lactose-intolerant but so what? Everyone my age dabbles in different milks. It’s good to consume less dairy, whatever your diet. Plant-based milks are healthier and generally taste better, too. I keep normal dairy milk in the house for guests and to cook with, but I don’t think that’s ridiculous.</p> <p>Lara uses my milk and doesn’t pay attention to which one she picks up. I’ll say, “Coconut milk works best with this type of coffee,” but she doesn’t listen. I think she should stick to normal dairy as she doesn’t appreciate the others. I’ll continue to consume milk the way I want to – and Lara should chill out because she uses them, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The jury</strong> <strong>of Guardian readers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Should Beatrice buy fewer milk alternatives?</strong></p> <p>With so many alternatives to dairy milk, it seems to me totally unnecessary to use cow’s milk: it’s a cruel industry even if you buy organic. Some plant milks do work better with different drinks, so I think Beatrice is not guilty<br><strong>Laura, 27</strong></p> <p>It’s commendable that Beatrice is drinking non-dairy milks even though she’s not lactose-intolerant – it’s much better for the planet. However, fridge and cupboard space is at a premium in a flatshare so it’s unreasonable to keep multiple opened cartons. So Beatrice is guilty. Just.<br><strong>Dean, 30</strong></p> <p>While I realise that keeping five cartons of milk in the fridge is decadent, using so-called “milk” instead of animal milk is something we should all get behind. Beatrice doesn’t say she uses them for ethical reasons but assuming that’s part of it, Lara should lay off the criticism – especially if she secretly drinks it herself.<br><strong>Mo, 34</strong></p> <p>I can relate to Beatrice; in our house we have oat milk for coffee, rice milk for tea, growing-up milk for our two-year-old and this week cow’s milk for the builders! They are all open in the fridge (plus unopened ones in the cupboard) and we get through the lot.<br><strong>Louise, 40</strong></p> <p>No one’s saying Beatrice can’t enjoy something she genuinely loves, but keeping five different open milks in a shared fridge is absolutely crackers. Either limit it to a couple or buy a mini-fridge and keep them in there. Beatrice should realise that this is her obsession, not Lara’s.<em><br></em><strong>Greg, 39</strong></p> <h2><strong>You be the judge</strong></h2> <p>So now you can be the judge.

It was quite strange; it was a celebration because there was no pressure any more – it was all done. We actually had a really good night, surprisingly; we all had a good laugh. That summed up the group. It wasn’t the typical, ‘Go home, get your heads down and think about your performance’. It was an incredible achievement to get there, so we had to celebrate something that was so unexpected.”</p> \n<p>Getting the disappointment out of a player’s mind is crucial, otherwise it will lurk in the background for a long time, infesting the squad going into pre-season. Most teams who fall at the final hurdle lose their best players, so signings are important to refresh and revive the group. After Middlesbrough lost to Norwich in 2015, the key loanee Patrick Bamford departed and Lee Tomlin was sold to Bournemouth. Stewart Downing and David Nugent were brought in by Aitor Karanka to add experience. They went on be promoted as runners-up.</p> \n<p>“You want to add something better to improve you,” the former Middlesbrough goalkeeper Dimi Konstantopoulos says. “That is what we did and credit to Aitor: he did his research and the players he brought in didn’t disturb the dressing atmosphere, they were adding to it. We were even better the season that followed and we deserved to follow up automatically.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"391bd22154273137a74d4bd2af7b6247089e6067\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/391bd22154273137a74d4bd2af7b6247089e6067/0_118_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Middlesbrough celebrate their 2016 promotion after losing the 2015 playoff final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Middlesbrough celebrate their 2016 promotion after losing the 2015 playoff final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gowthorpe/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Danny Schofield, who has replaced Corberán, faces a tough task because the manager is integral to helping a team bounce back.

Equally, players can be spurred on to make sure they finish in the top two and avoid the precarious nature of the playoffs. “Once we saw automatic promotion was in our sights, nothing was stopping that group of players; we were just hungrier than the others to get there,” Karacan says of the title-winning season. “We were just ticking off the games – we weren’t ever looking at the table, which was drummed into us when Steve Coppell was in charge … That was our mentality and it served us well.”</p> \n<p>Huddersfield, despite a tumultuous summer, will be a target after their third-place finish. The club have lost plenty of Championship experience and their replacements have largely come from the lower leagues.</p> \n<p>“It is tough,” Karacan says. “We had the continuity, whereas they’ve just lost their manager, and we just said: ‘Let’s go get it again.’ It will be difficult for them but they will just have to start the season as well as possible. It’s hard because who can forget that disappointment? Wash it off; they did well to finish third and get to the final when they were underdogs. They have some quality players and are a real tight-knit group, which is similar to what we had.”</p> \n<p>There are no guarantees in a league as competitive as the Championship but looking forward rather than back is the key to success.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/29/chess-magnus-carlsen-in-olympiad-action-as-world-no-1-targets-record-rating","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T07:00:50Z","webTitle":"Chess: Magnus Carlsen in Olympiad action as world No 1 targets record rating","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/chess-magnus-carlsen-in-olympiad-action-as-world-no-1-targets-record-rating","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/29/chess-magnus-carlsen-in-olympiad-action-as-world-no-1-targets-record-rating","fields":{"headline":"Chess: Magnus Carlsen in Olympiad action as world No 1 targets record rating","trailText":"The newly retired world champion will aim for a high score at Chennai to boost his chances of reaching the 2900 target which has twice narrowly eluded him","byline":"Leonard Barden","body":"<p>Magnus Carlsen, newly retired from world title matches, is in Chennai this weekend for Friday’s opening round of the 186-nation Olympiad, where, due to Carlsen’s elevated rating, Norway are the No 3 seeds behind the US and India.</p> <p>Round one Olympiad results (selected): India 4-0 Zimbabwe, Angola 0.5-3.5 US, Lebanon 0.5-3.5 Norway, Spain 4-0 Wales, England 4-0 Cyprus.

Carlsen will aim for the individual top board gold and a boost to his new ambition of a world record 2900 rating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/24/chess-robot-grabs-and-breaks-finger-of-seven-year-old-opponent-moscow\">Chess robot grabs and breaks finger of seven-year-old opponent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier, Carlsen won six blitz games in a row at the Zagreb leg of the US-backed Grand Tour, his first event since his announcement that he would not defend his crown in 2023. His surge was checked on the final day when he lost his last two, including <a href=\"https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=2331007\" title=\"\">one to Alireza Firouzja</a>, the 19-year-old who he has identified as a future rival. After going clear, Carlsen ended up with a 22.5/36 total and edged first prize by half a point.</p> <p>As ever, his comments were objective and self-critical: “I felt my play was pretty shaky throughout most of the day, but I won a bunch of these very nervy time-trouble duels where nobody really knew what was going on”. The 31-year-old Norwegian holds the Tour record of 27/36 points, achieved at Kolkata 2019, along with several other high totals.</p> <p>Carlsen’s chess future is still unclear. His plan after giving up his crown is to aim for a record 2900 rating, a stratospheric level which he has twice missed by fewer than 20 points. If, freed of the drudgery of match prep, he could now unleash his full creative powers and achieve the chess Everest within a year or two, that would surely cement his status as the clear all-time No 1 ahead of Garry Kasparov.</p> <p>In reality, the technical and personal obstacles are significant. The online rapid/blitz Tour is a major diversion of his energy from over-the-board classical chess. For 2900, he needs what he has been missing recently, consistent 75% totals and sustained winning runs against 2790 opponents. The classical calendar is smaller than it was, and two of what used to be his best events, Shamkir and the Grenke Classic, have ceased. His <a href=\"https://www.2700chess.com/players/carlsen\" title=\"\">ratings chart</a> for the past decade is a 2850 plateau, with peaks and dips 25 points or so either side.</p> <p>Long ago, Alexander Alekhine dominated his rivals in 1930-31, Bobby Fischer crushed them in 1970-71, and Garry Kasparov reached his peak of 2851 in 1999. In 1999-2002, Kasparov played 10 classical super tournaments, won nine of them, tied first in the other, and lost once in 115 games. Those exceptional performances were all achieved before the current era of super-computers and of opening prep deep into the middle game, so 2900 for Carlsen could legitimately be claimed as a modern equivalent at a higher, more sophisticated level.</p> <p>The question is whether, after achieving so much, his ambition still really burns bright. A decade ago, in his early 20s, he was often asked how long he would continue, and his reply was to the effect that he would not be like Kasparov or Anatoly Karpov, who continued to seek success in their 40s. If his new attempt at 2900 stalls, then gradually winding down and playing more poker and padel tennis may start to seem attractive.</p> <p>Carlsen is well known to prefer a world championship format where rapid, blitz, and even one-minute bullet play a part, with the aim to find the best all-round competitor rather than the best at slow classical chess.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/20/magnus-carlsen-will-not-defend-his-world-chess-championship-title-in-2023\">Magnus Carlsen will not defend his World Chess Championship title in 2023</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked in an interview this week if he had thought of coming back to the world championship cycle and playing the Candidates again, Carlsen said: “I have never ruled out a return in the future.

Will the Saudis care? | Ewan Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The former US president has always placed a premium on sport as an inextricable stripe of American life and bought in accordingly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/11/the-day-donald-trumps-narcissism-killed-the-usfl\">He owned a team</a> in the upstart United States Football League in the early 1980s, ponied up eight-figure fees to host prizefights at his Atlantic City casino before it went bankrupt, financed an American alternative to the Tour de France – the predictably named <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/remembering-the-tour-de-trump-donald-trumps-failed-bik-1735454622\">Tour de Trump</a> – and made a splashy but failed bid for the NFL’s Buffalo Bills in the 2010s.</p> <p>As the walls closed in during the final days of his presidency, his Twitter account neutered and reputation stained for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/21/january-6-hearing-donald-trump-us-capitol-attack\">his role in inciting the US Capitol attack</a> in 2021, Trump’s critics saw a certain poetic justice in the rejection he experienced from his favourite sport. Only days after the 6 January insurrection, the PGA of America <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jan/11/pga-strips-major-golf-championship-from-donald-trumps-course\">announced it was stripping Bedminster</a> of the 2022 US PGA Championship, the supposed crowning achievement of his two decades as a golf course owner. In Trumpland, it was a fate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1348731325440733184\">worse than impeachment itself</a>.</p> <p>But the former US president is nothing if not durable. And there he was on Wednesday night at the LIV Golf welcome gala at Manhattan’s Gotham Hall, taking in a performance by Nelly and kibitzing with Caitlyn Jenner and a cadre of the PGA Tour defectors whose adulation he craves. On Thursday, he was due to take part in the Pro-Am at Bedminster alongside DeChambeau and Johnson.</p> <p>Trump has further leaned into sports-baron cosplay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/19/donald-trump-urges-golfers-to-take-liv-money-despite-protests-from-911-groups\">by advising golfers</a> to side with LIV against the PGA Tour. “All of those golfers that remain ‘loyal’ to the very disloyal PGA, in all of its different forms, will pay a big price when the inevitable MERGER with LIV comes, and you get nothing but a big ‘thank you’ from PGA officials who are making Millions of Dollars a year,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p> <p>There was a time this marriage of convenience would have been considered improbable. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/19/trump-once-denounced-saudi-arabia-as-extremist-now-hes-heading-there-to-promote-moderate-islam/\">Trump accused Saudi Arabia of a role</a> in the September 11 attacks throughout his 2016 presidential run and decried the country’s abhorrent LGBTQ+ rights record during his final debate with Hillary Clinton. But he quickly warmed up to the Saudi regime after taking office, making a trip to Riyadh and later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/20/trump-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-crown-prince\">delivering an extraordinary statement</a> backing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s denial of responsibility for the Khashoggi murder in defiance of US intelligence officials.</p> <p>It remains unclear how much the former president’s company will earn for hosting this week’s event and LIV Golf’s October season finale at Doral, another Trump club outside Miami, but the move has attracted plenty of criticism. The 54-hole, no-cut competition will begin on Friday afternoon amid protests by 9/11 families at the public library in Bedminster four miles down the road from the sprawling 500-acre grounds of Trump National. Terry Strada, the national chair of 9/11 Families United, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/25/liv-golfers-criticised-by-911-survivors-group-over-staging-of-new-jersey-event\">called the venue</a> the “worst place on the planet” for the event: “[Trump] is a New Yorker, he claims to have empathy for the families but clearly he does not. If he had a sensitive bone in his body he would understand the level of angst this causes.”</p> <p>Whether the endeavour will deliver a return on the Saudi Public Investment Fund’s $2bn injection is anyone’s guess, though early indicators have left much to be desired. This week’s event, like the first two, has been relegated to YouTube, and there is no television deal in place. And the cost of a $75 grounds pass for Friday, Saturday or Sunday was down to a scant $3 on the secondary market as of Wednesday afternoon, denoting a paltry demand even among the Maga faithful itching for a glimpse of the former president in the flesh. The money is spinning.

That month, also in New York, there was a furore when a dress the woman had once worn was paraded at the Metropolitan Museum of Art gala by a reality TV star. The gown is said to be “the most expensive dress in the world”; its owner paid nearly $5m for it. To ensure its safety, it is normally kept in special conditions in a darkened vault.</p> <p>The woman in the portrait, the woman who once wore the dress – to sing Happy Birthday to President John F Kennedy at Madison Square Garden – was, of course, Marilyn Monroe. The vividly coloured screen-print of her, the work of Andy Warhol, is the most famous of his works of pop art. Kim Kardashian, whose stunt it was to wear the Monroe dress at the Met, responded to criticism for having worn a deceased woman’s clothing by insisting, bizarrely, that she had “so much respect” for her.</p> <p>In life, Monroe made herself noticed far beyond Hollywood and in ways very different from the corny “sex bomb” image that is the leitmotif of her modern iconography. Twenty years before physical exercise became a fad, she went running. She read serious literature voraciously, Dostoevsky in particular. As early as 1950, studio executives had thought it necessary to warn her not to be seen reading politically radical books. Before the decade was out, Monroe would marry Arthur Miller, at the very time the playwright was being investigated for his dalliance with communism. She supported the burgeoning civil rights movement. She was a founder member of the Hollywood branch of Sane, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"131e9c1c8bc6d8c11ae3b3b2eb4b4cad21efc29a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/131e9c1c8bc6d8c11ae3b3b2eb4b4cad21efc29a/585_244_4173_3268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man looks at Warhol’s vivid screenprint Shot Sage Blue Marilyn in a dim gallery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"783\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warhol’s Shot Sage Blue Marilyn, which sold for $195m in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet 60 years after she died, Monroe’s vivid presence in the world’s culture – only Diana, Princess of Wales rivals her hold over the public imagination – does not allow for nuance.

Innumerable Facebook groups, Pinterest boards, Instagram accounts and fansites – Marilyn Remembered, Our Marilyn, Immortal Marilyn, the Irish Marilyn Monroe fanclub – are devoted to her.</p> <p>I wrote a biography of the star in 1985, seeking to penetrate the jungle of factoids about her and emerge with something approximate to the truth about her life and controversial death. Since its publication, the appetite for all things Monroe – in particular the seamier side of her legacy – has only grown more voracious. In recent months, millions have watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/02/mystery-marilyn-monroe-unheard-tapes-documentary\">a Netflix documentary</a> based on the interviews I taped for that book. In September, Netflix will premiere <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/13/marilyn-monroe-abiding-obsession-biopic-blonde\">Blonde</a>, a highly anticipated fictional film starring Ana de Armas.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIsFywuZPoQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aIsFywuZPoQ?start=1&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It is billed as a “biopic” – and, by the director, Andrew Dominik, as “an emotional nightmare fairytale”. It is adapted from the novel of the same name by the American author Joyce Carol Oates, which was published in 2000. The novel, Oates wrote in a preface, was a “radically distilled ‘life’ of Marilyn Monroe”. By radically distilled, she explained, she meant that she had been highly selective, used real-life facts and characters – she credited my biography as being one of her main sources – but freely imagined much else.</p> <p>In Oates’ 700-page novel, the lead character is usually named as Norma Jeane, the name Monroe was born with and known by until her movie career took off. Later, she is “Marilyn Monroe”. During the second world war, the novel’s Norma Jeane works at Radio Plane, a company doing war work – and the future star did work at such a company. Later, when she finds fame, she marries first “the Ex-Athlete” and then “the Playwright” – transparent references to Monroe’s husbands Joe DiMaggio and Arthur Miller.</p> <p>Sexual experiences, mostly miserable ones, dominate Blonde – with an emphasis on the tyranny and treachery of many of her men. Early in the book, Norma Jeane is raped by a Hollywood studio mogul who is allotted the name “Mr Z”. The rape scene is graphically written, sparing no detail. “Mr Z” has been interpreted as a thinly veiled reference to the founder of Twentieth Century Fox, Darryl Zanuck. The real-life Monroe recalled “casting couch” sex encounters, but nothing suggests any of them were with Zanuck. In interviews with almost 700 people, I encountered nothing to suggest that any Hollywood producer raped Monroe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dba64629b5788372fa23f727e8e38d406b404fcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dba64629b5788372fa23f727e8e38d406b404fcf/0_136_762_457/500.jpg\" alt=\"Monroe (in sequinned silver dress) with President John F Kennedy and his brother Robert, after JFK’s birthday party in 1962.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monroe with President John F Kennedy (right) and his brother Robert, after JFK’s birthday party in 1962.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cecil Stoughton/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Oates’ novel, though, the most blatant historical libel targets Monroe’s 1962 involvement with “the President”. “The President”, from a hugely wealthy Irish-American family, is a clear reference to Kennedy. In the novel, the President asks peremptorily to see Monroe, has sex with her repeatedly, then becomes inaccessible until “the summons” comes again.</p> <p>Monroe is flown to the White House. There is more sex, chitchat about communist Cuba and Fidel Castro, and still more sex. Back in Los Angeles, she dreams that the president has made her pregnant. Then comes another summons, another flight east. She sings “Happy Birthday, Mr President” at Madison Square Garden. Then, on her return to Los Angeles, desolation and death.</p> <p>In the novel, death comes “hurtling toward her” in the form of a man “without passion and without pity”, an assassin. The man does not know whether his mission is “to protect the President from the President’s blond whore” or whether the real purpose is “to damage the President for being associated with the blond whore”. Using a key he has been given by a person identified as “RF”, the assassin gets into Monroe’s house at night when she is asleep. Then, equipped with a syringe loaded with a fatal dose of a sleeping medication, he “[sinks] the six-inch needle to the hilt into her heart”.</p> <p>Oates’ novel makes it clear that references to “the President” in the book are to Kennedy. Moreover, no one would interpret her reference to “RF” as code for anyone other than “RFK” – the president’s brother, Attorney General Robert F Kennedy.</p> <p>Why do I call Oates’ “fictionalised” tale of dalliance with the Kennedys “historical libel”? Credible information does suggest that Kennedy dallied with Monroe. His brother Robert, research indicates, also had some sort of covert connection to her. There is zero evidence, however, that they or anyone else murdered her. Is it defensible to write and publish this scenario in a novel – not least when the individuals involved are still fresh in the memory? A scenario that could suggest the president’s brother aided and abetted – ordered? – murder?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d209f9b23395336873034f7151207a7cb03fb9f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d209f9b23395336873034f7151207a7cb03fb9f5/0_50_4710_2825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monroe reads Michael Chekhov’s book To the Actor: On the Technique of Acting, in 1955.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monroe reads Michael Chekhov’s book To the Actor: On the Technique of Acting, in 1955.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Oates’ novel came out, her defence was that, in a work of fiction, she “had no particular obligation” to the facts. In my view, that is not so. The people she named in her novel were real people with real reputations – and historical legacies – and such fictional fabrication is unjustifiably cruel. The fact that the individuals concerned are dead is no defence.</p> <p>Will the upcoming movie spin the same tale? Dominik has said the film will be “critical of American sacred cows”, including Kennedy, and that “there’s something in it to offend everyone”. It is evident that the film will push the limits. Netflix reportedly insisted on hiring an editor to “curb the excesses” of the production. Even so, it has an NC-17 rating, which – in theory – bars viewing by anyone 17 or under in the US.</p> <p>Dominik does not mince his words. He says the movie is what you would want from “the NC-17 version of the Marilyn Monroe story”. He continues: “If the audience doesn’t like it, that’s the audience’s fucking problem.” More soberly, he claims the movie would not have been made without the #MeToo movement; that it tells what it is like “to be an unloved girl, to go through the Hollywood meat-grinder … how a childhood trauma shapes an adult who’s split between a public and private self”.</p> <p>After seeing a rough cut, Oates deemed the film “brilliant, very disturbing, perhaps most surprisingly an utterly ‘feminist’ interpretation”.

Bogs, meanwhile, sound comical. Marshes are pleasanter, although bring malaria to mind, while wetlands emanate wholesomeness but are also wet in the “meh” sense of take it or leave it. Yet, as Tom Blass explains, these words all refer to the same thing: a place where land and water have got into a tussle and can’t decide which has won. The result is not so much an equilibrium, although these states of semi-submersion can hold their nerve for millennia, more a temporary detente where both sides are too exhausted to declare an outcome. It is in search of these in-between places that Blass travels from Cyprus to Lapland, Romania to Virginia, eyes peeled and treading gingerly lest he fall into the murk that lies beneath.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Early on, Blass reveals himself to be more ethnologist than naturalist. While he pays respectful attention to the fauna that he encounters as he tacks from the Romney Marshes to Louisiana’s bayous by way of the Danube delta, it is the people he is after. The Lipovans, Cajuns and Seminole are all ethnic groups that have moulded a culture from the sludge squelching between their toes and this is the true subject of Blass’s bracingly original work. Above all, he is scrupulous about avoiding cliches. There are, for instance, very few glorious sunsets in Swamp Songs or encounters with gnarly old locals acting as aquifers for ancient wisdom, small mercies for which the reader should be grateful.</p> <p>This desire to skewer the cliches of his chosen genre starts early on, when Blass makes a trip to Dungeness, which in summer “is overrun by sea kale, psycho-geographers and, dammit, by people like me”. What people like him tend to be after, of course, is Prospect Cottage, the isolated clapperboard dwelling in which the film director Derek Jarman spent his last years cultivating his garden, a Shintoesque, salt-blown wonder in the lee of the looming nuclear power station. Even here, Blass can’t resist undercutting the conventions of his chosen genre, which may, indeed, be psycho-geography. “‘That’s it,’ they say. ‘That’s Derek Jarman’s house.’ And they move on, because really, there isn’t a great deal to see.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>To ‘drain the swamp’ is to recast a cluster of oppressed and vulnerable people as bogeymen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such deadpanning is much in evidence too when Blass heads for the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/great-dismal-swamp\" title=\"\">Great Dismal Swamp</a> of Virginia’s coastal plane. The very name of the place is tautologous, since from the 17th century the word “dismal” was a catch-all term for a quagmire. “In other words, all swamps were dismal by dint of being swampy,” he writes. Still, Dismal does seem to live up to the modern usage, offering the visiting Blass nothing but a series of guarded, misfiring interactions with the inhabitants who are doing their favourite thing of fishing for bowfin and bullheads while giving nothing away.</p> <p>The only clue as to what may lie behind this persistent sense of Dismal’s menace is the fact that in the domestic front yards you can see Confederate flags alongside the more usual stars and stripes. The year is 2016, and as Blass drives round the edge of the swamp the US presidential election is only a few weeks away. Everywhere he sees placards that bear the slogans “Lock Her Up” and “Make America Great Again”. Most chilling of all, though, is the exhortation to “Drain the Swamp”. Blass discovers that historically the Dismal was the last redoubt of Black people running away from the plantations, fugitive Native Americans, English and Irish indentured labourers. Seen in this context, to “drain the swamp” is to recast a cluster of oppressed and vulnerable people as bogeymen.</p> <p>Before Britons feel too smug, Blass finds this dynamic alive and well closer to home. Back at the Romney Marshes, near to where he lives, he explores the local romance of smuggling, which has endured over centuries thanks to the watery inlets that allow small boats to drift quietly ashore and unload well away from the customs officer’s gaze. But Blass turns his binoculars sharply round and, before we know it, we are confronting the fact that every month refugees are smuggled across the Channel to land at nearby Dover.

Unusually for this part of the country, this valley, which is peppered with gorse, hawthorn and bracken, was cut by a glacier, so its walls are high and steep. There is little but sheep here; the Vale of Ewyas is remote and wild with a distinct lack of civilisation, something that has attracted visitors for centuries.</p> <p>One such visitor, a knight called William de Lacy (related to the wealthy Norman landowner family), <a href=\"http://www.ewyaslacy.org.uk/-/Notes-on-Llanthony-Priory/1100-s-1200-s-1300-s-1400-s-1500-s/nw_lty_3003\" title=\"\">came here in the early 12th century</a>, so one story goes. In William’s time and right up until the second world war, the valley was densely wooded. De Lacy became lost in the swampy forest and, struggling to find his way, he chanced upon a small, sixth-century ruined chapel, said to be the hermitage of Saint David, the patron saint of Wales. Legend has it that the experience moved De Lacy so much, he renounced his sinful ways and took up a life of prayer and contemplation, choosing to remain in his armour for the rest of his life to “harden himself from temptation of the devil”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aab11c61abcf88f128e61141152f7e8f4633f2df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aab11c61abcf88f128e61141152f7e8f4633f2df/0_0_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View from Haterall Ridge on the descent up to the ridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from the ascent to Hatterall Ridge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quite naturally for the time, this behaviour attracted others including Erinisius, chaplain to Queen Matilda, wife of Henry I. Within a decade many more had arrived and Llanthony Priory was established in 1118. With the Archbishop of Canterbury firmly under the belief that Benedictines were too lazy and Cistercians too greedy, Erinisius, De Lacy and their merry band of religious zealots became Augustinian canons, black-clad preachers, rather than grey or brown-clad monks.</p> <p>A period of chequered fortunes was to follow. In the mid-12th century, it was <a href=\"https://www.llanthonyprioryhotel.co.uk/the-history\" title=\"\">taken over by local “barbarians”</a> who were scandalously reported to have had parties at the priory, with drunken orgies and frivolous dancing. By about 1275 the canons had restored order and, thanks to patronage from the De Lacy family, there was more money to spend on improvements. Much of the building we see today was constructed at this time with the work taking a little over 50 years. There was little else like it around and for some time it was said to be among the most magnificent buildings in Wales.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The grassland and hedgerows of the lush valley floor slip away as the surroundings become far wilder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The walk begins round the back of the ruins, following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jul/28/black-mountains-wales-walking-myth-folklore\" title=\"\">Beacons Way</a> signposted to Hatterall Hill. The barman called this well-trodden footpath the Ale Path or <a href=\"http://muddybootsandstuff.co.uk/2016/12/23/rhiw-cwrw-the-beer-track/\" title=\"\">Rhiw Cwrw</a>. Once a route linking the priory to the outside world, it was used to transport ale in and out of the valley. As I pause for breath, I think of the donkeys and ponies loaded with barrels hiking up the hill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3f0fe1f8b66bd7b0d4167f74500f683802a0a486\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f0fe1f8b66bd7b0d4167f74500f683802a0a486/0_0_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the Offa’s Dyke path with views to Herefordshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the Offa’s Dyke path with views to Herefordshire</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the hardest part of the trail: the path rises steeply up the fields and into the woods and you’ll feel your blood pumping as you climb. Thankfully, once through the trees, it eases to a slow, steadier incline. The grassland and hedgerows of the lush valley floor slip away as the surroundings become far wilder. At the height of summer the hillside is thick with juicy bilberries and it’s impossible to come away without deep purple stains on your hands.</p> <p>Once completely up out of the valley the walk continues north-west along <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/oct/14/offas-dyke-path-at-50\" title=\"\">Offa’s Dyke path</a>, high on Hatterrall Ridge and marking the border between England and Wales. The landscape feels alive as rabbits dart out from hiding places, kites swoop overhead and the incessant song of meadow pipits sounds like a benign car alarm among the swathes of bilberries. From this vantage point you can clearly see the route the ancient glacier would have taken to carve out this U-shaped valley of the River Honddu.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b338c519a0b34b6ee68d8f95b59f9c292fc2bed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b338c519a0b34b6ee68d8f95b59f9c292fc2bed/0_0_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wild ponies at the top of Hatterall Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild ponies at the top of Hatterall Hill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Close to the trig point, I’m joined by wild horses, much to the delight of three Malaysian sisters who have travelled across the country from Essex to be here. Having walked the reverse route they warn of the very steep path back down to Llanthony. At the cairn, 500 metres or so before the path takes a sharp left, the sky begins to bruise a foreboding dark grey. As I descend, feeling the strain in muscles I wasn’t previously aware of, I appreciate being forewarned and, despite the impending rain, take it slowly down the hill.</p> <p>Towards the end of the walk, I am rewarded with a perfectly framed view of the lonely priory below and am thrown back into that feeling of otherworldliness. It isn’t hard to see why De Lacy and his followers chose to live here far from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. I have certainly taken longer walks but my legs ache as I trudge the last few hundred metres. A drink in the cellar bar is calling me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Google map of Llanthony Abbey walk\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1yBuzG5QR288W19D-lvxG8W9aITimeJE&ehbc=2E312F\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>Start</strong> Llanthony Priory Car Park<br><strong>Distance</strong> 5.2 miles<br><strong>Time</strong> 2hrs 15mins<br><strong>Total ascent</strong> 442 metres <br><strong>Difficulty</strong> Moderate</p> <h2><strong>The pub</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d038eaa5e0aafa0d5d1894024340ad97b8ec73c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d038eaa5e0aafa0d5d1894024340ad97b8ec73c1/0_0_8217_4930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Llanthony Priory Hotel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Llanthony Priory Hotel</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tucked away on the left hand side of the ruins, the pub is easy to miss. But you’ll find it down a flight of stairs in a 13th-century vaulted cellar. It opens regularly during the summer months but less in the winter, so check the website before visiting to avoid disappointment. As often with remote pubs, it is as much a cafe, shop and ice-cream outlet as it is a pub. It sells guidebooks, tea, coffee and chocolate bars along with more regular pub fare such as bar snacks and soft drinks. Behind the bar you’ll also find Welsh ales, ciders and spirits including the not-to-be-missed <a href=\"https://www.penderyn.wales/\" title=\"\">Penderyn whisky</a>, a rare Welsh single malt.</p> <p>I found it refreshing to drink in a pub that hadn’t been refurbished to within an inch of its life: it had a welcoming, no-nonsense atmosphere. The food is as unpretentious as the pub: jacket potatoes, lasagne and chips, rather than essence of foraged mushrooms with kale foam and hand-selected quinoa.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.llanthonyprioryhotel.co.uk/bar---restaurant\" title=\"\">llanthonyprioryhotel.co.uk</a></em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I found it refreshing to drink in a pub that hadn’t been refurbished to within an inch of its life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>The rooms</strong></h2> <p>There is no wifi, no phone signal and no TVs in the rooms: these, for many, are their biggest selling points. As you might expect in a listed building, the decor is quirky and not overly sophisticated. There are no en suites but the rooms are generously sized with comfortable beds and period furniture, including at least one four-poster. The staff couldn’t be more welcoming and there are beautiful views out into the valley.</p> <p>You cannot escape the sense of history here, with food served in a huge gothic dining room.

Another is to send voice notes, via Bluetooth, to local staff of aid organisations who have rare satellite internet access.

Even before the conference began, a furious row over a draft declaration forced Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury and conference president, into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/justin-welby-forced-to-allow-anglican-bishops-to-reject-statement-on-sexuality\">a U-turn</a>.</p> <p>Profound differences over sexuality exploded at the 1998 Lambeth conference, at which same-sex relationships were declared “incompatible with scripture”, and they have persisted ever since.</p> <p>The 15th conference was due to take place in 2018 but Welby cancelled it when he realised there was little hope of papering over toxic divisions. It was rescheduled to 2020 but postponed because of the Covid pandemic.</p> <p>Welby has spent almost a decade as leader of the global Anglican church trying to persuade bishops, clergy and parishioners to “walk together” – despite there being what appear to many to be irreconcilable differences.</p> <p>In practice his approach has infuriated liberals who want to see the church embrace same-sex marriage, and conservatives adamant that traditional biblical teaching must prevail. Representatives of both will be out in force in Canterbury over the next 10 days.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/about/anglican-communion\">archbishop’s website</a>, the global Anglican church comprises 85 million people from 165 countries speaking 2,000 languages. But growth over the past half a century has been predominantly concentrated among young people in sub-Saharan Africa, while ageing church congregations in the UK and elsewhere in the global north have shrunk.</p> <p>This has raised questions about whether it is appropriate for the global church to be led and dominated by the Church of England, with some, including Welby, suggesting this is a colonial hangover.</p> <p>Now African bishops are to have a greater say in choosing the next archbishop of Canterbury, probably in 2026 when Welby is expected to retire. The C of E’s ruling body, the General Synod, approved a motion this month saying representation from the Anglican Communion on the Crown Nominations Commission, the body that puts forward candidates to the Queen, should increase from one to five. Some believe this will greatly increase the chances of the next archbishop of Canterbury being more conservative.</p> <p>Meanwhile, three primates from Nigeria, Rwanda and Uganda, jointly representing about 30 million Anglicans, are boycotting the conference over the issue of sexuality.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://anglican.ink/2022/05/06/primates-of-nigeria-rwanda-and-uganda-respond-to-march-2022-primates-communique/\">a communique</a> in May, they wrote: “Human sexuality is not a moral issue to be wrapped in the garment of human rights which allows for distortion of fundamental biblical truth. For faithful Anglicans, Anglicanism is a way of life of total commitment to biblical truth that has no room for any revisionist agenda.”</p> <p>They said Welby was “becoming too tolerant and complicit in the arrogance and errors of the revisionist Anglican churches in the west”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-lambeth-conference-dont-make-it-about-sexuality\">The Guardian view on the Lambeth conference: don’t make it about sexuality | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches, led by the archbishop of South Sudan and claiming to represent 75% of all Anglicans around the globe, has declared one of its four priorities to be sounding a “clarion call to biblical faithfulness”, including a reaffirmation of the 1998 Lambeth conference motion.

It’s beautifully realised, too; it starts as the story of a rich, reckless man (Charles Dance’s Sir Roderick Burgess) reaching for eternity and summoning forces he can’t control. During an occult ritual, he conjures Morpheus (Tom Sturridge), the anthropomorphic incarnation of sleep and dreaming. Morpheus is imprisoned but, eventually, this supernatural being finds his way out of captivity.

It led to the Met raiding the homes of the former home secretary Leon Brittan and the military hero Lord Bramall.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe apologised to victims of the Operation Midland investigation into alleged paedophile rings after an independent review he ordered uncovered serious failings.</p> <p>Downing Street’s intervention has extended the time the NCA has been without a permanent leader. It was in September last year that Lynne Owens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/sep/17/lynne-owens-to-step-down-as-head-of-uk-national-agency\">stood down as director general</a>.</p> <p>The readvertising of the NCA job led to new candidates applying, several of whom were sifted out without going before a panel. Among those still in the running and who will be interviewed is Iain Livingstone, the chief constable of Police Scotland, the UK’s second biggest force. For some he is now the frontrunner.</p> <p>Shaun Sawyer, the veteran head of Devon and Cornwall police, will also be interviewed. He failed to get an interview when he applied to be Met commissioner, but did make it to the final two to be chief inspector of constabulary.</p> <p>Also through to the interview stage is Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, a role he leaves next March.</p> <p>Biggar remains in the running and is also through to the interview stage.</p> <p>Johnson came to know Hogan-Howe while the former was mayor of London. In 2019 Hogan-Howe endorsed Johnson’s candidacy for Conservative leader. He described Johnson as “incredibly” effective and said: “I found him to be loyal, honourable and he did what he promised to do.”</p> <p>The top job in the NCA is a senior civil service role equivalent to that of a permanent secretary. The NCA leads the fight against serious and organised crime.</p> <p>The Home Office declined to discuss the selection process. A spokesperson said: “A fair and open recruitment campaign is under way to make the best possible appointment to this vital role.

Military aid to Ukraine is justified, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/02/russia-economic-war-ukraine-food-fuel-price-vladimir-putin\">economic war</a> is ineffective against the regime in Moscow, and devastating for its unintended targets. World energy prices are rocketing, inflation is soaring, supply chains are chaotic and millions are being starved of gas, grain and fertiliser. Yet Vladimir Putin’s barbarity only escalates – as does his hold over his own people.</p> <p>To criticise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/21/eu-russia-sanctions-nightwolves-putin-actors-gold\">western sanctions</a> is close to anathema. Defence analysts are dumb on the subject. Strategy thinktanks are silent. Britain’s putative leaders, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, compete in belligerent rhetoric, promising ever tougher sanctions without a word of purpose. Yet, hint at scepticism on the subject and you will be excoriated as “pro-Putin” and anti-Ukraine. Sanctions are the war cry of the west’s crusade.</p> <p>The reality of sanctions on Russia is that they invite retaliation. Putin is free to freeze Europe this winter. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/25/russias-gazprom-to-make-drastic-cut-to-europes-gas-supply-from-wednesday\">slashed supply</a> from major pipelines such as Nord Stream 1 by up to 80%. World oil prices have surged and eastern Europe’s flow of wheat and other foodstuffs to Africa and Asia has been all but suspended.</p> <p>Britain’s domestic gas bills face tripling inside a year. The chief beneficiary is none other than Russia, whose energy exports to Asia have soared, driving its balance of payments into unprecedented surplus. The rouble is one of the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-ruble-currency-russian-economy-sanctioms-2022/\">world’s strongest currencies</a> this year, having strengthened since January by nearly 50%. Moscow’s overseas assets have been frozen and its oligarchs have relocated their yachts, but there is no sign that Putin cares. He has no electorate to worry him.</p> <p>The interdependence of the world’s economies, so long seen as an instrument of peace, has been made a weapon of war. Politicians around the Nato table have been <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2022/07/07/the-consequences-of-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-for-international-security-nato-and-beyond/index.html\">wisely cautious</a> about escalating military aid to Ukraine. They understand military deterrence. Yet they appear total ingenues on economics. Here they all parrot Dr Strangelove. They want to bomb Russia’s economy “<a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/russia-thrown-back-stone-age-205350104.html\">back to the stone age</a>”.</p> <p>I would be intrigued to know if any paper was ever submitted to Boris Johnson’s cabinet forecasting the likely outcome for Britain of Russian sanctions. The assumption seems to be that if trade embargos hurt they are working. As they do not directly kill people, they are somehow an acceptable form of aggression. They are based on a neo-imperial assumption that western countries are entitled to order the world as they wish. They are enforced, if not through gunboats, then through capitalist muscle in a globalised economy. Since they are mostly imposed on small, weak states soon out of the headlines, their purpose has largely been of “feelgood” symbolism.</p> <p>A rare student of this subject is the American economic historian Nicholas Mulder, who points out that more than 30 sanctions “wars” in the past 50 years have had minimal if not counterproductive impact. They are meant to “<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-vladimir-putin-thinks-hes-beating-the-sanctions-on-russia-vlt6qskhx\">intimidate peoples</a> into restraining their princes”. If anything they have had the opposite effect. From Cuba to Korea, Myanmar to Iran, Venezuela to Russia, autocratic regimes have been entrenched, elites strengthened and freedoms crushed. Sanctions seem to instil stability and self-reliance on even their weakest victim. Almost all the world’s oldest dictatorships have benefited from western sanctions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/25/russia-attack-grain-deal-food-supplies-ukraine-nato\">Putin’s attack on the grain deal was despicable.

Another observer, the Royal United Services Institute’s Russia expert Richard Connolly, has charted <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/russias-response-to-sanctions/western-sanctions-and-the-russian-response/83AA49F23719B171BDD31B3A3690E411\">Putin’s response</a> to the sanctions imposed on him since his 2014 seizure of Crimea and Donbas. Their objective was to change Russia’s course in those regions and deter further aggression. Their failure could hardly be more glaring. Apologists excuse this as due to the embargos being too weak. The present ones, perhaps the toughest ever imposed on a major world power, may not be working yet, but will apparently work in time. They are said to be starving Russia of microchips and drone spares. They will soon have Putin begging for peace.</p> <p>If Putin begs, it will be on the battlefield. At home, Connolly illustrates how Russia is “<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sanctions-are-making-russia-weaker-but-putin-stronger-rv0qjw2br\">slowly adjusting</a> to its new circumstances”. Sanctions have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/russia-and-india-will-find-ways-to-trade-despite-sanctions-says-lavrov\">promoted trade</a> with China, Iran and India. They have benefited “insiders connected to Putin and the ruling entourage, making huge profits from import substitution”. McDonald’s locations across the country have been replaced by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/12/mcdonalds-restaurants-in-russia-reopen-under-new-brand\">Russian-owned chain</a> called Vkusno &amp; tochka (“Tasty and that’s it”). Of course the economy is weaker, but Putin is, if anything, stronger while sanctions are cohering a new economic realm across Asia, embracing an ever enhanced role for China. Was this forecast?</p> <p>Meanwhile, the west and its peoples have been plunged into recession. Leadership has been shaken and insecurity spread in Britain, France, Italy and the US. Gas-starved Germany and Hungary are close to dancing to Putin’s tune. Living costs are escalating everywhere. Yet still no one dares question sanctions. It is sacrilege to admit their failure or conceive retreat. The west has been enticed into the timeless irony of aggression. Eventually its most conspicuous victim is the aggressor.

Keir Starmer’s decision to fire the junior shadow transport minister Sam Tarry after he joined a picket line at Euston station and did a series of unauthorised TV interviews has shifted the spotlight firmly on to the opposition, and to the question of whether Starmer’s Labour is truly on the side of workers.

During his campaign to become leader, Starmer invoked images of unions and striking workers, and pledged to renationalise rail and water. Now he is embroiled in a row with the very people he claimed to want to represent. How did Starmer get here? And is this strategy enough to get him to No10?</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Is Labour’s position popular?</strong></p> <p>While polling does show that the public is not wildly keen on strikes, given the direct impact it has on their lives, the stance Starmer has taken has frustrated some within his party. Last month, Starmer told Labour frontbenchers not to join picket lines – but some of his shadow ministers were among 50 MPs who did so. Tensions have only continued to rise, with one union source claiming that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/28/labour-mps-may-join-pickets-starmer-faces-test-party-unity\">up to 70 MPs </a>could join picket lines today. </p> <p>“It’s Starmer’s attempt to make Labour as electable as they possibly can be by moving away from stuff that scares the public,” Peter says. “If you’re a critic though it’s a little bit odd because it takes Labour away from what’s seen as its core values.”</p> <p>Starmer has maintained that the reason he fired Tarry wasn’t because of his decision to join the picket, but to go and speak to the media about it without permission. Other frontbenchers who joined pickets at the previous strikes were merely asked to apologise. “I almost wonder if it’s going to go into a slightly strange ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy. So long as they [frontbenchers] don’t make a fuss about it, we won’t do anything about it,” Peter says.</p> <p>This isn’t likely to work if the strikes continue. “If you’re an MP with a much more popular strike in your local area and you’ve got very close links with workers and they say, ‘can you come down the picket line’, it’s going to be very hard for them to say no,” Peter says.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Union problems</strong></p> <p>It’s no secret that union leaders have been unhappy with Starmer’s response to the strikes. Loudest among them has been Unite; its general secretary, Sharon Graham, has strongly condemned Starmer’s actions as “another insult to the trade union movement”. And Manuel Cortes of TSSA said that his union is “ashamed of the actions of the Labour party leadership and the anti-worker, anti-union message it is sending out”.</p> <p>This is nothing new. Starmer’s relationship with the unions has been tense for a long time and the implications for the party aren’t just political: “There is this constant threat from quite a few unions of pulling the funding plug,” Peter says. Even centrist trade unions have questioned Starmer’s actions, meaning that he may be running out of allies outside the party. Without that funding there’s a big hole in the budget to fight the next general election.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Internal divisions</strong></p> <p>In the insular world of Westminster this may seem like a huge deal, but Starmer’s stance hasn’t harmed Labour in the polls, <em>yet</em>.</p> <p>While public opinion has been divided when it comes to the rail strikes (49% of people aged 18-24 said they supported strikes, compared with 32% of those aged 50-64), there is largely a consensus as to who’s to blame:<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rail-strikes-shapps-poll-savanta-b2106083.html\"> two-thirds of people</a> surveyed in a poll by Savanta ComRes thought that the government has not done enough to prevent the strikes from happening. And the attempts to paint this as Labour’s fault haven’t gained traction. “Some of the attacks from Liz Truss about union barons seems quite retro. It makes them feel that they’re speaking in the 70s or 80,” Peter says.</p> <p>However, with more strikes likely, Starmer’s stance could continue to cause problems for Labour. Unions representing NHS staff and teachers have threatened action if wage depreciation isn’t addressed swiftly. “Within Labour, there’s a significant chance this could be a source of quite a lot of tension. And you might even lose a couple of shadow ministers and the ones who remain might be peeved,” Peter adds.</p> <p>Starmer’s anti-picket stance has the potential to spark civil war in the Labour party. And until the leader sketches out a clearer vision of what he stands for, as opposed to what he stands against, it will be tough to pull the party back together.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p>There will be much more to come on <strong>Bernard Cribbins</strong> after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/28/bernard-cribbins-star-of-doctor-who-and-jackanory-dies-aged-93\">his death yesterday</a>, but Russell T Davies’s warm recollection of a fine actor who entertained generations of children in everything from the Railway Children to the Wombles and Jackanory is well worth reading, along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/28/bernard-cribbins-a-warm-kindly-titan-of-childrens-entertainment\">Mark Lawson’s lovely tribute</a>. <em><strong>Toby Moses, head of newsletters</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>As the impacts of the <strong>climate emergency</strong> intensify, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/climate-crisis-emergency-rebecca-solnit-terry-tempest-williams\">Rebecca Solnit and Terry Tempest Williams write emphatically</a> on why we need to respond urgently and where we can start. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>The <strong>final episode of Neighbours</strong> is on Channel 5 today in the UK (beware spoilers from Australian friends).

He stayed in an apartment in northern Virginia. From there, he re-established contact with Trumpworld.</p> <p>“There was no contact with anyone in the Trump orbit when I was in prison,” he writes. “And I didn’t want any, especially if it could be exploited by the MSM [Mainstream Media, a derogatory term in rightwing circles].</p> <p>“But when the re-election campaign started kicking off, I was interacting, unofficially, with friends of mine who were very involved.

The Guardian obtained a copy.</p> <p>Throughout the book, Manafort, 73, strenuously denies collusion with Russia and ridicules investigations by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, Congress and the US intelligence community.</p> <p>But in Virginia in August 2018, in a case arising from Mueller’s investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow, Manafort was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/21/paul-manafort-convicted-of-tax-in-virginia-federal-court\">found guilty on eight counts</a>: five of tax fraud, two of bank fraud and one of failure to report a foreign bank account.</p> <p>In March 2019 he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/07/paul-manafort-sentencing-trump-campaign-chief\">sentenced</a> to 43 months in prison. Later that month, in Washington DC, Manafort was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/13/paul-manafort-second-sentencing-hearing-donald-trump\">sentenced</a> to an additional three-and-a-half-year term, having pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges, including money laundering and unregistered lobbying and a count related to witness tampering.</p> <p>Manafort was also found to have <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/paul-manaforted-plea-deal-mueller-investigation-3df5702d-c893-4008-bcb4-19baee56449b.html\">violated an agreement</a> with Mueller, by lying.</p> <p>In his memoir, Manafort describes his travels through the US prison system – including a stay in a Manhattan facility alongside the financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the Mexican drug baron Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.</p> <p>In another startling passage, Manafort writes that during one transfer between facilities, at a private airfield “somewhere in Ohio”, the sight of “prisoners … being herded in long lines and then separated into other buses and on to … transport planes … reminded me of movies about the Holocaust”.</p> <p>Manafort ran Trump’s campaign <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-paul-manaforts-role-trump-campaign/story?id=50808957\">between May and August 2016</a>, when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/19/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump-campaign%27\">resigned</a> shortly after the arrival of Steve Bannon as campaign chairman and amid a scandal over alleged evidence of payments connected with consulting work in Ukraine.</p> <p>In his book, Manafort denies wrongdoing in connection with the so-called “black ledger” but writes: “My resignation only deflected attention from the Russian collusion story for a short period of time.”</p> <p>Describing his informal advice to the Trump campaign in 2020, after four years of scandal, trial and imprisonment, he writes: “I didn’t have any prohibition against it, but I didn’t want it to become an issue.”</p> <p>He continues: “I still had no promise of a pardon, but I had an expectation. My fear was that if I got in the way of the campaign and Trump lost, he might blame me, and I did not want that to happen.”</p> <p>Trump lost to Joe Biden – an outcome Manafort, whose <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/30/who-is-paul-manafort-a-brief-timeline-of-his-political-career.html\">career</a> in politics began as a campaign worker for President Gerald Ford, puts down to Biden’s campaign understanding Trump’s limitations better than Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>But he also flirts with Trump’s lie about electoral fraud being the cause of his defeat, writing: “I believed there were patterns that were irregular. The results in battleground states were close enough that the fraud could be the difference between winning and losing.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/28/trump-chief-of-staff-john-kelly-ivanka-trump-shove-kushner-book\">Trump chief of staff ‘shoved’ Ivanka at White House, Kushner book says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After Trump lost, Manafort writes, he held off “making phone calls the day after to start working for a pardon” and instead waited on Trump.</p> <p>Manafort says the news he would be pardoned came via an intermediary, “a very good doctor friend, Ron, who is also close to Donald and Melania” and “was always one of the judges” at Miss Universe pageants when Trump ran them.</p> <p>The friend spoke to Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, who relayed the good news.

This is nothing to do with their idyllic surroundings, of course – it is simply because true-crime entertainment (TV shows, books, films and especially podcasts) has become one of the sick and twisted public’s foremost methods of relaxation.</p> <p>In fact, you would imagine a resort that offered a choose-your-own true-crime adventure would be a huge hit. Bored of endless sun, sea and sand? Investigate a cold case while sipping bottomless margaritas! Run out of conversation at your seventh consecutive family dinner? Spend the meal consolidating the evidence you have unearthed during the day!</p> <p>In The Resort (Peacock/Now), this fantasy becomes a reality – kind of. Created by Andy Siara, best known for the Andy Samberg time-loop comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/08/palm-springs-review-the-time-loop-film-is-back-again-groundhog-day\">Palm Springs</a>, and executive-produced by Mr Robot’s Sam Esmail, the show stars Cristin Milioti (How I Met Your Mother) and William Jackson Harper (The Good Place) as Emma and Noah, a pair of holidaymakers whose marriage has soured in the most mundane ways: he comments on her bad breath, she rolls her eyes at his proclivity for napping and does internet quizzes on whether to leave him.</p> <p>Their indulgent Mexican break feels slightly off from the start (in the opening scene, their taxi arrives at the hotel and duly crashes into a large plant pot, as David Byrne and Brian Eno’s Strange Overtones plays in the background), but takes an ostensible turn for the weird when Emma falls down a small ravine on a quad-biking excursion, banging her head and unearthing an old mobile. The phone, she soon discovers, belongs to a college student who went missing in 2007 from a neighbouring resort – one that was destroyed by a hurricane soon afterwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04a3e8a154e076baa0fa7f58cd89372101ea06a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04a3e8a154e076baa0fa7f58cd89372101ea06a9/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Violet (Nina Bloomgarden) Violet and Murray (Nick Offerman) in The Resort\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supernatural?

After skateboarding into a palm tree, Sam is rescued by Violet (Nina Bloomgarden), a fellow guest, who superglues his head wound together. The pair then embark on some romance-sparking sleuthing of their own. Did it lead them to their deaths?</p> <p>It is difficult, initially at least, not to think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/16/the-white-lotus-review-a-magnificently-monstrous-look-at-how-the-other-half-live\">The White Lotus</a>, Mike White’s smash-hit 2021 series about a bunch of spoilt, unhappy guests and hard-partying staff at a swanky Hawaiian hotel, which becomes the site of a brutal killing. Both shows play on the tension between opulent getaways and the murky arrangements that underpin them, although The Resort doesn’t feature nearly as much side-eyed commentary on privilege, exploitation and cultural appropriation. Both shows also meld comedy, drama and frequently horrifying mystery, yet The Resort manages to be the much goofier and more hair-raisingly menacing.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the show feels most like a spiritual successor to Palm Springs, Siara’s archly silly, mildly terrifying and intellectually satisfying 2020 romcom, which also took place at a luxury hotel and starred Milioti as a similarly sardonic wedding guest dragged into Samberg’s inflatable-based Groundhog Day timeline.</p> <p>Does time-travel factor into The Resort, too? Maybe. There is an awful lot going on in the wildly entertaining first three episodes – and the show hints there is much more to come over the remaining five. We have the amateur investigation itself, which is fast-moving yet incredibly twisty. Then there is the question of Emma’s mental state: was she this reckless before sustaining a head injury that she is medicating with non-stop booze? Most intriguingly, there are hints that Violet and the large book she carries around with her – inscribed with a message from her mother, who died the year before – are in some way imbued with supernatural forces.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/love-life-review-william-jackson-harper\">Love Life review – this deeply romantic drama portrays love impeccably</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, there is also the marital drama at the show’s centre – the linchpin of the series and also the least convincing, least compelling element of it. Although the couple’s true-crime adventure reinvigorates their marriage, their dynamic can feel a bit thin, especially if Harper’s recent starring role in the excellent dramedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/love-life-review-william-jackson-harper\">Love Life</a> – a show that studiously and sensitively unpicks one man’s romantic history – is fresh in your mind.</p> <p>But The Resort doesn’t purport to be a deep and meaningful meditation on the vagaries of love. A show like this lives or dies by how clever the mystery at its centre turns out to be. While we will have to wait to see whether it lives up to expectations, this funny, fast-paced, knotty trip seems worth sticking with until the inevitably bitter – but hopefully not bitterly disappointing – end.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/let-there-be-light-a-radically-revamped-1980s-home","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T05:00:47Z","webTitle":"Let there be light: a radically revamped 1980s home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/let-there-be-light-a-radically-revamped-1980s-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/let-there-be-light-a-radically-revamped-1980s-home","fields":{"headline":"Let there be light: a radically revamped 1980s home","trailText":"One Edinburgh couple have transformed a dark, brick-built 1980s house into a brighter, more open home. Here’s how","byline":"Caroline Ednie","body":"<p>When John and Kate Cameron were looking to downsize from their Victorian family home in a suburb of Edinburgh after their children left home, they decided to go for a real change: a 1980s brutalist-style brick house in a suburb close to the city centre.</p> <p>The couple knew and loved the house – built in 1982 by Scottish architect Douglas Abrahams for his own family, and set within a walled garden in one of the city’s most picturesque suburbs – as the previous owners were family members who had lived in it since the mid-80s. But for all its character and charm, it didn’t suit the way they lived. </p> <p>The layout, particularly ground-floor living areas, was warren-like, with compartmentalised rooms (such as the dining room and kitchen, which were separated by a serving hatch), convoluted corridors and unusual level changes. And with few windows to the south the house felt dark and smaller than it was. The bathrooms were also dated and there was a long, narrow sunroom on the first floor that wasn’t really used.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"051d3fc103b521f96092f32846812fd9d3330d55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/051d3fc103b521f96092f32846812fd9d3330d55/0_0_5017_3345/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage furniture in the living area sits happily with designer pieces, such as a sofa from Heals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vintage furniture in the living area sits happily with designer pieces, such as a sofa from Heal’s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Safro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So they decided to radically transform it. “The main idea was to modernise and adapt it without losing the feel of the original house,” says Kate. “The proportions were designed around a smaller person than John, so we removed some of the unusual level changes and stair heights. And we wanted to maximise light and views to the garden.”</p> <p>They enlisted Edinburgh-based architect <a href=\"https://www.bergmarkarchitects.co.uk/home/\" title=\"\">Jens Bergmark</a>, with whom they had worked on their previous house. “The challenge was to take care to preserve and refine the character of the house while transforming it in quite a radical way,” says Bergmark. “So, rationalising the spaces, getting rid of all the passages, corridors and cupboards, and improving the layout.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d9cd050bbe5390c607b192ff9e8e2fa0a4d5585\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d9cd050bbe5390c607b192ff9e8e2fa0a4d5585/0_50_5421_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The living area of the repurposed granny flat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The living area of the repurposed granny flat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Safro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bergmark’s solution was principally to make the house more open plan, to create a smoother flow. He lifted or lowered the floors in certain areas so that the level changes disappeared, and added an extension with an open-plan dining/kitchen area: this overlooks and encloses part of the south-facing garden, forming a sheltered L-shaped courtyard with a slabbed patio area, edge planting and a much-used pizza oven. On the first floor, the former sunroom was converted into an en suite bathroom and dressing area for the master bedroom.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s about modifying what you’ve got and not making a big statement to prove your worth</p> <footer> <cite>Jens Bergmark</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Inspiration for the interiors came from the original house, with an emphasis on exposed brick. The brick that came down in the demolition was reused to clad the new timber-frame garden extension. </p> <p>Bergmark added light oak floors, replacing the former brick floor of the lounge to soften the space, and moved original bespoke cabinets and shelving to new areas of the house, mainly the dining room, to suit the new layout. Inherited furniture, such as a set of Georgian dining chairs, combine happily with modern designer pieces including a vintage Ikea table and light fittings from <a href=\"https://www.cataloginteriors.com/\" title=\"\">Catalog Interiors</a>. They also found room for upcycled armchairs and dining chairs reupholstered by Kate.</p> <p>One of the key features of the original house was a two-storey self-contained flat to the left of the main entrance. Although connected to the main house, the small, one-bedroom pad could function as separate living quarters, with its own kitchen, living area and bathroom<strong>.</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/28/restoring-a-300-year-old-fishing-cottage-design-interiors\">‘Outside space?

This created privacy issues, so Bergmark flipped the whole granny flat upside down, with the kitchen and living room upstairs and the bedrooms downstairs, looking out of the house in the other direction, away from the main entrance. “There is a lot more privacy now,” she says.</p> <p>The flat proved extremely useful during the pandemic, when it became John’s office. “He can lock the door to it at the weekend and not go back in until Monday,” says Kate. “We also stayed in it while work was going on in the main house.” The granny flat is now self-contained accommodation for visitors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6844eb4475bb8b94a62afd17cbe3d4161ce562db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6844eb4475bb8b94a62afd17cbe3d4161ce562db/0_891_3648_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new open-plan kitchen and dining area\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new open-plan kitchen and dining area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Safro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As part of the renovation, the energy efficiency of the house has been vastly improved, with more insulation and triple-glazed windows. “Opening the house up more to the south has also increased its solar gain,” says Bergmark. “The house is so warm and efficient, light and bright,” adds Kate. “We sit outside way more than we could have imagined.”</p> <p>Not only is the house ideal for post-pandemic working, it’s also a canny example of updating and refurbishment, ultimately preserving a charming architectural curio. “This project is about a gentle touch,” says Bergmark. “It’s about modifying what you’ve got and not making a big statement. It’s not grandiose.

Not bad, really, by the standards of this hellish summer. Better than being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/24/dover-travel-chaos-eurotunnel-channel-delays\">stuck for 21 hours</a> in traffic outside Dover with a screaming toddler in the back and no loo for miles. Or sitting on the asphalt for <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11054553/American-Airlines-passengers-trapped-Charlotte-runway-six-hours-no-AC-food.html\">six hours in a heatwave</a> without food or drink, as the inmates of one American Airlines flight to New York reportedly were this week. At least I wasn’t missing a wedding or a funeral, or even (like one despairing passenger on what was meant to be our flight home) trying and failing to get back for a sister’s graduation.</p> <p>All we had to contend with was a flurry of last-minute changes to our tickets, followed by someone else’s plane breaking down on a runway in New Jersey and triggering a now woefully familiar chain reaction: delayed takeoffs, jumbo jets queueing on the tarmac unable to offload increasingly stressed passengers at the gates, a missed connection, a day and a night unexpectedly stuck at Newark airport. There’s only so much time you can kill boggling at the Donald Trump “I’ll be back!” T-shirts and Kamala Harris commemorative socks on sale in the airport gift shop.</p> <p>Still, we managed to get on to another flight the next evening, which was airborne for one hopeful hour before starting to leak hydraulic fluid somewhere over Canada, prompting a scramble back to Newark and a runway lined with emergency vehicles. The rest, to be honest, is a blur. After more than 48 hours in transit everything takes on a faintly dreamlike quality, fogged by living on a diet of airline snacks and never being sure what time it is in real life.</p> <p>Travel chaos is the ultimate in first-world problems, of course, confined to those lucky enough to afford a holiday. But if it’s a luxury complaint it’s also an illuminating one, a lens through which something may finally snap into focus. Going away in summer is the sort of thing most people take for granted. When even hopping on a Channel ferry becomes a heroic expedition against the odds, the sense of things falling apart at the seams is palpable.</p> <p>The Home Office has been failing in plain sight for years now. But when more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/20/more-than-50000-passport-applications-past-10-week-wait-mps-told\">half a million people</a> are waiting to renew their passports, these failures become impossible to hide even from those who wouldn’t ordinarily notice. Nothing brings home the reality of Brexit, meanwhile, like gridlocked motorways in Kent. Now a <a href=\"https://aviationsourcenews.com/news/airmageddon-emirates-hits-out-at-heathrow-decision-to-limit-flights/\">summer of airmageddon</a> threatens to expose some painful truths about post-pandemic working life, too.</p> <p>The never knowingly understated Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary has blamed cancelled flights on a government that “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsngZQ0W7XA\">couldn’t run a sweet shop</a>”, together with airports failing to prepare for a predictable summer rush, which feels at least partly true. Ryanair was readier than some for the lifting of travel bans; the company retained its staff through lockdown (albeit while imposing an unpopular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/01/most-ryanair-job-losses-can-be-avoided-if-staff-take-pay-cut-says-michael-oleary\">pay cut</a>), and has been visibly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62289056\">exasperated with airports</a> cancelling slots at the last minute, making it kick enraged passengers off otherwise viable flights. But this isn’t a universal story. We were told to arrive at Heathrow four hours before our flight, where we found the longest queues not at security but at woefully undermanned airline check-ins. Too many carriers who dumped their staff like hot potatoes during Covid seem surprised they haven’t come running back now it’s over. Why be loyal to bosses who showed no such care for you?</p> <p>Worldwide, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-23/400-000-jobs-lost-at-airlines-during-coronavirus-pandemic\">400,000 aviation staff</a> were fired, furloughed or warned they faced redundancy in the spring and summer of 2020. Many now show understandably little inclination to come back and bail out companies that made them feel disposable. Pilots who were leaving the RAF a few years ago for a seemingly cushier life flying civilian planes are now heading back in the opposite direction. Thanks to an unusually tight labour market, cabin crew are discovering they have options other than an industry notorious for cost-cutting (Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling-up secretary, whose constituency includes workers at Manchester airport, says she has <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk-politics/2022/07/lisa-nandy-interview-the-wigan-warrior\">heard from crew</a> taking Pot Noodles with them on stopovers because their company meal allowances no longer cover the cost of dinner when they land). Among those who did stay on board, resentment seems to be mounting. While we glumly watched the departure boards at Newark lighting up with cancellations, Lufthansa was <a href=\"https://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/national/20581040.1-000-lufthansa-flights-cancelled-staff-go-strike/\">scrapping hundreds of flights</a> through Frankfurt and Munich after staff walked out. British Airways pilots are <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/british-airways-pilots-threaten-strike-action-over-pay-deal-khdj9kzhs\">threatening to strike</a> next, over pay and conditions.</p> <p>Long before Covid-19 hit, the aviation industry had become a skin-of-the-teeth operation, operating on punishingly tight margins. At first airlines squared the circle of fierce consumer demand for cheap fares by charging for things that used to be free. Want to sit next to your own children, or take an actual suitcase with you? That’ll be extra. But lately things have taken a darker turn.<em> </em>The American Airlines’ pilots union recently <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/american-airlines-pilot-calls-faa-monitor-airlines-says-are-scheduling-rcna34978\">accused companies</a> of “trying to fly more airplanes than they can actually fly and building these schedules to an inhumane level”, prompting calls in the US for an investigation into the wider industry. If you can’t feel sorry for stranded holidaymakers, then spare a thought for short-staffed crews bearing the brunt of their anger, all while watching colleagues drop like flies in a new wave of Omicron. The captain of our aborted Newark flight was brought in off standby after the original pilot fell sick at the last minute, and when we finally took off again five hours late, it was only because the crew volunteered to extend their working day; board quickly, we were warned, or there won’t be a crew at all (there are legal limits on how long they can work without a break). Watching the exhausted-looking stewards rush through takeoff routines was the first time I’ve ever felt a twinge of nerves, rational or not, about flying.</p> <p>Memories fade almost as fast as holiday tans, so perhaps by next summer we’ll have simply forgotten what this one was like. But not everything can be shaken out as easily as sand from a beach bag, and one lasting legacy of the last few years may be a new sense of fragility: the insecurity born of feeling that loyalty isn’t rewarded, jobs are not for life, things once taken for granted can no longer be guaranteed, and something somewhere may have been hollowed out beyond repair. Fasten your seatbelts: that means turbulence ahead.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2022/jul/29/pop-iconoclast-rina-sawayama-british-japanese-pop-star-asian-identity","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-29T05:00:47Z","webTitle":"Pop iconoclast Rina Sawayama: ‘Drag is turning trauma into entertainment.

The repayments on the house she bought in the south of the city a couple of years back are “literally going to double!” she exclaims between mouthfuls of porridge. “I was like: what the fucking fuck?!”</p> <p>The cost of living crisis probably won’t be the first thing that springs to mind when you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/16/rina-sawayama-i-go-on-social-media-see-how-anxious-i-get-then-write-about-it\">dive into Sawayama’s world</a>, where arch genre-blending meets enormous choruses and rawly emotional lyrics. Yet in another sense, Sawayama’s choice of conversation topic seems fitting. The 31-year-old Cambridge graduate’s current heights – critical adoration, a Brit nomination, nearly 5 million monthly Spotify listeners – are the result of a lonely, exhausting and expensive decade-long climb up a music industry ladder that she had to build for herself. You don’t become a self-made pop powerhouse without being across the details.</p> <p>Sawayama began making music full-time at the age of 27 – “ancient for a pop artist”. She had spent her post-university years striving for success but mired in creative confusion. “I was going to lots of different producers and trying to find a sound,” she admits. Meeting producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/12/clarence-clarity-no-35\">Clarence Clarity</a> was her breakthrough moment. Clarity’s maximalist sensibilities immediately chimed with Sawayama and the pair quickly established a distinctive new sound, first showcased on her 2017 EP Rina: a fusion of 90s R&amp;B, pop-punk, industrial, 80s digital funk-rock and super-slick Y2K pop. They perfected it on her 2020 debut album, Sawayama, a wildly entertaining collection of songs that brought sax-spiked new wave, droll Eurodance, synthpop, cheesy 00s chart fodder and metal into an already mind-boggling eclectic mix.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"821592d1d9366c75f1777113fadb324d1e6a7076\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/821592d1d9366c75f1777113fadb324d1e6a7076/0_0_5399_3599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rina Sawayama at the Coachella festival in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rina Sawayama at the Coachella festival in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty Images for Coachella</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite her formidable onstage presence, Sawayama radiates matey approachability and self-effacing candour, and she is transparent about her creative tactics. By melding genres that are “out of fashion,” she says, her music sounds fresh to jaded ears. “I’m just so aware that if I’m inspired by anything that’s out there now then it’s going to make me sound dated, so I turn it on its head. Like: what’s no one doing? No one’s doing stadium rock, I’m going to do stadium rock.”</p> <p>It’s an approach that is clearly yet to run out of steam. For her brilliant forthcoming album Hold the Girl (which also bears the imprint of British super-producers Paul Epworth and Stuart Price), Sawayama has taken the same tack, this time picking “genres I don’t feel like I touched in the first record”. Official influences include Madonna’s Ray of Light and Music, Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson, “the Irish coastline” (ie the Corrs) and country music. (I can also hear trance, Mariah, Mazzy Star, math rock and Toxic-era Britney, but you might not: at some point the melange becomes a sonic magic-eye picture.)</p> <p>There’s a postmodern thinking to Sawayama’s sound that’s probably best summed up by the outfit she has on today: diamanté-encrusted Juicy Couture T-shirt, diamanté-encrusted Vivienne Westwood orb necklace, lip-liner – totems from the early 00s worn not exactly with ironic distance, but with the tacit acknowledgment that they were considered desperately un-chic just a few years ago. Many of her contrarian musical influences are also styles that were popular during her turn-of-the-millennium tweendom, and if, like me, you’re the same age as Sawayama, the cocktail she creates feels like catnip: the heady glow of tweenage wonder remixed into something funny and unexpected but also comforting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ce4e042f6c27ca80b313a4a42ee455b7b73c642\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ce4e042f6c27ca80b313a4a42ee455b7b73c642/0_0_5515_4486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sawayama posing on a red themed set\" width=\"1000\" height=\"813\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘There were things that I allowed to happen because I wanted to fit in’ … Sawayama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thurstan Redding</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not to imply that Sawayama’s appeal is age-exclusive: her debut – the bulk of which was recorded without record company support, though later released on the label Dirty Hit (Wolf Alice, the 1975) – won over swathes of listeners and critics, and was voted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/16/the-best-albums-of-2020-no-3-rina-sawayama-sawayama\">Guardian’s third-best album of 2020</a>. It was so popular, in fact, that many were confused when it wasn’t included on the Mercury prize shortlist that year.</p> <p>That’s because it didn’t qualify. Sawayama, who moved from Japan to the UK with her parents when she was five, has indefinite leave to remain but isn’t a British citizen, so she wasn’t eligible. The Brits, also run by the BPI, had the same criteria. Initially, she didn’t want to speak out for fear of seeming pushy or entitled, but then she realised that if she didn’t, she would never get the opportunity to win a mainstream award in Britain. She did an interview on the subject that garnered noisy support online. At first, there was no official response. “It felt like the silent treatment for a couple of months – but that was the risk,” says Sawayama. “It was either: I get nominated for one category [international solo artist] for the rest of my life in a country I’ve lived in for 26 years or I get blacklisted. Both not great options.” Eventually, she had a phone conversation with Ged Doherty, then British Phonographic Industry chair, who agreed to change the rules. Her first Brit nomination, in the Rising Star category, followed soon after.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekauErew4Bs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ekauErew4Bs?start=89&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=89\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video for Rina Sawayama: This Hell.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>She may still be very much on the ascent (her only singles chart success is for a collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw_Gtwdnp1Q\">Charli XCX</a>), but Sawayama has been reflecting on the slog that got her to where she is today. Not just the “hell on earth” years spent striving to establish herself while simultaneously working three part-time jobs and grappling with severe depression, but also the deeper roots of the unhappiness that cast a shadow on her 20s. While her debut was peppered with references to various ordeals (racist microaggressions; her tumultuous relationship with her mother) its follow-up shudders with trauma of a different kind.</p> <p>Sawayama doesn’t want to reveal the specific details of the experiences she drew on for Hold the Girl – partly because they are still too upsetting, and partly because she wants the album to retain the lyrical ambiguity that allows great pop to connect with listeners. She will say, however, that it mainly revolves around the misguided notions she had about sex and love as a teenager – ideas she later recognised were “so wrong – so wrapped up in trying to be accepted by other people”. She is now horrified by encounters “that I thought were relationships but were actually completely abusive. There were things that I allowed to happen because I wanted to fit in.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The songs I wrote early in my career, I wasn’t talking about anything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These experiences, she came to understand, “completely destroyed my boundaries and my idea of consent”. (On a track called Phantom, she recalls trying to win friends with “stickers and scented gel pens”, but in the end “gave a little too much away”.) In retrospect, she also felt betrayed by the adults who didn’t protect her. “We grew up in the 90s and 00s when these things were not an issue,” she says. “People didn’t care about women’s rights, people didn’t care about teenagers’ rights and people didn’t have this language to describe things that we do now.” The #MeToo movement helped her grasp what she had been through, as did the emergence of terms such as “slut-shaming” – something she later understood she had been subjected to at her all-girls school.</p> <p>In her 20s, Sawayama tried to rebuild herself after these experiences: Frankenstein is about a partner she hoped would “love me for ever, fix me right”. But that pressure meant the relationship became dysfunctional in a different sense. “I was expecting him to put me back together whilst also realising that’s not the right thing to do – I should pay for someone to do that.” So she did, beginning a form of therapy that saw her learn to “re-parent” and embrace her teenage self: hence the phrase Hold the Girl – also the title of her hypnotically catchy new single. (It also answers the question: what if Steps did UK garage?) The therapy helped her establish: “What do I want? Who do I want to be? What do I want sexually? What do I want in relationships? All those things I did not know until I was 30.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"71238d7b208c06f95dff5617c54313da8030ba64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71238d7b208c06f95dff5617c54313da8030ba64/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sawayama at a party in London in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I would blame my mother, always’ … Sawayama at a party presented by Ugg in London in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the years, Sawayama confronted another aspect of this self-denial. Hold the Girl opens with a track called Minor Feelings about how small slights can gradually create a debilitating sadness. It was named after an essay collection by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/01/cathy-park-hong-minor-feelings\">Cathy Park Hong</a>, who “writes about being Asian and having to bury a lot of feelings because you don’t feel like they matter as much to people”, she explains.</p> <p>Growing up, Sawayama didn’t know what to make of her Asian identity. When her father’s Japan Airlines job took the family to Britain in the mid-90s, the plan was always to return home, but her parents soon noticed that their daughter was “being creative and musical” and felt London was a better place to foster her talents. Shortly afterwards, they separated, and her dad returned to Japan, where Sawayama now has half-siblings.</p> <p>As a teenager, she “wanted to be British”, while her mother “represented Japan” in her mind. “I was so embarrassed by her all the time. If she pronounced something wrong, it would embarrass me, like: ‘Why can’t you speak good English? You should have become more British by now.’ I would blame her, always. If she didn’t get served quickly enough [in a shop] I was like: it’s because she’s bad at English.”</p> <p>This resentment was compounded by a claustrophobic dynamic between them. A precarious financial situation meant the pair shared a bedroom until Sawayama was 15, and she describes her mother constantly attempting to keep tabs on her escapades through rather intrusive means, including snooping on her MSN Messenger account.</p> <p>After university, the pair’s relationship broke down further. Now Sawayama can laugh about her mother’s “savage” decision to charge her £600 a month to rent her old room – “it’s very iconic actually” – but at the time felt like it meant she didn’t “love me any more”. Her mother moved back to Japan in 2016. Nowadays, they are on far better terms: partly because of the distance between them, partly because there have been frank conversations and apologies. “We got to a point in our communication where she was like: I regretted doing that, I wish I hadn’t done this so that I could have been there for you. And I was like: sorry, I was a little shit.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79693eeb56084a61b5c828fb4a667d4aa8832584\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79693eeb56084a61b5c828fb4a667d4aa8832584/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sawayama in Portugal last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The songs I wrote early in my career, I wasn’t talking about anything!’ Sawayama in Portugal last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Hold the Girl, Sawayama writes about their relationship again – this time on the bombastic yet blissful Catch Me in the Air (she wanted it to sound “like a cool breeze”; it also sounds like the Corrs covering Bon Jovi). A tribute to the pair’s fractious codependency and mutual love, it’s an empathetic, nuanced pop portrait of the mother-daughter relationship.</p> <p>Despite their differences, Sawayama’s mother always encouraged her daughter’s musical ambitions. At school, she was in a gospel choir and performed Norah Jones covers at Monday mass. In sixth form, she was in a band called Lazy Lion alongside Wolf Alice’s Theo Ellis and rapper Jelani Blackman. “I used to think I was like Fergie because he was rapping and I was singing,” she says with a laugh.</p> <p>She didn’t perform much at Cambridge, where she studied politics, psychology and sociology, but her time there proved formative. In her final year she made a circle of friends – “a bunch of queers at Queens’ College” – who helped her realise that she wasn’t straight. She never had a classic coming-out moment, she says; more a steady process of discovery aided by the group. “It was like: now that you say that, I did this and this. It was like: maybe you’re bi? And I was like: maybe I’m bi? That kind of vibe,” she says. Today, she identifies as pansexual.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Before people come up to you they look at you. I’m like: oh fuck, what do they want? What’s on my face?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That friendship group was also part of a drag scene, which helped shape Sawayama’s musical modus operandi. “I really think that fun and humour is one of the best ways to get over something, once you’ve done the emotional work,” she says. “Drag is turning trauma into humour and entertainment and that’s what I’m trying to do.”</p> <p>Recently the Londoner has been engaging in a less flamboyant style of performance. Next spring, she’ll star in the Keanu Reeves action blockbuster John Wick 4, playing a character called Akira: unsurprisingly she can reveal no details beyond the fact that she’s “the female lead”. It’s a project that will doubtless catapult Sawayama to a new level of fame; for now, she’s getting used to the relatively unobtrusive but still unsettling experience of being noticed in public. “Before people come up to you they look at you,” she says. “I’m like: oh fuck, what do they want? What’s on my face?”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/10/rina-sawayama-review-albert-hall-manchester\">Rina Sawayama review – superstar status cemented by pop’s politician</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finding success later in life has given Sawayama “perspective”, she says.

The case forms the basis for a broader challenge, asking if it is “manifestly unjust” to sentence children and young people to life sentences. </p> <p>Aphiphany Forward-Taua, executive director of criminal justice reform organisation JustSpeak, said that New Zealand’s sentencing framework for murder should be reformed, to reflect that teenagers and children didn’t have the neurological development of adults.</p> <p>“Brain development isn’t fully achieved until the age of 24,” she said.</p> <p>“In a lot of these young offender cases we see a pattern of behaviour that, in our view, correlates to the lack of neurological development … These young people unfortunately, they make these decisions, and often they don’t actually anticipate the outcome.”</p> <p>Forward-Taua said sentencing, particularly for young offenders, should be more focused on rehabilitation over punishment. </p> <p>Last year, in a joint statement, the children’s commissioner and psychology and law academics called for an end to life sentences for children, calling them “harmful and ineffective”.</p> <p>“No child or young person should be sentenced in the adult criminal justice system,” they wrote. “Punitive adult sentences, such as life imprisonment and minimum non-parole periods, should not be available for children and young persons.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
