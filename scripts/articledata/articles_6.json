Sunak pledges 20% tax cut by end of decade in last-gasp pitch to members","trailText":"Former chancellor warns party members against ‘fantasy economics’, adding voting for Truss would be ‘self-sabotage’","byline":"Jessica Elgot Chief political correspondent","body":"<p>Rishi Sunak has pledged to slash taxes by 20% by the end of the decade in a last-gasp pitch to Conservative members with the first ballots set to drop in the leadership race.</p> <p>But in one of his strongest attacks yet on the frontrunner, Liz Truss, Sunak warned party members against an “act of self-sabotage” that could cost the party the election and to be wary of major spending pledges and tax cuts which he has previously dismissed as fantasy economics.</p> <p>“I would urge them to treat with caution any vision that doesn’t involve any difficult trade offs and remember that if something sounds good to be true – then it probably is,” he said.</p> <p>Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury who worked under Sunak, said households could not afford to wait seven years. Clarke, a key ally of Truss, said: “Liz will cut taxes in seven weeks, not seven years … People are facing the biggest cost of living crisis in decades and the tax burden is at its highest level in 70 years.”</p> <p>The former chancellor made the pledge having faced internal criticism from backers for his narrative of restraint versus Truss’ tax-cutting ambitions.</p> <p>In the announcement on the day party members will begin receiving their ballots, Sunak said he would cut the basic rate of income tax to 16p by the end of the next parliament, which he said would represent the largest cut to income tax in 30 years.</p> <p>Truss – whose campaign gained the support Sunak’s replacement as chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, on Sunday night – has said she will cut taxes “on day one” of becoming prime minister. She pledged to reverse the national insurance rise pushed through by Sunak in the Treasury as well as halting the planned corporation tax rise next year, another Sunak proposal.</p> <p>Sunak has said he will cut income tax by 1% from 2024 – a pledge made as chancellor – but said his number one priority is to tackle inflation and getting borrowing under control.</p> <p>But on Monday he said he would go further should the Conservatives win re-election in 2024, and cut income tax down to 16p – costing around £6bn a year.</p> <p>Sunak called the pledge “the biggest income tax cut since Margaret Thatcher’s government” and said it was a realistic promise in the current economic climate.</p> <p>“I will never get taxes down in a way that just puts inflation up,” he said, promising to “always be honest about the challenges we face.”</p> <p>In a coded attack on Truss, Sunak said the party’s future in power was in peril. “Winning this leadership contest without levelling with people about what lies ahead would not only be dishonest – it would be an act of self-sabotage that condemns our party to defeat at the next general election and consigns us to a long period in opposition.</p> <p>“I would urge them to treat with caution any vision that doesn’t involve any difficult trade-offs and remember that if something sounds too good to be true – then it probably is.”</p> <p>Sunak’s campaign said the 1p cuts would be paid for by increased Treasury receipts via projected economic growth forecasted by the Office for Budgetary Responsibility. But the UK is still projected to experience the lowest growth in the G20 – apart from Russia – and have the worst growth in the G7 at around 0.5%.</p> <p>A Truss campaign source called the pledge “another U-turn” following Sunak’s previous pledge to cut VAT on energy bills – a policy he rejected in office.</p> <p>“He has also made it conditional on getting growth first – knowing full well that his corporation tax rises are contractionary,” the source said. “The public and Conservative party members can see through these flip-flops and U-turns.” Sunak’s campaign hit back saying it was “not a u-turn” and consistent with his pledge to “grip inflation, grow the economy and then cut taxes”.</p> <p>Truss will spend today in the south-west with a pledge to remove further regulation on farming – without giving further specifics – but promising also a short-term expansion to the seasonal workers scheme.</p> <p>MPs backing Sunak have privately voiced fears that he will not have time to regain public momentum before members begin voting in the coming days. Though the contest is set to run until September, the majority of members are likely to cast their ballots in the coming days immediately after they are received.</p> <p>MPs who have canvassed constituents say they believe the race is much closer than the public polling picture has suggested so far – polls by YouGov of Tory members put Truss more than 20 points ahead of her rival.</p> <p>But backers of Sunak pointed to a poll of Tory councillors by Savanta ComRes which put Truss on 31% and Sunak on 29%. Around 32% were still undecided.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One MP in a south-eastern seat said the councillor polling was “a much better indication of things” and there was a significant amount to play for. “In my constituency Rishi is 60/40 ahead. And they love him in home counties, that is where the huge bulk of members are, in [the] north there are barely any members.”</p> <p>One senior MP backing Sunak who had contacted over half of their members said they were struck by the numbers of undecideds. “The Truss vote is soft and quite easily persuadable,” they said, saying MPs needed to do more “old fashioned, one-to-one lobbying” if Sunak was to have a chance.</p> <p>Another who had polled their members said the vote was “neck-and-neck – and very soft.” The MP said: “The YouGov polls are normally accurate – I think Liz will win but I don’t think it’s all over.”</p> <p>Labour said the final pledges from the candidates were emblematic of a culture “favouring headlines, stunts and division, over practical policy plans”. A spokesman said: “As the ballots drop Conservative members will make their choice but the sooner the whole country gets one, the better. Britain needs a fresh start with Labour.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/31/pep-guardiola-backs-manchester-city-to-be-ready-premier-league-defence","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T21:30:05Z","webTitle":"Pep Guardiola backs Manchester City to be ready for Premier League defence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/pep-guardiola-backs-manchester-city-to-be-ready-premier-league-defence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/31/pep-guardiola-backs-manchester-city-to-be-ready-premier-league-defence","fields":{"headline":"Pep Guardiola backs Manchester City to be ready for Premier League defence","trailText":"The manager brushed off defeat to Liverpool in the Community Shield and backed his side to respond in the league","byline":"Jamie Jackson","body":"<p>Pep Guardiola is confident Manchester City will challenge for the title despite the attritional effort required to be champions in four of the past five years.</p> <p>Guardiola’s squad has a core of 12 players who have all been part of at least three triumphant teams since the 2016-17 campaign: Kyle Walker, Kevin De Bruyne, Rúben Dias, John Stones, Ederson, Bernardo Silva, Aymeric Laporte, João Cancelo, Ilkay Gündogan, Rodri, Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez.</p> <p>The manager has previously praised their ability to maintain the mental and physical edge to achieve this.

But it fails to ask basic questions about the real victim – the man he killed","byline":"Stuart Jeffries","body":"<p>“I don’t think I am a murderer,” says ex-Royal Marine sergeant Alexander Blackman. “I don’t think I was a murderer. I am not a murderer.”</p> <p>But if what Blackman did in a field in Afghanistan almost 11 years ago doesn’t make him a murderer, what is he? On 15 September 2011, after a firefight, Blackman and two other marines from J Company walked across the field to the injured body of a Taliban fighter who had earlier attacked a military checkpoint. The insurgent had been hit by some of 139 anti-tank bullets fired from an Apache helicopter but was still alive.</p> <p>According to the Geneva conventions, Sgt Blackman should have treated the enemy as one of his own and summoned a helicopter to carry the man to hospital. Such an action must require a heroic moral compass on the battlefield: hard indeed to save the life of someone who 30 minutes earlier was bent on taking yours.</p> <p>Instead, head-cam footage shown in this gripping if too narrowly focused documentary reveals what happened next. Blackman shot the injured man at point-blank range. He is heard saying: “Shuffle off this mortal coil, you cunt. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.” After killing the man, he said to his men: “I have just broke [sic] the Geneva convention.”</p> <p>Soon after, the cover-up began. Some marines saw the headcam footage before being ordered to delete it. But the Royal Military Police, who investigated the killing, managed to forensically reconstitute it. As a result, he was charged with murder in 2012.</p> <p>Blackman told investigators the man was dead when he fired the bullets. That was what he meant when he said he had broken the Geneva conventions: desecrating a corpse is outlawed, too. The retrieved footage showed otherwise and in 2013 the man known then only as Marine A became the first member of the UK armed forces in recent history to be convicted of battlefield murder. In jail in Lincoln, he says, he feared attacks from Islamist-sympathising inmates.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Maybe the Afghanistan veterans who did not suffer from adjustment disorder are the ones we should worry about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Much of War and Justice: The Case of Marine A (Channel 4) investigates why he wound up there. When Blackman shot the insurgent, psychiatrist Neil Greenberg tells us, he was suffering from adjustment disorder, a condition the professor estimates affected a quarter of British forces personnel who served in Afghanistan, and which manifests as anxiety, depression, distressing emotions and disturbing conduct.</p> <p>It’s amazing that that proportion is so low. Given that the daily risk for soldiers on patrol in Afghanistan was getting a bullet in the brain or losing their legs by stepping on an improvised explosive device – not to mention the growing sense of the utter pointlessness of their mission underlined here by Blackman and his fellow marines – the figure could have been 100% and be unsurprising. Maybe the Afghanistan veterans who did not suffer from adjustment disorder are the ones we should worry about. Blackman, who told the Guardian two years ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/18/i-wasnt-aware-i-was-suffering-marine-a-talks-about-troops-mental-health\">he didn’t realise</a> what mental state he was in at the time of the killing, also had his personal demons: he was mourning the recent death of his father, a fellow serviceman.</p> <p>Greenberg’s testimony was used in Marine A’s successful 2017 appeal to have his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/28/marine-a-alexander-blackman-released-from-prison\">conviction reduced to manslaughter</a> on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He is now living under licence in Taunton with his wife, Claire, who campaigned against his murder conviction.</p> <p>Claire says she was never a supporter of the war. Fair enough, but it would have been interesting for her husband’s views to be probed. Did he think the oxymoronic “war on terror” was worth fighting when he was in Afghanistan? And now?</p> <p>If not a murderer, then what is Blackman? A killer no doubt, but perhaps also a victim of a war that achieved nothing worthwhile but left 457 British service personnel dead while, according to Brown University’s estimates, about 240,000 Afghans, 70,000 of them civilians, died. But let’s not overemphasise his victimhood: he gets hugged by strangers in the street; the man killed, in this programme at least, isn’t even given a name.</p> <p>This documentary, though compelling, is remiss in not considering the real victim. “Nobody seems to worry about him,” said Jeff Blackett, the judge who presided over Blackman’s first trial. “That was a man who might have been spared but was killed.” We don’t find out what happened to his corpse. A stronger programme would have tried to track down his family and comrades and asked what they thought about how he died.

Yet on a wild and discombobulating night in Birmingham he suffered surely the biggest shock in Commonwealth Games history as he finished fourth in the men’s 100m breaststroke final.</p> <p>Fourth! This was swimming’s equivalent of Buster Douglas knocking out Mike Tyson. Of the US soccer team defeating England in the 1950 World Cup. A moment when everything we thought we knew about a sport was picked up and spun discordantly off its axis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/commonwealth-games-cycling-matt-walls-matthew-bostock-hospital-crash-involving-crowd\">Laura Kenny calls for bigger barriers at velodromes after Walls’ horror crash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was mighty close - with England’s James Wilby taking gold in 59.25, ahead of Australia’s Zac Stubblety-Cook (59.52) and Sam Williamson (59.82). Peaty, meanwhile, came home in 59.86 - three seconds outside his world record.</p> <p>True, Peaty had arrived at Birmingham looking dangerously undercooked following a fractured foot in May that left him in a boot and behind schedule. Yet after victories in his heat and semi-final here, no one expected this. Not when Petty had never lost a 100m race in his senior career.</p> <p>“It took a broken foot to get it away from me,” said Peaty. “But I chose to fight.”</p> <p>He did. And he went out valiantly on his shield.</p> <p>Initially everything looked to be going to script as Peaty led at 20 metres and began his familiar surge at 30. But this time there was no muscular separation from the pack. At the turn the 27-year-old still led, but only by 0.13 sec, and his pursuers sensed blood.</p> <p>Peaty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/06/adam-peaty-swimmer-olympics-tokyo-interview-faces-of-year\">so long swimming’s ultimate Alpha male</a>, tried to hold them off but with 25m remaining he began to be swallowed up. First Wilby passed him. Then Stubblety-Cook. Before, right at the finish, Williamson ripped the bronze away from him too.</p> <p>“I felt really good to 50m,” admitted Peaty. “I just don’t know what went wrong. With 25m to go I had nothing in the tank. I felt good, but it’s two seconds slower than the Olympics. There’s something obviously gone majorly wrong in that cycle.”</p> <p>Intriguingly Peaty also talked of a ‘major reset,’ before adding: “There’s obviously a lot going wrong in my training programme. But sometimes when you don’t race all season it bites you when it matters.”</p> <p>This was his first 100m breaststroke defeat since moving to the senior ranks in 2014, during which time he has hoovered up three Olympic gold, eight world titles and nearly two dozen European and Commonwealth medals.</p> <p>For good measure he also holds all of the top 20 times in history - with no one else breaking 58 seconds and has also shattered 14 world records to boot. Yet none of that mattered on this crazy night in Birmingham.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0ebf659ee1b4647109adfcc12e1c41f206d2204\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0ebf659ee1b4647109adfcc12e1c41f206d2204/0_8_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Alice Tai won gold six months after her right leg was amputated below the knee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Alice Tai won gold six months after her right leg was amputated below the knee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Goode/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It was a very slow final for me,” said Peaty, who will now go again in the heats of the 50m on Monday. “I can’t even remember when I went that slow. Of course it’s a shock. Of course it’s disappointing but that’s where you have those moments to go faster next time.”</p> <p>Wilby, meanwhile, rightfully revelled in his stunning upset. “I’m overwhelmed and amazed,” he said. “I’ve always chased him. He’s a phenomenal athlete and he’ll probably kick me in the arse later in the calendar. But I’m proud of that.” And so he should be.</p> <p>Meanwhile there was more success for England in the S8 100m backstroke as Alice Tai took gold in 1:13.64, six months after having her right leg amputated below the knee due to a worsening of her clubfoot.</p> <p>There was also a bronze for England in the 4x200m freestyle relay behind Australia who stormed to gold with a new world record time of 7:39.29 and Canada, who took silver.</p> <p>Earlier in the evening the South African Chad Le Clos broke the record for most Commonwealth Games medals - 18 - as he took silver in a thrilling men’s 200m butterfly.</p> <p>The 30-year-old was leading until the final 20 metres when he was overtaken by Lewis Clareburt who came through to win in 1:55.60. England’s James Guy took bronze.</p> <p>However Clos, who has won his 18 medals across three Commonwealth Games, was not too disappointed. “We both knew what each other would do but fair play to Lewis,” he said. “It is always kill or be killed when I race.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/01/morning-mail-property-prices-tumble-alarming-gas-shortfall-emma-mckeon-makes-history","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T20:59:24Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: property prices tumble, ‘alarming’ gas shortfall, Emma McKeon makes history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/01/morning-mail-property-prices-tumble-alarming-gas-shortfall-emma-mckeon-makes-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/01/morning-mail-property-prices-tumble-alarming-gas-shortfall-emma-mckeon-makes-history","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: property prices tumble, ‘alarming’ gas shortfall, Emma McKeon makes history","trailText":"<strong>Monday:</strong> Five of the country’s eight capitals are reporting house price falls on par with the start of the GFC.

We are European champions’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the end Germany will feel that, sometimes, fate and fortune are simply not on your side. They have tended to expertly steer clear of such a conclusion, whether at this level or any other, down the years but thoughts will inevitably turn to the cruellest of pre-match twists.</p> <p>This had been Popp’s summer: she had been its best striker and, after she had overcome a succession of cruelly timed injuries to perform with an enthralling vigour and panache, a fairytale writer with little regard for host‑nation headiness would have offered the ending she had craved for an entire career.</p> <p>Instead she cut a distraught figure after pulling out with a muscle injury in the warmup and there was an impression, even before a ball had been kicked, that Germany’s narrative had run out of road. Perhaps, if those away fans had collectively closed their eyes and wished hard enough, the match might have run to penalties and Popp, dragging herself off the bench, might have slotted in the winner. But reality painted a less romantic picture, even though Martina Voss‑Tecklenburg will feel her team were by no means inferior on the night.</p> <p>At an earlier point in the post‑match euphoria, Sarina Wiegman’s players were belting out Sweet Caroline in a long line facing the seats occupied by their friends and family. Halfway down the other end of the pitch, their beaten opponents leaned in to a huddle. Voss-Tecklenburg, the coach whose calm authority shone through in this tournament, stood at its centre and for a moment her players straightened up.</p> <p>Germany had slumped to the floor as one upon the full-time whistle as if drowned by the tide of white-and-red emotion around them. Defeat in a European Championship final would hurt anyone; here the pain came with an extra sting. No German side had fallen short after getting this far, and then there was the fact they had done so in such a storied fixture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63f8d10969be5cb2667d0345bf2de1a6d087ad6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63f8d10969be5cb2667d0345bf2de1a6d087ad6e/0_240_3672_2203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chloe Kelly pounces to score the winning goal for England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chloe Kelly pounces to score the winning goal for England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soon enough there was cause to walk taller. The loud ovation Germany received upon collecting their runners-up medals spoke beautifully of the good-natured spirit in which this entire competition has been contested but it also told a further truth. This is an outstanding side that stretched England to the limit in a tense, taut, nervy and sometimes tetchy final, dictating much of the game and not deserving to lose. For the home side, joy was heightened by the knowledge victories come no more hard-earned than this.</p> <p>Popp’s absence was telling at times, particularly when Germany failed to capitalise on a succession of inviting positions before Lina Magull’s smart leveller. There was a moment when Giulia Gwinn, their superb right-back, marauded into the area and arrowed a waist‑high cross that evaded Sydney Lohmann; it took little effort to imagine Popp flinging herself gladiatorially at the ball and making sure.</p> <p>There had also been cruel luck in the continued absence of Klara Bühl, the flying winger out with Covid-19, and at times it was not hard to wonder what their first‑choice attack might have achieved when the screw was turned. The substitute Nicole Anyomi – tall, strong, quick and technically excellent with it – made a difference, though, and nobody would seriously suggest this squad is anything but deep in ability.</p> <p>Those absences might make German hearts look back more fondly but, on the pitch, this game was decided by two moments when things went askew. Ella Toone’s opener was sublimely taken but followed a long stoppage for injuries to Marina Hegering and Beth Mead, England reacting the quicker.</p> <p>The winner by Chloe Kelly, who may not have had the chance to seize on confusion at a corner if the commanding Hegering had not been substituted halfway through extra time, came shortly after a curious sequence in which the keeper Merle Frohms sidefooted away a speculative shot from Toone. In these small episodes, the focus and application that marked an otherwise super‑assured performance appeared to waver. Most teams would let you get away with it; England are not most teams.</p> <p>So Germany lick their wounds, but anyone zooming out will consider how important their sweat and tears were to the success of this occasion. A record crowd, a booming television viewership and a captive audience of new fans needed to see an event of this intensity: a physical, technical tussle played at a rattling pace by two heavyweights who both showed up on the night.</p> <p>It takes a pair of marvellous football teams to make a final truly worth winning. Popp, for one, may take some convincing of such consolation but Germany contributed thrillingly to the sense women’s football will only soar in one direction from here.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/31/sarina-wiegman-it-was-so-tight-but-who-cares-we-are-european-champions","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T20:36:18Z","webTitle":"Sarina Wiegman: ‘It was so tight but who cares?

In front of 87,000 fans at the home of English football, the Lionesses battled past Germany to lift their first major trophy, rewriting the history books. In both a gruelling and magical afternoon, England edged to a 2-1 win in extra time, calling on every ounce of energy left.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report\">England crowned Euro 2022 champions after Kelly sinks Germany in extra time</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Wiegman described her team’s historic feat as “unbelievable”. “I’ve lost my voice a little bit,” she continued. “I think what we’ve done is really incredible. I’m so proud of the team. I think I need a couple of days to realise what we’ve done.”</p> \n<p>The England manager, having been appointed less than 12 months ago, masterminded yet another victory for her team. England remain unbeaten under her, the 18th victory of the 20 games she’s been in charge.</p> \n<p>Known for her ruthlessness and high standards, her second-half substitutes proved the difference as they have so often this tournament. In a game of close margins, every small detail counted in the narrowest of encounters.</p> \n<p>“It was so tight but who cares,” Wiegman said. “We won 2-1 and we are European champions. If you really want to win and become better every single day, that’s what I have noticed the whole year. It’s been incredible. We agreed a couple of things on behaviours, they weren’t just words, we lived it. And this is the result.”</p> \n<p>Over the past three weeks, the resilience of this England side has been clear to see, and it was required in abundance. It was a contest that threatened to boil over at times, with a raft of tenacious challenges from both sides. With half an hour to go in normal time, the Lionesses took the lead in sublime fashion. Keira Walsh picked out the run of Ella Toone with her trademark vision. The substitute, only on the pitch for a few minutes, lifted a sweetly struck lob over Merle Frohms in the Germany goal.</p> \n<p>Alessia Russo, her England and Manchester United teammate, had every confidence as she watched Toone break the defensive line. “As soon as she got put through, I knew it was going in the back of the net,” she said. “That’s because she can do it on the biggest stage of all.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f038d51eeab0c66806f1ca33b82a9c2d65b99ef5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f038d51eeab0c66806f1ca33b82a9c2d65b99ef5/0_110_3316_1990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leah Williamson is given the Euro 2022 trophy by the president of Uefa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leah Williamson is given the Euro 2022 trophy by the president of Uefa.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The drama was only just beginning. Germany struck a late blow to English hearts as Lina Magull proved deadly once more in front of goal. However, the Lionesses rallied in extra time when substitute Chloe Kelly remained alert after a corner to fire home the winner with 10 minutes to play, her first goal for her country.</p> \n<p>“This is what dreams are made of,” she said. “As a young girl watching women’s football and now this, it’s unbelievable. These girls are special, the manager is special, and what a special group of staff. This is amazing. All my family are in the crowd. My mum, all my brothers, my sister, all my nephews, everyone. I just want to celebrate.”</p> \n<p>Leah Williamson was equally delighted, lifting the trophy for her country in the first year of her captaincy. “It’s the proudest moment of my life – until the day I have kids I suppose. I am going to lap it up,” she gushed. “Every single piece of advice I got was to take every single second in because you’re going to want to relive it over and over and I’ll be reliving that for a long time.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"028b60ae-f054-44ba-b1c7-2ab5ddd6efaa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NbbDN31jmZw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Williamson had a special word for the younger generation of players who, along with her, have achieved something never done before. “With something like this,” she said, “we talk and talk, and we have finally done it.

We’ve brought everyone together. We’ve got people to come to games and we want them to come to WSL games, but the legacy of this team is winners and this is the start of the journey.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2022/jul/31/england-win-germany-euro-2022-only-beginning-for-women-game","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T20:34:08Z","webTitle":"England’s win against Germany is only the beginning for the women’s game | Jonathan Liew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jul/31/england-win-germany-euro-2022-only-beginning-for-women-game","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/jul/31/england-win-germany-euro-2022-only-beginning-for-women-game","fields":{"headline":"England’s win against Germany is only the beginning for the women’s game","trailText":"Football was an intrinsic part of the nation’s identity for years while women were excluded.

The second is a journey with no maps, no driver and no end in sight.</p> \n<p>For more than 150 years football has been an intrinsic part of this nation’s culture and lifestyle, a form of identity, a unit of social currency. And yet for most of that time women have been excluded from this club and its perks: shouted down and shut out. The last time England’s men lifted a major trophy, the 1966 World Cup, women were banned from playing competitive football in any form. Now, against the same opponents in the same stadium, English football – all of it, not just half – has ascended to the very top step of the podium.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Moving the Goalposts, our weekly women’s football newsletter.\"> \n <iframe id=\"moving-the-goalposts\" name=\"moving-the-goalposts\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/moving-the-goalposts\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--moving-the-goalposts\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up for Moving the Goalposts, our weekly women’s football newsletter.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is a team adored and revered in equal measure, relatable and humble but primarily athletes of the most viciously competitive quality. It is a team of many stars and none: tournament top scorer Beth Mead, goalkeeper Mary Earps, captain Williamson, and rising stars Alessia Russo and Lauren Hemp are world-class in their positions but ultimately submitting their talent to the collective in the way of all great sides. They play with verve and pace and guts; lead and advocate in the way we wished our politicians did; celebrate the same way any of us would.

Germany were brilliant and resilient, perhaps even the better team over 120 minutes, despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jul/31/alexandra-popps-warmup-woes-rob-her-of-fairytale-finish-with-germany\">late withdrawal of their lethal striker</a> Alexandra Popp. Once the usual pre-match superfluities had been dispensed with, a game of rare antagonism and ill-temper broke out, with flying challenges, bruising aerial tussles and a mutual grudge that felt too visceral to be confected.</p> \n<p>Chances were few, but the best of them fell to Germany. Earps was at her inspired best in the England goal, saving from Tabea Wassmuth in the first half, Lina Magull in the second and plucking countless dangerous crosses out of the air. And so, with the game still gridlocked and deadlocked, Wiegman predictably turned to her bench. On came the Manchester United pair of Russo and Ella Toone, opening the game up, giving England an injection of pace and elasticity they so badly needed.</p> \n<p>An hour in came perhaps the game’s only real moment of clarity: the fragment of master calligraphy daubed onto the door of a pub toilet. Keira Walsh played a delightful long ball into the stride of Toone, who opted for guile rather than power, lifting the ball in a delicate arc over Merle Frohms and into the net. For decades Germany has derided the English style of football as mere “kick and rush”. This was a perfect retort: a sublime long kick, and a rush that felt like nothing else on earth.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c32ed099344a5df164d79dd733ad2450d88263fd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c32ed099344a5df164d79dd733ad2450d88263fd/0_27_4108_2465/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the England team celebrates winning Euro 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A simple and unremarkable vision of what sport can be’ … the England team celebrate winning Euro 2022.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With 11 minutes of normal time remaining, the superb Magull burgled a deserved equaliser, slamming home Tabea Wassmuth’s finish at the near post after some watery England defending. Naturally this was a moment ripe for some traditional English fatalism. Instead, Williamson simply adjusted her socks and walked back to the centre circle. And there is a restlessness and a stubbornness to this England team that sets it apart from its forebears.</p> \n<p>Knock them down and they simply hit you harder, stronger, more resentfully.</p> \n<p>And yet as extra-time leaked away, the deadweight of penalties loomed like an open casket. With 15 minutes remaining, Germany looked the fitter and better side. But as Hemp swung in a corner, for once the impregnable German set-piece machine developed a kink. Lucy Bronze won the header, Chloe Kelly of Manchester City swung at the loose ball and, at the second time of asking, scraped it desperately over the line: a goal of the utmost ugliness to generate a moment of almost crystalline beauty.</p> \n<p>There was a moment a few seconds before the end when England realised they were going to win. The substitutes were standing on the touchline, the crowd was on its feet, and yet none of them was empowered to do anything but watch and hope. And in a sense this was the perfect metaphor for women’s football itself, a game that for decades has always been on the cusp of something, some distant promise over the next horizon, a tomorrow that always seemed to get closer without ever actually arriving.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"028b60ae-f054-44ba-b1c7-2ab5ddd6efaa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NbbDN31jmZw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tomorrow arrived with a referee’s whistle. And as England celebrated, the tableau that greeted us at Wembley would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. Women commentating on television. Women tapping away in the press box. Women officiating, women coaching on the touchline, women bellowing in the stands. Over the last few weeks these sights have become normalised because they are, in fact, normal. The crowds will disperse. The wall of noise will dissolve. But this legacy will remain: a nation slowly being rewired to expect different, to expect better.</p> \n<p>Night was falling as England’s players continued their revelry on a silver ocean of tickertape. Here was a simple and unremarkable vision of what sport can be, which also acted as a rueful and wistful vision of what sport could have been all these years had the game’s administrators and custodians valued women beyond their ability to bear children and serve tea.</p> \n<p>There is still plenty to be done. This is not a perfect game because football is not a perfect sport.

The kiss at the time was considered a forward-looking move on the part of the actors, as well as Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and the network that broadcast the show, NBC.</p> \n<p>The episode in question, titled Plato’s Stepchildren, aired in 1968 and was fashioned in a way that gave those involved something of an out from any potential discriminatory backlash: Uhura and Kirk did not choose to kiss but were instead made to do so after being inhabited by aliens.</p> \n<p>Roddenberry had reportedly insisted on an integrated crew for Starship Enterprise – a bold move given that interracial marriage was still illegal in 17 US states.

After 30 games and 92 goals only England and Germany remain. The old foes reignite a rivalry and both bid for glory. Germany are aiming to reclaim the trophy they have lifted eight times before and they want to be back on top of bowing out in the quarter-finals in 2017. It is a different story for the Lionesses, they have never won the title but today they have the perfect stage in which to do so. <br> England v Germany will be played at the home of English football, Wembley Stadium, with an expected 87,000 fans in attendance. If they record that many supporters the match will become the most attended Euros final ever - men or women’s. It’s been a ground-breaking tournament across the board, attendance and broadcast records have been smashed with women’s footballers becoming household names across the board. Speaking of stars there will be a particular focus on two in today’s final who are battling for more than the tournament trophy. Germany’s Alexandra Popp and England’s Beth Mead are level in the Golden Boot standings with six goals a piece. Popp has scored in every match of Germany’s campaign, coming off the bench in their first match against Denmark with an impressive performance which has sealed her spot in the starting XI. Mead, on the other hand, has started every match and has been the difference when England needed it. She scored the only goal of their opener against Austria and she got the scoring underway in their semi-final against Sweden. If neither forward scores today the Golden Boot will go to Mead as she has more assists than Popp. We will find out if both start, it would be a shock if either didn’t, soon with the team news imminent!<strong> Kick-off coming at 5pm.</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/jul/31/commonwealth-games-2022-cycling-gymnastics-and-swimming-on-day-three-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T20:04:34Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Games 2022: cycling crash mars day three action – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/31/commonwealth-games-2022-cycling-gymnastics-and-swimming-on-day-three-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/jul/31/commonwealth-games-2022-cycling-gymnastics-and-swimming-on-day-three-live","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Games 2022: cycling crash mars day three action – as it happened","trailText":"Matt Walls’ dramatic crash in the velodrome overshadowed the day but he is thankfully fine","byline":"Luke McLaughlin  and Rob Bleaney (earlier), Will Unwin (now)","body":"<div id=\"block-62e6dfdd8f08730a1f7f4d9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-31T20:04:34.606Z\">9.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Thanks for joining me today. </strong>The blog will be back tomorrow! </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62e6dfca8f08730a1f7f4d9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-31T20:02:32.640Z\">9.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>What a day for McKeon.</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/emma-mckeon-becomes-most-successful-commonwealth-games-athlete-with-11th-gold-medal\">Emma McKeon becomes most successful Commonwealth Games athlete with 11th gold medal</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62e6de578f08af33ff4a4aa6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-31T19:59:37.302Z\">8.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">James Wilby wins 100m breaststroke gold</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What a swim from Englishman Wilby.

The rider is also being attended to by medics.</p> <p>The two Canadian riders are being disqualified, although Chris Boardman thinks that is for riding off the track, rather than causing the crash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TeamEngland/status/1553709823417634817\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thoughts are with all the riders involved in the crash in the velodrome.<br><br>🙏</p>&mdash; Team England (@TeamEngland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamEngland/status/1553709823417634817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 31, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-31T11:57:49.514Z\">at 12.57pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62e66bbd8f08af33ff4a46df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-31T11:48:56.699Z\">12.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Track cycling: </strong>There has been a worryingly huge, high-speed crash in a men’s race on the track in London which several riders were involved in.

Brotheron and Chris Boardman both sound very concerned as to the condition of the athletes ... let’s all hope they are (relatively) unscathed.

Staggered polling began across PNG in July, but delays as well as failures in the electoral roll, which has not been updated in a decade, has seen up to a million people disenfranchised. On top of this, there have been allegations of voter fraud, and missing ballots have fuelled distress, rumours and violence, with the United Nations warning of dozens killed and thousands displaced. Writs were due on Friday but have now been extended to 12 August to avoid a failed election.</p> <h2>‘We want to break that slavery’</h2> <p>As tensions escalate around the disrupted and disputed counting, Peter is one of only a handful of women still in contention, running in second place against a powerful incumbent.</p> <p>Meanwhile, counting started late and is very slow in the Madang Rai Coast seat where Kessy Sawang, another highly fancied female contender, is leading.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/02/papua-new-guinea-election-whats-at-stake\">Papua New Guinea election: what’s at stake? </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sawang, like Peter, quit the security of high public office in Port Moresby to contest her home seat in 2017. A former treasury official and deputy commissioner of the PNG customs service, she has a better understanding than most of the wealth being shipped out of her country. Her campaign is motivated, she says, by anger and sadness.</p> <p>The Chinese-owned $2.1bn Ramu Nickel mine’s processing plant sits on the Madang Rai Coast right next to the village where Sawang grew up, and yet her community has no electricity, no medicines and only seasonal road access. The provincial capital is a two-hour dinghy ride away with kind conditions and a big outboard. But “the sea is our graveyard”, Sawang says. “We have lost many family members to sea piracy, to bad weather.” Her own boat was captured two years back.</p> <p>Like Peter, she raises water carrying – her daily chore growing up – as a reality and metaphor for female constraint. Sawang has enlisted volunteer engineers to design village water projects – the plans are ready.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e46d62c62db73834258757675636ee9bfd8534a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e46d62c62db73834258757675636ee9bfd8534a7/0_246_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poster for Kessy Sawang for the Madang Rai coast seat hangs in her village\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster for Kessy Sawang for the Madang Rai coast seat hangs in her village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Godfreeman Kaptigau/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We tell the women, when you give birth to a girl, you are giving her a lifetime job of carrying water.

If the government can provide free condoms, why not these?</p> <p>Water also preoccupies Matilda Koma, 55, running for the fifth time, although her concern is with water quality. She trained as an analytical chemist, and then in process engineering. Then in 2000 an Australian gold mining company <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s113011.htm\">accidentally dropped one tonne of cyanide from a helicopter</a> into jungle near the headwaters serving her community. And so began her journey into environmental monitoring, social justice activism and politics.</p> <p>“Because of that I went out and started to campaign,” she says. “Those who lived by the rivers deserted their homes,” she says. “No one told them, but they saw fish floating down the river.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/violence-in-the-png-elections-is-the-result-of-broken-systems-that-australia-cannot-ignore\">Violence in the PNG elections is the result of broken systems that Australia cannot ignore | Miranda Forsyth and Gordon Peake</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This trio – Peter, Sawang, Koma – reflects the high calibre of women standing in 2022, many far better qualified for leadership than the men they hope to unseat, observes their mentor, Dame Carol Kidu.</p> <p>Australian-born Kidu, 74, is one of the seven women who has served in the PNG parliament, and she’s been ploughing hope and energy into ensuring this election there will be – at least – an eighth.</p> <p>For many years, much of the bandwidth supporting women’s political representation in PNG has been preoccupied with educating and training the candidates. But the candidates are not the major problem, she argues.</p> <p>Kidu’s focus has been on community education, challenging perceptions of women’s capacity and claim for leadership, which in PNG often becomes entangled in references to culture and tradition. After corruption, culture is the obstacle most preoccupying the half a dozen women candidates interviewed in depth by the Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0199d661aa08f04804df73d56fdc7e558156612a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0199d661aa08f04804df73d56fdc7e558156612a/0_113_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dame Carol Kidu in Port Moresby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dame Carol Kidu has run community awareness workshops promoting votes for women.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Godfreeman Kaptigau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When they put up their hands to enter PNG’s male-dominated power systems, women confront resistance, hostility and sometimes violence. “Women shy away from running for elections because of this mindset that it is for men only,” says Sawang. But heading into this election, she’s seen up close how a little education can seed powerful shifts.</p> <p>Across 2021 Kidu, well known across PNG after serving three terms in parliament, got on the road to conduct more than 40 “Vote Women for Change” community awareness workshops in eight electorates where women who polled well in 2017 were standing again.</p> <p>Part of a women in leadership program co-funded by the Australian National University and the Australian government, the workshops pick up one of the key recommendations from close analysis of the 2017 experience: to educate voters in basic civics and voting processes, and begin changing community attitudes towards women’s political leadership.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/06/png-prime-minister-denies-connection-to-suitcase-full-of-cash-found-as-voting-starts\">PNG prime minister denies connection to suitcase full of cash found as voting starts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Addressing grassroots audiences, Kidu used storytelling to explain how government works. She enlisted the analogy of the Bird of Paradise, “our emblem, and how it has two wings. And we have only one wing – the men– and we can’t fly.” She showed charts from Rwanda – “a Black country” – showing health and education indexes going up and corruption going down since women there gained political power.</p> <p>“I try to separate in their minds that women candidates are not challenging the <em>hausman</em> [men’s house] concept,” says Kidu, referring to traditional village authority systems. “We talk about how that concept was transferred to the house of parliament – which has nothing to do with custom.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99a3914b4ff0d7d0a960c9ddcc926c65dcf07f8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99a3914b4ff0d7d0a960c9ddcc926c65dcf07f8e/0_334_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moresby North-East candidate Tania Bale begins the process to cast her vote at the Gordons International School in Port Moresby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moresby North-East candidate Tania Bale begins the process to cast her vote at the Gordons International School in Port Moresby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Godfreeman Kaptigau/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Candidates like Peter continue the conversation in their campaigns. “Our culture is important, and when we go home of course we conform to that. But when we come to the Parliament House, it is not a traditional place, it is the Westminster system … and who is the boss of Parliament House? It’s Queen Elizabeth. It’s a woman. It is not a <em>hausman</em>.”</p> <p>On voting day in Kessy Sawang’s village, dozens of her supporters – male and female – wore the “Votim Meri” (Vote Women) T-shirts given out at the workshops in Madang. The discussions there were a game-changer in her community, she says. “They really helped to break down the mindset of people toward women.”</p> <p>“The people here, for 47 years [since independence] have had the same shit. They don’t want to believe anyone,” says Sawang. Through educating rather than traditional campaigning, “I empower them with the knowledge, so people feel confident and have the words to speak.

There must be women there.” For a while, it “totally changed their minds, to vote for women”.</p> <p>But from the little information now trickling in from her Goilala Open electorate – phone networks have been down across the district – something or someone has lately interfered. What, she can’t say, “but I’ve heard from people that the whole valley has changed their mind, gone back to the men”.</p> <h2>‘We remain hopeful, in spite of everything’</h2> <p>The structural issues locking women out of power – money, corruption - “are still very much present”, says Dr Orovu Sepoe, a political scientist who has been documenting women’s politics and activism in PNG over decades. “Something new has to happen. If we have zero women [in parliament] again, that will highlight the problem. And we have to recognise it as a problem – it’s not normal.”</p> <p>Part of what’s gone wrong, she argues, is that notions of custom have been twisted to serve male political interests, obscuring recognition of the traditional authority women held in many PNG cultures. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4d548c1e1918c9d9f87cc5cd40237cac376a51fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d548c1e1918c9d9f87cc5cd40237cac376a51fa/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dulciana Somare-Brash at the Grand Papua Hotel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dulciana Somare-Brash, a second-time candidate. ‘We are only as good as our processes.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Godfreeman Kaptigau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We also have to get the message across strongly that a culture that breeds violence is not good culture.

The only reform that could have guaranteed women in the parliament – the introduction of temporary special measures to reserve seats for women, which Sepoe has championed for years – has stalled repeatedly since 2009, despite the concept being supported by the then-prime minister, Sir Michael Somare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/16/smiles-and-unity-at-the-pacific-islands-forum-mask-tough-questions-shelved-for-another-day\">Smiles and unity at the Pacific Islands Forum mask tough questions shelved for another day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“But we remain hopeful, in spite of everything,” says Sepoe.</p> <p>As counting drags on, those hopes in 2022 turn on close scrutiny and public pressure forcing some integrity on the process. If not, the hard-earned votes of candidates risk being corruptly stolen, or lost in the maelstrom.</p> <p>It is a shattering prospect given the huge logistical and physical challenges of campaigning in PNG. For Dulciana Somare-Brash, 49, a public policy specialist, second-time candidate and the daughter of the late prime minister, a day on the hustings could mean “travelling in the rain for four hours up river, you run out of fuel, there’s a low tide, you get stuck in reeds and you get killed by mosquitoes”. But, she says, she’s fortunate – she could bankroll the entourage and eight drums of fuel a week required to get to her potential voters.

The electoral commission told her they would be transported for counting aboard a helicopter owned by her opponent, the governor, Robert Agarobe.</p> <p>Peter and Kidu protested publicly to the commission that this represented a conflict of interest and was not appropriate.

As the manager had not scheduled a post-game conference afterwards the media were unable to ask. But the player may also not have pleased the 52-year-old with his “on Sunday the king plays” comment on Instagram on Friday.

It was, in fact, that sort of afternoon for Celtic. This two-goal victory was sufficient to place them at the summit of the table after a single round of matches but Ange Postecoglou cut a slightly frustrated post-match figure.</p> <p>“Especially in the last 15 minutes of the first half there was some slack passing and we allowed the game to be a little bit more open than it should have been,” Celtic’s manager said. “We got better again in the second half.</p> <p>“We just needed to be a lot more clinical with the chances we had. We also would have had even more chances with better decisions.”</p> <p>Even Jota, the man of the moment, was not spared. “He was one of the worst culprits in that first-half spell,” Postecoglou added. “He was wasteful with the ball, gave away possession when he shouldn’t have. But he addressed that in the second half. There were lessons in there for everyone.”</p> <p>Stephen Welsh headed the hosts in front inside three minutes. Aberdeen’s defending was timid from a Matt O’Riley corner, which the young centre-back could glance home. Aberdeen spent the first quarter of the game chasing shadows and unable to retain any meaningful possession. Kyogo flicked a shot wide and Roos saved well from the outstanding O’Riley as Celtic chased a quickfire second.</p> <p>Not only did that not arrive but Aberdeen, remarkably, should have levelled. Jonny Hayes had time and space to pick his spot beyond Joe Hart after Vicente Besuijen played the ball into his path. The former Celtic man drove his shot wide of Hart’s right-hand post from 16 yards.</p> <p>It looked thereafter as if one goal may have to suffice for Celtic. Roos denied Josip Juranovic and O’Riley before Aberdeen’s captain, Anthony Stewart, survived a penalty claim. Enter Jota, who left Roos helpless.</p> <p>“That’s what six million quid gets you,” said a rueful Goodwin later.</p> <p>Aberdeen’s manager added: “We couldn’t have started the game any worse. We gave away a silly corner, then didn’t defend it. Giving a team of Celtic’s quality a head start is not what we needed to do.</p> <p>“It was a very difficult afternoon, there’s no getting away from that. I tried to explain to the players after the game that we won’t face this quality week in, week out in Scotland. We will learn from today and see what we can do better but there’s no point dwelling on it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/31/lionesses-victory-womens-football-chloe-kelly-winner-sarina-wiegman","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T18:48:26Z","webTitle":"The Lionesses have done it.

Both male and female pundits have been analysing the games, and the mainstream media have been chatting about the results – which is also what’s happened in workplaces around the country. It’s everyday watercooler talk, the same as you’d expect from any major men’s tournament.</p> <p>The sponsors have been flocking and it looks as if they’ll stick around too, encouraged by the interest and engagement.

In 1984, England reached the final of the first Women’s European Championships. With amateur players and little to no funding, a squad couldn’t just go into camp for a month to train, eat and socialise every day. Instead, the semi-finals and the final had home and away legs, so once the first match was over, each player could head back to her day job for a couple of weeks before playing the deciding fixture. England’s captain, Carol Thomas, led the team out against Sweden at Kenilworth Road in Luton for the second leg on 27 May 1984. The weather conditions were vile; the few photographs and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzs45WcJEOI&amp;t=1088s\">limited video footage</a> of the day attest to that. Today the match might have been rearranged, but back then such flexibility in the calendar was impossible.</p> <p>When the FA set up the WSL in 2011, one of their aims was to support a successful England side. After reaching the semi-finals at the Women’s World Cup in 2015 and 2019, and at the last Euros in 2017, the Lionesses were aiming to go top that this year. It paid off: England’s women have finally landed their first major senior trophy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/key-reasons-behind-england-run-to-womens-euro-2022-final\">Long road to Wembley: key reasons behind England’s run to Euros final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although there is clearly brilliant talent already in the game – Williamson’s and Wiegman’s Lionesses are proof of that – this tournament must be the starting point of even greater progress. There has already been plenty of discussion about the need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/18/england-women-squad-euro-2022-whiteness-diversity\">draw from a more diverse talent pool</a>, with question-marks around whether the setup over the past decade has marginalised some groups who haven’t been able to access the limited training facilities for reasons of time, travel or money. The FA has announced the launch of 60 emerging talent centres across England, which should go some way to addressing that.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.thefabrochures.co.uk/legacyprogramme/\">FA’s aims</a> – for 75% of schools to provide access to girls’ football and 75% of grassroots clubs to have at least one girls’ team – are also important steps. The Lionesses have been inspirational role models for the next generation – of both girls and boys, just as Southgate’s side were in 2021 – and the path needs to be clear for the superstars of tomorrow to progress and shine. The momentum from this exciting, exceptional group of players and their achievements this summer will go some way to doing that – and with that legacy, they will ensure that this tournament goes down in history in more ways than one.</p> <ul> <li><p>Carrie Dunn is a journalist and lecturer.

There’s an agreement that we’re going to be drilling and doing more than we can to bring more energy to the market that reduces prices. They like that,” he said of Republicans.</p> <p>Manchin reiterated to Fox News that he believes the bill would not raise inflation, while saying that previous Biden spending packages he supported, including last year’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/10/covid-us-house-biden-coronavirus-relief-stimulus\">$1.9tn American Rescue Plan</a>, had done just that.</p> <p>“I’ll make sure I don’t make that mistake again,” Manchin said.</p> <p>He once again declined to say if he’d back Joe Biden for re-election in 2024.</p> <p>“Everybody’s worried about the election. That’s the problem. It’s the 2022 election, 2024 election. I’m not getting involved in that,” Manchin told ABC’s This Week. “Whoever is the president, that’s my president. Joe Biden is my president right now,” he added.</p> <p>Manchin agreed on a deal with Senate majority leader and fellow Democrat Chuck Schumer last Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/manchin-deal-democrats-schumer-reconciliation-bill-climate-health\">announcing an expansive $739bn package</a>, that had eluded them for months, and that addresses healthcare and the climate crisis, raising taxes on high earners and corporations and reducing federal debt.</p> <p>The bill replaces the $3.5tn Build Back Better flagship infrastructure and social support legislation that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/12/joe-manchin-spending-bill-vote-senate\">Manchin crushed</a> last fall and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/19/joe-manchin-biden-build-back-better-no-fox-news\">the reduced</a> $1.75tn version that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/19/joe-manchin-biden-build-back-better-no-fox-news\">he rejected</a> in December, then was renegotiating, then caused to suffer a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/15/joe-manchin-climate-funding-tax-hikes\">near-death experience</a> just weeks ago when he turned away from that too.</p> <p>The new legislation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/manchin-deal-democrats-schumer-reconciliation-bill-climate-health\">now called</a> the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, could pass the Senate this week, although it is not a done deal and Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona has not yet committed. </p> <p>“Senator Sinema is my dear friend …She has an awful lot in this piece of legislation, the way it’s been designed as far as … letting Medicare go ahead and negotiate for lower drug prices,” Manchin said, referring to the government health insurance program for older Americans and people with disabilities.</p> <p>“Also, basically, when she said … ‘we’re not going to raise taxes,’ I agree with that,” he added.</p> <p>As a budget-related bill, Democrats aim to be able to use the so-called reconciliation process to pass it with a simple majority in the Senate, which would need all 50 Democratic senators in the 100-seat chamber and the swing vote of US vice-president Kamala Harris to pass.</p> <p>“I sure hope so,” Manchin told CNN’s State of the Union show on Sunday morning, when asked if the Senate would vote to approve the bill before they go on summer recess at the end of the week.</p> <p>It’s “a great opportunity. It’s not a Democrat bill, it’s not a Republican bill, it’s definitely not a ‘green’ bill, it’s a red, white and blue bill,” he told host Jake Tapper.</p> <p>Manchin appeared to walk away from the legislation earlier this month on inflation concerns, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/15/joe-manchin-condemned-us-climate-action\">enraging</a> supporters of climate action and his own colleagues on Capitol Hill.

But afterwards the pair, who live and train together as part of the GB squad in Loughborough, disagreed on how firm that commitment had been.</p> <p>“I’m pretty sure we had a deal that if Wales got a medal we could get one, but he’s backtracking,” Mathias said. “My mum and dad would look after it. They’re only half an hour away.”</p> <p>Yee was not convinced. “I didn’t shake on that,” he shot back, smiling. “I haven’t backtracked. Maybe after the Paris Olympics.” Yee’s teammate Sophie Coldwell, however, backed Mathias. “I heard it,” she said.</p> <p>But there were no hard feelings as Yee and Mathias expressed their delight at their joint success by hugging and high-fiving at the finish. “It’s our first major Games together,” Mathias said. “We’ve only seen each other at the race sites but it’s really cool that we’re going to be on the podium.”</p> <p>“We always knew we’d be in with a shot for a medal if everyone had their perfect leg.

We have just moved house so hopefully there will be a nice place for them somewhere.”</p> <p>Earlier Yee had put the race to bed on the opening leg, establishing a 20-second lead over the pack, before Coldwell then further pushed England’s advantage. And while it was reduced to 16sec as Samuel Dickinson took it steady on the third leg, Georgia Taylor-Brown confidently brought victory home.</p> <p>Afterwards Yee praised the thousands who cheered the team to glory at Sutton Park. “It was mental,” he said. “Running down the hill was a bit like the Tour de France, everyone on the sides, helicopter above you. It was a bit surreal. It was really cool.”</p> <p>There was more triathlon success for England earlier in the day as the visually impaired duo David Ellis and Katie Crowhurst both won gold. The moment was especially sweet for the world No 1 Ellis, guided by Luke Pollard, as a broken bike chain led to him withdrawing from the Paralympics last year when he had been expected to win. “I didn’t want to go through the feeling we had in Tokyo ever again and this is the complete opposite,” he said.</p> <p>Crowhurst, guided by Jessica Fullager, only took up triathlon during lockdown and was stunned at her win. “This is a pinch me moment,” said Crowhurst, who was the youngest athlete in the field at 18. “I never expected to win a gold.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T18:33:06Z","webTitle":"England crowned Euro 2022 champions after Kelly sinks Germany in extra time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"England crowned Euro 2022 champions after Kelly sinks Germany in extra time","trailText":"Chloe Kelly toe-poked the winner in extra time at Wembley as England beat Germany 2-1 for their first European Championship triumph","byline":"Suzanne Wrack at Wembley","body":"<p>Ecstasy.

For England it was a chance to prove the gap between the European powerhouse and the home team had closed in the 13 years since their 6-2 final defeat at the hands of Germany.</p> \n<p>Sarina Wiegman’s side needed a good start and they had one before a ball had been kicked with Alex Popp, tied for the golden boot with Beth Mead on five goals going into the final with the latter collecting the award with more assists, a late withdrawal from Germany’s starting XI having picked up an injury in the warmup. It was a bruising exit for the enigmatic Popp, who has more than 100 caps but had never played in a European Championship before this because of injuries.</p> \n<p>Both managers had promised a tight contest and, if the pressure of the moment threatened to get under the skins of the Lionesses, then nerves were eased almost instantly. Lauren Hemp burst free on the left and delivered for Ellen White at the back post, but her header was easy for Frohms, who had conceded only one goal before this final.</p> \n<p>With the battle in midfield hotting up, and the competition’s main powerhouses in the middle – Georgia Stanway and Lena Oberdorf – going head to head, it was a matter of time before one went in the book. It was Stanway this time but Oberdorf collected her own booking after the break.</p> \n<p>Germany almost took the lead in the 25th minute, with Mary Earps fumbling a corner that bounced around before she fell on it, relieved. A short pause for a VAR check on a possible handball was quickly over.</p> \n<p>With the decision-making of the Ukrainian referee, Kateryna Monzul, questionable there was a hesitancy, and the game became a little niggly, making the half-time whistle very welcome.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec99ef337bcdadd724b23e962f2f35bbdb47e854\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec99ef337bcdadd724b23e962f2f35bbdb47e854/0_135_3959_2377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Georgia Stanway is floored by a bad tackle during the Euro 2022 final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georgia Stanway is floored by a bad tackle during the Euro 2022 final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2022/jul/08/womens-euro-2022-golden-boot-top-goalscorers-game-by-game\">Women’s Euro 2022 Golden Boot: top goalscorers, game by game</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Germany had scored six first-half goals in five games in their run to the final, making a 0-0 score at half‑time not the worst position for England to be in.

A long-range line-splitting pass from Keira Walsh fed Toone and the Manchester United forward clipped the ball over Frohms.</p> \n<p>England pushed for a second but, as the clocked ticked, they sank deeper and deeper. Magull provided a constant threat, firing a rising shot off the bar with the follow-up from Lea Schüller straight at Earps. But, with 11 minutes of normal time remaining, the dogged serial winners levelled. Neat play from the substitutes Sydney Lohmann and Wassmuth allowed the latter to ping in a cross that was turned in by Magull from close range.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"887f28d0efaa2da55805060ed07a7cfd843e9936\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/887f28d0efaa2da55805060ed07a7cfd843e9936/0_0_3634_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chloe Kelly scores the winning goal for England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chloe Kelly scores the winning goal for England.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>England’s quarter-final victory against Spain had proved tense but it was a comparatively relaxed evening stroll as extra time kicked off.

India broke several temperature records. The warmest March in more than a century was recorded across the country and a new high of more than 49C was hit in Delhi in May.</p> <p>Record-breaking heat has also been recorded elsewhere this year, including the UK, which smashed its previous record by an incredible 1.6C, reaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/19/a-wake-up-call-as-extreme-heat-blazes-across-uk-experts-say-net-zero-is-the-only-way-out\">more than 40C</a>. Portugal reached 47C on the 21st of this month, the hottest July day on record, while several places in France recorded new highs.</p> <p>These heatwaves have reignited the debate about how we can protect people from rising temperatures – and how high we can stand them to go. But the headline figures do not give the whole story when it comes to the impact of high temperatures on humans, because humidity, which is not factored into these figures, plays a huge role in how we actually experience heat.</p> <p>Recent research has found that we may actually already be nearing the threshold values for human survivability of temperature and humidity for short periods in some places of the world – a measure known as the “wet-bulb” temperature – and that this threshold may actually be far lower than previously thought.</p> <h2>What does wet-bulb temperature mean?</h2> <p>Wet-bulb temperature (WBT) combines dry air temperature (as you’d see on a thermometer) with humidity – in essence, it is a measure of heat-stress conditions on humans.</p> <p>The term comes from how it is measured. If you slide a wet cloth over the bulb of a thermometer, the evaporating water from the cloth will cool the thermometer down. This lower temperature is the WBT, which cannot go above the dry temperature. If humidity in the surrounding air is high, however – meaning the air is already more saturated with water – less evaporation will occur, so the WBT will be closer to the dry temperature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ab3ef656c0f7bb6a2cfb7cdc58a0f82a27d00b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ab3ef656c0f7bb6a2cfb7cdc58a0f82a27d00b7/0_288_8640_5184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man and a boy walking across a dry, cracked riverbed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bed of the River Yamuna in Delhi in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manish Swarup/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The [wet-bulb] temperature reading you get will actually change depending on how humid it is,” says Kristina Dahl, a climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “That’s the real purpose, to measure how well we’ll be able to cool ourselves by sweating.”</p> <p>Humidity and temperature are not the only things that affect a person’s body temperature: solar radiation and wind speed are other factors. But WBT is especially important as a measure of indoor environments, where deaths often occur in heatwaves, says W Larry Kenney, a physiology professor at Penn State University.</p> <h2>When do wet-bulb temperatures get dangerous?</h2> <p>Concern often centres on the “threshold” or “critical” WBT for humans, the point at which a healthy person could survive for only six hours. This is usually considered to be 35C, approximately equivalent to an air temperature of 40C with a relative humidity of 75%. (At the UK’s 19 July peak temperature, relative humidity was approximately 25% and the wet-bulb temperature about 25C.)</p> <p>Humans usually regulate their internal body temperature by sweating, but above the wet-bulb temperature, we can no longer cool down this way, leading our body temperature to rise steadily. This essentially marks a limit to human adaptability to extreme heat – if we cannot escape the conditions, our body’s core can rise beyond the survivable range and organs can start failing.</p> <p>The oft-cited 35C value comes from a 2010 theoretical study. However, <a href=\"https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00738.2021\">research</a> co-authored by Kenney this year found that the real threshold our bodies can tolerate could be far lower. “Our data is actual human subject data and shows that the critical wet-bulb temperature is closer to 31.5C,” he says.</p> <p>Bill McGuire, director of the Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre in the UK, says if the new finding is true, we are in “a whole new ball game” when it comes to extreme heat. “The numbers of people exposed to potentially deadly combinations of heat and humidity across the world would be vastly higher than previously thought.”</p> <p>It is important to note that heat gets dangerous for many people far below the threshold WBT.</p> <h2>Where could the wet-bulb threshold be passed?</h2> <p>In a global context, the UK is a relatively low-risk area for wet-bulb extremes – it has <a href=\"https://news.climate.columbia.edu/wp-content/themes/sotp-foundation/dataviz/heat-humidity-map/\">rarely reached above 28C so far</a>. “My personal feeling is that a wet-bulb temperature of 35C would not be possible in the UK, although 31C may well be later in the century,” says McGuire<strong>. “</strong>Then again, the Met Office certainly didn’t expect 40C [dry temperature] heat in 2022.”</p> <p>The risk of passing the WBT threshold is larger elsewhere, however. One 2015 study concluded extremes are likely to approach and exceed 35C in the region around the Arabian Gulf towards the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions are not reined in, posing questions for human habitability there.</p> <p>In 2020, research found that some coastal subtropical locations have already experienced WBTs of 35C, albeit only for a few hours. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9019e81ca0fec928e81decf9db37205d57bdab61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9019e81ca0fec928e81decf9db37205d57bdab61/0_373_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Iraqi man wiping his face in front of two large misting fans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Iraqi man cools down in Baghdad.

There were about 1,000 occurrences of a 31C WBT, and about a dozen above 35C, in Pakistan, India, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/27/looking-for-someone-to-blame-for-the-extreme-heat-try-wall-street\">Looking for someone to blame for the extreme heat? Try Wall Street | Alec Connon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One important question is how temperature rises because of the climate crisis correlate with rises in WBT extremes. A study last year found that the maximum WBT in the tropics will rise by 1C for each 1C of average warming. This means limiting global heating to 1.5C above the pre-industrial era would prevent the majority of the tropical area – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/mar/08/global-heating-tropical-regions-human-livability\">where 40% of the global population lives</a> – from reaching the survival limit of 35C, the paper said.</p> <p>Heatwaves are worsening many times faster than any other type of extreme weather because of the climate crisis. Scientists estimate that it made the India and Pakistan heatwave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/23/deadly-indian-heatwave-made-30-times-more-likely-by-climate-crisis\">30 times more likely</a>. As another paper put it, asking whether today’s most impactful heatwaves could have occurred in a pre-industrial climate is “fast becoming an obsolete question”.</p> <p>Instead, as heatwaves begin affecting more people’s lives more frequently, the question of what we can do about them is becoming ever more important. As the world sees the deadly mix of high humidity and high temperature more and more often, this could ultimately mean that some places <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/ask-nasa-climate/3151/too-hot-to-handle-how-climate-change-may-make-some-places-too-hot-to-live/\">simply become too hot to live in</a>, opening up the need for migration pathways to enable millions of people to get away from their home areas.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jul/31/archie-battersbee-life-support-to-end-on-monday-despite-mothers-pleas","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T17:50:38Z","webTitle":"Court to hear last-minute appeal in Archie Battersbee case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/31/archie-battersbee-life-support-to-end-on-monday-despite-mothers-pleas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jul/31/archie-battersbee-life-support-to-end-on-monday-despite-mothers-pleas","fields":{"headline":"Court to hear last-minute appeal in Archie Battersbee case","trailText":"Court of appeal to consider request by UN body to review plan to switch off life support treatment for 12-year-old in a coma","byline":"Joe Middleton and agency","body":"<p>A court of appeal hearing will take place on Monday morning in the long-running legal battle over whether to turn off life support treatment for 12-year-old Archie Battersbee.</p> <p>It is understood the virtual hearing, which will take place at 11am, will consider a request from the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (CRPD) to keep Archie alive so it could consider his case. A legal stay on the termination of treatment at the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel, east London, has been extended to 1pm on Monday.</p> <p>Barts Health NHS trust, which runs the hospital, had written to the family over the weekend to inform them it intended to end treatment at 2pm on Monday.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday evening ministers had asked the high court to “urgently consider” a request by the UN to stop life support treatment being ended for Archie. The letter, seen by PA Media, was written on behalf of Steve Barclay, the health secretary. It states that the CRPD has asked the UK government to refrain from withdrawing treatment until the case has been considered by the committee.</p> <p>“In the circumstances, we wish to draw the [UN] committee’s request for interim measures to the court’s attention for its urgent consideration,” the letter said. It also requested the letter be “placed before the out-of-hours judge immediately” or before Mr Justice Hayden, who has previously considered the case.</p> <p>An earlier letter from the committee to Archie’s family said it had requested the government “refrain from withdrawing life-preserving medical treatment, including mechanical ventilation and artificial nutrition and hydration, from the alleged victim while the case is under consideration by the committee”.</p> <p>Alistair Chesser, chief medical officer for Barts Health, said the plan to withdraw medical treatment will proceed unless the court directs otherwise on Monday.</p> <p>He said: “Our deepest sympathies are with Archie’s family at this difficult time.</p> <p>“We understand a court hearing will take place on Monday morning and we await the outcome. The plan to withdraw treatment will proceed unless the court directs otherwise.”</p> <p>Over the weekend Barts Health sent a letter to Archie’s parents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, saying that “all fluid infusions, medications, including vasopressin will be stopped” at 2pm on 1 August.</p> <p>The child has been in hospital since April after Dance found her son with a ligature over his head. Doctors treating him at the Royal London hospital in east London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/13/archie-battersbee-judge-rules-12-year-old-is-brain-stem-dead\">think he is brain-stem dead</a> and say continued life support treatment is not in his best interests.</p> <p>However his family have made legal challenges to keep Archie’s ventilator – a machine that helps move air in and out of the lungs – turned on and treatment continued.</p> <p>His mother had pleaded with Barclay to “act immediately” to stop the treatment ending, saying it would be “a flagrant breach” of the boy’s rights and urged the UN to intervene.</p> <p>The letter from Barts trust said: “We understand that any discussions around the withdrawal of Archie’s treatment are very difficult and painful. However, we want to ensure that you and your family are involved as much as you wish to be.”</p> <p>A high court judge had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/archie-battersbee-family-given-time-to-come-to-terms-with-ruling\">ruled that ending treatment is in Archie’s best interests</a>, after reviewing evidence. Writing to Barclay on Saturday, Dance said: “If this happens, this will be an extraordinary cruelty, and a flagrant breach of Archie’s rights as a disabled person.</p> <p>“Archie is entitled to have the decisions about his life and death, taken by the NHS and UK courts, to be scrutinised by an international human rights body. Hastening his death to prevent that would be completely unacceptable.”</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We recognise this is an exceptionally difficult time for Archie Battersbee’s family and our thoughts are with them.</p> <p>“The government asked the high court to urgently consider the request from the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/31/commonwealth-games-england-gymnast-jake-jarman-claims-all-around-gold","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T17:49:58Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Games: England gymnast Jake Jarman claims all-around gold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/commonwealth-games-england-gymnast-jake-jarman-claims-all-around-gold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/31/commonwealth-games-england-gymnast-jake-jarman-claims-all-around-gold","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Games: England gymnast Jake Jarman claims all-around gold","trailText":"England’s Jake Jarman said: ‘I put the work in.

He is just 20 and over the past 18 months his emergence as a senior gymnast had been complicated by the sparse competition calendar during Covid and injuries that agitated him until March this year.</p> <p>But his talent has always been undeniable, long placing him as one of Great Britain’s most promising gymnasts for the future. He is now also its present. After a dramatic tussle he rose to become the Commonwealth Games men’s all-around gold medallist, edging past his veteran teammate, James Hall, by .550 with a score of 83.900. Cyprus’s Marios Georgiou finished with bronze.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/31/commonwealth-games-2022-cycling-gymnastics-and-swimming-on-day-three-live\">Commonwealth Games 2022: cycling crash mars day three action – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“With the support of the team behind me, especially with the personal team behind me, it really showed me that I can do this,” he said. “I put the work in. It was just a matter of keeping calm, staying composed. Enjoying the competition makes it so much better.”</p> <p>In the women’s all-around final, Australia’s Georgia Godwin continued her excellent championship by producing a small upset, following up Australia’s team silver by winning the individual gold medal with a score of 53.5. While England’s Alice Kinsella and Ondine Achampong qualified in the top two spots, both gymnasts relinquished the gold medal with falls on the balance beam. Achampong, however, rallied to win silver with a tremendous floor routine.</p> <p>Jarman is a supremely powerful gymnast, particularly on the floor exercise and vault, where he completes some of the most difficult skills in the world, and he has gradually built an all-around programme to compete with quality rivals.</p> <p>From the beginning of the final he was on fire. He opened the day by nailing his floor routine, smoothly executing a series of enormous tumbling passes. Hall, who had qualified in first place, kept pace until the duel was defined by the vaulting table.</p> <p>First Jarman opted to attempt his supremely difficult Yonekura vault, a handspring vault with 3.5 twists that carries the joint highest difficulty value of 6.0 in the code of points, registering a huge score of 15.3. Moments later Hall stepped out of bounds on his vault, injuring his ankle and scoring only 13.8.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c61ba4ba0fed1a0da682112577cf83bec8502f0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c61ba4ba0fed1a0da682112577cf83bec8502f0c/0_270_8095_4857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Left to right: Silver medallist Ondine Achampong of England, gold medallist Georgia Godwin of Australia and bronze medallist Emma Spence of Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Left to right: Silver medallist Ondine Achampong of England, gold medallist Georgia Godwin of Australia and bronze medallist Emma Spence of Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ross/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Hall was in excruciating pain and trailing by over a point, he put Jarman under pressure until the end. But Jarman did not falter, commanding his parallel bars and high bar routines without hesitation to win. As he digested the biggest achievement of his young career, Jarman thought back to the inspiration the 2012 Olympics provided him with, and then to his own future. “I remember sitting there wanting to be like that, wanting to have that opportunity,” he said. “These competitions feel like a huge stepping stone on that way. I feel like after today, anything is possible.”</p> <p>An unwelcome feature of this year’s Games is its brutal, compact schedule. The women’s team final finished at 9:30pm on Saturday, with a round of media and recovery after that, yet they had to return early the next day to be ready at 2:30pm for the all-around final.Many gymnasts in the women’s all-around final appeared to be feeling the strain. Achampong was slightly less sharp, even as she remained solid.</p> <p>Despite great amplitude on her double-twisting double-back somersault vault, then a smooth start to her complex uneven-bar routine, she dismounted from both pieces with her chest low. Then she fell on the balance beam but the 18-year-old demonstrated the resilience that will guide her to more success.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/30/teenager-alice-capsey-shines-as-england-chase-down-sri-lanka-total\">Alice Capsey shines as England’s T20 hopefuls chase down Sri Lanka total</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I try to split up my competition into each piece,” she said. “Once one piece is over, it’s fine. If a mistake comes, I’ll just deal with it. It’s fine. And once I’ve done it, just move on to the next piece.”</p> <p>She moved on without hesitation, first recovering in the beam routine to register an acceptable score of 12.5, then she finished with one of the best floor routines of her life, smashing down a series of stuck tumbling passes to secure silver. “I would’ve said floor was my weakest piece, but after doing that, I might have to rework it,” she said, laughing.</p> <p>For a while Kinsella’s day followed a similar path. She was solid on vault and then she executed a spotless uneven bars routine, save for starting the routine late and incurring a 0.3 neutral deduction. But then it rapidly deteriorated. She eventually fell on the beam before struggling badly throughout the rest, leaving her with a brutal score of 11.0. After falling again on the floor, both in the warm-up and routine, she left the podium in tears and fourth place, as Arena Birmingham offered her a loud ovation.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jul/31/russia-ukraine-war-drone-hits-russias-black-sea-fleet-hq-zelenskiy-urges-civilians-to-leave-donetsk-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T17:42:44Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy urges civilians to leave Donetsk as city of Bakhmut comes under attack – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jul/31/russia-ukraine-war-drone-hits-russias-black-sea-fleet-hq-zelenskiy-urges-civilians-to-leave-donetsk-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jul/31/russia-ukraine-war-drone-hits-russias-black-sea-fleet-hq-zelenskiy-urges-civilians-to-leave-donetsk-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy urges civilians to leave Donetsk as city of Bakhmut comes under attack – as it happened","trailText":"Hundreds of thousands ‘must evacuate Donetsk’ to avoid falling into enemy hands, says Ukrainian president","byline":"Gemma McSherry (now); Emine Sinmaz and Joe Middleton (earlier)","body":"<div id=\"block-62e6b86a8f08af33ff4a4999\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-31T17:27:11.690Z\">6.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It is nearly 8.30pm in Kyiv and here is where we stand on the day’s developments the Russia-Ukraine war:</p> <ul> <li><strong>200 Russian marines from the 810th naval infantry brigade refused to come back to fight in the southern regions of Ukraine</strong>, according to Ukraine’s Defense Ministry Intelligence Directorate, <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/\">The Kyiv Independent reports.</a></li> <li><strong>The Odesa District State Administration has reported that Russian forces have conducted a missile strike that has hit a quarry.</strong> The authorities didn’t specify the location and the number of casualties is being clarified.</li> <li><strong>Russia has moved some units from the Sloviansk direction in Donetsk, Oblast, to the southern Zaporizhzhia, Oblast</strong>,<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/\">the Kyiv Independent reports.</a><strong> </strong>According to the report, Ukraine’s military said that Russian troops have had partial success near Avdiivka while Ukrainian forces pushed back Russian attempts to advance toward the Husarivka village in Kharkiv, Oblast.</li> <li><strong>Six people were injured when a drone flew into the Russian headquarters of its Black Sea fleet.</strong> The Sevastopol mayor, <strong>Mikhail Razvozzhaev,</strong> said six people were injured in the blast.</li> <li><strong>There was intense bombardment of the eastern town of Bakhmut, reports say.

indicated that the blast came from within the building, which is under Russian control, according to an AP report. </p> <p>Russian officials have claimed the building was attacked by Ukraine with the aim of silencing PoWs who may have be giving information about Ukrainian military operations.</p> <p>Satellite photos taken before and after the attack show that a small, squarish building in the middle of the Olenivka prison complex was demolished, its roof left in splinters.</p> <p>Podolyak said on Twitter that those images and the lack of damage to adjacent structures showed that the building was not attacked from the air or by artillery, and contended that the evidence was consistent with a hyperbaric bomb being set off inside.</p> <p>Here is a photo taken after the attack that

increasing their troop numbers, preparing for our counteroffensive [in Ukraine’s south] and perhaps preparing to launch an offensive of their own.

Here’s a summary of the latest developments as it just passes 9am in Kyiv on this Sunday 31 July 2022. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Ukrainian officials have denounced a call by Russia’s embassy in Britain for fighters from the Azov regiment to face a “humiliating” execution</strong>, Agence France-Presse reported. Twitter said the embassy had violated its rules on “hateful conduct” but put a warning on the tweet rather than ban the post about the Azov, a Ukrainian battalion that retains some far-right affiliations. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian presidency’s office, responded on Telegram on Saturday: “In the 21st century, only savages and terrorists can talk at the diplomatic level about the fact that people deserve to be executed by hanging. Russia is a state sponsor of terrorism. What more evidence is needed?”</li> <li><strong>Renewed Russian strikes on Ukraine’s frontline have left one person dead in the south of the country and also hit a school in Kharkiv</strong>, officials said. The mayor of the southern city of Mykolaiv said one person was killed when rockets pounded two residential districts overnight, AFP reported. In Ukraine’s second city of Kharkiv, rockets from an S-300 surface-to-air system destroyed part of an educational facility, local authorities said.</li> <li><strong>The Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for the evacuation of the eastern Donetsk region</strong> of Ukraine, which has seen fierce clashes between his country’s forces and the Russian military. The governor of Donetsk, where Moscow is focusing the brunt of its offensive, said six civilians were killed and 15 wounded by strikes on Friday. Zelenskiy said in his daily address: “There’s already a governmental decision about obligatory evacuation from Donetsk region. Please, follow evacuation.” Zelenskiy said thousands of people, including children, were still in the battleground areas of the Donetsk region.</li> <li><strong>The Ukrainian military said it had killed scores of Russian soldiers and destroyed two ammunition dumps in fighting in the Kherson region</strong>, the focus of Kyiv’s counter-offensive in the south and a key link in Moscow’s supply lines. Reuters reported the military’s southern command as saying rail traffic to Kherson over the Dnipro River had been cut, potentially further isolating Russian forces west of the river from supplies in occupied Crimea and the east.</li> <li><strong>Gazprom has suspended gas supplies to Latvia</strong> following tensions between Moscow and the west over the conflict in Ukraine and sweeping sanctions against Russia, AFP reports.

The bill allocates huge amounts for tax credits on renewable energy and battery production, rebates on household electric vehicles and green appliances, support for environmental justice projects in communities that are disproportionately affected by the climate emergency and funding to address highly potent methane emissions.</p> <p> The authors say it could lift the country from a 30% to a 40% cut in emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 levels and put Joe Biden’s 50% reduction target within reach.</p> <p>Not everything in the bill, optimistically called the Inflation Reduction Act, is climate positive. It also includes significant concessions to fossil fuels, which were deemed necessary to get Manchin across the line. There will be new leases for oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska – a step that would break a Biden election commitment – and faster approval processes for gas pipelines. </p> <p>At another time, these sort of measures might have prompted a stronger negative reaction. Some critics have argued that while fossil fuel elements in the deal are dwarfed by the support for renewable energy, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jlappen1/status/1552753435753074688/\">they could drive an expanding demand for gas</a> that locks it in well into the future. But pro-climate action Democrats and activists have mostly applauded the bill as a breakthrough. Their position can be summarised as a combination of “the positives are immense” and “this is far more than the nothing we expected a week ago”.</p> <p>Expectations in Australia are, of course, in a different place. With the Coalition continuing to absent itself from an adult conversation about climate policy, the centre of debate lies somewhere between the Labor assessment last year of what was politically achievable after years of electoral losses and the science-based positions of the Greens and independents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"weekend app\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&link=true&link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p> The position of the climate change minister, Chris Bowen – basically that Labor will stick to its modest election commitments but won’t stand in the way of deeper cuts – is not an unreasonable starting point given where we have been, but it has been undermined by Anthony Albanese’s extravagant suggestion that expanding the Australian coal export industry could be good for the climate because local coal is “cleaner” than that from overseas. It’s an old coal industry line that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/albanese-parrots-a-pro-coal-talking-point-as-ampol-offers-carbon-neutral-petrol\">as Graham Readfearn has explained</a>, doesn’t stack up.</p> <p>The prime minister’s other rhetorical device has been to misrepresent a push from the Greens for a moratorium on developing new coalmines and gas fields as an attempt to rapidly shut down existing fossil fuel developments, claiming it would have a “devastating impact on the economy”. It is blatant politics, but unlikely to matter by 2025, when voters will be able to judge the Albanese government on what it has actually achieved.</p> <p>The key questions will go something like this. Has it implemented the climate policies it promised in a way that sets the country up for the future? Has it persuaded Australians that its emissions reductions are real and not greenwash? Has it been honest with the communities that will be most affected by inevitable change and produced a plan to support them?</p> <p>Has it nullified dishonest claims by the Coalition and others that try to blame Labor for increases in power bills caused by international factors? And has it used the power of incumbency to set an ambitious emissions reduction target for 2035 that sets a new trajectory and renders debate over the 2030 goal redundant?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/23/the-best-way-to-dutton-proof-climate-legislation-is-to-get-it-into-parliament-and-get-it-passed\">The best way to Dutton-proof climate legislation is to get it into parliament and get it passed | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We will get a pretty good idea of how much of this is looking over the next 12 months.</p> <p>In terms of new climate spending, the government is offering nothing on the scale of what is planned in the US, but it has introduced legislation for tax breaks for electric cars and says $20bn will be dedicated to building electricity transmission links needed to get the country to 82% renewable energy by 2030.</p> <p>But the big questions will be over how Labor deals with industrial pollution and future coal and gas proposals.</p> <p>Bowen has promised a discussion paper later this month on options for the government to use the safeguard mechanism – a Coalition policy that has been around for years without achieving anything – to cut out-of-control emissions from major industry. Labor has enjoyed support from the business community for its climate targets, but the negotiations over the safeguard – which will decide how rapidly 215 big emitting facilities and mines have to make cuts – are where things could get challenging. The minister won’t have much time to thrash out the detail. He has promised the revamped safeguard will be running by July next year.</p> <p>Labor has made clear it has no intention of banning new fossil fuel mines outright, regardless of what the world’s climate scientists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/18/humanity-faces-collective-suicide-over-climate-crisis-warns-un-chief\">the UN secretary-general</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/12/oil-gas-mega-projects-climate-iea-fatih-birol-carbon-bombs-global-energy-crisis-fossil-fuel?fr=operanews\">the International Energy Agency</a> says. But a well-designed safeguard mechanism could at least make developing new coal and gas fields much more difficult.</p> <p>Total industrial emissions will have to start to decrease. Obviously enough, allowing new fossil fuel projects will make this harder, and put greater pressure on existing polluting businesses to make deeper cuts. But the government has also said trade-exposed big emitters will be protected. Something will have to give. One option would be place much stricter emissions requirements on new fossil fuel proposals than on those already operating.</p> <p>A more straightforward approach might be to just introduce a climate test – often called a climate trigger – in national environment laws so that new major developments could be blocked or curtailed if they were to cause substantial emissions. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/20/the-dire-state-of-the-environment-report-is-a-major-challenge-for-labor-and-an-opportunity\">promised a revamp of those laws next year</a>, with details to come.</p> <p>While the government is considering all this it will also need to decide what it does about carbon credits.

Most women do lie a lot.’”</p> <h2>A wake-up call</h2> <p>Since former Sydney private school student<strong> </strong>Chanel Contos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/feb/27/the-trouble-with-boys-what-lies-behind-the-flood-of-teenage-sexual-assault-stories\">revealed the alarming prevalence of sexual abuse</a> in high schools and launched the Teach Us Consent <a href=\"https://www.teachusconsent.com/\">petition</a> calling for earlier consent education, there has been progress in attitudes towards sexual violence, consent and gendered abuse in Australia. This progress includes Contos’s campaign achieving its goal of mandatory consent education in all Australian schools, starting next year.</p> <p>“It was a wake-up call for a lot of young men,” Taukolo says. “But there’s still an issue.</p> <p>“When we dive a bit deeper [in the class] and ask what are your actual views on consent and give them some scenarios, that’s when we’d find the alarming attitudes.”</p> <p>Some young men consider asking for consent to be necessary only insofar as to avoid getting into trouble, Taukolo says. “We then try to unpack that, and build their understanding of consent through empathy.”</p> <p>A survey of 500 boys, undertaken bythe Man Cave, a school program promoting boys emotional wellbeing and healthy relationships, showed students understood respect and consent and were eager for more education,<strong> </strong>the charity’s CEO Hunter Johnson says.</p> <p>But Johnson says a new challenge has arisen during the pandemic. “Due to the last two-and-a-half years, the young men are more socially and emotionally behind than their female counterparts. There’s more disrespect in the classroom, particularly towards female and non-binary classmates.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"139f25435e4009ce9404ad52cb7650a02cf4c9c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/139f25435e4009ce9404ad52cb7650a02cf4c9c1/0_0_1740_1236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hunter Johnson, CEO of the Man Cave, a programme that teaches students about consent, healthy masculinity and positive relationships.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunter Johnson, CEO of the Man Cave, a programme that teaches students about consent, healthy masculinity and positive relationships.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mancave</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ojasvi Jyoti, co-head of curriculum at Consent Labs, an organisation that gives consent education in schools and universities, says he’s observed fear among some young men about being wrongly accused of sexual assault.</p> <p>“There is a lot of rhetoric around, I think from social media or media in general, that they could get falsely accused,” he says. “Even though statistics show that only 5% of assault allegations are false.”</p> <p>However<strong>, </strong>Contos says she has seen more young men standing up against toxic behaviour by their peers. “I think in the past a lot of young men felt uncomfortable with these sorts of things, or didn’t really know how to be active or anti that behaviour.”</p> <p>Attitudes are changing, Full Stop Australia’s CEO Hayley Foster says, “but it is slow” and the toxic signals men and boys receive over time from pop culture and the media can act as “counter forces” to change.</p> <p>“When you have young people that are imbibed in an environment of misogyny, objectification of women and girls and gender roles and expectations that are supportive of violence, then [advocates] can sometimes feel as if you’re losing the battle,” she says.</p> <p>Providing people with an alternative view of the world is crucial to changing attitudes, Foster argues. “It’s about giving young people opportunity to reflect and investigate and be critical around the influences that they’re exposed to.”</p> <p>This is where consent programs can be particularly beneficial, advocates say, so long as they nurture empathy and reflection. </p> <h2>The power of programs</h2> <p>If young men are given a non-judgmental space in these programs to have “messy” conversations it helps them build emotional intelligence, Hunter and Taukolo say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc4232ec0eeaafc815c1f6a610b2a70f7c73ae85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc4232ec0eeaafc815c1f6a610b2a70f7c73ae85/0_312_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Staff from Men4Respect, who run consent education programs in Queensland schools.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff from Men4Respect, who run consent education programs in Queensland schools.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Men4Respect</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those leading the programs say they can create real changes in attitudes. <strong> </strong>In<strong> </strong>the eight-week Men4Respect program, 16% of the young men at the start of the program agreed that “men should take control in relationships” but<strong> </strong>this dropped to none after the program, Taukolo says. More than a third initially agreed that “if a woman sends a nude image to her partner, she is partly responsible if he shares it without her permission” and by the end this dropped to 10%. </p> <h2>‘It is not the fault of 13- and 14-year-old boys’</h2> <p>Prof Michael Salter, an expert in criminology and gendered violence at UNSW, says having these honest conversations between young men to unpack the anxiety and tension in male sexuality can be transformative – but it is not a “silver bullet”.</p> <p>Salter says he is concerned this focus on children “exculpates the adults that have the responsibility for social transformation”.</p> <p>“It is not the fault of 13- and 14-year-old boys that they grow up in an unequal and sexist society,” he says. “It’s our fault.”</p> <p>Salter says more men must take the burden from woman to reinforce the message of respect and equality. “Frankly, until we see more men, in a professional capacity as well, deciding to work on it I think we’re going to continue to struggle.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>But I do wonder, what about the rest of our population that never got this education?</p> <footer> <cite>Beatrice*</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bianca Fileborn, an expert in criminology at the University of Melbourne, agrees. “There’s a lot of focus on young people, which is obviously important, but what about the rest of the community?” she says. “There’s a real need to actually engage in some broader community education around consent and sexual ethics as well.”</p> <p>A similar thought was on 29-year-old Beatrice’s* mind as she watched the push to change the culture of consent in Australian schools. She has been the victim of three separate non-consensual sexual acts in recent years by men a similar age to her.</p> <p>“Having consent education is a huge win,” she says. “But I do wonder, what about the rest of our population that never got this education - and where it’s also a problem?”</p> <p>Taukolo says during workshops at schools sometimes it is the teachers or staff members who are problematic, not the students. </p> <p>“And when these young men go to their sporting clubs and to their coaches and their mentors or their other leaders, do those people have the capacity to dissect these complex issues?”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/16/we-really-are-trailblazers-coming-out-as-trans-in-later-life\">‘We really are trailblazers’: coming out as trans in later life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Taukolo says his team feels they are making a difference. “A lot of us see ourselves in the young men we’re teaching and a lot of us didn’t have those opportunities to have that type of growth at those ages,” he says. “So we do feel proud.”</p> <p>In the final lesson of the Men4Respect’s program, the boys again sit in their yarning circle, this time holding a piece of paper with personal reflections on what they’ve learnt.</p> <p>“The best part was being able to open up without any judgement from any of you,” one of the students says. “My main takeaway is how to treat women in a respectful way.”</p> <p>Another says: “My main takeaway is to treat everyone the way you’d like to be treated.”</p> <p>*<em>Name has been changed to protect her identity</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/01/blind-advocates-allege-nsws-removal-of-online-voting-system-is-a-breach-of-human-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T17:30:01Z","webTitle":"Blind advocates allege NSW’s removal of online voting system is a breach of human rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/01/blind-advocates-allege-nsws-removal-of-online-voting-system-is-a-breach-of-human-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/01/blind-advocates-allege-nsws-removal-of-online-voting-system-is-a-breach-of-human-rights","fields":{"headline":"Blind advocates allege NSW’s removal of online voting system is a breach of human rights","trailText":"State electoral commission accused of discrimination for suspending iVoting platform as Blind Citizens Australia takes case to watchdog","byline":"Christopher Knaus","body":"<p>Advocates for blind and low-vision people will take the New South Wales Electoral Commission (NSWEC) to Australia’s human rights watchdog, accusing it of unlawful discrimination over the removal of an accessible voting platform.</p> <p>The NSWEC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/22/unacceptable-suspension-of-ivote-system-undermines-rights-of-low-vision-australians-expert-says\">announced earlier this year</a> that it would not be using the iVote online voting system for the looming 2023 state election, following technical glitches during local government elections in Kempsey, Singleton and the City of Shellharbour.</p> <p>But advocates say no viable replacement has been planned for the online voting system, leaving a gap that will deny blind and low-vision Australians the ability to cast their ballot in a secure, secret and independent way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/22/unacceptable-suspension-of-ivote-system-undermines-rights-of-low-vision-australians-expert-says\">‘Unacceptable’: suspension of iVote system undermines rights of low vision Australians, expert says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Blind Citizens Australia (BCA), with the assistance of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre (Piac), is now taking the state’s electoral commission to the Australian Human Rights Commission, complaining that the conduct amounts to unlawful discrimination.</p> <p>They allege it breaches Australia’s commitment to the United Nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, which compels government to ensure people with a disability can fully participate in elections.</p> <p>The case is seeking an urgent conciliation between the bodies ahead of the March 2023 election, and will pressure the NSWEC to reinstate a fit-for-purpose online voting platform for people who are blind or have low vision.</p> <p>“People who are blind or vision impaired have a right to participate equally and freely in elections,” BCA’s chief executive, Sally Aurisch, said.</p> <p>“The decision to scrap the only voting platform which truly allowed us to participate equally clearly disregards this right.”</p> <p>The loss of iVote would force blind and low-vision people to vote using human-assisted telephone voting.

Hopes that the pandemic would lead to an easing of pressures, because remote working would increase flexibility for those making decisions about where to live, have been crushed. Instead, prices rose 10% between March 2020 and March 2021, and have kept on rising. June saw a year-on-year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/07/uk-property-prices-rise-at-the-fastest-rate-for-18-years\" title=\"\">increase of 13%</a>. Private rents are also at<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/14/private-rents-in-uk-reach-record-highs-with-20-rises-in-manchester\" title=\"\"> record levels</a>, with recent figures showing the average outside London up 11.8% on a year ago. In the capital the figure is 15.8%.</p> <p>Because the majority are homeowners, attitudes surrounding housing inflation are at odds with those around rising prices for energy or food. But for those renting privately or hoping to buy, it forms part of a wider affordability crisis. Particularly for younger people, the difficulty of buying a first home is a generational injustice – although this framing can obscure the fact that many of those with home-owning parents stand to benefit in the longer term. From 59% in 2003, the proportion of people in the 25-34 age bracket who are homeowners has <a href=\"https://positivemoney.org/publications/banking-on-property/\" title=\"\">fallen to 47%</a>. The racial disparities are also stark, with lower rates of home ownership among ethnic minorities.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7723/\" title=\"\">lack of consensus</a> over the solutions to Britain’s housing crisis reflects wider differences of view about public policy, as well as the conflict of interests between those who own property and those who don’t. Another factor is gaps in data. The government has never studied the impact on prices of foreign investment in UK property, but these purchases are widely accepted as having contributed to price inflation in some areas. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/13/foreign-investors-snapping-up-london-homes-suitable-for-first-time-buyers\" title=\"\">Research commissioned by the mayor of London</a> showed that 36% of new builds in the “prime” inner London boroughs had foreign buyers, and that these were less likely to be used as main homes. A <a href=\"https://hmlandregistry.blog.gov.uk/2022/04/29/progress-on-the-register-of-overseas-entities/\" title=\"\">new register</a> of overseas entities should provide more clarity about who is profiting from UK property purchases.</p> <p>But transparency will not solve the affordability crisis. Currently a fifth of homes are owned by private landlords, and changes to the tax system, including council tax and capital gains rates, are needed if rich buyers are to be discouraged from turning homes into financial assets. Increasing the supply of socially rented properties, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jun/15/white-paper-to-tackle-unfair-evictions-and-bad-landlords-in-england\" title=\"\">boosting tenants’ rights</a>, should be viewed as urgent necessities. It is dismaying that housing policy overall is not a higher-profile issue than it is. Liz Truss’s pledge to “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/liz-truss-pledges-to-help-more-renters-buy-their-first-home\" title=\"\">rip up the red tape</a> that is holding back housebuilding” sounds more like a threat than a promise, to anyone who cares about the UK’s net-zero target and thinks that meeting human needs, not deregulation, should be the government’s aim.</p> <p>There is no quick or easy fix to a situation that has built up over decades. But there are possibilities. Researchers at the banking reform campaign group Positive Money have argued that the Bank of England should be <a href=\"https://positivemoney.org/publications/banking-on-property/\" title=\"\">tasked with reshaping the mortgage market</a>, while a new report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation makes a case for measures aimed at <a href=\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/making-house-home-why-policy-must-focus-ownership-and-distribution-housing\" title=\"\">shifting property out of the private rental sector</a> into other forms of tenure. The first essential step is to recognise that the large-scale transfer of homes out of social ownership to private landlords, in the decades since right to buy was launched, has been a disaster. Particularly in combination with other inflationary pressures, house prices rising faster than incomes are a gross injustice and make a mockery of levelling up.</p> <p>The fact that two-thirds of the population stand to benefit from these rising prices makes any attempt to dampen them tricky. But progressive politicians should take heart from polling showing support for the idea that the <a href=\"https://positivemoney.org/2022/03/most-homeowners-happy-for-house-prices-not-to-rise/\" title=\"\">primary purpose of housing should be shelter</a>, not profit. In the current context of dysfunction and unfairness, fortune ought to favour the brave.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Waiting times to see a GP or undergo urgent surgery are deteriorating.</p> <p>We have N95 masks which reduce virus transmission – but we’re not using them when we should. We see many people out and about with viral symptoms, who should be staying home from work and school. We have vaccinations which still confer significant protection against severe and fatal Covid – but uptake rates of the important booster have been stagnant.

Litres of water came through the roof in one bedroom, causing mould to develop and mushrooms to sprout from the ceiling. Sam and his mother contacted their real estate agent, who took six weeks to respond before sending out a roofer who told them it was too wet to do any work and left.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t until a family member, who is a lawyer, wrote their agent a formal letter that anything happened: they were granted a one-off rent reduction of $960 for their three-bedroom home, the equivalent of nine days’ amnesty from rent.</p> \n<p>“We just got this sort of arbitrary number,” Sam says. “Which, in the grand scheme of things, is not really sufficient. But I guess it was some sort of small victory.”</p> \n<p>But that wasn’t the end of the matter. Four months later, Sam says, the leak in their roof still has not been fixed. They haven’t received any further reductions and have recently been informed their rent is being hiked up by $100 a week.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/this-isnt-safe-nsw-renters-fight-twin-battles-against-mould-and-landlords\">‘This isn’t safe’: NSW renters fight twin battles against mould and landlords </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“So not only have they spent months not fixing it and only giving us a small rent reduction, they are now clawing that back in a rent increase,” Sam says.</p> \n<p>“In hindsight, I think we should have been a lot more aggressive in threatening to go to NCAT [the New South Wales civil and administrative tribunal] and developing some sort of case. But when you’re working full-time, trying to develop a case for NCAT is a lot of work.”</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, Sam’s is one of the better outcomes Guardian Australia heard while researching this story. Even tenant advocacy groups along Australia’s La Niña-hit east coast concede getting action on mould from a landlord or agent can be difficult.</p> \n<p>“I asked [one of our] law workers if he’s got anyone who has successfully negotiated a rent reduction, and he said no,” says Penny Carr, CEO of Tenants Queensland. “It’s just really complicated with mould.”</p> \n<p>So what <em>are</em> your rights when it comes to mould – and how can you actually enforce them? Here’s a quick guide for renters in NSW, Queensland and Victoria.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/04/tableizer/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>I’ve spotted mould, what do I do?</h2> \n<p>The first step is always contacting your landlord or real estate agent, Carr says.</p> \n<p>Whatever part of the country you’re in, as with most rental disputes, your best bet is to create a paper trail.</p> \n<p>“Keep evidence and document things. So get photos, keep dates, tell the owner or agent what’s going on,” says Carr. Calling your real estate agent is fine, “but always follow up with something in writing”.</p> \n<p>Ned Cooke, a solicitor from the Tenants’ Advice and Advocacy Service at Sydney’s Redfern Legal Centre, agrees. “The key to all of these things is your landlord being on notice or aware of the issue.”</p> \n<p>If your landlord or agent fails to act, you can escalate to your state’s civil and administrative tribunal with as much evidence as you can muster.</p> \n<h2>Mould has ruined my stuff! Am I eligible for compensation?</h2> \n<p>Theoretically, yes. With some caveats.</p> \n<p>In NSW and Queensland, you must be able to prove the cause of the mould is a problem with the property – for instance, a leak, like Sam’s, that has not been fixed despite being reported by the tenant.</p> \n<p>If the dispute reaches a tribunal and the mould is deemed the landlord’s fault, you could ask for compensation for the value of items damaged in your home or the cost of having them cleaned. In NSW, you can also claim compensation for general loss of enjoyment to the property, which is paid on top of any claim for damaged possessions. But proving your case is rarely easy.</p> \n<p>“Mould is a really difficult issue because it comes down to causation,” says Carr. “And sometimes it’s hard to understand or to know for sure what’s caused the mould.</p> \n<p>“If you take that complexity out for a second, it’s like any repair. If the issue has been caused by the owner, directly or indirectly – so that could be it’s been poorly built or poorly repaired or maintained, and that’s caused mould – then that is an issue for the owner.</p> \n<p>“You could substitute, in that scenario, the word mould for a working oven. The problem is it’s really clear when the oven doesn’t work … it can be much more difficult to work out why mould is happening.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Guardian weekend\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>So how do I prove cause?</h2> \n<p>If the mould is down to recent weather, it is unlikely to be deemed the landlord’s fault. Even when mould is a longstanding issue, determining its cause could still be tricky.</p> \n<p>“A very typical situation would be a tenant complaining about mould and their landlord saying, ‘Well, it’s a ventilation issue – you guys aren’t using the bathroom fan, you’re not opening the windows’,” says Cooke.</p> \n<p>If you’re after compensation in either NSW or Queensland, you must also show that you took reasonable steps to limit the amount of loss that you suffered – for instance, you didn’t leave a laptop in a place with a known leak.</p> \n<p>If your landlord doesn’t immediately agree to compensation, you can ask them to arrange for an expert inspection and written report to determine what caused the mould. Of course, your landlord might refuse this request.</p> \n<p>In NSW, Cooke says, “If it really turns into a fight, then it might be a matter of getting … Fair Trading to send an inspector out to the property.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/how-to-get-rid-of-mould-and-mildew-a-guide-to-post-flooding-cleanup\">How to get rid of mould as floods, wet weather and extreme humidity hit NSW and Queensland</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In Victoria, tenants seeking compensation must also prove cause – though that process should be easier than in NSW or Queensland. <a href=\"https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/housing/renting/repairs-alterations-safety-and-pets/pests-infestations-and-mould\">Recent changes to rental laws</a> state that if ordinary use of a building is causing mould, the landlord is responsible.</p> \n<p>“Unless the rental provider can say that the renter is using [the property] in some extraordinary way that would amount to a breach of the renter’s duty not to cause damage, I think that the compensation position would be there,” says Ben Cording, a lawyer with Tenants Victoria.</p> \n<p>Renters in Victoria who are dealing with mould can apply to the Victorian civil and administrative tribunal for a hearing that must, by law, happen within two business days. “And you’ll usually come out pretty quickly with an order saying it’s got to be fixed,” says Cording.</p> \n<p>But to be awarded compensation, your landlord must have been notified and given adequate time to fix the problem.</p> \n<p>“It might be slightly different in a situation where the renter didn’t know anything, then pulls back the mattress and goes, ‘Oh, there’s mould there’,” says Cording. “The tribunal is a bit reluctant [to award compensation] in those sorts of situations.”</p> \n<h2>Part of my house is too mouldy to use. Can I get a rent reduction?</h2> \n<p>Yes – in NSW and Queensland.</p> \n<p>“That’s one of the big remedies,” says Cooke. “If you’ve got any aspect or feature of your property that you can’t use because the landlord has failed to do some necessary work, then you could be asking for a rent reduction. If the landlord won’t give you one, you could apply to the tribunal.”</p> \n<p>You’ll want to put “a reasonable figure” on what percentage of your rent would be appropriate. “So a cupboard might be a reasonably small reduction, but the loss of a whole bedroom can be quite a significant reduction, depending on the overall property,” Cooke says.</p> \n<p>It’s a similar story if part of your home has flooded. “You’re not probably going to get compensated for the goods that you’ve lost because it was an act of nature, unless the owner’s done something to contribute to that,” Carr says. (Again, that could mean not fixing a leak that exacerbated your flood damage).</p> \n<p>But if you can’t use the whole property while repairs are underway, it might be possible to get a rent reduction.</p> \n<p>In Victoria, Cording advises going for compensation over a rent reduction.</p> \n<p>“The tribunal prefers the losses to become crystallised. So you can say, ‘I reported it on this day, I wasn’t able to use the cupboard until this day,’ and you get compensation for use of the cupboard for that period of time,” he says.</p> \n<h2>Could I be evicted for asking about mould?</h2> \n<p>Unfortunately, some renters may find their landlord would rather give them the boot than deal with the problem.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/16/theres-real-powerlessness-australian-renters-at-the-mercy-of-no-cause-evictions\">‘There’s real powerlessness’: Australian renters at the mercy of no-cause evictions</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In NSW, tenants who are no longer in a fixed-term lease – for instance, those who are past their initial one-year lease period – are vulnerable to what’s called a no-grounds termination notice, in which the landlord can evict them without having to give a reason.</p> \n<p>There are similar laws, called without grounds notices, in Queensland. Other factors exacerbate the situation there.</p> \n<p>“The bigger overlay at the moment for renters is that they’re in an extremely tight market, so they don’t want to put their head up,” says Carr. “And in Queensland, we tend to have shorter tent fixed term agreements – six months [is common].”</p> \n<p>In Victoria, the situation is better – but still not perfect.</p> \n<p>“Within the bundle of rights that came through last year, they also got rid of what’s called a no-reason notice to vacate. So they can’t kick you out for no reason any more,” Cording says.</p> \n<p>Renters could still be evicted with 90 days’ notice before the end of their fixed-term agreement. However, landlords must disclose to potential tenants if anyone has complained about mould in the past three years – meaning they have incentive to actually fix the problem.</p> \n<p>On Australia’s soggy east coast, that’s about as good as it gets.</p> \n<p>*Name has been changed</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/31/the-guardian-view-on-fishing-marine-protection-should-mean-what-it-says","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T17:25:09Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on fishing: marine protection should mean what it says | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/the-guardian-view-on-fishing-marine-protection-should-mean-what-it-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/the-guardian-view-on-fishing-marine-protection-should-mean-what-it-says","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on fishing: marine protection should mean what it says","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> By allowing destructive dredging and bottom-trawling, ministers are undermining wider efforts to protect the oceans","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>Damage to the world’s oceans generally takes place out of sight, meaning it can be even harder to build momentum behind policymaking than it is to tackle other forms of harm to wildlife. But shocking data gathered by marine conservation NGOs, revealing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/31/fishing-industry-still-bulldozing-seabed-in-90-of-uk-marine-protected-areas\" title=\"\">90% of Britain’s marine protected areas</a> (MPAs) are still being fished using the most destructive methods, should serve as a wake-up call. The UK government is officially signed up to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/11/50-countries-commit-to-protection-of-30-of-earths-land-and-oceans\" title=\"\">target of protecting 30%</a> of our territorial waters by 2030. So far, action is lagging a long way behind words.</p> <p>With a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/un-ocean-treaty-is-once-in-a-lifetime-chance-to-protect-the-high-seas\" title=\"\">desperately needed global oceans treaty</a> due to be negotiated in August , the UK government should live up to its pledges. If nations are unwilling to protect the marine environment in their own waters, the chance of reaching agreement over international ones could slip away. The level of protection provided by the designation of MPAs has been exposed as too minimal to be meaningful. Last year, just 10% were not fished using highly destructive dredging or bottom-trawling equipment – which Greenpeace likens to “bulldozing” the seabed.</p> <p>Awareness of the importance of the oceans in regulating the climate, by storing what is known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/04/can-blue-carbon-make-offsetting-work-these-pioneers-think-so\" title=\"\">blue carbon</a>, as well as the urgency of managing the world’s fisheries sustainably, has risen sharply. But so has the scale of destructive industrial fishing, and the threat posed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/08/nowhere-is-free-from-noise-deep-sea-mining-threat-to-marine-mammals\" title=\"\">deep-sea mining</a>. The UK has presented itself as a model to follow on marine conservation – as it was on climate change laws. Protected zones are meant to aid species and ecosystem recovery. In some cases, the creation of off-limits nursery areas has been shown to help fishers too. A <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/spring-tides-fiona-gell-book-review-andrew-harvey/\" title=\"\">recent book by the marine biologist Fiona Gell</a> explains how the Isle of Man government worked with the local fishing industry in developing its marine conservation plans. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/22/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">2020 Fisheries Act</a> gave UK ministers powers to ban bottom-trawling in protected areas. But so far bans have been introduced in only four – a minuscule proportion of the total. The creation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/20/five-highly-protected-marine-areas-set-up-in-english-waters-fishing-ban\" title=\"\">five highly protected areas</a> – effectively no-take zones where all fishing is banned – was recently mooted for sites including one off the coast of Lindisfarne in Northumberland and another in the Channel. Separately, Scotland is now committed to fully or <a href=\"https://scottishwildlifetrust.org.uk/2021/10/how-scotlands-seas-will-be-affected-by-the-programme-for-government/\" title=\"\">highly protected areas across 10% of its waters</a>. But the regulation of the existing protected areas must also be toughened up.</p> <p>Already, the EU has stolen a march on the UK with a vote in its parliament to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/14/european-parliament-votes-to-ban-fly-shooting-fishing-in-part-of-channel-france\" title=\"\">ban a technique known as “fly shooting”</a>, which uses lead-weighted ropes to capture entire shoals of fish, from French waters in the Channel – a vote that must now be considered by the European Commission and member states. Notably, this was at the instigation of small-scale fishers who struggle to compete with industrial factory ships. Enforcement is essential, as well as regulation. Rules are no use if there is no means of stopping them from being broken. NGOs continue to do essential work in exposing what is going on. Governments urgently need to catch up. An end to dredging licences in the UK’s existing protected areas is not a big ask.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A shout for lbw follows when Roy is on strike but it’s turned down - going down leg, no review. Roy wants pull a shorter ball when it comes but gets none of it - his touch, it’s just not there. Nice changes of pace, too.<br></p> <p>A theory from Tom v d Gucht. “I remember before the 2005 Ashes there was talk of not playing Harmison into he two ODI series and the T20 game so the Aussies had less time fo acclimatising to his pace and bounce. It seemed cowardly at the time, but there might have been something in it. Mills started the T20 world Cup well but then faded and was more effectively played as the tournament progressed- until he was injured... Similarly, Topley has been less effective as the series has progressed and Joedan’s revitalised death bowling has been more effectively countered after his recent renaissance. Maybe you’re better off keeping your best bowlers as mysteries and only rarely rolling them out to keep the surprise impact intact....”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73ace9221c1a96e79d56e20ca88e88c074eca1d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73ace9221c1a96e79d56e20ca88e88c074eca1d2/0_0_2892_1944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anrich Nortje delivers a ball as Jos Buttler looks on.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anrich Nortje delivers a ball as Jos Buttler looks on.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Bardens/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-07-31T15:54:14.610Z\">at 4.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62e6a2668f08af33ff4a48bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-31T15:44:41.575Z\">4.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>2nd over: England 15-0 (Roy 11, Buttler 4) Target 192. </strong>Nortje, back today in the place of Rabada who has an ankle niggle, starts well attacking the stumps at pace.

After a difficult week for Scottish cricket, not least for Majid Haq and Qasim Sheikh, whose racist treatment and subsequent bravery in shining a light on the goings on at Cricket Scotland will hopefully lead to real change and a brighter future for all, Scotland finish their mini-series against New Zealand with an ODI in Edinburgh today. Having lost both T20’s heavily, the Scots recovered well from 107-5 in the 25th over to post a respectable 306 all out. Short boundaries at the Grange, so I’d still expect NZ to reach that total with a bit to spare.

Welcome to the third and final T20 international from Southampton on a very busy afternoon of sport around this United Kingdom.<br></p> <p>The series is square at one apiece with the England camp have noting in the build-up to this decider that it would be timely for them to win the trophy here having failed to in their aforementioned summer series. They saluted easily in the opener by boshing 234-6 at Bristol thanks to YJ Bairstow’s 90 and Moeen Ali’s 16-ball half-century. The tables were turned in Cardiff when the visitors passed 200 with an unbeaten 96 from the returning man due to Brexit (long story), Rilee Roussouw.</p> <p>It’s also of note that this is England’s final limited-overs match of the summer and a T20 World Cup is around the corner in October and November.

The SVD being a missionary order, he was sent in 1973 to Indonesia, which has a large Roman Catholic population, and worked there, on Flores, as assistant priest in the parish of St Thomas More in Maumere, and as priest in the parish of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Wolofeo.</p> <p>In 1984 John came back to the UK to become a doctoral student at Birmingham University, obtaining his PhD in intercultural theology in 1987.

He wanted to be the person whose presence was so reassuring, and set about making it happen.</p> <p>He was born in Godalming, Surrey. His father, Sydney Smith, went from the Royal Flying Corps to running a preparatory school with his wife, Constance (nee Sidney) – giving Colin the advantage of a scholarly background.</p> <p>After Charterhouse school in the town and then Oxford University, where he studied medicine, he took a year off from his training at Guy’s hospital in London, and signed up to sail across the North Atlantic on board a Bristol Channel pilot cutter, which is how he met his future wife, Celia Perkins, another crew member.</p> <p>Realising after qualifying that he could fulfil his national service using his medical skills, Colin went to practise medicine in Lesotho. He wrote to Celia inviting her to join him, and there they were married in 1960.</p> <p>After three years they returned to settle near the Medway Towns in Kent, living outside the village of Higham, not far from Charles Dickens’s home at Gad’s Hill Place. There he became deeply involved with the local people; both through his work as family doctor and GP trainer, and in the protection of the countryside.</p> <p>He was one of those who founded the Dickens Country Protection Society in the early 1970s to safeguard the North Kent marshes from the incursion of industry – specifically an oil refinery. Methods included driving around on his 125cc motorbike selling raffle tickets, and making a BBC Open Door documentary, The Forgotten Marshes (1976), to publicise the cause. Colin also held a mud-smeared shrimp-counting “festival” to aid his ecological research. The marshes remain protected to this day.</p> <p>Colin and Celia retired in 1996 to Dorset where he became occupied with the local church in Beaminster as church warden, while also singing in the choir. The solar panels he had been campaigning for are due to be installed soon in the church roof.</p> <p>Colin was a voracious reader and a talented amateur musician, artist and writer; fascinated by all aspects of the world. This curiosity led him to constantly experiment with creative techniques, his extraordinary brain being both scientific and artistic. He was well informed about world events; and in parallel with his Christian beliefs he was a staunch supporter of other faiths. He and Celia even travelled to Ramallah in 2004 as part of a local delegation, and visited the Palestinian leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/11/israel.guardianobituaries\">Yasser Arafat</a> in his compound.</p> <p>His once robust health had deteriorated in recent years and eventually gave out when he suffered heart failure and a stroke. He is widely remembered for his generosity of spirit and enormous sense of fun, which endured almost to the end.</p> <p>As well as Celia, he is survived by three daughters, Philippa, Diana and me; and three grandchildren, Eve, Joe and Isabella. He was predeceased by his son, Peter.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/jul/31/tour-de-france-femmes-van-vleuten-goes-for-glory-on-final-stage-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T16:29:44Z","webTitle":"Tour de France Femmes: Van Vleuten survives final stage to win inaugural race – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/31/tour-de-france-femmes-van-vleuten-goes-for-glory-on-final-stage-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/jul/31/tour-de-france-femmes-van-vleuten-goes-for-glory-on-final-stage-live","fields":{"headline":"Tour de France Femmes: Van Vleuten survives final stage to win inaugural race – as it happened","trailText":"Annemiek van Vleuten survived multiple attacks and bike changes on stage eight to claim a historic Tour de France Femmes win","byline":"Luke McLaughlin","body":"<div id=\"block-62e6aca98f08c001473281ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-31T16:28:55.622Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Thank you for reading</strong> our coverage of this year’s Tour de France Femmes, and thank you to all of you who got in touch via email or Twitter.</p> <p>It was heartening to see the appetite for women’s cycling, both from fans out on the road and the many of you who have tuned in to read our live blogs, reports and more.

It’s a milestone to win the first one of, hopefully, many more.”</p> <p>But it was a testing final day for the Olympic time trial title holder, and leader of the Movistar Team, who swapped bikes half a dozen times after starting the final stage in an all yellow bike, kit and helmet combination.</p> <p>Although her closest rival, her compatriot Demi Vollering (Team SD Worx), wearing the Queen of the Mountains jersey, attempted to force the pace on the descents towards the final climb to Super Planche, Van Vleuten’s lead remained intact to the foot of the 7km ascent, which has sections as steep as 24%.</p> <p>Six kilometres from the finish, Van Vleuten bridged up to her Colombian teammate, Andrea Patino, and began accelerating through the remnants of the day’s nine‑rider breakaway.</p> <p>Only Vollering could give chase but as the climb wore on, the race leader’s advantage grew and, although Vollering closed the gap on the final gravel ramps, Van Vleuten crossed the finish line with 30sec to spare.</p> <p>Van Vleuten has already won this year’s women’s Tour of Italy, the Giro Donne and now becomes the first woman to achieve the Giro-Tour double since Joane Somarriba, of Spain, in 2000. But her decisive stage victory on Saturday, based on a 60km lone raid through the Vosges, 72 hours after – by her own admission – she had been too weak to pack her suitcase, left her peers open-mouthed.</p> <p>“To be honest, yes, it’s out of the ordinary, because we all worked hard,” FDJ-Suez rider Évita Muzic, one of Van Vleuten’s pursuers on the road to Le Markstein, said.</p> <p>“There were five of us in the group and we were losing time all the time. We couldn’t give more: she was on another planet.”</p> <p>Vollering, too, seemed stunned by Van Vleuten’s superiority. “I said to her [Van Vleuten]: ‘It’s not normal what you did,’” she said.</p> <p>“She said: ‘I have so much more training experience and overall experience.’ Then she said to me: ‘That will come to you, so let’s hope.’</p> <p>“I’m a bit older than the other girls, so can do a lot of training,” Van Vleuten said after her stage win on Saturday. “I want to make something clear. It’s not that my colleagues don’t train as much as I do. It has something to do with training years.”</p> <p>Marianne Vos, who led the Tour de France Femmes for five days, took the green jersey, while Vollering claimed the King of the Mountains and Shirin van Anrooij (Trek Segafredo) won the best young rider classification. But it was Van Vleuten’s masterclass.

Sadly, she did nothing to support this innovative service, which produced such excellent outcomes. I have provided evidence to several all-party parliamentary groups on early education and childcare, including the current one; yet the only changes in the last 12 years have been damaging deregulation, privatisation and profiteering.</p> <p>It is unarguable that there are greater benefits to society from investment in early learning than from later investment. This is because the foundations for lifelong learning are laid in the first five years. This is when key areas of development mature at an astonishing rate.</p> <p>Disadvantaged groups have even greater risks of poor health, social, emotional, behavioural, cognitive and language problems – which affect basic skills, employability, health, adjustment and criminality. Currently, 22% of UK children enter school with developmental problems, and so do not go on to achieve full functioning in society.</p> <p>The rhetoric of governments that they want “high-quality, affordable childcare” is nonsense: no other sector of education is described in such an ignorant and irresponsible way. It is not possible to provide the quality of education and childcare needed in a modern nation with poorly paid, undervalued, low-qualified staff in an outsourced, profiteering, market-driven sector.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Iram Siraj</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Professor of child development and education, University of Oxford</em></p> <p>• Prospective prime minister Liz Truss proposes to only help a parent with a tax break if he or she chooses to give up a career. This is an insult not only to parents who choose to not give up their professions, but to a modern society struggling to offer mothers a true choice between family and career.</p> <p>It is true that the main political parties seem to have run out of ideas to tackle the British childcare disaster (the main article refers to England, but the disaster reverberates throughout the UK). But don’t be fooled, these same parties know perfectly well what needs to be done to fix the childcare mess. They just choose every day not to act. They choose to force women out of flourishing professions. They choose to make the childcare sector a private equity jungle exploiting dedicated educators. And they choose to make children, the most wonderful creatures in the known universe, a private business, a heartbreaking economic choice.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Dr Emanuele De Luca</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p>• My son’s son will go to his Oslo nursery in September.

The monthly bill is about £1,000. So on a like-for-like basis, full-time for one child per month in Norway is £300 and in Sheffield it’s about £1,200.</p> <p>And that’s just the start.

Those who test positive for the virus will be offered treatment available after NHS England struck a deal with three major pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>Prof Graham Foster, national clinical chair for NHS England’s hepatitis C elimination programmes, said the scheme “marks a significant step forward” in the fight to eliminate the virus before 2030. It will “use new software to identify and test patients most at risk from the virus – potentially saving thousands of lives”, he added.</p> <p>“Hepatitis C can be a fatal disease which affects tens of thousands across the country but with unlimited access to NHS treatments, innovative patient finding initiatives such as this one … we will continue to boost the life chances of thousands of patients by catching the virus even earlier.”</p> <p>Hepatitis C deaths have fallen by over a third in five years.

It can be spread by sharing unsterilised needles – particularly needles used to inject recreational drugs.</p> <p>The actor Pamela Anderson contracted hepatitis C while married to the musician Tommy Lee, who had a history of drug abuse, when the couple shared a tattoo needle. Anderson, 55, was cured after taking antivirals.</p> <p>Experts say the recent fall in deaths is largely down to earlier detection of the virus coupled with improved access to treatments.</p> <p>Rachel Halford, the chief executive of the Hepatitis C Trust, said: “Thanks to the brilliant advances we have seen in hepatitis C treatment in recent years we have a real opportunity to eliminate the virus as a public health concern in the next few years.

Amid the onslaught of rain and catastrophic flash flooding, at least 28 people have died while dozens more are reported injured.</p> <p>Kentucky governor Andy Beshear has warned that the death toll will probably continue to rise as officials struggle to reach certain areas of the state that have been badly affected by the floods. On Sunday morning he told NBC it was raining hard in the region and there are renewed warnings of additional flooding.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/30/kentucky-flash-flooding-death-toll-missing\">Catastrophic flash flooding kills 25 in Kentucky and at least a dozen missing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Thursday, Beshear <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/govandybeshear/status/1552819584239017984\">said</a> that the flooding was the worst that he has seen in his lifetime. “I wish I could tell you why we keep getting hit here in Kentucky. I wish I could tell you why areas where people may not have much continue to get hit and lose everything. I can’t give you the why, but I know what we do in response to it. And the answer is everything we can,” he said.</p> <p>However, to climate scientists, the answer to such frequent and drastic weather events can be attributed to a climate emergency that has largely been human-caused and expedited.</p> <p>Jonathan Overpeck, an earth and environmental sciences professor at the University of Michigan, explained that because human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels have significantly warmed the atmosphere in recent years, the atmosphere now holds more moisture than it used to. As a result, whenever rainfall occurs, it is more drastic.</p> <p>“This means the risk of flooding is going up dramatically over much of the planet where people live, and Kentucky is one of those places. The evidence is clear that climate change is a growing problem for Kentucky and the surrounding region – more floods like this week, and more floods when wetter tropical storms track north over the state,” Overpeck <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/29072022/with-epic-flooding-in-eastern-kentucky-the-states-governor-wants-to-know-why-we-keep-getting-hit/\">told</a> Inside Climate News.</p> <p>Flash floods happen as a result of torrential rainfall that occurs within a short period of time, often resulting in the water having nowhere to go. When grounds are already saturated, they are unable to absorb all the excess water.</p> <p>“It gathers speed, it gathers power, it can pick up debris. And that is a flash flood. It’s really dangerous. It can carry away cars, it can carry away houses, and it can kill people,” said Rebecca Hersher <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/29/1114417118/because-of-climate-change-inland-flooding-is-becoming-more-common\">from NPR’s climate team</a>.</p> <p>Opeck explained that in addition to more frequent flash floods, Kentucky will also probably experience more tornado risks in the future. Last December, Kentucky faced its deadliest tornado outbreak when numerous tornadoes tore through the state and killed 80 people. One of the tornadoes cut through more than 165 miles and was nearly half a mile wide.</p> <p>“Heatwaves are clearly getting more dangerous and deadly due to human-caused climate change, and there is growing evidence that thunderstorms are getting supercharged by the warming atmosphere as well – and that can mean higher tornado risks,” he said.</p> <p>As the eastern region of Kentucky struggles with rebuilding efforts that could take years, residents from the western parts of the state are also feeling the impacts of climate change in various ways.</p> <p>Steve Fisher, a 61-year old farmer, told the Guardian that the floods have driven him to use increased fungicide on his crops due high moisture content.</p> <p>Additionally, volatile weather conditions have forced farmers like Fisher to change their farming methods and routines. One method Fisher now uses is no-till farming, a technique used to address soil erosion that washes away the topsoil that supports plant growth and helps to retain moisture during long periods of drought.</p> <p>“We’ve gone from tilling the soil up and making the soil real loose to no-till farming, which basically drills the seed into the ground without having to work the soil up to save the moisture in the ground to prevent moisture loss and soil erosion,” he said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/31/copa-evo-morales-bolivia-football-tournament-comeback","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T15:23:46Z","webTitle":"Bolivia’s Morales keeps up comeback hopes as Copa Evo kicks off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/copa-evo-morales-bolivia-football-tournament-comeback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/31/copa-evo-morales-bolivia-football-tournament-comeback","fields":{"headline":"Bolivia’s Morales keeps up comeback hopes as Copa Evo kicks off","trailText":"Some see youth football tournament as former president’s latest attempt to keep his name in frame for 2025 vote","byline":"Thomas Graham in La Paz","body":"<p>Politics and football have long mixed in South America, but not perhaps to this extent. On Sunday the Copa Evo, an international youth football tournament arranged by and named after Bolivia’s former president Evo Morales, kicked off in the country’s coca-growing tropics.</p> <p>The buildup was dominated by political scraps, with the opposition questioning the involvement of the national football federation in a tournament that bears Morales’s name.</p> <p>Morales has said the purpose of the tournament is to support football as a form of integration. Six teams from Bolivia and another six from across the Americas are taking part.</p> <p>Morales is an avid football fan. While president, in his 50s, he toyed with playing professionally in Bolivia’s top league. He promoted the sport by unveiling new artificial pitches around the country.</p> <p>But with Copa Evo, some of his opponents reckon there is more to Morales’s motivation than love of the game.</p> <p>On the political scene, Morales is an important but diminished figure. Though he is leader of the governing Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), he is no longer directly involved in government. And though he retains the staunch support of some sectors of society, notably the coca growers of the Chapare, he is not as broadly popular as he once was.</p> <p>His monopolisation of power during his almost 14 years as president, and defiance of the result of a referendum on whether he could exceed the term limits and run again in 2019, made him a divisive figure, even within the MAS.</p> <p>Morales won the 2019 election, which was disputed by the opposition, who alleged fraud. The country seized up with protests before the army suggested Morales resign. He did, and then fled the country. After a year of political turmoil the MAS, under the former finance minister Luis Arce, was voted back in with a landslide, and Morales has since returned from exile in Argentina.</p> <p>He is just one of several MAS candidates being mooted for elections in 2025, and some see the tournament as his latest attempt to keep his name in the running.</p> <p>Members of the opposition threatened to complain to Fifa if the national football federation did not dissociate itself from a tournament that they consider to be political. Fifa, with which Bolivia’s national football federation is affiliated, has a policy of neutrality. The national football federation clarified that it was just providing support with refereeing and equipment, and was not organising or publicising the event.</p> <p>Opponents also questioned the source of the tournament’s funding, and the decision to hold it in the Chapare, a coca-growing region that they described as a “red zone” for drug trafficking.</p> <p>In a letter sent to all the teams involved, opposition MPs warned them against tainting their reputation, and compared Morales to Pablo Escobar, who they said “used to bring teams to play in the back yard of his house”.</p> <p>The organisers shot back, refusing to change the tournament’s name and declaring that it was paid for by sponsors and the Six Federations of the Tropics, the umbrella coca growers’ union. Héctor Arce, a representative of the MAS, accused the opposition of “stigmatising a whole region of drug trafficking”.</p> <p>The Chapare, where Morales lives and his support is strongest, is one of two main coca-growing regions in Bolivia and is often described as a state within a state, where the first authority is the coca unions.</p> <p>It was where Morales rose to political prominence as a union leader, at a time when the Bolivian government still followed the US-led “war on drugs”, with forced eradication of coca that often turned violent.</p> <p>After the MAS came to power it ejected the US Drug Enforcement Agency and legalised a certain amount of coca cultivation. Violence fell and development came to previously marginalised places. But doubts hang over exactly where the Chapare’s coca ends up.</p> <p>In recent months the drug trade has rarely been far from the news, with a spate of high-level corruption cases, multiple murders and drug busts, some not far from where the Copa Evo will take place.</p> <p>Facing criticism, several teams have pulled out of the tournament, but the organisers have brought in replacements.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Morales thanked the opposition for all the free publicity. “Without even trying,” he said, “Copa Evo has made it to Fifa.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2022/jul/31/hungarian-grand-prix-f1-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T15:19:29Z","webTitle":"Max Verstappen wins the Hungarian Grand Prix: F1 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/jul/31/hungarian-grand-prix-f1-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2022/jul/31/hungarian-grand-prix-f1-live","fields":{"headline":"Max Verstappen wins the Hungarian Grand Prix: F1 – as it happened","trailText":"The defending world champion came from tenth on the grid as Lewis Hamilton and George Russell made it a Mercedes 2-3","byline":"John Brewin","body":"<div id=\"block-62e69c428f08af33ff4a4892\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-07-31T15:19:29.114Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here’s Giles Richards’ report from Hungaroring.

But the house and its spirit would be destroyed if you did that.”</p> <p>The AAVA says the heritage interest status – which recognises places or items <a href=\"https://www.comunidad.madrid/cultura/patrimonio-cultural/bienes-patrimonio-historico\">“without exceptional value, but which possess a special historical or artistic significance”</a> – does not take into account the house’s rich past. In order for it to become a museum, they want to see the property afforded that far more stringent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bien_de_Inter%C3%A9s_Cultural\">“item of cultural interest”</a> status.</p> <p>Few buildings in Spain, Europe or the rest of the world have as remarkable a literary pedigree as Velintonia. The nickname was coined by Aleixandre himself as a Hispanicisation of the street’s original name – Calle Wellingtonia – long before it was renamed in the poet’s honour following his 1977 Nobel win.</p> <p>Aleixandre and his family moved into the house in 1927, a year after it was built. Within months, it became a meeting place for the poet’s friends in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/06/spains-forgotten-literary-star-maria-teresa-leon-from-a-turbulent-age-is-rescued-from-oblivion\">avant garde literary set</a> known as the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Generation-of-1927\" title=\"\">Generation of ’27</a>, which was named after the year the group met.</p> <p>In 1928, the poet <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Cernuda\">Luis Cernuda</a> met Aleixandre in the house. Two years later, Lorca – fresh from his travels in New York and Cuba – pitched up on the poet’s doorstep.</p> <p>“Lorca gives Aleixandre a signed copy of his poems, which reads, ‘In Velintonia at last, Federico’,” says Sanz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0a9a3e936fb84f8165538ce0c3278243dec485a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0a9a3e936fb84f8165538ce0c3278243dec485a/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A room inside Velintonia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A room inside Velintonia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the Association of Friends of Vicente Aleixandre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“That shows how important Velintonia had become for the Generation of ’27.

Salons take place there, and interviews are given there. A lot of Lorca’s works were read aloud for the first time between these walls.”</p> <p>Lorca was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jun/25/spain-franco-federico-garcia-lorca\">murdered by a rightwing firing squad in the early days of the Spanish civil war</a>, while his fellow poet <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Hern%C3%A1ndez\">Miguel Hernández</a>, another Velintonia visitor, died in prison in 1942, his lungs destroyed by tuberculosis.</p> <p>Unlike some members of the Generation of ’27 – among them Cernuda, Alberti, Prados and Altolaguirre – Aleixandre did not go into exile following Franco’s coup, partly because he was too ill, and partly because he was devoted to his sister Conchita.</p> <p>After the bomb damage to Velintonia had been repaired and parts of the house rebuilt, Aleixandre and Conchita moved back into the house in 1940 and the poet planted a Lebanese cedar tree in the garden to symbolise a new beginning. The tree still stands today, huge and in need of pruning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/04/spain-santiago-de-compostela-noughts-and-crosses\">Game of stones: calls to protect Spanish city’s centuries-old noughts and crosses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From 1940 until his death in 1984, Aleixandre continued to receive writers from Spain, Latin America and elsewhere. Close friends would be entertained in the garden in the morning or admitted to the room where the poet reclined on a chaise longue from 4.30pm. Less familiar visitors were granted an audience from 7pm.</p> <p>The Spanish writer and director <a href=\"https://www.cervantes.es/bibliotecas_documentacion_espanol/creadores/molina_foix_vicente.htm\">Vicente Molina Foix</a> was 17 when he was introduced to Aleixandre by a friend.

For Verstappen, his win was a triumph. What had begun with the expectation of damage limitation led to an immense run <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/30/george-russell-claims-first-pole-of-his-career-at-hungarian-grand-prix\" title=\"\">from 10th on the grid</a> as he and his Red Bull team pulled off an absolute coup.</p> <p>Mercedes in turn produced their best performance of the year, while in stark contrast Ferrari wallowed, from leading the race to fourth and sixth for Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc.</p> <p>Verstappen’s touch and judgment in coming through the field was unquestionable and Red Bull’s race management and strategy calls were executed to perfection. So much so the world champion was even moved to reference the inexplicable decision that had cost Ferrari so dearly.</p> <p>“Nobody expected this,” he said. “We had to remain calm and we made all the right calls. We had a few overtakes, we pitted at the right time and put the right tyres on the car. That was most important today.”</p> <p>The Dutchman had to make repeated passes but he is so confident, so dominant now, he seemed to almost be toying with the opposition, Leclerc the luckless mouse, allowed out of range of his claws but only for seconds.</p> <p>Verstappen threw in a spin mid‑race, to lose a place to Leclerc he had just taken, only to settle and pass him once more, before marching down the road to take his eighth win of the season from 13 meetings. It was a body blow to Leclerc’s championship hopes. Verstappen’s lead over the Monégasque driver is now a chasm of 80 points, a seemingly insurmountable advantage with nine races remaining.</p> <p>At Mercedes, while a win remains a way off, the pleasure from this was palpable. They scored a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/24/max-verstappen-wins-french-f1-gp-to-stretch-lead-in-title-race\" title=\"\">second and third last time out in France</a> but here they did it with their car proving it could genuinely challenge. Enough indeed for Hamilton to move from seventh to second and for him and teammate Russell in third, to finish ahead of both Ferraris and Sergio Pérez’s Red Bull, which was fifth.</p> <p>Their car, a mercurial beast this year, is a handful to set up, balance and put into the operating window. This weekend, right up until qualifying, it had been guarding its performance with petulant devilry. On Saturday they found the sweet spot as Russell took pole and on Sunday the car was quicker and more manageable than it has been all year. Hamilton believes a victory is genuinely achievable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d8d8cc27986df881fdc58f3b169ea5a6607f648\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d8d8cc27986df881fdc58f3b169ea5a6607f648/0_317_4758_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Verstappen had started 10th on the grid but ended up winning by almost eight seconds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Verstappen had started 10th on the grid but ended up winning by almost eight seconds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: François Nel/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“This weekend there was potential for a win,” he said. “If we can take this pace into the second half of the season we can start to fight. This is the first time we have been able to battle with Ferrari. That is huge for us.”</p> <p>There was also, in common with Red Bull, well-managed decision making on the pit wall. Control, calm and class at the very front then but, behind, a baffling chaos from Ferrari.</p> <p>Sainz and Leclerc had started in second and third, the race surely theirs to dictate. It started promisingly, their pace self-evident and after the first pit stops Leclerc took the lead with a bold move, late‑braking round the outside of Russell at turn one.</p> <p>So far so good, the win, it seemed, was in his grasp – yet his team floundered once more .</p> <p>On his second stop they fitted the slowest, hard tyres for Leclerc, so he could make it to the end without another stop, expecting the rubber to come up to speed with track time. That was a calamitous miscalculation.</p> <p>Those in his wake had stuck with the faster, medium tyres and he was eaten up in no short order. First Verstappen shot past, spun with a clutch issue, before breezing by him again. Then Russell also found him a sitting duck.</p> <p>The exasperation emanating from Leclerc’s cockpit danced in the air like heat haze. Ferrari were forced to pit him again for soft tyres but the damage was done and he emerged in sixth, from which he could not come back.</p> <p>Leclerc was as perplexed as the rest of us as to why the team chose the hard tyres and bemoaned Ferrari’s failings. “A race like this is frustrating and we need to get better as a whole,” he said. “It’s always felt like there’s something going on whether it’s reliability, mistakes or whatever.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\">  <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The team principal, Mattia Binotto, said they had been misled by the data on how the tyre would perform.

The binary piece consists of short settings for counter tenor (the excellent <a href=\"https://www.tim-mead.com/\">Tim Mead</a>) of poems that O’Regan and Wallen had written for each other, both based upon an extract from the writings of the 19th-century women’s rights advocate <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/margaret-fuller\">Margaret Fuller</a>.

Taking its prompts from 10 years spent cooking in as many different kitchens, it reclaims that domestic space as one of intensely physical thought. An ingredients list would run to fortune cookies and poetry by Rilke, a serving of “bad news potatoes” (“for one, obviously”) and apron strings, both literal and inescapably metaphoric.

Successive rounds of IVF have led to miscarriages and the anguish of dashed hopes, and her husband Ed is now living in San Francisco. But what of their last embryo that’s stored at the fertility clinic?

The products of a marriage tethered to a tragic car crash years earlier, they were conceived via IVF; a fourth embryo was frozen, and on their departure for college in the year 2000, their mother has it thawed and enlists a surrogate, resulting in the birth of Phoebe, who will narrate the novel’s closing section.

The two trained dolphins disappear underwater, exchange sounds and then emerge, flip on to their backs and lift their tails. They have devised a new trick of their own and performed it in tandem, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSjqEopnC9w\">just as requested</a>. “It doesn’t prove that there’s language,” says Aza Raskin. “But it certainly makes a lot of sense that, if they had access to a rich, symbolic way of communicating, that would make this task much easier.”</p> <p>Raskin is the co-founder and president of <a href=\"https://www.earthspecies.org/\">Earth Species Project</a> (ESP), a California non-profit group with a bold ambition: to decode non-human communication using a form of artificial intelligence (AI) called machine learning, and make all the knowhow publicly available, thereby deepening our connection with other living species and helping to protect them. A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_the_Humpback_Whale_(album)\">1970 album of whale song</a> galvanised the movement that led to commercial whaling being banned. What could a Google Translate for the animal kingdom spawn?</p> <p>The organisation, founded in 2017 with the help of major donors such as LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, published its first scientific paper last December. The goal is to unlock communication within our lifetimes. “The end we are working towards is, can we decode animal communication, discover non-human language,” says Raskin. “Along the way and equally important is that we are developing technology that supports biologists and conservation now.”</p> <p>Understanding animal vocalisations has long been the subject of human fascination and study. Various primates give alarm calls that differ according to predator; dolphins address one another with signature whistles; and some songbirds can take elements of their calls and rearrange them to communicate different messages. But most experts stop short of calling it a language, as no animal communication meets all the criteria.</p> <p>Until recently, decoding has mostly relied on painstaking observation. But interest has burgeoned in applying machine learning to deal with the huge amounts of data that can now be collected by modern animal-borne sensors. “People are starting to use it,” says Elodie Briefer, an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen who studies vocal communication in mammals and birds. “But we don’t really understand yet how much we can do.”</p> <p>Briefer co-developed an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/22/oinks-squeals-grunts-scientists-decode-pig-emotions\">algorithm that analyses pig grunts</a> to tell whether the animal is experiencing a positive or negative emotion. Another, called DeepSqueak, judges whether rodents are in a stressed state based on their ultrasonic calls. A further initiative – <a href=\"https://www.projectceti.org/\">Project CETI</a> (which stands for the Cetacean Translation Initiative) – plans to use machine learning to translate the communication of sperm whales.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"380e7f2f7a6777bcde5603d149ecdfc4ebf13e44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/380e7f2f7a6777bcde5603d149ecdfc4ebf13e44/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"tamworth piglets in a pen in st austell, cornwall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Earlier this year, Elodie Briefer and colleagues published a study of pigs’ emotions based on their vocalisations. 7,414 sounds were collected from 411 pigs in a variety of scenarios.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet ESP says its approach is different, because it is not focused on decoding the communication of one species, but all of them. While Raskin acknowledges there will be a higher likelihood of rich, symbolic communication among social animals – for example primates, whales and dolphins – the goal is to develop tools that could be applied to the entire animal kingdom. “We’re species agnostic,” says Raskin. “The tools we develop… can work across all of biology, from worms to whales.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The “motivating intuition” for ESP, says Raskin, is work that has shown that machine learning can be used to translate between different, sometimes distant human languages – without the need for any prior knowledge. </p> <p>This process starts with the development of an algorithm to represent words in a physical space. In this many-dimensional geometric representation, the distance and direction between points (words) describes how they meaningfully relate to each other (their semantic relationship). For example, “king” has a relationship to “man” with the same distance and direction that “woman’ has to “queen”. (The mapping is not done by knowing what the words mean but by looking, for example, at how often they occur near each other.)</p> <p>It was later noticed that these “shapes” are similar for different languages. And then, in 2017, two groups of researchers working independently found a technique that made it possible to <a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/unsupervised-machine-translation-a-novel-approach-to-provide-fast-accurate-translations-for-more-languages/\">achieve translation by aligning the shapes</a>. To get from English to Urdu, align their shapes and find the point in Urdu closest to the word’s point in English. “You can translate most words decently well,” says Raskin.</p> <p>ESP’s aspiration is to create these kinds of representations of animal communication – working on both individual species and many species at once – and then explore questions such as whether there is overlap with the universal human shape. We don’t know how animals experience the world, says Raskin, but there are emotions, for example grief and joy, it seems some share with us and may well communicate about with others in their species. “I don’t know which will be the more incredible – the parts where the shapes overlap and we can directly communicate or translate, or the parts where we can’t.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"444668ccd12464bf413ea7b1a60912d21304ac8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/444668ccd12464bf413ea7b1a60912d21304ac8b/0_209_3305_1983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"two dolphins in a pool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dolphins use clicks, whistles and other sounds to communicate. But what are they saying?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ALesik/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He adds that animals don’t only communicate vocally. Bees, for example, let others know of a flower’s location via a “waggle dance”. There will be a need to translate across different modes of communication too.</p> <p>The goal is “like going to the moon”, acknowledges Raskin, but the idea also isn’t to get there all at once. Rather, ESP’s roadmap involves solving a series of smaller problems necessary for the bigger picture to be realised. This should see the development of general tools that can help researchers trying to apply AI to unlock the secrets of species under study.</p> <p>For example, ESP recently published a paper (and <a href=\"https://github.com/earthspecies/cocktail-party-problem#readme\">shared its code</a>) on the so called “cocktail party problem” in animal communication, in which it is difficult to discern which individual in a group of the same animals is vocalising in a noisy social environment.</p> <p>“To our knowledge, no one has done this end-to-end detangling [of animal sound] before,” says Raskin. The AI-based model developed by ESP, which was tried on dolphin signature whistles, macaque coo calls and bat vocalisations, worked best when the calls came from individuals that the model had been trained on; but with larger datasets it was able to disentangle mixtures of calls from animals not in the training cohort.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It could produce a step change in our ability to help the Hawaiian crow come back from the brink</p> <footer> <cite>Christian Rutz</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another project involves using AI to generate novel animal calls, with humpback whales as a test species. The novel calls – made by splitting vocalisations into micro-phonemes (distinct units of sound lasting a hundredth of a second) and using a language model to “speak” something whale-like – can then be played back to the animals to see how they respond. If the AI can identify what makes a random change versus a semantically meaningful one, it brings us closer to meaningful communication, explains Raskin. “It is having the AI speak the language, even though we don’t know what it means yet.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f750d98554d1cb1f8d8aaead4705bf96005563c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f750d98554d1cb1f8d8aaead4705bf96005563c/0_430_3456_4336/797.jpg\" alt=\"a hawaiian crow using a twig to hook grubs from a tree branch\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hawaiian crows are well known for their use of tools but are also believed to have a particularly complex set of vocalisations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Minden Pictures/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A further project aims to develop an algorithm that ascertains how many call types a species has at its command by applying self-supervised machine learning, which does not require any labelling of data by human experts to learn patterns. In an early test case, it will mine audio recordings made by a team led by Christian Rutz, a professor of biology at the University of St Andrews, to produce an inventory of the vocal repertoire of the Hawaiian crow – a species that, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19103\">Rutz discovered</a>, has the ability to make and use tools for foraging and is believed to have a significantly more complex set of vocalisations than other crow species.</p> <p>Rutz is particularly excited about the project’s conservation value. The Hawaiian crow is critically endangered and only exists in captivity, where it is being bred for reintroduction to the wild. It is hoped that, by taking recordings made at different times, it will be possible to track whether the species’s call repertoire is being eroded in captivity – specific alarm calls may have been lost, for example – which could have consequences for its reintroduction; that loss might be addressed with intervention. “It could produce a step change in our ability to help these birds come back from the brink,” says Rutz, adding that detecting and classifying the calls manually would be labour intensive and error prone.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another project seeks to understand automatically the functional meanings of vocalisations. It is being pursued with the laboratory of Ari Friedlaender, a professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The lab studies how wild marine mammals, which are difficult to observe directly, behave underwater and runs one of the world’s largest tagging programmes. Small electronic “biologging” devices attached to the animals capture their location, type of motion and even what they see (the devices can incorporate video cameras). The lab also has data from strategically placed sound recorders in the ocean.</p> <p>ESP aims to first apply self-supervised machine learning to the tag data to automatically gauge what an animal is doing (for example whether it is feeding, resting, travelling or socialising) and then add the audio data to see whether functional meaning can be given to calls tied to that behaviour. (Playback experiments could then be used to validate any findings, along with calls that have been decoded previously.) This technique will be applied to humpback whale data initially – the lab has tagged several animals in the same group so it is possible to see how signals are given and received. Friedlaender says he was “hitting the ceiling” in terms of what currently available tools could tease out of the data. “Our hope is that the work ESP can do will provide new insights,” he says.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>But not everyone is as gung ho about the power of AI to achieve such grand aims. Robert Seyfarth is a professor emeritus of psychology at University of Pennsylvania who has studied social behaviour and vocal communication in primates in their natural habitat for more than 40 years. While he believes machine learning can be useful for some problems, such as identifying an animal’s vocal repertoire, there are other areas, including the discovery of the meaning and function of vocalisations, where he is sceptical it will add much.</p> <p>The problem, he explains, is that while many animals can have sophisticated, complex societies, they have a much smaller repertoire of sounds than humans. The result is that the exact same sound can be used to mean different things in different contexts and it is only by studying the context – who the individual calling is, how are they related to others, where they fall in the hierarchy, who they have interacted with – that meaning can hope to be established. “I just think these AI methods are insufficient,” says Seyfarth. “You’ve got to go out there and watch the animals.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b80a6c1686d20039abb81c2afcbc2a0294c8addb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b80a6c1686d20039abb81c2afcbc2a0294c8addb/0_111_2137_1282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a honey bee on a dog rose flower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A map of animal communication will need to incorporate non-vocal phenomena such as the “waggle dances” of honey bees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is also doubt about the concept – that the shape of animal communication will overlap in a meaningful way with human communication. Applying computer-based analyses to human language, with which we are so intimately familiar, is one thing, says Seyfarth. But it can be “quite different” doing it to other species. “It is an exciting idea, but it is a big stretch,” says Kevin Coffey, a neuroscientist at the University of Washington who co-created the DeepSqueak algorithm.</p> <p>Raskin acknowledges that AI alone may not be enough to unlock communication with other species. But he refers to research that has shown many species communicate in ways “more complex than humans have ever imagined”. The stumbling blocks have been our ability to gather sufficient data and analyse it at scale, and our own limited perception. “These are the tools that let us take off the human glasses and understand entire communication systems,” he says.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/jul/31/india-pakistan-women-commomwealth-games-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T14:42:08Z","webTitle":"Commonwealth Games T20 cricket: Mandhana helps India thrash Pakistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/india-pakistan-women-commomwealth-games-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/jul/31/india-pakistan-women-commomwealth-games-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Commonwealth Games T20 cricket: Mandhana helps India thrash Pakistan","trailText":"Smriti Mandhana scored 50 off 31 balls as India beat Pakistan by eight wickets in the Commonwealth Games","byline":"Andy Bull at Edgbaston","body":"<p>So India won.

There are one-and-a-half billion good reasons for them to do it and another 20 million or so in the diaspora. India’s relative lack of success in other sports (they have won 10 gold medals in 120 years of Olympic competition) has held the Games back in that market. But the individual athletes who have won gold medals recently, rifle shooter Abhinav Bindra and javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, became so famous off the back of it that the IOC has a pretty clear idea of what it would be worth if they can break into it.</p> <p>Which is one reason why it recently agreed to hold its next annual session in Mumbai. Bringing in cricket would do it, too. The trouble is the sport is not all that well-suited to the Games’ current aims. It is intricate and obscure, impenetrable to outsiders and often seems ridiculous even to those in the know. In Tokyo, Paris and Los Angeles it would need large, complicated, single-use venues which the locals would have precious little use for. And it brings with it an enormous number of players, who all need to be housed in the athletes village but very few of whom actually have a chance of winning the thing.</p> <p>Besides which, the schedule is already so congested it is unclear whether the ICC could even guarantee its star players would even be free to compete in it. Which is why the Commonwealth Games is only hosting a women’s tournament. There simply wasn’t the space in the men’s schedule to fit this in. And the last thing the IOC needs when it is trying to sell the game to the Olympics is a tournament their most high profile players skip because it is so low down their list of priorities. Oh yes, and it is entirely at the mercy of the weather, so if it is raining the TV companies have nothing to screen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"02cb77e763088b8cd77cf20dda7f8a1f337be2ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02cb77e763088b8cd77cf20dda7f8a1f337be2ae/0_186_2086_1251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sneh Rana dismissed Pakistan’s Muneeba Ali and Bismah Maroof in a single over.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sneh Rana dismissed Pakistan’s Muneeba Ali and Bismah Maroof in a single over.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The flip side, as every right-thinking person knows, is that cricket is the greatest sport going and ranks somewhere between the Mona Lisa and the moon landings among the pinnacles of human achievement.</p> <p>India v Pakistan, the tent-pole game of the tournament, showcased some of the best and worst of it. The start was delayed twice by rain, and for a time it seemed as though they may struggle to get playing at all. It finally cleared 35 minutes after the scheduled start, which meant the innings were reduced to 18 overs each, the powerplay cut down to five overs, and three bowlers on each team could bowl four overs each and two more could bowl three. Just try fitting all that into a pithy 30-second video to explain the laws to a new audience. Not that they needed that at Edgbaston.</p> <p>There were plenty of people here but it was not the sold out crowd the organisers had promised. Midway through the day they offered everyone free entry to the second game of the day, too, between Australia and Barbados, a sensible response to the fact that sales have not gone as well as they could have. They sent out a press release midway through saying the Games had broken the record for total ticket sales at a women’s tournament but still the stadium has not been half full yet. There is talk that people bought tickets then did not come, perhaps because they did not realise it was a women’s game, perhaps because it clashed with other events.</p> <p>More fool them. Because it was a brilliant match, with more than enough action in it to make up for the fact that India won it so easily. Pakistan’s innings turned on the ninth over, bowled by Sneh Rana. They had been one for none after nine balls but Muneeba Ali and Bismah Maroof rebuilt the innings with a 50-run partnership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-spin\" name=\"the-spin\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-spin\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-spin\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then Rana dismissed them both in a single over, Maroof lbw, Ali caught and bowled. A couple of run-outs later in the innings meant Pakistan never really rallied and they lost five wickets in the final eight deliveries trying to get their total up above a hundred.</p> <p>Mandhana then laid on a power batting spectacular, fours to all corners, sixes down the ground and over mid-wicket. Her 50 came off 31 balls and the match was as good as over by the time she reached it. In the stands they were laughing and dancing and roaring and chanting as she did it, and maybe, far away in its headquarters in Switzerland, the IOC was watching and listening, one eye on the TV viewing figures in India, the other on the schedule for LA 2028.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/31/killing-of-nigerian-street-seller-causes-outrage-in-italy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T14:25:25Z","webTitle":"Killing of Nigerian street seller causes outrage in Italy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/killing-of-nigerian-street-seller-causes-outrage-in-italy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/31/killing-of-nigerian-street-seller-causes-outrage-in-italy","fields":{"headline":"Killing of Nigerian street seller causes outrage in Italy","trailText":"Alika Ogorchukwu beaten to death in broad daylight while onlookers stood by in far-right-led Marche region","byline":"Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo and Angela Giuffrida in Rome","body":"<p><a href=\"https://video.corriere.it/cronaca/video-nigeriano-ucciso-civitanova-marche-passanti-riprendono-senza-intervenire/b2a63286-0fdb-11ed-a2fd-aa9adf96677a\">Video footage</a> of a Nigerian street seller being attacked and killed in broad daylight in Italy has sparked a row over far-right parties’ xenophobic tactics in the country’s election campaign.</p> <p>Alika Ogorchukwu, 39, was killed on Friday in the centre of Civitanova Marche, a beach town on the Adriatic Sea.

There were so many people around, why didn’t anyone help him? I want justice now.”</p> <p>The incident has caused outrage in Italy, which will hold snap elections on 25 September. A coalition led by Brothers of Italy and including Matteo Salvini’s far-right League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia is tipped to win power.</p> <p>A few days after Mario Draghi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/21/italian-pm-mario-draghi-resigns-after-attempt-salvage-coalition-fails\">confirmed his resignation</a> as prime minister on 21 July, members and leaders of the coalition began preparing their electoral campaign by posting on Twitter news of crimes and rapes allegedly committed by “fake refugees” and “illegal immigrants”.

You have to think that when a black priest says mass then there are people who come to me to complain because according to them that mass is not valid.”</p> <p>The Marche region has been ruled since 2020 by Brothers of Italy, a descendant of the neofascist Italian Social Movement (MSI). The party’s leader, Giorgia Meloni, who could become Italy’s first far-right leader since Mussolini, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7JUntsJtSo\">once said</a> Italy needed to “repatriate the migrants back to their countries and then sink the boats who rescued them”.</p> <p>Many on social media accused Salvini and Meloni of spreading hatred against asylum seekers during their political rallies.

There can be no justification.”</p> <p>Francesco Acquaroli, the Brothers of Italy president of the Marche region, condemned the killing. “Along with expressing deep condolences to Alika’s family, it is also necessary to reiterate the firm condemnation of an act of insane and unprecedented violence, which has no justification and which damages the entire Marche region,” Acquaroli said.</p> <p>Salvini and Meloni also denounced the killing and said they hoped the perpetrator would receive the maximum possible sentence. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jul/31/merseyside-police-apologise-to-woman-deterred-from-sexual-assault-complaint","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T14:20:12Z","webTitle":"Merseyside police apologise to woman deterred from sexual assault complaint","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/31/merseyside-police-apologise-to-woman-deterred-from-sexual-assault-complaint","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jul/31/merseyside-police-apologise-to-woman-deterred-from-sexual-assault-complaint","fields":{"headline":"Merseyside police apologise to woman deterred from sexual assault complaint","trailText":"Local rape and sexual assault support group says ‘nine out of 10’ survivors report similar experiences","byline":"Helen Pidd North of England editor","body":"<p>Merseyside police have apologised after an officer deterred a woman from pursuing a sexual assault complaint by saying that because there were no witnesses or CCTV “there will be no realistic prospect of a prosecution”.</p> <p>The letter, seen by the Guardian, was sent last month by a detective sergeant before the complainant had been interviewed by officers.</p> <p>Campaigners said it helped to explain why so few reports of sexual offences end up with anyone being charged, let alone convicted.

Or is he exactly what he seems – and just what she needs?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The author teases out the traces of vulnerability and wariness beneath Kiki’s bravado</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book unfolds with the ease of a Netflix algorithm-generated miniseries. The usual romcom impediments arrive in the form of gossip, scheming, deception, bad timing and misunderstandings. But Bolu Babalola also teases out the traces of vulnerability and wariness beneath Kiki’s bravado, the mistrust and fear that underscore the female characters’ interactions with the young men in their lives. As Kiki confesses to Malakai: “You’re the only guy who’s ever held my hand without the intention of getting something from me. You just hold my hand to hold it. To hold me. Like you like doing it or something.”</p> <p>Kiki makes for an entertaining narrator and the novel’s countless witty lines come mainly from her inner monologue. As the book opens, she is fleeing after a one-night stand with a fellow student who fancies himself as the campus Casanova but whose “50-thread count sheet scratched against my calves”. He embraces her cheesily in front of a mirror: “It only took a few seconds for his eyes to flit from me, from us, to his own reflection. His bottom lip had tucked in. It was honestly like a very uncomfortable threesome where two people were way more into each other than they were you.”</p> <p>Immediately after this, Kiki meets Malakai and the real engine of the novel starts up. The story often drifts into a heavily Americanised snap’n’sass sitcom register, which sits oddly with its UK redbrick university setting, while the general descriptions, reported actions and exchanges between characters can be strained and clunky. However, the central couple have a beguiling sweetness and Babalola skilfully imbues their scenes with a tender innocence that is romantic.</p> <p>• <em>Honey &amp; Spice</em> by Bolu Babalola is published by Headline (£16.99).

During the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/23/maggie-rogers-interview\">Maggie Rogers</a> moved in with her parents in Maine after the burnout from touring her debut album, 2019’s folk-R&amp;B confection <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/20/maggie-rogers-heard-it-in-a-past-life-review-pharrell-williams\">Heard It in a Past Life</a></em>, and becoming a Grammy-nominated breakthrough artist. She enrolled at Harvard, reconnected with herself and NYC, and then – that greatest signifier of rebirth – she cut off all her hair. Second album <em><a href=\"https://maggierogers.lnk.to/preorder_uk\">Surrender</a></em> is just that: a freshly cropped Rogers channelling anthemic 90s rock-chick and giving in to intensity, recorded between her home city, New York, and in the UK with Kid Harpoon (Harry Styles, Florence Welch).</p> <p>Songs such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdrNXRdkuG4\">That’s Where I Am</a> are clean and punchy like Sheryl and Shania, though Rogers dips this in alt-rock on the excellent Honey and the Placebo-like promise of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SylF32J2g8k\">Want Want</a>. Throughout, she gives an exceptional vocal performance, urgent and belting, especially on Shatter, a turbo-charged, Haim-style ripper. Occasionally this can leave you longing for something less overblown, but this is Rogers 2.0: dancing sweatily in NYC karaoke bars and singing lines such as “sucking nicotine down my throat/ thinking of you giving head” (on new track Horses) and rocking out.

There were almost 1,000 more callouts in 2021 than in 2019 as crowds of people headed for the hills during Covid-19.</p> <p>There is little sign of the pandemic-fuelled popularity waning. Mountain rescue teams dealt with 1,489 callouts in the first six months of this year, generally the quieter half of the calendar, according to provisional figures for England and Wales. More than half of those were in the three most popular regions – the Lake District, Peak District and north Wales.</p> <p>“It has been building up and building up, and the last five or six weeks have been really busy and very tragic,” said Margeson. He counts at least 12 fatalities in the past two months, the most recent being a walker who fell from Snowdon, Wales’s highest mountain, last Tuesday.</p> <p>The vast majority of incidents are down to human error, primarily with people being <a href=\"https://www.adventuresmart.uk/\">ill-equipped for the terrain</a>. Rescue teams said they had seen a significant rise in people turning up in trainers, without spare clothing, and trying to rely on Google Maps in mobile blackspots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd4608ccf22c721c01de64dc98f2265c2edbabc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd4608ccf22c721c01de64dc98f2265c2edbabc1/0_194_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rescue team\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edale mountain rescuers in the Peak District – one of the country’s top hiking destinations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We are very enthusiastic that people have realised the importance of being in the outdoors, it’s just that the numbers are so big,” said Margeson, who has worked in mountain rescue for more than 40 years.</p> <p>“And the demographics: the people that would normally be on the beach in Benidorm were crowding off to join a queue for two hours to get to the top of Snowdon, or cramming themselves into the Lake District.”</p> <p>There may be another reason for the rise in emergency incidents, said Richard Warren, chair of the Lake District mountain rescue teams: “A lot of people are having knee operations and hip operations now after the pandemic, and I think there are an awful lot of people coming down off the high fells, hobbling down, tripping, falling.”</p> <p>Mountain rescue teams are staffed entirely of volunteers and most rely wholly on donations as they receive no money from central government. They are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p> <p>As well as responding to accidents in the hills and valleys, they are increasingly called upon by the police and ambulance crews, either for their technical expertise or when the blue-light services are stretched.</p> <p>Colin Price, a duty team leader for Edale mountain rescue in the Peak District, said his team had responded to 82 callouts already this year and were on track to match last year’s record of 155.</p> <p>Despite the return of mostly restriction-free foreign travel, he said the region was getting “busier and busier” even before the end of the school term. Campsites are fully booked in the Lake District too.</p> <p>Margeson, a member of the rescue team that covers part of Cumbria’s Scafell Pike, England’s highest mountain, said: “A lot of people have gone back to going abroad but many people can’t afford it, so popping out to the Peaks, or north Wales or the Lake District is a more financially viable holiday – and who can blame them?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/31/us-political-violence-threats-against-lawmakers","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T13:17:43Z","webTitle":"US faces new era of political violence as threats against lawmakers rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/us-political-violence-threats-against-lawmakers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/us-political-violence-threats-against-lawmakers","fields":{"headline":"US faces new era of political violence as threats against lawmakers rise","trailText":"Members of the House will now get up to $10,000 to upgrade their home security as experts warn such threats endanger the health of US democracy","byline":"Joan E Greve and Lauren Gambino in Washington","body":"<p>Members of the US House of Representatives will now receive up to $10,000 to upgrade security at their homes in the face of rising threats against lawmakers, the House sergeant at arms announced last week, in yet another sign that American politics has entered a dangerous, violent new phase.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/29/pro-israel-lobby-aipac-andy-levin-democratic-races\">Pro-Israel group pours millions into primary to defeat Jewish candidate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As support for political violence appears to be on the rise in the US, experts warn that such threats endanger the health of America’s democracy.

A much smaller portion of survey respondents, 3%, believe that political violence is usually or always justified.</p> <p>Liliana Mason, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University and co-author (alongside Nathan P Kalmoe) of Radical American Partisanship: Mapping Violent Hostility, Its Causes, and the Consequences for Democracy, said the phrasing of survey questions on political violence can drastically affect results. But having studied such polling since 2017, Mason said it is clear that support for political violence is indeed on the rise in the US.</p> <p>“I think of it as pretty low numbers of people who actually approve of violence at all,” Mason said. “The problem is that, if you go from 7% to 20%, that means that there are certain social spaces where the norms around anti-violence are eroding.”</p> <p>The impact of that trend can be seen at every level of American government, from the halls of Capitol Hill to local polling places.</p> <p>The US Capitol police reported 9,625 threats and directions of interest (meaning concerning actions or statements) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/25/capitol-hill-congress-security-concerns\">against members of Congress</a> last year, compared to 3,939 such instances in 2017.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/25/capitol-hill-congress-security-concerns\">‘Medium level of paranoia’: security concerns still loom on Capitol Hill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The members of the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection have frequently been the targets of violent threats, requiring them to get personal security details.</p> <p>One member of the committee, Republican Adam Kinzinger, recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamKinzinger/status/1538647426348859393\">shared</a> a threatening letter sent to his wife last month. The sender vowed to execute Kinzinger, his wife and their newborn son. He is not seeking re-election in 2022.</p> <p>Even those who help administer elections in the US have reported an increase in threats against them. According to <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-local-election-officials-finds-safety-fears-colleagues-and\">a poll</a> conducted by the Brennan Center for Justice this year, one in six elec­tion offi­cials have received threats because of their job, and 77% believe threats against them have increased in recent years.</p> <p>Jennifer McCoy, a political science professor at Georgia State University whose research focuses on polarized democracies, said: “The kinds of threats and intimidation to … election administration officials and poll workers is very concerning and is also new.”</p> <p>The apparent increase in threats against public servants has sparked broader concerns about the health of American democracy, particularly in the wake of the January 6 insurrection.</p> <p>“There is simply no place for political violence in a healthy democracy. The increase in threats and harassment being leveled at people across our government is deeply concerning,” said Jennifer Dresden, policy advocate for the group Protect Democracy.</p> <p>“To be clear, we’re not yet at a point where political violence has fundamentally undermined our democracy. But when violence is connected to other authoritarian tactics, like disinformation and efforts to corrupt elections, that sets a dangerous path for our democracy that we cannot ignore.”</p> <p>While threats and harassment against lawmakers and political candidates appear to have increased across many government institutions, they are not evenly distributed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/public-figures-public-rage-candidate-abuse-on-social-media/\">One study</a> of online messages sent to 2020 congressional candidates found that women, particularly women of color, were more likely to be the target of abusive content. Of all the candidates reviewed, the progressive congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who is Somali American, received the highest proportion of abusive messages on Twitter. Fellow progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is Puerto Rican American, saw the most abusive comments on Facebook.</p> <p>Women of color serving in Congress have spoken publicly about the threats they face, which have become a regular part of their lives on Capitol Hill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4bf80f609b9728d1320c0ce613417c984ef0f72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4bf80f609b9728d1320c0ce613417c984ef0f72/0_363_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who saw the most abusive comments on Facebook.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who saw the most abusive comments on Facebook.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Congresswoman Jahana Hayes, who is Black, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/for-black-women-in-government-highlighting-threats-and-abuse-can-make-it-worse\">told PBS Newshour last year</a>: “I remember, at the beginning of the 116th Congress [in 2019], when we were just spotlighting and highlighting the beautiful diversity of this incoming Congress, but then, on every caucus call, we had members who were getting death threats on a daily basis.”</p> <p>The acts of political violence carried out in the US are also unevenly distributed across the ideological spectrum. According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/briefing/right-wing-mass-shootings.html\">a study</a> conducted by the Anti-Defamation League, rightwing extremists have committed about 75% of the 450 political murders that occurred in the US over the past decade. In comparison, Islamic extremists were responsible for about 20% of the murders, while leftwing extremists were blamed for 4% of the killings.</p> <p>Expert argue the frequency of rightwing violence compared with leftwing violence can be partly explained by Republican leaders’ failure to condemn threatening rhetoric.</p> <p>“We see justifications for violence that are similar on the left and right,” said Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies political conflict. “But we see incidents of violence that are vastly higher on the right and that has to do with all of the normalization of violence from leaders on the right.”</p> <p>That normalization has been on vivid display over the past couple of years in the US. Donald Trump infamously referred to his supporters who carried out the deadly January 6 insurrection as “very special”, telling them: “We love you.” Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House for his role in the 6 January riot, but acquitted in the Senate.</p> <p>Last year, House Democrats, over <a href=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202125\">near-unanimous Republican opposition</a>, voted to strip the far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments, after it was discovered that she had previously expressed support for assassinating Barack Obama and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.</p> <p>In November, Congressman Paul Gosar received the same punishment, as well as a House censure, after he shared an animated video depicting violence against Joe Biden and Ocasio-Cortez. Only <a href=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2021379\">two Republicans</a> supported the censure.</p> <p>Most recently, the Senate candidate Eric Greitens was widely criticized for airing a campaign ad that appeared to encourage violence against more moderate Republicans. In the ad, Greitens, who resigned as Missouri governor over allegations of sexual harassment, is seen carrying a shotgun and bursting into homes as he urges the “hunting” of Rinos, meaning Republicans in Name Only.</p> <p>Research indicates that the messages supporters receive from their political leaders have a large impact on whether they actually carry out violent acts, several experts said. In experiments conducted by Mason and her colleagues, some participants were asked to read a quote from Biden or Trump condemning violence while others read nothing. Those who had read the quote were significantly less approving of violence.</p> <p>“Leaders are actually uniquely powerful in being able to tamp down violence,” Mason said. “Republicans in particular are not using that power. And they could, but they’re not.”</p> <p>Although political leaders are particularly powerful when it comes to reducing violent rhetoric, Mason’s research indicates that average people may have some leverage of their own. Mason’s team saw some positive results when they asked participants to read messages from random Twitter users condemning political violence. For the overwhelming majority of Americans who oppose such violence, the findings could offer some hope.</p> <p>“For Americans in general, I think it’s sort of empowering to know that every single one of us has the potential to reduce violence by simply rejecting it,” Mason said. “We can all do that. All the 80% of us who don’t think violence is acceptable have a real voice, and it’s important to use it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/31/nadine-dorries-disturbing-tweets-on-rishi-sunak-condemned-by-tory-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T13:13:13Z","webTitle":"Nadine Dorries’s ‘disturbing’ tweets on Sunak condemned by Tory MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/31/nadine-dorries-disturbing-tweets-on-rishi-sunak-condemned-by-tory-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/31/nadine-dorries-disturbing-tweets-on-rishi-sunak-condemned-by-tory-mps","fields":{"headline":"Nadine Dorries’s ‘disturbing’ tweets on Sunak condemned by Tory MPs","trailText":"Culture secretary’s post portraying Sunak wielding knife at Boris Johnson denounced in light of MPs’ murders","byline":"Jessica Elgot","body":"<p>Conservative MPs have condemned “divisive, disingenuous and disturbing” interventions against Rishi Sunak by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, including a tweet showing Sunak wielding a knife at Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Other Conservative ministers have condemned comments by Dorries, a supporter of Liz Truss, about Sunak’s dress sense, after she compared his Savile Row suit with Truss’ earrings from Claire’s.</p> <p>One suggested it was deeply provocative for her to tweet the image of Sunak stabbing Johnson, in a parody of Julius Caesar, given two MPs have recently been murdered.</p> <p>The culture secretary, one of Johnson’s closest allies, retweeted an image depicting him as Julius Caesar about to be stabbed by a knife-wielding Sunak, a parody of his resignation that brought down the prime minister.</p> <p>The business minister Greg Hands said the picture was inappropriate, especially given the killing of the Southend West Tory MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/17/sir-david-amess-obituary\">Sir David Amess</a> at a constituency surgery in Essex last October.</p> <p>“I’m sure Liz Truss would disown this kind of behaviour.

Rightly or wrongly, there are always limits to loyalty.”</p> <p>An ally of Dorries said: “It’s quite obviously a satirical image of Brutus and Caesar which has been clearly Photoshopped to provide political commentary.

He said that, following an intervention from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/21/uk-cybersecurity-chiefs-back-plan-to-scan-phones-for-child-abuse-images\">technical leads of GCHQ and the National Cyber Security Centre</a> backing an extension of the technology on to individual phones, Apple should be emboldened to revive its shelved plans to do just that.</p> <p>“The pushback was from a relatively small number of privacy groups,” Farid said, speaking to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) on the child safety group’s latest podcast. “I contend that the vast majority of people would have said ‘sure, this seems perfectly reasonable’, but yet a relatively small but vocal group put a huge amount of pressure on Apple and I think Apple, somewhat cowardly, succumbed to that pressure.</p> <p>“I think they should have stuck their ground and said: ‘This is the right thing to do and we are going to do it.’ And I am a strong advocate of not just Apple doing this, but Snap doing this, and Google doing this – all the online services doing this.”</p> <p>Apple first announced its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/06/apple-plans-to-scan-us-iphones-for-child-sexual-abuse-images\">plans to carry out “client-side scanning”</a> in August 2021, alongside other child-safety proposals that have since arrived on iPhones. The company intended to update iPhones with software that would let them match child abuse images stored in a user’s photo library with identical copies already known to authorities from being shared on the web, and flag those users to child protection agencies.</p> <p>After an outcry from privacy groups, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/03/apple-delays-plans-to-scan-cloud-uploads-for-child-sexual-abuse-images\">shelved the proposal in September</a> that year, and has not discussed it publicly since. But in July, the leads of the UK’s security services <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/21/uk-cybersecurity-chiefs-back-plan-to-scan-phones-for-child-abuse-images\">published a paper</a> detailing their belief that such scanning could be deployed in a way that assuaged some fears, such as the concern that an oppressive nation could hijack the scanning to search for politically contentious imagery.</p> <p>“Details matter when talking about this subject,” Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson wrote. “Discussing the subject in generalities, using ambiguous language or hyperbole, will almost certainly lead to the wrong outcome.”</p> <p>Farid argued that the time is ripe for Apple and other technology companies to act and get ahead of legislation. “With the online safety bill making its way through the UK government, and with the DSA [Digital Services Act] and the DMA [Digital Markets Act] making its way through Brussels, I believe this is now the time for the companies to say: ‘We are going to do this, we’re going to do it on our terms.’ And, if they don’t, then I think we have to step in with a very heavy hand and insist they do.</p> <p>“We routinely scan on our devices, on our email, on our cloud services for everything including spam and malware and viruses and ransomware, and we do that willingly because it protects us. I don’t think it is hyperbolic to say that, if we are willing to protect ourselves, then we should be willing to protect the most vulnerable among us.</p> <p>“It is the same basic core technology, and I reject those that say this is somehow giving something up. I would argue this is, in fact, exactly the balance that we should have in order to protect children online and protect our privacy and our rights.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking about the Levy/Robinson paper, Mike Tunks, head of policy and public affairs at the IWF, said: “For the last few years, the government has been saying: ‘We want tech companies to do more about tackling child sexual abuse in end-to-end encrypted environments.’</p> <p>“As we know, at the minute, there is no technology that can do that, but this paper sets out some ways in which that can be achieved.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/jul/31/maisie-richardson-sellers-star-wars-on-risks-rewards-and-keeping-it-real","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T13:00:04Z","webTitle":"‘I’m an all-or-nothing person’: actor Maisie Richardson-Sellers on risks, rewards and keeping it real","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/31/maisie-richardson-sellers-star-wars-on-risks-rewards-and-keeping-it-real","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/jul/31/maisie-richardson-sellers-star-wars-on-risks-rewards-and-keeping-it-real","fields":{"headline":"‘I’m an all-or-nothing person’: actor Maisie Richardson-Sellers on risks, rewards and keeping it real","trailText":"Her first ever role was in Star Wars, but Maisie Richardson-Sellers is also fascinated by more down-to- earth stories about women, queer love and politics","byline":"Chris Mandle","body":"<p>Maisie Richardson-Sellers has often taken a leap of faith, and it’s nearly always paid off. Before the 30-year-old made her first ever on-screen appearance, in <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>, no less, and before starring in megawatt franchises like Netflix’s <em>The Kissing Booth</em> and <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em>, she worked odd jobs, including for a London helicopter tour company. She would hand out flyers and take official photos when couples got engaged on the trips. Sometimes, when people failed to show up, she would ask if she could replace them in the helicopter. No use wasting an empty seat. “I’d try my luck and ask for a ride,” the actor says. It was always worth it. Every now and then Richardson-Sellers would be whisked high into the sky, to bear witness to the city she grew up in from dazzling new heights.</p> <p>Richardson-Sellers (who uses both she and they pronouns) is calling from Miami, during a brief period of downtime while filming a “queer psychological thriller” about gaslighting and emotional abuse. She’s currently on screen in the cyberwarfare drama <em>The Undeclared War</em>, written by Peter Kosminsky, who directed <em>Wolf Hall</em>. She plays tech analyst Kathy, both tightly wound and smart enough to downplay her own shyness. In conversation, though, she has the quiet confidence of someone who knows they can ace the test, even if they don’t know the questions yet, and her black turtle-neck top and long braided hair gives her the fortified coolness of a gallery curator.</p> <p>“Peter seems to have this uncanny knack of being one step ahead of the political climate,” she says, of Kosminsky. Several of the show’s plot points – the long shadow of Putin, Boris Johnson being ousted by his own government – were works of fiction when Kosminsky began researching the series five years ago. Now the whole thing feels eerily cosmic in its accuracy. “To have that kind of foresight is pretty unnerving.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b98867af7a64e4d6127848726dce7745edbf584e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b98867af7a64e4d6127848726dce7745edbf584e/0_80_2387_1433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I didn’t know about secret agents.

It’s not luck, rather a flair for playing a great hand with whatever she’s been dealt. How else do you explain an Oxford anthropology and archeology graduate taking a punt and trying for the lead role in a <em>Star Wars</em> movie? An agent had already approached her after doing a couple of plays at university. “‘Have you ever thought about acting?’ Funny you should say that, I have actually,” she says. She originally auditioned for the part of Rey (which went to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/daisy-ridley\" title=\"\">Daisy Ridley</a>), and spent eight months attending auditions, meetings and screen tests. Caught out by a last-minute callback deadline, she once used a child’s toy train as a makeshift gun. She didn’t get the part. But director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jjabrams\" title=\"\">JJ Abrams</a> saw something in her and offered her a small role anyway. “It was my first time on a professional set,” she says. “I didn’t know what ‘standing on your mark’ was!” As a military officer, her first scene was a one-on-one with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carrie-fisher\" title=\"\">Carrie Fisher</a>. “I was terrified,” she says. “But she was so warm and gentle and lit the whole room up with her smile. I told her, afterwards: ‘That was my first ever scene.’ And she invited me back to her trailer to hang out with her daughter. She didn’t have to do that. I mean… What?”</p> <p><em><strong>Though Richardson-Sellers </strong></em>didn’t go to drama school, acting runs in her blood. Both her parents are actors, mainly in theatre. Her mother, Joy Richardson, played John Boyega’s mum in Steve McQueen’s <em>Small Axe</em>; her father is Trevor Sellers. “My parents worked on incredible plays that were politically conscious, or heartbreaking and intense. I was always drawn to the power of art,” she explains. Her earliest memories are running lines with her mother in her dressing room. “When she did [Shakespeare’s <em>A Winter’s Tale</em>] at the Globe, I must only have been two – far too young to attend myself. Dad took me to the curtain call as a compromise and I remember watching and hearing the applause for her.” She told her dad then and there: “‘I want to do that’.”</p> <p>Though they were successful, her parents warned her of the struggle. “I’m so grateful for that now. Studying something else gave me a very different approach and perspective to acting,” she says. Anthropology, after all, is the study of humankind. “What better entry into performing other worlds?”</p> <p>Parts of her thrived at Oxford University. She relished the amount of research and rigour needed to take it all in and would often end up in the library until 5am. “I’m an all-or-nothing kind of person,” she admits. “Even now, when I do a project, I am drawn into creating the backstory and over-researching.” She made incredible friends, too, and envisaged a career working for the United Nations. But adjusting to the culture at Oxford was hard. “I struggled with how homogenous it was. A very privileged, predominantly white world.” Even on the academic side of her course, which looked at historical anthropology, things felt curiously one-dimensional. “There wasn’t much space for conversations, even within the syllabus, that were ethnically diverse. Our lectures and the texts we were writing were predominantly based on older white men.” She went to Oxford to relish studying the diversity of humankind, only to end up viewing it through the narrowest lens available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"db8fe929a333c645f50ef16e408005cdef138091\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db8fe929a333c645f50ef16e408005cdef138091/0_36_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lucky break: in the Kissing Booth with Jacob Elordi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucky break: in the Kissing Booth with Jacob Elordi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection /Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Growing up, both Guyanese and English cultures flowed through the family home, and Richardson-Sellers was encouraged to embrace her whole identity. At 15, she came out as queer. Her parents were supportive, but there had been moments of self-doubt and anxiety. “Then I came out to my agent, maybe at 22, while we were having lunch. I told her: ‘I don’t know what to do!’” she says. “She just said: ‘Maisie, do whatever you want. This is your truth’. Weirdly, it gave me permission to just be myself. I thought about, as a kid, how much I’d have loved to have seen someone like me.”</p> <p>She considers “queerness” a fitting way to explain the impermanence of both her masculine and feminine qualities. “Sometimes I wake up and feel more masc, some days I’m kind of androgynous or femme,” she says. Sometimes she wakes up and asks herself: “Which part of me is feeling the most fuelled?” Once or twice, she refers to the masculine and feminine as being in oscillation, a movement we typically associate with a pendulum, rocking chair or the Earth moving around the sun. Natural forces at work.</p> <p>She recently launched a production company, Barefaced Productions, because she wanted to bring more stories by marginalised voices to life. “I want to use the access I have to connect with other filmmakers,” she explains. She co-wrote and directed her first short film, <em>Sunday’s Child</em>, about a first-generation queer woman finding self acceptance. “The crew represented the story being told – 80% were people of colour, 90% were female, including every department head. As a performer, I often found it isolating being the only person with my identity – whether my sexuality or being a person of colour. It can be uncomfortable.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f040ff919fd57883ab7c51fce5f9ac4e636b2215\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f040ff919fd57883ab7c51fce5f9ac4e636b2215/0_811_6416_7445/862.jpg\" alt=\"Maisie Richardson-Sellers by Pip\" width=\"862\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘If I’m able to share my love in order to make other people feel empowered… What a beautiful thing.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pip</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask her what she wants to make next. “I want to make the next <em>Moonlight</em>,” she says. “Story-wise, performance-wise, directing, cinematography… It’s such a stunning story told in such a delicate way, and it steers clear of stereotypes. It’s vulnerable and raw and cinematically pleasing. That’s the kind of filmmaking that I want to do.”</p> <p>Positive representation can empower people. That’s what she believes. “Often, people who don’t necessarily have the same industry clout or connections can find their stories are taken away and told for them,” she explains. “They lose the power and their agency, and that’s when they become misrepresented and diluted.”</p> <p>Part of her plight involves standing tall, and she recently extended that to her personal life, too. “I have made the conscious decision to be public about my relationship in the past, because I think positive representation of queer love is important,” she says. I ask about the partner she has been dating and she explains that they’ve actually broken up. “If I’m able to share my love in order to make other people feel empowered…” she drifts for a moment, and smiles. “What a beautiful thing.”</p> <p><em><strong>Though she is convincing</strong></em> in <em>The Undeclared War</em> as an American cyber-analyst transplanted to GCHQ, Richardson-Sellers thinks she would make a terrible secret agent. “The problem is, you have to be incredibly secretive,” she explains. “You can’t even tell your partner what you do. At GCHQ, they have a burn bag – nothing can leave the building. No documents. Then you retire and you’re completely cut out from that world. You dedicate your whole life to it and then the door is closed.” She learned this from a deep-dive into intelligence agencies, which involved “looking at official websites, the job criteria. Then researching previous cyber-attacks, their outcomes and the implications of them. Because I didn’t know anything about it, it kind of terrified me. But it’s also very exciting.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"edd527cea66d87149599ee73cd0a2c74c1841265\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edd527cea66d87149599ee73cd0a2c74c1841265/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Out of this world: in Legends of Tomorrow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out of this world: in Legends of Tomorrow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection /Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her character, Kathy, forms a tight bond with codebreaker wunderkind Saara Parvin (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm11789272/\" title=\"\">Hannah Khalique-Brown</a>), the show’s protagonist. “It’s a tender, beautiful relationship. They have to make the decision between what they believe is morally correct and what is being asked of them by the government.”</p> <p>In real life, Boris Johnson’s downfall happened almost concurrently with <em>The Undeclared War</em>’s premiere, in which a fictional Johnson was ousted by fictional politician Andrew Makinde (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/adrian-lester\" title=\"\">Adrian Lester</a>). “Isn’t that crazy?” she remarks. “There’s an interesting grey area in politics: what is right for the country, and what is right for our political future. The two aren’t always aligned,” she tells me. How do we know? I ask. At the time of our interview, Conservative candidates are popping up left and right, promising to fix the culture they themselves have been enmeshed in.</p> <p>“I know, right?” she says. “That’s what we need to think about. Who is playing politics like a game? Who is going to retaliate, create more suffering on a large scale for people, purely out of ego? Who is going to be the bigger person, know when to step away from game-playing, make those hard decisions?” I can’t tell if she’s talking about the show she’s starring in, or the real life drama unfolding in front of our eyes.

In particular these leaders cause the 30% of us who are less able to cope with increasing complexity of their lives more likely to elect those authoritarian leaders offering simplistic and unachievable solutions – as we clearly see with Brexit and Trump.

His country’s main goal, Zelenskiy said, was to prevent a global food crisis caused by the Russian invasion.</p> <p>His comments came as it emerged that the owner of one of Ukraine’s largest agricultural companies had been killed in the shelling of the strategically important southern city of Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea.</p> <p>Before the invasion, Ukraine was known as the breadbasket of Europe, a key supplier for countries in north Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

As a result, mountains of Ukrainian grain remain stuck in silos, and food prices reached a 10-year high earlier in 2022, prompting the UN World Food Programme to warn of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/07/un-hunger-crisis-ukraine-russia-blockade\">risk of multiple famines</a> in the next one to two years without rapid action.</p> <p>Separately, the owner of one of Ukraine’s largest agricultural companies was killed in shelling of the southern city of Mykolaiv this weekend.</p> <p>Oleksiy Vadaturskyi, the majority owner of Nibulon, and his wife, Raisa Vadaturska, were killed in their home during shelling that hit several targets, including schools, a sports centre and many residences, the local governor, Vitaliy Kim, said on Telegram.</p> <p>Nibulon, which is headquartered in Mykolaiv, produces and exports wheat, barley and corn. It has its own fleet and shipyard and can store 2.25m tonnes of grain, the largest capacity in Ukraine. Vadaturskyi founded the company 30 years ago and “did a lot for the Mykolaiv region and Ukraine”, said Kim, according to Ukrainian media.</p> <p>Authorities in Mykolaiv said on Sunday that the city had endured its strongest shelling of the war. “Mykolaiv was subjected to mass shelling today.

The league is no longer their primary concern. The focus is the Champions League, the great prize that continues to elude them despite their wealth.

There’s been bad luck but there have been enough setbacks to make it reasonable to ask whether there might be something in his method that doesn’t quite work against the very best, when the pressure is at its greatest.

Again, hindsight may see significance in his tweets the previous week: was the admission of buying Percy Pigs in Marks &amp; Spencer just the innocent production of content for the social media machine?

Haaland just seemed to be playing a very different game to his teammates. Again and again he set off on surges behind the Liverpool back four and again and again they went sideways, reluctant to risk possession with the sort of riskier pass that might give City a directness they have tended to eschew in recent years.</p> \n<p>There were two bad misses as well, one in each half, but even that felt an ambiguous sign. He did not play well, looked out of sorts, is probably not yet up to full fitness and yet he could still easily have scored twice. Does that demonstrate an inherent clumsiness, set off more starkly by the filigree precision of City as a whole, or does it show that, even on an off day, he could give City the capacity to score a type of goal from nothing that has been alien to them for several years?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One game is no evidence for anything, but the sense from Saturday was that Liverpool, again, have been smart in buying a player who fits perfectly within their system.

He was also a longstanding player for Northern Ireland, winning 59 caps between 1961 and 1973 – a record at the time – and serving for four years as their manager.</p> <p>Although Neill’s achievements as a player and manager at Arsenal were modest in terms of the team’s illustrious history, he was held in great affection by fans there for his overall contribution to the club, and was even forgiven for becoming manager of their north London rivals, Tottenham, for a two-year spell immediately after finishing as a player.</p> <p>A central defender at Highbury between 1959 and 1970, Neill was unable to lift a trophy while at the club, and left just before Arsenal’s double-winning season of 1970-71. Returning as manager between 1976 and 1983, he delivered a best position of third in the First Division in 1980-81 and, aside from his achievements in the FA Cup, guided Arsenal to the European Cup Winners’ Cup final in 1980.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"223e6348914225d9a35da4c6c360322cb7a59f3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/223e6348914225d9a35da4c6c360322cb7a59f3f/0_916_3366_2019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Neill, centre, talking to the players at the European Cup final match between Arsenal and Valencia in 1980.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Neill, centre, talking to the players at the European Cup final match between Arsenal and Valencia in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he was sacked in 1983, Neill was only 41 and looked to have a good future in the game. But he never returned to management, instead settling into many years of running sports bars in London, adding in some media work along the way.</p> <p>Born in Belfast, Neill grew up in the seaside resort of Bangor, Co Down, where he attended the town’s grammar school and played in Bangor FC’s youth team before joining Arsenal in 1959. He made his first-team debut at 18, gained his first Northern Ireland cap in 1961, and from 1964 onwards was a core member of the Arsenal set up under both Billy Wright as manager and his successor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/oct/23/guardianobituaries.brianglanville\" title=\"\">Bertie Mee</a>.</p> <p>Arsenal were generally a mid-table outfit during Neill’s decade-long sojourn as a player, and were not particularly successful in cup competitions either – although he did appear in a losing cause in a League Cup final against Leeds in 1968. The side’s fortunes began to pick up after that, but jaundice, and its after effects, prevented Neill from playing in a second League Cup final against Swindon the following season and ruled him out of the 1970 Inter Cities Fairs Cup final, which Arsenal won against Anderlecht.</p> <p>By then 28 and struggling to regain his regular team place, Neill accepted an offer from Hull City to become their player-manager. The following 1970-71 season, as he led his new team to fifth place in the Second Division, Arsenal won the First Division title and FA Cup without him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce4fe58ed53aeda80b4d0b8bb7dca9ac5e877678\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce4fe58ed53aeda80b4d0b8bb7dca9ac5e877678/0_138_2572_1543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Neill, left, with Malcolm MacDonald in 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Neill, left, with Malcolm MacDonald in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Thomas/Bob Thomas Sports Photography/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Hull Neill delivered mid-table finishes over the next three seasons, and from 1971 he was also player-manager of Northern Ireland. In 1973 he stopped playing altogether so that he could concentrate on both managerial roles.</p> <p>Having impressed at Hull as a natural leader, in 1974 Neill was chosen by Tottenham as successor to their double winning manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/25/guardianobituaries.football\" title=\"\">Bill Nicholson</a> – a daunting task, not just due to Nicholson’s status but because, as an Arsenal man, Neill was viewed by some Spurs fans as an enemy agent. Initially he continued to manage Northern Ireland but, after narrowly avoiding relegation in his first term at Spurs, he gave up his international duties in 1975, leading to a significant improvement with ninth position the following year.</p> <p>Although he had hardly set the world on fire at White Hart Lane, Neill’s efforts were deemed impressive enough for Arsenal to come calling in the summer of 1976, when they took him on as a replacement for Mee. A colourful character, chipper, witty and well-liked by his players, Neill fostered an attractive brand of football at Arsenal that was built around a talented contingent of Irish players, including Liam Brady, Frank Stapleton, David O’Leary, Pat Rice, Sammy Nelson and Pat Jennings. Eighth place in the league in 1976-77 was a significant upgrade on the last knockings of the Mee era, and over the next five seasons Arsenal finished seventh, fourth, third and fifth in the First Division.</p> <p>It was in the cups, however, that Neill’s sides made the biggest impression. In the first of three consecutive FA Cup finals, in 1978, they were favourites against Ipswich, only to be soundly beaten 1-0. Compensation came in 1979 when, after having led Manchester United 2-0, they were pegged back to 2-2 late in the game, only for a dramatic Alan Sunderland goal in the 89th minute to seal a 3-2 Arsenal victory. In the 1980 final they were again defeated 1-0, by West Ham, and a few days later, wearied by their Wembley exertions, they lost the 1980 European Cup Winners’ Cup final on penalties to Valencia.</p> <p>Fifth place in 1981-82 appeared to render Neill’s position reasonably secure, and he was given a three-year contract extension soon afterwards. But the departure of key players had begun to reduce his resources and after two of his big signings, Lee Chapman from Stoke and Charlie Nicholas from Celtic, proved unsuccessful, he was relieved of his job in late 1983.</p> <p>Pocketing a hefty compensation package, Neill decided he would be better off venturing into the world of business rather than exposing himself any further to the vicissitudes of football management. With his wife, Sandra (nee Lichfield), a former model whom he had married in 1969, he opened and ran sports bars in north and central London. He also invested in a media management company, The Hub, and picked up media work, including as a pundit with Capital Gold radio.</p> <p>In retirement in Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex, Neill continued to travel to Highbury for matches, proclaiming that “I’m an Arsenal man until I die”.</p> <p>He is survived by Sandra, their daughters, Tara and Abigail, and his grandchildren, Izaak, Zeb, Azania and Florence.</p> <p> • William John Terence Neill, footballer and manager, born 8 May 1942; died 28 July 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2022/jul/31/alan-grant-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T12:08:58Z","webTitle":"Alan Grant obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/31/alan-grant-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/jul/31/alan-grant-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Alan Grant obituary","trailText":"British comic book writer responsible for shaping storylines for characters such as Judge Dredd, Batman and Strontium Dog","byline":"David Barnett","body":"<p>When the comic book writer Alan Grant, who has died aged 73, was at school in Scotland in the 1950s, he was regularly beaten by his teachers for being left-handed, and frequently excluded for rebellious behaviour. So it is perhaps surprising that he went on to write celebrated runs of the adventures of two of the most authoritarian comic characters — Judge Dredd and Batman.</p> <p>Or perhaps not. Judge Dredd, which debuted in the British sci-fi weekly 2000AD in 1977, is a sharp satire on an all-powerful future police state, while Batman is the brooding vigilante who has to mete out justice because the corrupt authorities are failing in their job. So maybe Grant’s writing was in some way revenge for the injustices he suffered as a child.</p> <p>Grant continued to fall foul of authority after school — in 1969 he spent three months in prison for possession of half a tab of LSD, a circumstance that later formed the basis of a story for his 2000AD strip, Mazeworld, created with the artist Arthur Ranson, which debuted in 1996.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ebbf5d52146a38983ed6b918ff1a2758a601f231\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebbf5d52146a38983ed6b918ff1a2758a601f231/39_233_2979_1786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Grant began writing comic book stories at DC Thomson in Dundee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Grant began writing comic book stories at DC Thomson in Dundee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Harrison/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, Grant imbued all his comic book writing with his experiences and political beliefs, though the latter were often as quirky as the strips he wrote. He said in a 2021 interview that he was thrown out of the Young Conservatives for being too leftwing, and shown the door by the Socialist party for being too Conservative-minded, adding that “basically, what both parties were saying was that I was just too argumentative for either of them”.</p> <p>One Judge Dredd story he wrote, John Cassavetes Is Dead, even had the titular law-enforcer questioning the totalitarianism of the regime he has sworn to uphold as he is forced to sentence an elderly man to 10 years’ imprisonment for possessing banned literature from the 20th century, including newspapers, novels and comic books. The story appeared in 1989, in the wake of the UK government enacting its controversial Section 28 regulation banning schools from promoting homosexuality.</p> <p>Grant often wrote in collaboration with John Wagner, who was one of the founders of 2000AD along with its editor <a href=\"https://patmills.wordpress.com/\">Pat Mills</a>, and together they wrote some of the stories considered to represent the golden age of Judge Dredd, including the long-running Apocalypse War saga, feeding directly into 80s nuclear anxiety.</p> <p>They also worked on the Strontium Dog strip, about a group of feared and hated mutants suffering prejudice, as well as more madcap series such as the futuristic detective story Robo-Hunter and the space comedy Ace Trucking Co.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17f627a7af7ddee500ae20e1de8b62b23e4722a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17f627a7af7ddee500ae20e1de8b62b23e4722a7/4_911_4670_2803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Grant, left, with his longtime collaborator John Wagner in 1984.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Grant, left, with his longtime collaborator John Wagner in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Harrison/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their writing partnership came to an end in typically argumentative fashion when, during the Judge Dredd series Oz, Grant wanted to kill off a popular character, the sky-surfer Chopper, by having Dredd shoot him in the back. Wagner was vehemently opposed, and realising the partnership was not working any more, they agreed to dissolve it. However, it was by no means an acrimonious parting of the ways, and they continued to work together less regularly on specific projects.</p> <p>That was not the only time Grant would clash with his creative partners. After becoming jaded with 2000AD’s then publishers, IPC, over their policies on royalties and creative ownership, he wrote a final Strontium Dog story in which the protagonist, Johnny Alpha, was killed off, purely to stop the comic using him again. However, his longstanding artistic collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/01/judge-dredd-co-creator-carlos-ezquerra-dies-aged-70\">Carlos Ezquerra</a> refused to draw it and the story, titled The Final Solution, was instead drawn by Simon Harrison and Colin MacNeil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"210d3f2474e5fdf48ec036fc2a68bcdce15a59ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/210d3f2474e5fdf48ec036fc2a68bcdce15a59ac/0_0_1043_1233/846.jpg\" alt=\"A 1981 issue of 2000AD featuring a Judge Dredd storyline by Alan Grant, illustrated by Carlos Ezquerra.\" width=\"846\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1981 issue of 2000AD featuring a Judge Dredd storyline by Alan Grant, illustrated by Carlos Ezquerra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: 2000 AD/Rebellion</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grant was born in Bristol, but his family moved when he was a baby to Scotland, and he was brought up in Newtongrange, Midlothian. After leaving school he worked briefly in a bank until he saw an advertisement for a trainee editor’s job at the Dundee-based DC Thomson publishing house, home of the Beano.</p> <p>One of his jobs there was writing a horoscope column for a local newspaper, which he would take to increasingly outlandish levels (“Sagittarius, the stars are against you today — it might be safer to stay inside. Do not be surprised if a close family member suffers an accident”). At DC Thomson he met Mills and Wagner, and it was through them, after a spell in London working for IPC on romance magazines, that he would later be offered an editorial position on 2000AD when it launched in 1977.</p> <p>Initially Grant was charged with finding new talent for 2000AD and its other comics, and helped to discover the writer Alan Moore, who penned Watchmen and V for Vendetta, by pulling one of his very first comic scripts out from the slush pile.</p> <p>Grant quit the job in 1980 but was then offered work as a co-writer of scripts by Wagner, who was overloaded with projects at the time. That forged their collaborative writing career, and even after they had stopped writing together for 2000AD, they reunited in the late 80s to work for the American publisher DC on some of its top characters, including The Outcasts, Lobo and Batman.</p> <p>With his wife, Susan, a graphic designer, Grant lived in the village of Moniaive in Dumfries and Galloway, where the pair organised a regular comics festival in a bid to help revitalise the community after its economy was devastated by foot-and-mouth disease in 2001. Considered a supportive and encouraging figure on the comics scene, he also worked with Moniaive residents to produce a comic book in 2020 chronicling their experiences with Covid.</p> <p>Although he had suffered ill health for a number of years he continued to write, his most recent work being a 2000AD story about Judge Anderson, the psychic compatriot of Judge Dredd, in 2018, and in 2020 a story for a special edition celebrating the vintage war comic Battle.</p> <p>He is survived by Susan and by their daughter, Shalla.</p> <p>• Alan Grant, comic book writer, born 9 February 1949;

But as my boss once told me, being promoted is all very nice but then you have to do the work, and Raisin’s follow-up, <em>Waterline</em><em>,</em> was a misstep. His third novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/12/a-natural-review-ross-raisin-gay-footballer-masterful\">A Natural</a></em><em>, </em>however, was one of the best books of 2017, though weirdly overlooked by prize juries.</p> <p>His new novel, <em>A Hunger,</em> is its equal, and his most ambitious achievement yet. It reminded me of those cliched blurbs promising that a book “tells us what it means to be human” – which they rarely do. Yet here is one that does just that, encompassing work and family, desires and appetites, responsibility and identity.</p> <p>Our narrator is Anita, a sous chef in her mid-50s at a high-end London restaurant, who goes home every day to “the second job, Patrick” – her husband of 30 years, suffering from vascular dementia after a series of strokes. Her task makes Sisyphus’s look rewarding: slow decline, a little worse each day, punctuated by shouts in the night and the occasional harrowing lucidity (“I don’t want this life”).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Surrendering her own interests to those of her mother, children, husband and head chef makes her wonder who she really is</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Anita’s story comes in thin slices: chapters in the present alternate with short scenes from her past, one for each year from 1970 – when she was six years old – to 2018. It’s a risky business: we lose the possibility of sustained tension but gain a cumulative insight into the elements that constitute a life.</p> <p>We see how Anita (“I come from a family of nutcases”) has always been looking after others, starting with her mother (“I need you to help me, Anita”). Surrendering her own interests to those of her mum, children, husband and head chef makes her wonder who she really is. She sees herself as an accumulation of past identities – “all the women that used to be me” – just as she sees Patrick bit by bit disappear and her children become unknowable. (As an aside, Raisin deserves credit for recognising how much parenting time is spent telling your kids to put their shoes on.)</p> <p>Anita’s story is filled with the ironies of adulthood. The more help Patrick needs, the more he resists; while for Anita, Patrick’s dementia frees her from his previous controlling behaviour (“he treats you like shit”, as son Matthew says) but imprisons her in obligations. But some light gets through: she plans to open her own restaurant with supplier and colleague Peter, who is more than a colleague, and maybe more than a friend. “Something has changed. A hunger is growing in me”; and hunger is the great motivator.</p> <p>The attention to detail with which Anita is drawn means she steps outside the pages and lives enduringly in the reader’s mind. This is a character-driven story that resists the temptation of a neat ending, though there are a couple of gut-punch moments – which are all the more effective for not being the ones the reader was expecting.</p> <p>• <em>A Hunger</em> by Ross Raisin is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99).

I think it’s going to be soon, because the new leader will get a bounce.</p> <p><strong>Nimco</strong> If there is an election, I don’t think Boris Johnson will stand. Or he’ll ask to be moved to a safe constituency.</p> <p><strong>Gina</strong> I am surprised – I would have thought that the experience would have meant he wouldn’t want to.</p> <p><strong>Nimco</strong> He’s going to think there’s a comeback kid in there. In the last few days he did sound like Donald Trump.</p> <p><strong>Gina</strong> We don’t have a first lady in this country – we elect the prime minister and their spouse is supposed to be out of the way.

I want the equalities department to be an actual department. Then we should look at universal childcare as infrastructure …</p> <p><strong>Gina</strong> Absolutely, it is ridiculous. Childcare in the UK is £1,000 a month; in some Nordic countries it’s £10 a day. We have to allow people to go to work.</p> <p><strong>Nimco</strong> And we should look at a feminist foreign policy.</p> <p><strong>Gina</strong> Womanise the world – and I don’t just mean running the world, I’m talking about female qualities. Rather than saying to little boys don’t cry, say cry if it makes you feel better.

Millions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/17/millions-in-uk-drinking-harmful-levels-of-alcohol-at-home-experts-warn\">were drinking at harmful levels</a> while stuck at home during lockdown, and alcohol-caused deaths – mostly from liver disease – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/07/britains-drinking-deaths-rose-at-record-rate-in-pandemic\">soared</a> to a 20-year high in 2020. The closure of vital support services also contributed, with higher rates of <a href=\"https://alcoholchange.org.uk/blog/2022/alcohol-services-post-lockdown\">relapses and fewer referrals</a> from doctors and hospitals, while large numbers of long-Covid patients are consuming problematic amounts of alcohol, <a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/long-covid-alcohol-ptsd-anxiety-depression-5783805-Jun2022/\">one small study</a> has suggested.</p> <p>The causes for such patterns seem equally clear: the extreme stress, boredom, trauma and isolation of a protracted and dangerously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/12/covid-response-one-of-uks-worst-ever-public-health-failures\">mismanaged</a> pandemic, in combination with Britain’s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/work-drinks-jeremy-corbyn/499445/\">deep-rooted</a> drinking culture and general human proclivity for the relaxing properties of alcohol. These demand-side factors are essential to understanding alcohol use here – or anywhere else. Beer, wine and spirits aren’t unilaterally foisted on to the British public, but consumed with enthusiastic participation by drinkers.</p> <p>But what we’re not talking about nearly enough is the influence of supply-side contributors on our national consumption: namely, the incredibly powerful multinational companies that produce and sell alcohol for enormous profits, including brewers (such as AB InBev and Heineken), distillers (such as Diageo and Pernod Ricard), and both “off-trade” and “on-trade” retailers (such as Tesco and Stonegate, respectively). Alcohol has an extremely long and complex history, but its ever-increasing ubiquity is largely the product of its commodification and deregulation by Big Alcohol.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jun/02/you-booze-you-lose-the-rise-of-sober-curious-tv\">You booze you lose!

Rather than being subjected to intense tobacco-style restrictions, the alcohol industry has so far successfully fought to maintain “<a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/303926567.pdf\">self-regulation</a>” and offload responsibility for alcohol-related harms on to individual “problem” users, especially through the discourse of “responsible drinking”.</p> <p>But alcohol-related harms are not restricted to those experiencing dependency (about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-dependence-prevalence-in-england\">600,000 people</a> in England alone). Even relatively low doses of alcohol consumed on a regular basis increase the risk of health issues, including digestive and cardiovascular diseases, traumatic injuries and cancers of the oesophagus, liver and breast; a <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1470-2045(21)00279-5/fulltext\">recent study</a> estimated that almost 750,000 new cancer cases in 2020 were attributable to alcohol use worldwide, including about 100,000 from “moderate drinking”. Previously heralded claims of alcohol, especially red wine, providing a “protective” function for issues such as heart disease and diabetes are also <a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2021/09/alcohol-free-wine-has-same-heart-health-benefits-as-the-real-thing-study-says/\">in doubt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31571-X/fulltext\">now considered</a> “offset by monotonic [closely correlated] associations with cancer”.</p> <p>The crisis of alcohol-related harms is principally caused by the fact that the profit-motivated alcohol industry structurally incentivises higher-risk drinking. Industry revenues would drop by 38%, or £13bn a year, if all drinkers used alcohol below recommended guidelines, according to one <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30136436/\">study</a>. Companies have a clear vested interest in preventing such reductions, yet it’s exactly this kind of structural change – rather than voluntary and ineffective measures preferred by industry – required to seriously curb alcohol harms.</p> <p>Public health organisations, such as the World Health Organization, have long called for measures to reduce the power of the alcohol lobby through bans on advertising, limiting the density and hours of retail, and increasing taxes and <a href=\"https://shaap.org.uk/news/370-shaap-comment-on-new-report-on-minimum-unit-pricing.html\">minimum unit pricing</a>. Other policies in this vein include mandatory nutritional information and warning labels, prohibiting industry involvement in policymaking and <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)31883-5/fulltext\">coordinating global restrictions</a> to limit predatory capital flight. The profit motive driving constant expansion of consumption should also be curbed through increased <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955395919302828\">public ownership</a> of production and retail. But restrictions alone will not be enough.</p> <p>We also desperately need to start a conversation around genuine alternatives to its use. For starters, there needs to be a massive expansion of free and public alcohol-specific healthcare for higher-risk drinkers that doesn’t demand sobriety as a condition of use, including <a href=\"https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-019-0332-4\">managed alcohol programmes</a>, therapy, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/well/live/alcohol-abuse-drinking-treatment.html\">medication-assisted treatment</a> and psychiatric care. This should also include public development of desirable alternatives such as “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/mar/26/an-innocent-drink-could-alcosynth-provide-all-the-joy-of-booze-without-the-dangers\">synthetic alcohol</a>”, legalisation and regulation of <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15879441/\">lower-risk psychoactive drugs</a>, and promotion of public spaces that aren’t exclusively oriented around alcohol use.</p> <p>Ultimately, this is about expanding opportunities for relaxation, socialising and pleasure in ways that don’t eventually kill, injure or harm. It’s undoubtedly an enormous undertaking given the dominance of Big Alcohol over global policy, discourse and imaginations. Radical and systemic political action is urgently required if we are to stand any chance of addressing Britain’s great drinking problem – or we will continue to mourn it.</p> <ul> <li><p>James Wilt is the author of Drinking Up the Revolution: How to Smash Big Alcohol and Reclaim Working-Class Joy</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2022/jul/31/orbital-30-something-review-so-so-celebration-of-pioneering-ravers","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T12:00:03Z","webTitle":"Orbital: 30 Something review – so-so celebration of pioneering ravers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/31/orbital-30-something-review-so-so-celebration-of-pioneering-ravers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/jul/31/orbital-30-something-review-so-so-celebration-of-pioneering-ravers","fields":{"headline":"Orbital: 30 Something review – so-so celebration of pioneering ravers","trailText":"A collection spanning more than three decades at the heart of British dance misses some gems and adds little of interest","byline":"Damien Morris","body":"<p>Maybe no one will believe the Hartnoll brothers next time they say they’re going to split up again, having now played at least two “last ever” gigs.

There was this huge national emergency, and all Boris could say was “Get Brexit done”. So I just drowned him, right while he was in the middle of saying it.</p> <p>Other cartoonists love Boris as his hair is such a strong signifier, but I don’t have a preference in that sense. I’m not a caricaturist, I come from an illustration background, and to me politicians are all the same. I’m just happy if they don’t have facial hair, as it takes me ages to draw. I’m not a fan of Boris, though, and that definitely makes it easier to think of funny material.</p> <p>Sunak is probably my preference for leader, in an artistic sense.

Around the time of the jubilee, I was thinking back to ’77, the Sex Pistols and God Save the Queen. And it just seemed like a sort of marriage made in hell or heaven, depending on how you see it, to combine Johnny Rotten’s anti-establishment ethos with the current disgraceful incumbent of No 10. As a cartoonist, one is continually looking for metaphors, and this somehow worked as an embodiment of his curious position, his punkish attitude towards the establishment.</p> <p>Unlike some of the other politicians I have drawn, Johnson doesn’t really have an ideology; he has a cult of personality. He is a man of costumes, whether he’s on the end of a guy rope, or dressing up as if he’s about to drive a forklift truck. So it has felt natural to dress him up in costume, and the costume of a punk rather suited him.</p> <p>I’ve tremendously enjoyed drawing Boris. I have the ambivalence of many cartoonists, in that I enjoy the more colourful and egregious politicians, and when they go, I feel a pang. It’s often towards the end that you really feel you have captured them. Now I’ll have to do my homework on Rishi’s tiny suits and Liz Truss’s enormous forehead. I met David Cameron once, after he had left office, and it was so surreal: I couldn’t help looking at him as if I’d just drawn him. I dare say, if I ever meet Johnson, I’ll have a very similar feeling.</p> <h2><strong>Patrick Blower</strong></h2> <p><em>The Daily Telegraph</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed15d149e905d3dde4f865b18f1f7734d98625f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed15d149e905d3dde4f865b18f1f7734d98625f0/24_16_3464_2259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Blower cartoon Blue Boy Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘With the departure of Johnson, cartoonists are in mourning.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Patrick Blower</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This ran in the <em>Telegraph</em> in January, when partygate was just getting traction. The <em>Telegraph</em> had been a big supporter of Johnson, but it had started to go quite big on the story. At the same time, <em>The</em> <em>Blue Boy</em> by Gainsborough was in the news because it had been on loan from California, the first time it had been in this country for 100 years. It was a perfect contrast: this rather attractive, fresh-faced young lad in his nice silk suit and then this fat, scruffy man with lax morals.</p> <p>With the departure of Johnson, cartoonists are in mourning. He really was cartoon gold. One particular thing I found incredibly useful is that he’s one of the very few people you can draw from behind, and you always know instantly who he is. Compositionally that’s a very useful asset, because you can show him from his own point of view, careering towards some kind of disaster. I’ve used that quite a lot.</p> <p>In terms of the leadership contenders: Liz Truss just looks plain weird, so she’s good. She and Sunak have been on the scene for quite a while, so most cartoonists have perfected them. It sometimes feels like a collective endeavour: we are all chiselling away at the edifice and someone will make a breakthrough; you’ll think, ah, they’ve noticed the upturned lip… there’s always something. We’re all probing, all the time.</p> <h2><strong>Ralph Steadman</strong></h2> <p><em>The Big Issue</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fad6e7129a6d5777cfdd95cf6c9aca3cc97c3ce4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad6e7129a6d5777cfdd95cf6c9aca3cc97c3ce4/173_95_4534_6626/684.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson 2019 cartoon by Ralph Steadman\" width=\"684\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I wanted this head of Boris to look like an explosion.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ralph Steadman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I haven’t drawn Boris much, I didn’t particularly want to. But with a drawing you can do something, without having to explain it. This appeared on the cover of the <em>Big Issue</em> when he was campaigning to be prime minister in 2019. There’s a sort of collage under his collar, with horror images of starvation. Anyone who’s been to Eton has a privileged life, and can’t be completely understanding of ordinary people. Boris doesn’t take their problems seriously. I wanted people to think about whether they wanted a compassionate leader, or someone who is just a “fun guy”.</p> <p>I gave him a pair of half-hearted horns. One is a horn, the other is more like a growth coming out of his head. They are an expression of the thoughts in his brain. I wanted this head of Boris to look like an explosion. He’s also looking to the side, looking very shifty. I bet he’s wondering if he can break the law, again.</p> <p>A while ago I decided to move on from focusing on politics. I probably won’t draw Rishi Sunak, I don’t know that it will be worth it. Fifty years ago I wanted to change the world for the better; now it’s worse than it was when I started. At the moment I’m working on a Ralphabet. It’s an alphabet made up of imaginary animals.

I was worried that some people might be offended by the long Covid zombies, but that’s honestly how I felt when I drew this – like the living dead. I had to find humour in the situation in order to keep going. Drawing took my mind off how awful I was feeling.</p> <p>Somehow, during the time that I was the sickest I’ve ever been, I produced some of my best ever work. This appeared in the <em>Guardian</em>, but I also did more than 40 cartoons featuring Boris for the Scottish pro-independence website Bella Caledonia. I hope that they might be published as a body of work, to remind people, so we don’t just move on and forget what he did. As a cartoonist, though, I don’t want Boris to go anywhere. He has been the perfect common enemy. I’ve tried to do cartoons featuring Nicola Sturgeon, but I always get horribly trolled online – women always get it worse, and I was the only female cartoonist with a weekly platform in Scotland. I chose to focus on Boris, partly for the sake of my wellbeing.</p> <h2><strong>Grizelda</strong></h2> <p><em>The New Statesman</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7019dd2def49e7ad6c7d84f0244db6dc20f5de85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7019dd2def49e7ad6c7d84f0244db6dc20f5de85/0_0_1953_1883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grizelda cartoon Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"964\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘With Boris you need no caricaturing skills whatsoever.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Grizelda</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I normally avoid doing caricatures, just because I’m rubbish at making people look like who they really are. I tend to focus more on ordinary people and what they are saying about politicians. But with Boris you need no caricaturing skills whatsoever. You just stick on the blond thatch of hair and… bingo.</p> <p>I realise that some other cartoonists will be sorry to see Boris go. But I have delved down deep into my inner soul and… I’m not at all. He’s become boring now. Everything does, in the end. When Covid came along it was great material for cartoonists, because we were all so tired of Brexit, which had in turn replaced the financial crash and global recession. But Covid got boring, too, and so did Boris. But there’s always something new around the corner to make jokes about.</p> <p>The Boris image that will most endure is not a cartoon at all, but that photo of him dangling from the zip wire with the union jacks. You see that and you ask yourself, is that really the guy we wanted to lead the country? Hopefully people will learn from the past few years and go for someone sensible next time.</p> <h2><strong>Peter Brookes</strong></h2> <p><em>The Times</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f7ca9ad8882164854eeb920eb2b4b3f21afeebf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f7ca9ad8882164854eeb920eb2b4b3f21afeebf/0_0_1767_1221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Brookes’ ‘Human Shield’.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘You can’t really do him better than he does himself.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Peter Brookes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The way Boris used Zelenskiy was so cynical, and so entirely typical of him. He made great play of supporting Ukraine, while actually of course he was using it to hide from everything that was going wrong at home – the fixed penalty notice, and all the rest of it. I was very pleased to find a way of capturing that in this cartoon.</p> <p>The way I have drawn Boris has changed over the years – partly as a result of how he has changed. Ten years ago, for example, his hair was really quite neat. It was definitely brushed, and even had a parting. At some point it became cool to muss it up. More recently I noticed he was going bald, so I added a bald spot – I don’t know whether he noticed, but it disappeared soon afterwards; he must have started combing it over.</p> <p>I’ve always drawn Boris with his hair over his eyes, ever since he was mayor of London. I’ve stuck with that, as it played into that idea of him having no vision. I regret it a bit now though, as the eyes can convey expression and emotion.</p> <p>I’m so glad Boris is going. He became tiresome in the end. A bit like Trump, you can’t really do him better than he does himself. My best-case scenario for the new leader would be Liz Truss, who is so appallingly bad in so many different ways that I’m going to have an absolute feast.</p> <h2><strong>Martin Rowson</strong></h2> <p><em>T</em><em>ribune</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c77572caa892001d2f6f5812c9e4cc383a0e6249\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c77572caa892001d2f6f5812c9e4cc383a0e6249/0_0_3263_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hell.

I realised that they were two cheeks of the same arse. Populist isn’t the right word; they are both clearly narcissistic sociopaths and attention vampires. The only difference is that Trump doesn’t care what people think of him, whereas Boris wants to be liked.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Boris’s eyes are very interesting: close-set and triangular. When he’s lying he always moves his eyes to the left</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Generally as a cartoonist you think about your subject having three key elements: with Blair it was the teeth, the eyes and the ears. Everyone thinks it’s the hair with Boris, but I realised early on that was not the case: it’s the eyes. His eyes are very interesting: close-set and triangular. When he’s lying he always moves his eyes to the left. When things are going badly for him, he looks awful – the eye bags, the grey, flabby skin.</p> <p>I’d been hoping for Mordaunt to win the leadership race, because she’s fresh meat. I’ve only drawn her two or three times. Liz Truss is going to be good fun because her chin is going to recede more and more. With Sunak, the benefit is that he’s so tiny, like a little elf. Sometimes cartoonists develop Stockholm syndrome: we fall in love a little bit with our subjects, because they are so fun to draw. I still miss George Osborne. But Tony Blair was my all-time favourite because his appearance degenerated so much while he was in office, and I was able to track that in real time.</p> <h2><strong>Christian Adams</strong></h2> <p><em>Evening Standard</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c82b24ac6c3475df8aa2dfdc30be6f3a5d186ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c82b24ac6c3475df8aa2dfdc30be6f3a5d186ad/74_227_4725_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Adams cartoon Boris Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘He <em>is</em> a toddler, isn’t he?

He wanted us all to think he was a man of the world, but we could all see he wasn’t, really. I like some of the little details in it: the pocket bulging with cheese; the way he looks like a toddler in his party hat, trailing those balloons… because he <em>is</em> a toddler, isn’t he? A toddler dressed up as a grown man.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I’ve got Sunak down now: he has big ears, like Mr Potato Head. Truss is like a mannequin</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I’ve been drawing Boris for many years, dating back to his tenure as mayor of London. He’s always had big lips and floppy blond hair, but over the years the lips have got bigger and the hair messier. He’s got fatter, too. When you see him at PMQs it is the eyes you notice. He has very dark, sad eyes – he doesn’t look like a happy man. It’s important to show that, as it’s the bit he wouldn’t want you to see, unlike the hair, which is his trademark.</p> <p>There’s no denying that Boris has been a daily gift to cartoonists. Liz Truss I’m still finding very difficult to draw, as I haven’t had much practice. I’ve got Sunak down now: he has big ears, like Mr Potato Head, a big nose and big white teeth. Truss is more indistinct; kind of greasy and shiny, like a mannequin.</p> <h2><strong>Ella Baron</strong></h2> <p><em>Times Literary Supplement</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9804aec8693791d13a06e670fd7e41a279e3f037\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9804aec8693791d13a06e670fd7e41a279e3f037/48_36_3852_4816/800.jpg\" alt=\"‘Boris Johnson, The Golden Monkey’, originally published in The TLS, February 2019.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Boris’s hair is such a distinctive feature, but I wanted to do something different with it.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ella Baron</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I drew this image for the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> in 2019, hence the literary reference.

The evil character in <em>His Dark Materials</em> has a daemon called the Golden Monkey. It fitted so well: Boris is a clown and a joker, but also a golden boy and the Tories’ golden ticket. There’s a shiny facade, but something very slimy underneath. We’ve seen that play out in the past few months; even though this image is quite old, it called him very accurately.</p> <p>I do like drawing Sunak. He’s slick, plasticky and stiff. For a cartoonist, he’s fruitful territory. Truss I haven’t drawn at all, which is probably telling. I grew up drawing Boris: he was mayor when I started doing cartoons. He’s a big, loud character and always fun to draw. But it will be nice to have someone new to poke at.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2022/jul/31/tiktok-video-instagram-revolt-update-kardashians","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T12:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘Stop trying to be TikTok’: how video-centric Instagram sparked a revolt ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/31/tiktok-video-instagram-revolt-update-kardashians","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/jul/31/tiktok-video-instagram-revolt-update-kardashians","fields":{"headline":"‘Stop trying to be TikTok’: how video-centric Instagram sparked a revolt ","trailText":"Loyal users and Kardashians forced social network to partially retreat by demanding renewed emphasis on photo-sharing","byline":"Dan Milmo and Alex Hern","body":"<p>If you’re going to change a social media platform synonymous with celebrity culture, make sure the Kardashian-Jenners are onboard first.</p> <p>Instagram was forced into a partial retreat last week as influencer royalty joined a user rebellion against the app, driven by complaints that it had become too video-centric and was pushing content from accounts that people did not follow.</p> <p>Kylie Jenner and her sister Kim Kardashian – who each have more than 300 million Instagram followers – echoed the concerns of hundreds of thousands of others when they shared a post demanding “Make Instagram Instagram again”.</p> <p>The core accusation was that Instagram was mimicking its arch-rival TikTok at the expense of a loyal user base that wanted renewed emphasis on its photo-sharing origins. The original <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CgVLB1Dj3Ow/\">post</a> by the US photographer Tati Bruening, added: “Stop trying to be TikTok I just want to see cute photos of my friends.” A “save Instagram” petition set up by Bruening has gathered more than 275,000 signatures.</p> <p>Chinese-owned TikTok has shaken the social media establishment. The social video app has raced to more than 1 billion users worldwide to put it on a par with Instagram, itself a former upstart that galvanised the competition so much that Mark Zuckerberg bought it. </p> <p>Instagram’s head, Adam Mosseri, announced last week that the app would row back some of the changes that had sparked the revolt. “I’m glad we took a risk – if we’re not failing every once in a while, we’re not thinking big enough or bold enough,” he said in an interview with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/28/23282682/instagram-rollback-tiktok-feed-recommendations-interview-adam-mosseri\">tech newsletter Platformer</a>. “But we definitely need to take a big step back and regroup.”</p> <p>It is not just influencers who had been complaining but also people who use the platform to interact with friends and family. “It’s not a good redesign. I refuse to scroll down my feed now because I see more videos of pages I don’t follow instead of my own family and friends,” said Erika Cazares, a project management company owner from Texas.</p> <p>Instagram has been trying out a number of changes including increasing the amount of videos in users’ main feed, introducing a full-screen mode for viewing posts and pushing more videos from accounts a user does not follow. In one permanent change announced last week, all videos posted on Instagram will become “Reels”, Instagram’s TikTok-style video feature.</p> <p>Mosseri said Instagram would reduce the amount of videos being pushed towards users from accounts they do not follow and would stop trialling a full-screen mode for viewing posts.</p> <p>Vex King, a self-help author based in the UK, said Instagram needed to do more to satisfy users. King said he owed his success to Instagram – his literary agent found him on the app. But he is one of many users who took to the platform last week to bemoan how it had changed. Wing said his reach – measured in likes from his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vexking/\">1.2 million followers</a> – had dropped sharply since <a href=\"https://creators.instagram.com/blog/instagram-reels-creators-simplify-video\">Instagram started tinkering this year</a>.</p> <p>“The majority of users I’ve spoken to would like photos to be the priority, want better support, a default chronological feed and an algorithm that serves them better,” he said. “I suppose this rollback is a step in the right direction because it means they’re attentive and they’re listening, but they would still need to do more. They could even consider creating a separate reels app to rival TikTok if that’s what they want to do.”</p> <p>Instagram was launched in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger as a photo-sharing app, a home for the millions of snaps people were taking on their camera-toting smartphones. It grew rapidly, from 1 million users in two months to 10 million within a year, prompting Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook to buy it for $1bn in 2012. It shaped celebrity culture, drawing legions of users as it became as ubiquitous as its Insta abbreviation.</p> <p>Shortly before announcing the pullback, Mosseri said in a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CgeQ5DqgSyv/\">video post</a> on Instagram that the world was changing and Instagram needed to change with it. “I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time.”</p> <p>Instagram’s parent company, Meta, pointed to a short-video future last week when it reported a 30% increase in time spent on Reels across Instagram and Facebook.</p> <p>Last week Instagram’s sister app Facebook also announced a radical redesign, similarly focused on driving users to algorithmically curated selections of posts from strangers, and away from content shared by their friends. “Our discovery engine will recommend the content we think you’ll care most about,” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/21/facebook-to-restore-chronological-feed-of-posts-from-friends\">said Zuckerberg</a>, the chief executive of Facebook and Meta.</p> <p>Users who did not like the algorithm changes might need to brace themselves. Zuckerberg said the amount of recommended content on people’s Instagram and Facebook feeds from accounts they do not follow would double from 15% currently to 30% by the end of next year.</p> <p>Experts say Zuckerberg, who is also making a major strategic push into the virtual world of the “metaverse”, will not backtrack.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>“Make no mistake, this is a regroup not a walk back. Meta is clear that its future is the metaverse and short-form video. And the latter means that Instagram wants to be like TikTok,” said Mike Proulx, a research director at the analysis firm Forrester.</p> <p>Instagram and Facebook fear that what many users want is an experience more like that provided by TikTok. According to <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/insights/tiktok-dances-to-the-top-of-the-social-media-charts/\">research from SimilarWeb</a>, the video-sharing app far outpaces Instagram in downloads, and among 18- to 34-year-olds it also beats Facebook. TikTok has a very different approach from “old Instagram”, with its algorithmically powered “for you” page pulling in content from users all around the service, rather than focusing on friends and other followers.</p> <p>But TikTok’s difference is not just one of form. Unlike Instagram and Facebook, the app has always been more about consuming content than connecting with friends – and in their haste, some fear Zuckerberg and Mosseri have forgotten that.</p> <p>“Meta seems to have correctly identified what people like about TikTok,” said Ryan Broderick, who <a href=\"https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FyYmFnZWRheS5lbWFpbC9wL3Rpa3Rvay13b24_dG9rZW49ZXlKMWMyVnlYMmxrSWpveE5UQTNORFE0TENKd2IzTjBYMmxrSWpvMk5EYzJOakkwTml3aWFXRjBJam94TmpVNE56WTVNREF3TENKcGMzTWlPaUp3ZFdJdE9UTXhOeUlzSW5OMVlpSTZJbkJ2YzNRdGNtVmhZM1JwYjI0aWZRLnF3UHR0c2dEeDNMbndlVDZJbWQ2Q2VxaWl4RVBTbEtUd2xGOHBZUWVpX00iLCJwIjo2NDc2NjI0NiwicyI6OTMxNywiZiI6dHJ1ZSwidSI6MTUwNzQ0OCwiaWF0IjoxNjU4NzY5MDAwLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMCIsInN1YiI6ImxpbmstcmVkaXJlY3QifQ.4jFpbBMxF-NVxevg0vvRm2uZxylEDmAhDp_0nuenoeQ?\">writes the Garbage Day newsletter about internet culture</a>. “Short-form videos, remixable video and audio-editing tools that works on mobile, and creators that make stuff rather than influence things – but they’re still trying to jam those features into an ecosystem that wasn’t built for them.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/jul/31/edinburgh-art-festival-2022-review-a-taste-for-impressionism-celine-condorelli-daniel-silver-cooking-sections-sakiya-studio-lenca","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T12:00:03Z","webTitle":"Edinburgh art festival 2022 review – sunstruck blockbuster steals the show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jul/31/edinburgh-art-festival-2022-review-a-taste-for-impressionism-celine-condorelli-daniel-silver-cooking-sections-sakiya-studio-lenca","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/jul/31/edinburgh-art-festival-2022-review-a-taste-for-impressionism-celine-condorelli-daniel-silver-cooking-sections-sakiya-studio-lenca","fields":{"headline":"Edinburgh art festival 2022 review – sunstruck blockbuster steals the show","trailText":"A Greek chorus of clay busts, an audience with some molluscs and a magnificent show of impressionist masterpieces captivate","byline":"Laura Cumming","body":"<p>The tales he tells of my oyster are so mesmerising – how it grew and where, what the shape, colour and undulating nuances of its black-and-white striped shell reveal about its decade of experiences – as to open up an oceanic history.

A whole wall of Vuillard’s secretive Paris interiors is succeeded by the complete set of Matisse’s starbust jazz prints.</p> <p>There is an organising narrative, entertaining and judicious, which is how French art came to be bought up by Scottish railway engineers, Liberal MPs and marmalade magnates. This is told through the highly intelligent captions of the curator, <a href=\"https://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/profile/professor-frances-fowle\">Frances Fowle</a>, who includes a couple of fakes to reveal how slyly these early-20th-century collectors could be duped.

Monet’s amazing haystacks, purple, mauve and umber, against the glimmering snowy dusk, just before the light fades. How could he get that massy vision down in time, before night? Or how could he remember it so perfectly afterwards? Gauguin’s <em>Vision of the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling </em><em>With the Angel)</em> is here, all those Breton women’s heads in their outlandish white bonnets framing the bizarre wrestling match, like a winged insect with four legs, against the throbbing crimson ground.</p> <p>But there are many revelations drawn out from the back bedrooms of museums, including the firing squad prints of Manet, showing street fighting during the Paris Commune in 1871. An X-ray of a previously unknown Van Gogh self-portrait painted on the back of <em>Head of a Peasant Woman</em> appears in a light box alongside the front of the painting. (It is unexpectedly conventional.) Most astonishing is Courbet’s frightening dark wave, an ultramarine peak rising out of white foam, straight out of Japanese painting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba2019c7eb61c53d5bbfc3cbf071639ddebba141\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba2019c7eb61c53d5bbfc3cbf071639ddebba141/0_0_3500_2925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Courbet’s The Wave, c1869.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"836\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Courbet’s The Wave, c1869.

And this was the genesis of a travelling exhibition that has been to Berlin, Rome and Amsterdam, and which opened last week in the EU capital.</p> <p>With paintings, sculptures and photographs from about 50 Ukrainian artists, Taylor hopes to show the cruel reality of war as it is felt every day. “The exhibition is not about the war in itself – it is about a humanitarian catastrophe that people are going through.”</p> <p>Counting every child killed in the war is the aim of Daria Koltsova, a Kharkiv-born artist who fled Odesa when the conflict started. Having escaped to Palermo via Moldova, she felt lost, endlessly scrolling through the news, overwhelmed by minute-by-minute updates on the bombing of Ukrainian cities and the killing of children. She started to make little heads from clay. “It was the pressure that I felt every day, because every day I got those messages. It was really painful and it all started from my way to live out all that, a kind of artistic sublimation.”</p> <p>When the exhibition opened in Berlin, she sat for three hours a day in the basement art space making the heads, each one representing a child killed in the war.</p> <p>Haunting footage taken during this time has become part of the Brussels exhibition. Dressed in a plain antique Ukrainian gown, she carefully sculpts the clay to make eyes, then a nose. Seemingly reluctant to let go, she adds another little head to the pile of screaming faces. “Every time the sculpture is done, I say goodbye and I let it go,” she said. She works to the strains of an updated version of a traditional Ukrainian lullaby, <em>Oy Khodyt Son Kolo Vikon</em> (The Dream is Wandering by the Window). And as she sculpts, she thinks about the children who will never grow up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40bbec258ebc1461f4033ccbc6a19448d293f2f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40bbec258ebc1461f4033ccbc6a19448d293f2f6/974_544_6719_4033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Military-themed embroidery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Embroideries by Masha Shubina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Captured House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As of 28 July, 358 children had died and 693 were reported as injured according to official sources cited by the news agency Ukrinform, although the actual toll is likely to be much higher.</p> <p>The artist plans to create a new head for every child killed in the war: “So many people have died that we don’t have enough time to honour the deaths the way they should be honoured.”</p> <p>Other works consider the aggressor, such as Ihor Husev’s images of Russian classics warped with graffiti. A portrait of Pushkin, the national poet taught in every Russian school, has been scribbled over with lightning bolt-type symbols. The roiling grandiose seascape, The Ninth Wave, by the 19th-century artist Ivan Aivazovsky, is scrawled with the slogan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/ukraine-reveals-russian-warship-go-fuck-yourself-postage-stamp\">“Russian warship go fuck yourself”</a> – the response of Ukrainian defenders to a Russian navy vessel that has become a national rallying cry.</p> <p>These works are part of the “cancel Russia” movement that has led to Ukrainian cities removing sculptures and renaming public spaces. But the questioning of Russian high culture is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/friends-no-longer-ukraine-removes-russian-statues-and-street-names\">not universally popular</a> in Ukraine, nor straightforward. Aivazovsky was born in Feodosia in Crimea, part of Ukraine that was occupied and then annexed in 2014.</p> <p>The exhibition also highlights photojournalists, whose images brought the horror of the war to the world, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2022/apr/03/photographer-maksim-levins-work-in-ukraine-in-pictures\">Maksim Levin</a>, a longtime contributor to Reuters who was killed near Kyiv during the first weeks of the war, and Evgeniy Maloletka, an AP photographer who, along with his video journalist colleague Mstyslav Chernov, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/the-russians-were-hunting-us-down-the-war-on-journalism-in-mariupol\">remained in besieged Mariupol</a> when all other international media had gone, to document the relentless attacks on civilians, such as heavily pregnant women escaping a bombed maternity hospital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a9cda5fab60ef4f9183dcc703681aa2791ddd35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a9cda5fab60ef4f9183dcc703681aa2791ddd35/0_20_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Family lie on floor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A shot of a family sheltering from a missile attack, taken by the AP photographer Evgeniy Maloletka.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Captured House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The final exhibit is not a work of art, but a steel door from a house in Irpin. The occupants of the house, a family with two children, escaped on foot to Kyiv, 15 miles (25km) away. They survived. Their house was bombed to rubble, except the front door. When the door arrived in Berlin for the exhibition in early May, it was thick with dust and the smell of fire. “It was in a sense amazing,” recalls Taylor, the curator. “I feel a certain power in the art and in those original pieces that it will not be possible to show or give in five years.”</p> <p>The transformation from humdrum house entrance to war-torn museum exhibit in under three months underscores the dizzying speed of the artistic response to the war. “I always thought that the artists needed the time and distance to have reflection, especially on a subject such as a war, but we don’t have that time and distance,” Taylor said.</p> <p>The exhibition, promoted by Ukraine’s government, is part of Kyiv’s cultural diplomacy, aiming to counter arguments that the war was provoked by Nato expansion or Kyiv. Such narratives the team encountered above all in Italy, Taylor said, where polls show people are less likely to see Russia as responsible for the war than elsewhere in the EU.</p> <p>In Berlin, people left the exhibition in tears, while in Rome “our social work” was more important, Taylor said, referring to exhibition-goers who put the blame for the war on Nato. “And I have nothing to say to that because you need to come to Mariupol and have this conversation.”</p> <p>After the exhibition closes in Brussels on Sunday, the team hope it will go to New York, Washington and San Francisco next year, to show the reality of war to a US audience. “We are not here [in Brussels] to ask for money or weapons,” Taylor said. “But we are here for people to make their choices when they choose their politicians, when they vote at whatever level of decisions.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 2 August 2022 to clarify a detail regarding Ihor Husev’s artwork of Pushkin.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/jul/31/joyride-review-olivia-colman-grabs-the-wheel-in-odd-couple-irish-road-movie","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"Joyride review – Olivia Colman grabs the wheel in odd-couple Irish road movie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/31/joyride-review-olivia-colman-grabs-the-wheel-in-odd-couple-irish-road-movie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/jul/31/joyride-review-olivia-colman-grabs-the-wheel-in-odd-couple-irish-road-movie","fields":{"headline":"Joyride review – Olivia Colman grabs the wheel in odd-couple Irish road movie","trailText":"A woman abandons her baby for a holiday, only to fall in with a 12-year-old thief, in this clumsy comedy with a late redemption","byline":"Wendy Ide","body":"<p>Some women embrace the wonders and the challenges of new motherhood with open arms and hearts.

She hides him in the family barn, where she and her siblings and other children bring him gifts and ask him for Bible-style stories. Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 1996 musical relocates the action from rural Lancashire to steamy, late-50s Louisiana (the musical palette smudges bluegrass, rock, ballads, gospel; Stuart Morley’s arrangements). With lyrics from Jim Steinman, whose writing credits include Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell, the feel is less Sunday school, more gothic noir.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.tom-jackson-greaves.com/\">Tom Jackson Greaves</a>’s tightly honed production, the tonal contrasts are most stark (and moving) in the pre-interval crescendo scene: children gather in the barn around The Man (whom they believe is Jesus), singing a gentle, chiming lyric, “The demons are gone, The young are strong”. Meanwhile, circling adults in the world beyond menacingly pound a heavy-on-the-bass, revivalist number, “You’ve got to wrestle with the devil”. Elsewhere, though, the book (by Lloyd Webber with Patricia Knop and Gale Edwards) does not present oppositions so simplistically.</p> <p>The 12-strong company of actor-musicians, along with six younger cast members, delivers strong characterisations of people struggling with hard choices in a gumbo world of racial tensions, religious revivalism, small-town vindictiveness and teen rebellion. All the performers are outstanding, but special mention to <a href=\"https://www.roberttripolino.com/\">Robert Tripolino</a> as The Man, Manichaean angel/devil, and to Lydia White’s girl (older than Mills’s film character), moving through childish innocence to burgeoning adolescence.</p> <p>Jackson Greaves, as director and choreographer, thrillingly fuses movement with music, turning his actor-musicians into a chorus (almost in the style of Greek tragedy), expanding the world of the action, amplifying the characters’ emotions and pulling together extremes of every day and supernatural.

With that in mind, there might come a point at which watching the abject <em>DC League of Super</em><em>-Pets</em> may fleetingly seem like a good idea. But then, by the end of the holidays, poking cutlery into plug sockets might fleetingly seem like a good idea.</p> <p>This animated spin-off posits that when the infant Superman was launched into space from the dying planet of Krypton, his puppy hitched a ride alongside him. Fast-forward, and the pair share everything, including super powers. But Superman’s burgeoning romance with Lois Lane causes Krypto the Super-Dog (Dwayne Johnson) to momentarily take his eye off the squeaky pet toy, allowing a power-crazed, hairless guinea pig to wreak havoc on the city.

Washington DC and Philadelphia have declared heat emergencies, activating public cooling centers and other safety measures across their cities, while Phoenix and Los Angeles continue to push programs to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/cities-look-trees-combat-heat-islands-growth-slow-rcna25327\">plant</a> new trees in working-class neighborhoods with little canopy coverage.<em> </em>Many of these short-term solutions rely on water, a dangerous reality given that nearly 50% of the country is <a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/current-conditions\">experiencing</a> some form of drought, with the amount of Americans affected by drought increasing 26.8% since last month. This looming threat has pushed one state, Nevada, to seek a more long-term solution: the banning of non-functional lawns.</p> <p>Lawn grass <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/americas-biggest-crop-is-grass-2016-2\">takes</a> up 2% of all land in the United States. If it were a crop, it would be by far the single largest irrigated crop in the country. Nevada has, due to necessity, taken an obvious but large step in alleviating some of the more immediate symptoms of the climate crisis and bought themselves more time for other measures. It is time for the federal government to push all states to do the same and create incentives to ensure that it happens quickly and in a manner that doesn’t force working-class Americans to foot the bill.</p> <p>The US is experiencing the beginning of a water shortage. A 2021 study found that the drought in the western US is the worst the region has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/us/lake-powell-drought-before-after-climate/index.html\">seen</a> in 1,200 years, and that much of it is the result of the current climate crisis. While lawns are not the largest contributor to climate change, they take up space from plants that could be offsetting carbon or slowing down wildfires, while still doing a heft of damage on their own.</p> <p>According to the EPA, outdoor water usage for lawns and gardens accounts for 60% of household usage in arid areas of the country. And unlike indoor water usage, much of that water is lost to evaporation and runoff. All in all, American lawns <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22662490/grasslands-better-than-lawns-yard\">use</a> 3tn gallons of water each year – enough drinking water for billions of people annually – on top of 59m pounds of pesticides and 1.2bn gallons of gasoline <a href=\"https://afdc.energy.gov/files/pdfs/52423.pdf\">for</a> lawn mowers. These are all relative drops in the bucket given the full scale of the climate crisis, but given the absolute pointlessness of lawns, it’s a few too many drops too much.</p> <p>The history of lawns in the US is deeply rooted in racism and the aristocratic ambitions of America’s ruling and middle classes. In the 18th century, something akin to modern lawns gained popularity among the wealthy elite of France and England, and was <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/the-american-obsession-with-lawns/\">imported</a> by founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Lawns’ difficulty to maintain made them the exclusive domain of the wealthiest Americans until they became widespread in the 1950s after federal aid and a friendly lending market made it easier for Americans to purchase homes and move to the nation’s growing suburbs.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/opinion/fair-housing-act-trump.html\">confluence</a> of federal housing policies, discriminatory lending practices, and newly created homeowners associations allowed white families to almost exclusively reap the full benefits of this growth. White people fled the cities and claimed their own private white fenced fiefs. Lawns became a symbol of the American Dream – a dream deferred, for some. The American lawn represents the worst of the United States, wasteful, vain and full of shit. After all, lawns need fertilizer – which in America comes mixed with herbicides that kill off local plants and pollinators.</p> <p>This mess of negative features is why Nevada moved to ban non-functional turf lawns in southern Nevada. A committee was tasked with determining what fit that definition and created a list that included everything from condominium lawns to strip mall dividers – and excluded individual homeowners and places like cemeteries and football fields.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/climate/las-vegas-lawn-grass-ban.html\">According</a> to the New York Times, the state had spent decades pushing half measures like setting water use limits and creating financial incentives for residents to essentially sell their grass to the state. But Lake Mead, which supplies 90% of the drinking water for southern Nevada, has gotten so empty that the agency responsible had to construct a new pumping station to extract what remains. With this new legislation, southern Nevada is predicted to reduce the amount of water it extracts from Lake Mead and another reservoir by 10% this year.</p> <p>The rest of the country should follow suit. While it will not by itself avert the global disaster we are already in the midst of, it is the kind of commonsense reform that can generate support on both sides of the dimly lit aisle – as evidenced by the bipartisan nature of the Nevada bill. The federal government should step in and provide incentives to states to encourage citizens to abandon lawns willingly, with firmer dates for mandatory removal for locations that fit criteria similar to those set out by Nevada’s committee. Congress could also help by subsidizing some of the often costly replacement of grass lawns with local flora, or by <a href=\"https://www.sunrisemovement.org/campaign/good-jobs-for-all/\">passing</a> legislation like the Green Jobs Programs that could offset potential job losses in the lawn care industry – though the latter is obviously unlikely.</p> <p>There are a number of beautiful proposals to replace the modern lawn, from old school <a href=\"https://gardens.si.edu/gardens/victory-garden/\">victory gardens</a> – which allowed communities to pool together produce and help the government drive down the cost of goods in the midst of the second world war – to simply sticking with local plants and trees that can provide shade on hot days and absorb some carbon in the meantime.</p> <p>This may sound like the bare minimum, and that’s because it is. And it is about time we at least did that.</p> <ul> <li><p>Akin Olla is a contributing opinion writer at the Guardian</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/31/era-of-soaring-house-prices-is-ending-as-central-banks-raise-rates","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T10:24:03Z","webTitle":"Era of soaring house prices is ending as central banks raise rates | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/31/era-of-soaring-house-prices-is-ending-as-central-banks-raise-rates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/31/era-of-soaring-house-prices-is-ending-as-central-banks-raise-rates","fields":{"headline":"Era of soaring house prices is ending as central banks raise rates","trailText":"Policies are tightening when major economies are either falling into recession or heading that way","byline":"Larry Elliott","body":"<p>It’s over. An era of ever-rising house prices stimulated by cheap money is coming to an end. Central banks created a colossal real estate boom and soon they will have to cope with the consequences of the bubble being pricked.</p> <p>In China it is already happening. Banks in the world’s second biggest economy are under orders to bail out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/18/china-banks-told-to-bail-out-property-developers-as-mortgage-boycotts-threaten-economy\">property developers</a> so they can complete unfinished projects. Mortgage boycotts are on the rise because people are, unsurprisingly, unhappy about paying home loans for properties they are unable to occupy.</p> <p>Sales of new properties have plunged and new housing starts have almost halved compared with pre-pandemic levels, spelling problems for heavily indebted property companies, the banks they have borrowed from and the wider economy. The property sector accounts for about 20% of China’s gross domestic product.

According to figures from the Halifax, the country’s biggest mortgage lender, house prices are rising at an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/07/uk-property-prices-rise-at-the-fastest-rate-for-18-years\">annual rate of 13%</a> – the highest in almost two decades. Here, too, the picture is changing.</p> <p>Last week the Office for National Statistics published data for housing affordability, based on the ratio of property prices to average earnings. In Scotland and Wales, the ratio was 5.5 and 6.0 respectively, below peaks reached at the time of the 2007-09 global financial crisis. In England the ratio was 8.7, the highest since the series began in 1999.</p> <p>Within England there were <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/housingpurchaseaffordabilitygreatbritain/2021\">regional variations</a>. In Newcastle upon Tyne the cost of an average home was 12 times the annual income of someone in the lowest 10% income bracket. In London it was 40 times, and it is almost certainly higher now. The ONS figures cover the period up to March 2021 and since then house prices have comfortably outstripped wages.</p> <p>There comes a point where housing simply becomes too expensive for potential buyers, but a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates means it has taken time to arrive at this reality checkpoint. Central banks have made the unaffordable affordable by ensuring monthly mortgage repayments remain low.</p> <p>That has been true around the world, which is why from New York to Vancouver, from Zurich to Sydney, from Stockholm to Paris the trend in house prices has been relentlessly upwards.</p> <p>Until now, at least. Central banks in the west are aggressively raising interest rates, making mortgages more expensive. Even before the US Federal Reserve last week announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/fed-increase-interest-rates-inflation\">second successive</a> 0.75-point increase in official borrowing costs, a new borrower taking out a 30-year fixed home loan was paying a rate of about 5.5% – double that of a year earlier. That increase explains why fewer Americans are buying new homes and why prices are coming down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The toxic mix for house prices is rising interest rates, collapsing growth and higher unemployment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the UK, the Bank of England reduced interest rates to 0.1% at the start of the pandemic and left them at that level for almost two years. That allowed homebuyers to take out fixed-term mortgages at extremely competitive rates, which reached a trough of 1.4% last autumn. But since December last year, the Bank has been tightening policy, and those mortgages will rise when fixed terms run out. Average home loan rates are now 2.9%.</p> <p>Central banks say the highest inflation in decades means they have no choice but to tighten policy – but they are doing so at a time when major economies are either falling into recession or heading that way. The toxic mix for house prices is rising interest rates, collapsing growth and higher unemployment. Of those only the last is missing, but if the winter is as grim as policymakers expect then it is only a matter of time before dole queues lengthen.</p> <p>Last week the International Monetary Fund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/26/imf-slashes-global-growth-forecast-as-top-three-economies-stall#:~:text=In%20a%20downbeat%20update%20to,of%20a%20more%20pronounced%20slowdown.\">published forecasts </a>for the global economy that were decidedly grim. Noting that all three main growth engines – the US, China and the eurozone – were stalling, the fund said risks were heavily skewed to the downside.</p> <p>According to the IMF, there have been only five years in the past half-century when the global economy has grown by less than 2%: 1974, 1981, 1982, 2009 and 2020. A complete stop to Russian gas supplies to Europe, stubbornly high inflation or a debt crisis were among the factors that might result in 2023 joining that list. A global housing crash would guarantee that it does.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>That’s not to say there aren’t good reasons for wanting a purging of property market excess. Rocketing housing prices discriminate against the young and the poor, lead to the misallocation of capital into unproductive assets, and add to demographic pressures by discouraging couples from having children.</p> <p>However, central banks are trying to finesse a soft landing in which the downturn is short and shallow, and the increase in unemployment is sufficient to ease upward pressure on wages but still modest. A house price crash is not part of the plan because it would ensure a hard landing.</p> <p>There is no appetite for a repeat of 2007, when the US subprime mortgage crisis triggered the near collapse of the global banking system and led to the last big recession before the one caused by the pandemic. That is why the Chinese government is trying to shore up property developers and why western central banks may stop raising interest rates sooner than financial markets expect.

As a result, people may drown even as their house catches fire.</p> <p>This about sums up the sorry state of inflation fighting in America.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Fed – America’s central bank – raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, and <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220727a.htm\">signaled</a> more rate increases to come, perhaps as soon as September.</p> <p>This followed a quarter-point increase in March, another half a point in May, and three-quarters of a point in June.</p> <p>On Thursday, the commerce department announced that the US economy had shrunk for the second quarter in a row.</p> <p>While not technically a recession (economists in and out of the White House have spent much of the last several days deconstructing the word “recession”), there’s no question but that the US economy is slowing.</p> <p>This, to put it mildly, makes no sense.</p> <p>Inflation has broken out all over the world – the consequence of pent-up demand from more than two years of pandemic <em>and</em> of limited supplies of everything from computer chips to wheat, due to difficulties getting the world economy up and running.</p> <p>Add in Putin’s war in Ukraine driving up world energy and food prices, and China’s lockdowns against Covid, and you get a perfect conflagration.</p> <p>That’s not all. Big corporations are busily raising their prices because consumers have so little choice. Corporations are using inflation as cover.</p> <p>Prices at the gas pump have drifted down a bit in the last month but are still eye-popping. (Here in California, I’m paying more than $6 a gallon.)</p> <p>At the same time, big oil has hit a gusher. Exxon just reported second-quarter profits of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/29/business/exxon-chevron-profit.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share,\">$17.9bn</a>, more than three times what it earned a year ago. Chevron’s profit more than tripled to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/29/business/exxon-chevron-profit.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share,\">$11.6bn</a>.</p> <p>The two giant American oil companies aren’t pouring their profits back into energy, green or otherwise. They’re buying back their shares of stock to reward investors and executives.</p> <p>Or consider giant corporations selling consumer staples, such as Proctor &amp; Gamble (maker of everything from Gillette razors to Tide detergent). On Friday, P&amp;G reported another quarter of rising profits despite the increasing costs of raw materials and transportation. How did it manage this feat? By raising its prices even more.</p> <p>Meanwhile, half of the recent rise in grocery prices is from beef, pork and poultry. Just four large conglomerates control these markets, and they’ve been coordinating their price increases to score large profits – here again, using “inflation” as an excuse.</p> <p>If markets were competitive, companies would keep their prices down to prevent competitors from grabbing away customers. But they’re raising prices even as they rake in record profits.</p> <p>The Fed’s firehose is hitting none of this.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we’re told not to worry because the labor market is doing just fine.</p> <p>Rubbish.</p> <p>There are two aspects to the labor market – jobs and wages. The number of jobs has been increasing nicely. Let’s hope this continues. But hourly wages have plummeted, when adjusted for inflation.</p> <p>If the Fed keeps raising interest rates – even if the national economy avoids an official “recession” – most workers will fall even further behind.</p> <p>The living standards of nearly everyone who borrows money are already dropping. Because of the Fed’s rate hikes, the average rate on credit card debt has reached 17.25% (up from 16.34% in March, before the Fed began raising interest rates). Rates on student loans, car loans and mortgages are also rising.</p> <p>The government should use a firehose better aimed at the conflagration, which won’t so badly burden the bottom 80%.</p> <p>For starters, impose a temporary windfall profits tax on big oil, on giant sellers of consumer staples and on big ag. This would reduce their incentive to engage in price gouging.</p> <p>Bolder antitrust enforcement – even the threat to block mergers and break up giant companies – could also reduce their ardor to raise prices.</p> <p>If Congress refuses to allow the government to use its bargaining power to reduce the prices of pharmaceuticals, big pharma is a good candidate for temporary price controls. (FDR controlled prices via executive order.)</p> <p>Finally, higher taxes on the wealthy – such as Democrats seem finally ready to enact – will help dampen total demand, thereby dousing some of the inflation fire.</p> <p>The Fed’s single tool for fire-fighting – interest-rate increases – is aimed in the wrong direction. It’s hitting working people rather than corporations responsible for most price increases (over and above the rising costs of global supplies).</p> <p>We need to fight rising prices, not working people.</p> <ul> <li><p>Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/saving-capitalism-for-the-many-not-the-few/9780345806222\">Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-common-good-9780525436379/9780525436379\">The Common Good</a>.

But that ignores the exertions of everyday life","byline":"Alex Clark","body":"<p>In the latest round of scolding women and pretending it’s for their own good comes the news that we’re not doing enough exercise – at least of the “vigorous” sort. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/25/almost-half-british-women-no-vigorous-exercise-survey\" title=\"\">According to Nuffield Health</a>, 47% of women they surveyed hadn’t engaged in activities such as running, swimming or a class at the gym that would help them to keep fit and healthy in mind and body; markedly more than men, of whom only just over a third responded similarly. Two-thirds of the women, and half of the men, cited a lack of motivation; other reasons included not knowing where to start, and simply not having enough time.</p> <p>To be clear, it’s not Nuffield doing the telling-off – more what we might call the discourse that greeted their findings, which immediately started to discuss issues of childcare deficits and the heavier burden of unpaid labour that continues to fall on women and prevent them from getting to Zumba. But although these barriers to exercise are demonstrably valid, they also reinforce the idea that we are failing to do something we ought.</p> <p>Despite an early and traumatic encounter with a school vaulting horse, I come to praise crunches, not to bury them. Looking after your physical self is clearly worthwhile, especially when the march of time threatens creaking joints and energy dips; and we all feel better after a bracing walk (it is widely reported).</p> <p>It is perhaps the notion of vigorousness that prompts my caution, not least because it is surely subjective and doesn’t take into account an individual’s starting point. For those who are unfit, or with mobility and other health issues, one person’s cool-down might represent an unattainable goal (apparent or actual). Nuffield does recommend an incremental approach – work up to your daily 10,000 steps by starting with 2,000, for example – but even that rough mile will be daunting to many.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The message that keeping fit is a duty of care is often betrayed around us, sometimes subtly and sometimes egregiously.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Others have a more Bartleby-like response to exercise: they would simply prefer not to, perhaps out of a visceral dislike, or they find it boring, or because their time is filled with things they regard as more important. Perhaps, indeed, those things <em>are</em> more important: they involve caring for others, or volunteering to help those outside one’s own circle, or even getting to grips with larger personal problems than slack muscle tone. I phrase it like that – rather than maintaining cardiovascular health or building core strength – because the dividing lines are still blurry between physical fitness and the presentation of one’s outer body to others, no matter how many recipes for chia seed smoothies the wellness industry pumps out.</p> <p>It is hard, of course, to imagine a modern-day equivalent of the American fitness instructor Debbie Drake, who in 1960 became the first woman to present a daily fitness TV show and who released an album entitled <em>How </em><em>to Keep Your Husband Happy</em>. (If you are in need of a fillip between squats, do glance at her appearance on the Johnny Carson show, in which she, in frilled yellow leotard and sheer black tights, inducted the talkshow host, who had least removed his suit jacket but not his tie, into the magic of hip undulations.) But the message that, nowadays, keeping fit is primarily a duty of care to oneself, is so often betrayed all around us, sometimes subtly and sometimes egregiously.</p> <p>Thus it is, for instance, that the body positivity movement has to contend with the outpouring of concern over the health of larger women, when the merest excavation reveals that concern to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/aug/30/demoted-dismissed-weight-size-ceiling-work-discrimination\" title=\"\">disgust and repulsion</a>.</p> <p>Rather than despairing at our own failure to measure up, redefining success might help. On a podcast about books that I present, my co-host and I regularly begin with a two-minute chit-chat about gardening, and the horticultural element of our postbag greatly outweighs the literary. While deadheading might not be vigorous, digging over a veg patch certainly is, and so is mowing, and large-scale pruning and humping about sacks of well-rotted manure. Why should that not count as my exercise, and elevate me out of the benighted 47%? Ditto kitchen disco, pet-wrangling, the countless trips up and down the supermarket middle aisle and wrestling a super-kingsize duvet into its cover?</p> <p>Meanwhile, the world outside our bodies needs our attention: as almost everyone has noticed, we’re not doing so well.

Just when tourism officials think it can’t get better, it does. Athens is bracing for a million visitors this week; record numbers are flocking to the islands – jellyfish notwithstanding – and there are holidaying celebrities galore.</p> <p>“This year the whole world is voting [for] Greece,” the country’s tourism minister, Vassilis Kikilias told the <em>Observer</em>. “We have a war in Europe, a pandemic that is still with us, an energy crisis, global uncertainty, inflation, tensions with Turkey and even jellyfish and yet they’re still coming. Arrivals on popular islands are up 20%.”</p> <p>In the Greek capital it can’t get much better either: after the lost years of coronavirus holidaymakers have returned en masse, teeming through the streets of the city’s historic centre and thronging archaeological sites.</p> <p>Figures already point to a tourist season that will outstrip the country’s all-time record of attracting 33.1 million visitors – more than three times Greece’s total population – in 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc5b2868dfd340b5e92ec848e41edd95b687c67f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc5b2868dfd340b5e92ec848e41edd95b687c67f/358_144_1271_855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elon Musk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elon Musk, who flew to Mykonos, was one of many celebrities to visit Greece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lily Lawrence/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Costas Lavidas who runs the kebab shop that first made his grandfather famous back in the 1950s, the holidaymakers are a life saver. “What’s certain is that if it weren’t for tourists I wouldn’t have the business that I have,” he said, placing sticks of marinated pork on the grill behind him as queues formed outside the eatery off Syntagma Square in Athens. “Thank God they’re here!”</p> <p>It’s not only resort islands that are reporting a significant rise in arrivals. Demand for cruises has also rocketed, with over 700 liners expected to dock at Greek ports in 2022. “There has been a 280% increase in the port of Thessaloniki and a 130% increase in Piraeus,” Kikilias said.</p> <p>Flights into Athens’s international airport – among the few in Europe not to be blighted by delays this summer – have jumped by 20%. The surge is such that if there is any problem at all it is finding enough workers to staff the industry. In recent months resorts and hotels have drafted Ukrainian refugees to help fill posts.</p> <p>“As of 2 March there have been nine direct flights from the US to Athens every day. It’s been a game-changer,” added Kikilias. “Around 500,000 Americans are expected to come by November. They’re big spenders and with the dollar to euro rate they can spend even more.”</p> <p>Greece earned €18.2bn in tourist revenues in 2019 and just over €10bn last year when Greece <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/14/greece-to-ditch-quarantine-for-tourists-who-are-vaccinated-or-test-negative\" title=\"\">opened its borders</a> in May. Speaking to CNN last Thursday the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said he thought officials would be “pleasantly surprised” once they “did the math” at the end of the season.</p> <p>“Greece is doing particularly well this summer,” he told the US network. “We’ve put a lot of effort in upgrading our tourism product, making sure that all new investments in tourism are sustainable. We saw this year the tourism season start very early and I expect it to end very late.”</p> <p>In an economy so reliant on the sector – tourism accounts for 25% of Greece’s economic output and one in five jobs – the travel bug that appears to have taken a hold post-Covid has had the effect of being more than just a psychological balm.</p> <p>Away from the rosy figures, Greeks know they are in store for a tough winter. Inflation hit 11.5% – a 28-year high – this month, according to data released by Eurostat on Friday. In a nation where the minimum wage is €713 a month and an estimated 43 % of the labour force can’t afford to take a holiday, prices have soared.</p> <p>“There’s a very large number of people in this country who work for less than €1,000 a month,” said Nikos Vettas, an economics academic who heads the influential IOBE think tank.</p> <p>“Greek incomes are lower than average salaries in the EU, not least because of the crisis years,” he added, referring to the tough austerity that was the price of international bailouts to avoid the debt-stricken nation going bust. As such, the surge in prices for many households had been a shock.</p> <p>“We’re an economy still in recovery, an economy that has shrunk 25%,” Vettas said. “Although it’s now growing faster than many others in Europe thanks in part to tourism, the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine are huge threats that cannot be ignored.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/jul/31/has-history-got-it-wrong-about-oliver-cromwells-persecution-of-catholics","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"Has history got it wrong about Oliver Cromwell’s persecution of Catholics?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/31/has-history-got-it-wrong-about-oliver-cromwells-persecution-of-catholics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/jul/31/has-history-got-it-wrong-about-oliver-cromwells-persecution-of-catholics","fields":{"headline":"Has history got it wrong about Oliver Cromwell’s persecution of Catholics?","trailText":"Hundreds of lost documents have been unearthed revealing the Puritan leader’s radical views on religious freedom","byline":"Donna Ferguson","body":"<p>Oliver Cromwell was far more committed to religious freedom and equality than historians previously thought, according to new research. The findings suggest he wanted Jews to be allowed to practise openly in England and Irish Catholics to have the right to worship freely, as long as it was in private.</p> <p>Academics have unearthed an obscure 17th-century pamphlet which reveals that despite his bloody and well-established reputation as a ruthless persecutor of Catholics in Ireland, in 1650 Cromwell was actually willing to allow Irish Catholics the freedom to privately practise their religion without interference.</p> <p>Newly discovered documents, detailing meetings the Puritan leader had with lawyers, merchants and clergymen in 1655, also reveal for the first time the precise reasons why Cromwell “strongly supported” the readmission of Jews to England and his willingness to offer them religious freedom. “Cromwell’s commitment to religious freedom and religious equality is much more radical than a lot of historians have thought,” said John Morrill, emeritus professor of British and Irish history at Cambridge University.</p> <p>Along with eight other scholars, Morrill has spent the last 11 years hunting down and examining the 1,253 documents containing Cromwell’s words that exist in libraries and archives all over the world: “Cromwell thinks that persecution is always counterproductive, because if you target militants, you finish up radicalising moderates. He also believes the way to convert people isn’t by persecution, but by kindness.”</p> <p>Traditionally, historians have argued that Cromwell invaded Ireland in 1649 to punish the Catholic Irish nation and commit atrocities, which led to an immense transfer of wealth and power from Irish Catholics to English Protestants. “However, our general review of his letters and speeches in Ireland shows his principal purpose for going to Ireland was, in fact, to deal with the Royalists problem,” said Morrill.</p> <p>Many English Royalists had fled to the sanctuary of Ireland to regroup after Cromwell executed Charles I, and were forming new alliances with Irish Catholic confederates and Ulster Scots: “Those are the people he treats most harshly in Ireland.”</p> <p>A key piece of evidence historians have previously relied upon to demonstrate that Cromwell despised Catholics is <a href=\"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo2/A87205.0001.001?view=toc\" title=\"\">a declaration he made denouncing the Irish Catholic clergy</a>, printed in London in 1650. Morrill and his team unearthed two earlier versions of this declaration, printed only in Ireland, with a different title.</p> <p>“The new versions we found make it clear that while Cromwell is severely critical of the Irish clergy for stimulating rebellion and supporting the massacre of Protestants, he is trying to demonstrate to the ordinary people of Ireland that they have nothing to fear from him,” Morrill said. “That what the priests have told the people – that he’s come to ‘extirpate’ or destroy Catholics and Catholicism in Ireland – is completely untrue, and on the contrary, he’s going to protect religious freedom in Ireland.”</p> <p>The Irish versions of the pamphlet claim Cromwell will tolerate private Catholic worship and ordinary Catholics will not be made to conform to Protestantism.</p> <p>Although Cromwell later killed dozens of Irish priests and forced hundreds more into exile, Morrill – who is himself an ordained Roman Catholic deacon – argues this happened because Cromwell was convinced many priests had instigated the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/07/irish-rebellion-archive-online\" title=\"\">1641 rebellion</a>, where terrible atrocities were inflicted on Protestants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f4ba162fe2eddff947354e3c7d57ee3a508d52e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f4ba162fe2eddff947354e3c7d57ee3a508d52e/0_11_2787_3484/800.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Cromwell (1599 - 1658) from a portrait attributed to Van Dyck\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Cromwell (1599 - 1658) from a portrait attributed to Van Dyck.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is little in Cromwell’s writings, he said, to suggest Cromwell wanted to persecute Catholics for being Catholic, rather than for their politics and supporting the king.</p> <p>This fits in with documents his team found, showing Cromwell negotiated with the prominent Catholics to agree that, if they guarantee political loyalty and live peacefully with him, he will give them religious freedom.</p> <p>Other newly discovered correspondence upholds the sincerity and provenance of a letter historians have, until now, doubted Cromwell wrote to a French cardinal. In it, Cromwell conveys he is currently prevented by parliament from fulfilling his desire to offer more freedom to Catholics, but the cardinal has evidence Catholics suffer less persecution under Cromwell than his predecessors, the Stuart Kings.</p> <p>Many of the original documents the academics tracked down, often using web catalogues and newly digitised archives, have been thought missing for hundreds of years or were incompetently transcribed in the 18th century. This includes precise accounts of meetings revealing how keen Cromwell was to invite Jews, who were expelled by Edward I in 1290, back to England. “He wanted Jews who could help finance trade with the Caribbean and he had no problem with granting religious freedom to get their expertise.”</p> <p>Lawyers “rather grudgingly” informed Cromwell Jews could lawfully return, but he would not be able to give them new rights without parliament’s agreement, which he wasn’t going to get. “So he does what he can, allowing them to come back and have a synagogue and a burial ground. And from that time on, there were Jews back in England.”</p> <p>The research will be published in a three-volume book, <em><a href=\"https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9780199587896\" title=\"\">The Letters, Writings and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell</a></em>, in September. Morrill hopes it will offer a more nuanced view of Cromwell as “a flawed man, who was deeply tolerant, but struggled with the responsibilities of power in a fractured and divided nation”.</p> <p>Essex University professor John Walter, an expert on early modern history, said the “exciting” documents Morrill has unearthed suggest Cromwell was actually an extraordinarily tolerant leader by the standards of the time: “Morrill is absolutely right to pose this representation of Cromwell as a complex and godly man who – not least for political reasons – wants to readmit Jews to England and produce stability in Ireland, by offering religious freedom to Catholics,” he said.</p> <p>In the 17th century, Royalist and Catholic propaganda painted Cromwell as a man of blood and violence, and historians have, until now, failed to properly interrogate the accuracy of this portrayal, he said. “This analysis is rightly saying: look at these key documents and think again.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/31/us-airman-daniel-mcgovern-cameraman-hiroshima-nagasaki","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"US airman who rescued film of A-bomb horrors is honoured at last","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/us-airman-daniel-mcgovern-cameraman-hiroshima-nagasaki","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/31/us-airman-daniel-mcgovern-cameraman-hiroshima-nagasaki","fields":{"headline":"US airman who rescued film of A-bomb horrors is honoured at last","trailText":"Cameraman Daniel McGovern copied footage of Hiroshima and Nagasaki devastation to ensure lessons were learned","byline":"Rory Carroll","body":"<p>The photograph shows devastation in Nagasaki after the atomic bomb: a scorched wilderness where there was once a city.

Joe McCabe, a journalist from McGovern’s native County Monaghan in Ireland, has pieced together his remarkable life in a biography, <a href=\"https://www.rebelstoreels.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Rebels to Reels</em></a>, published earlier this month after 20 years of research, including interviews with McGovern before his death in 2005.</p> <p>McGovern’s relatives travelled to Monaghan last week for the unveiling of a plaque. “I’m overwhelmed. It’s such a surprise to see my uncle Dan and his family recognised,” said Michael McGovern, a nephew.</p> <p>The research has revealed that McGovern bore witness not only to the dawn of the atomic age but also Ireland’s revolution, Franklin Roosevelt’s White House, wartime Hollywood and the so-called Roswell incident that entered UFO lore.</p> <p>His presence at key moments in the 20th century has elicited comparisons to Forrest Gump, the fictional character who stumbled through historical events. “Dan was the most interesting person I ever met,” said McCabe.</p> <p>McGovern was born in Monaghan town in 1905, the son of a policeman. During Ireland’s 1919-21 war of independence, still a boy, he hitched rides with the Black and Tans, a British military force.</p> <p>The family moved to the US and McGovern, nicknamed Big Mack for his 6ft 5in frame, joined the air force, ending up in its artistic wing, the First Motion Picture Unit. He was a photographer for President Roosevelt before setting up an air force camera training school in Hollywood, where he encountered Ronald Reagan, Clark Gable and other stars.</p> <p>McGovern flew bombing missions over Germany – surviving two crashes – and filmed footage used in a 1944 documentary, <em>The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress</em>.</p> <p>His defining work came in Japan a year later, where he took still photographs and filmed with 35mm in black and white and Technicolor.</p> <p>The fields around Nagasaki were bleached white and the city looked as if a “massive anvil” had flattened it, he later told McCabe. At a ruined school he filmed the bodies of children amid piles of skulls. “Hundreds of kids had been sucked out through the windows. We were always finding bones.”</p> <p>He filmed harrowing scenes at overwhelmed hospitals, including the agony of a 16-year-old boy named Sumiteru Taniguchi. “His whole back just looked like a bowl of bubbling tomatoes.”</p> <p>Other patients had rashes, hair loss and bleeding from the nose and mouth – a mysterious malady later identified as radiation sickness.</p> <p>McGovern also captured the phenomenon of people who had been atomised yet left shadows caused by radiant heat. The two atomic bombs are estimated to have killed more than 200,000 people.</p> <p>McGovern’s teams amassed 100,000ft of colour footage and enlisted the help of a Japanese newsreel service, Nippon Eigasha, which had 26,000ft of black-and-white footage, much shot before the Americans had arrived. The Irishman helped edit the Japanese footage into a documentary called <em>Effects of the Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki</em>, and planned to turn the colour footage into another one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jun/28/many-people-dont-know-this-the-artist-shining-a-light-on-nuclear-testing\">‘Many people don’t know this’: the artist shining a light on nuclear testing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Authorities in Washington, however, classified the material as secret in 1946. “They didn’t want the American public seeing the horrors,” McGovern said. He discreetly made copies at the Pentagon. He stored one set at an air force motion picture depository in Dayton, Ohio, and kept another set himself.</p> <p>Years passed – McGovern witnessed rocket tests and debunked theories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/08/roswell-incident-66th-anniversary-google-doodle\" title=\"\">aliens at Roswell </a>as “a load of crap” – and then in 1967 a US Congressional committee that included Robert Kennedy asked to see the atomic bomb footage. The material had been declassified but no one could find the originals.

You feel that John Banville may sometimes resent the way that people have rushed to embrace Benjamin Black (although I’m sure his bank manager isn’t complaining). Joyce Carol Oates’s mysteries written under the pseudonym Rosamond Smith outsold all but a handful of the (many) books published under her own name. Stephanie Merritt (also an <em>Observer</em> critic) has written a series of superior literary thrillers, from her excellent debut, <em>Gaveston</em>, in 2002, to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/26/thrillers-while-you-sleep-stephanie-merritt-tangerine-christine-mangan-come-find-me-sarah-hilary\">While You Sleep</a></em><em> </em>(2018). Her novels are about circles of friends trapped in literal or metaphorical crucibles, about privilege and failure, obsession and revenge. That Merritt’s output has been rather thin is down to the fact that her alter ego, SJ Parris, has become one of the most successful writers of historical fiction in the country, selling more than 1m copies of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/15/conspiracy-giordano-bruno-sj-parris-review\">Giordano Bruno</a> series of mysteries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Storm swims naked, smokes joints, fills the prim mothers with a mixture of horror and jealousy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now Merritt has returned to her own name for <em>Storm</em>, another literary thriller of the highest quality. Jo, our hero, is reeling from the death of her husband, Oliver. Their marriage was far from perfect – Oliver was controlling and self-centred – but his death has opened up a void in her life, one that she fills by cosseting their daughter, Hannah. When an invitation arrives to go to a chateau in France where she and Oliver holidayed in the early months of their relationship, she leaps at the chance, even though it means leaving Hannah behind. She wants to go away with Arlo, Max and Leo, Oliver’s closest friends, knowing that it is a way of staying close to him. They, she realises, are still “trying to work out what they owed her, for his sake, in terms of attention and inclusion”.</p> <p>Max, a journalist, has been called away on a story at the last minute and so his girlfriend, the alluring and much younger Storm, has come along without him. There are echoes of François Ozon’s <em>Swimming Pool</em><em> </em>and Bertolucci’s <em>Stealing Beauty</em>: what happens when someone young and liberated enters a world of more rigid morals. Storm swims naked, smokes joints, fills the prim mothers, Nina and Cressida, with a mixture of horror and jealousy. Then tragedy strikes, and all eyes turn to Storm. The ending is blistering, brilliantly paced and intricately plotted: the perfect poolside read.</p> <p>• <em>Storm</em> by Stephanie Merritt is published by HarperCollins (£14.99).

Running a 21st-century economy is not cheap and, unfortunately for those in power, gets more expensive every year.</p> <p>More immediately, to prevent a cost of living crisis translating into a calamity this winter for low- and middle-income households, a bigger bailout is on the cards.</p> <p>Treasury officials are under no illusions that rising energy bills, coupled with the extra cost of food and travel, will force the next chancellor to dig deeper than their predecessor to fund generous energy subsidies. Tax cuts, if <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/business/economics/2022/07/liz-truss-trussonomics-economy\" title=\"\">the Liz Truss bandwagon rolls to victory</a>, will only add to the need for extra borrowing.</p> <p>The bill will be large whatever, and yet will amount to no more than spasms of generosity while the rising tide of demands on the exchequer lap at the chancellor’s feet.</p> <p>It is easy to see how Conservative politicians can ignore all the warning signs and believe that the economic touchstones they grew up with will soon return to pre-pandemic norms, making all their spending affordable.</p> <p>Look back to the 2008 financial crash: it was supposed to reveal the fundamental flaws in a global, neoliberal economic system and begin a debate about how to build an alternative. Books such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/13/price-inequality-joseph-stiglitz-review\" title=\"\">The Price of Inequality</a></em> by Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz were supposed to get us all thinking about how a postwar consensus had run its course. Stephen D King’s award-winning opus <em>When the Money Runs Out: The End of Western Affluence</em> appeared a year later, in 2013.</p> <p>Like Stiglitz and so many other commentators, King, a former chief economist at HSBC, wrote and published his book during the post-crash period of high oil prices. Just like today, Brent crude above $100 a barrel was having a crippling effect on the global economy.</p> <p>Alongside the pressing issue of inequality, there was talk about climate change and how high fuel prices would spur a switch to low-carbon energy, force manufacturers to cut their emissions and make obvious the benefits of insulating Britain’s homes against colder and hotter weather.</p> <p>It didn’t take long for the Cassandras to be sidelined. By 2015, prices for oil and gas had dropped like a stone, along with those of most commodities. EU economies were still struggling with debts, but the majority of voters could shop for cheap clothes, cheap food and cheap flights to myriad destinations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If you believe the money is running out – and it is – then quite radical changes to the mix of tax and spending are needed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the same year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/jan/27/david-cameron-bonfire-of-building-regulations-future-homes\" title=\"\">David Cameron scrapped Ed Miliband’s strict housebuilding rules</a>, allowing developers to build flashy estates with as much insulation as a wedding marquee.

They were reluctant to change job for fear of losing what benefits they had accrued. Banks were more circumspect about giving out loans, excluding young people from taking out mortgages unless they had mum-and-dad cash. But they could kid themselves that their lives had returned to something like normal.</p> <p>Truss appeals to voters, much as Boris Johnson did, with a confidence born of experience – that if we just wait a little longer, the usual terms of economic life will return.</p> <p>After a brief downturn, runs this argument, the war in Ukraine will end, gas prices will decline along with other commodities and inflation will fall back to 2% or below.</p> <p>Central banks, including the Bank of England, will cut interest rates back towards zero and we can carry on borrowing to purchase property or to buy the kitchen/patio/conservatory we have always dreamed of.</p> <p>This optimism is a trap for Labour, which can only appear miserably austere in response.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/10/tory-turmoil-keeps-bank-of-england-in-the-dark-on-tackling-crisis\">Tory turmoil keeps Bank of England in the dark on tackling crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you believe the money is running out – and it is – then quite radical changes to the mix of tax and spending are needed.</p> <p>Keir Starmer is already talking about shifting the tax burden on to the better paid to fund the long list of demands that always lie in wait for a Labour prime minister – higher spending on education, health, social services and international aid among them.

Most of the action takes place in West Bengal but the frame is pointedly British – a link made between factory workers in West Bengal and the gig economy in the UK. The shoes could be seen as a symbol: Bhattacharyya’s writing is driven by the uncynical hope that we can put ourselves in each other’s shoes and make the world a fairer place.</p> <p>As Prab, an idealistic writer and father, Irfan Shamji is a wonderfully relaxed presence on stage. We watch him pick up his baby daughter and a story at the same time – a tale about ogres in a drought – one of several of his unlikely narrative lullabies. Video designer Akhila Krishnan supports all stories with elegant shadow play and one of Bhattacharyya’s strengths turns out to be her emphasis on the importance of finding the right story at the right time. This comes into keenest focus when Prab and his wife meet two actors with a <em>jatra</em>, a folk theatre company, who seek a new story to replace traditional scenes from the Mahabharata.</p> <p>Devesh is invigoratingly played by Scott Karim as a sarcastic factory owner and actor whose nastiness deepens as the show progresses. Ayesha Dharker is electric as Chellam, his professional other half, in a shocking pink sari, showing sharp intelligence as a form of glamour. Prab gets hired, a little unconvincingly, to write this daunting couple a new play. Zainab Hasan is excellent as Prab’s pragmatic wife, Kajol, urging her husband to put family before social conscience. Prab’s reformist instincts are crushed when Devesh insists on a rewrite of his play and, in compensation, makes him floor manager in his factory where the use of child labour becomes the scandal around which the subsequent action revolves.</p> <p>It is a play that is unkempt in parts and would benefit from a little extra grooming. The subject matter is not new, yet comes across as pleasingly fresh. And the urgent speech at the end, in which Prab’s daughter Amba, boldly played by Saroja-Lily Ratnavel, speaks up for British workers, is spot on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20aabc62d39a5a88e0880d71416d302cc6f3955c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20aabc62d39a5a88e0880d71416d302cc6f3955c/0_0_5760_4920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Fleetwood as Cruella De Vil, with Pongo and Perdi puppeteered by Yana Penrose, Emma Lucia, Danny Collins and Ben Thompson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"854\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Fleetwood as Cruella De Vil, with Pongo and Perdi puppeteered by Yana Penrose, Emma Lucia, Danny Collins and Ben Thompson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Senior</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://openairtheatre.com/production/101-dalmatians\">101 </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://openairtheatre.com/production/101-dalmatians\">Dalmatian</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://openairtheatre.com/production/101-dalmatians\">s</a></strong> is spot on, too – in every sense.

I am not a woman who takes no for an answer!” she shrieks at the dogs. The music is tunefully poppy and in the splendid Für Fur, Cruella confesses what makes her tick. The song is performed in a non-tongue-in-cheek way – and brilliantly confirms that Cruella needs a shrink. All readers of Dodie Smith’s classic and devotees of the film and stage versions will, by this stage, also realise that a pre-emptive call to the RSPCA would not have gone amiss.</p> <p>There is so much else to like: Bury That Bone by a homeless cur named Captain (Tom Peters) is a shaggy-dog song in which to wallow; there is a particularly charming cameo by a dancing pink poodle (Courtney George); and all of the children in the show perform beautifully. Even if the tale that wags this dog is slight, it cannot spoil this dottily enjoyable show, directed by Timothy Sheader.</p> <p>CS Lewis, in <strong><a href=\"https://www.lionwitchonstage.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw54iXBhCXARIsADWpsG9KrZWIrhw6_mFnG6l1PdEG2cuhXGv4_NFSVhnwQFQijt513Jm5aLsaAuzAEALw_wcB\">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a></strong>, promised a Narnia for every generation and Sally Cookson’s splendid 2017 Leeds Playhouse production, with set by Rae Smith, is repurposed for new audiences by director Michael Fentiman and proves itself glossily good (almost to a fault).

The children (Ammar Duffus, Robyn Sinclair, Shaka Kalokoh and Delainey Hayles) are played with attractive naturalness. It is marvellously unsettling to watch Edmund swig the witch’s foaming brew and sate himself on pink, sugary cubes. The show’s moral could hardly be clearer: never accept marmalade cake from strangers – let alone turkish delight.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)<br>Chasing Hares</em> <strong>★★★<br></strong><em>101 </em><em>Dalmatian</em><em>s</em><strong> ★★★★<br></strong><em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em><strong> ★★★★</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.youngvic.org/whats-on/chasing-hares?gclid=Cj0KCQjw54iXBhCXARIsADWpsG9D6RqL9Ykl46P9--gHwYVaphKcb0x1Sxaw8N68i9cFvPl3KnEaKisaAme5EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds#close\">Chasing Hares</a> is at the Young Vic, London, until 13 August</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://openairtheatre.com/production/101-dalmatians\">101 Dalmatians</a> is at the Open Air theatre, London, until 28 August</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.lionwitchonstage.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw54iXBhCXARIsADWpsG9KrZWIrhw6_mFnG6l1PdEG2cuhXGv4_NFSVhnwQFQijt513Jm5aLsaAuzAEALw_wcB\">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> is at the Gillian Lynne theatre, London, until 8 January</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/31/wanted-desert-island-resort-in-maldives-seeks-barefoot-bookseller","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T09:00:51Z","webTitle":"Wanted: desert island resort in Maldives seeks barefoot bookseller ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/wanted-desert-island-resort-in-maldives-seeks-barefoot-bookseller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/31/wanted-desert-island-resort-in-maldives-seeks-barefoot-bookseller","fields":{"headline":"Wanted: desert island resort in Maldives seeks barefoot bookseller ","trailText":"Passionate about literature, adventurous, outgoing, creative and happy to stay shoeless?

Applications have opened for what might just be the best job in the world: running a bookshop on a luxury desert island in the Maldives.</p> <p>Passionate lovers of books – who are also adventurous, outgoing, creative and don’t mind spending all day barefoot – are sought for the year-long contract, which starts in October and involves moving to live on the remote island of <a href=\"https://1001beach.com/en/indian_ocean/maldives/kunfunadhoo_island\" title=\"\">Kunfunadhoo</a> in the Indian Ocean.</p> <p>The bookselling takes place barefoot, because no shoes are allowed to be worn on the island. Reading a newspaper, even one as compelling as the <em>Observer</em>, would also be frowned upon.</p> <p>“The ethos of the island is: no shoes, no news. They encourage guests to reconnect with the ground,” said Alex McQueen, spokesperson for Ultimate Library, which runs the bookshop with the Soneva Fushi resort, and provides bespoke library collections for hotels, resorts and private residences around the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b994e71d526681118ca62ce3b93833432b6c23c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b994e71d526681118ca62ce3b93833432b6c23c/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Georgie Polhill reading to\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georgie Polhill with an enrapt audience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barefoot Bookseller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Guests at the resort – usually high net worth individuals – are encouraged to switch off from the digital world and allow their “barefoot butlers” to attend to their needs.</p> <p>McQueen said the island’s bookseller will need to be a self-starter who is happy to introduce themselves to guests and provide them with personalised book recommendations. The successful applicant will be solely responsible for the day-to-day running of the bookshop, including accounting and stock management. “The applicant will be there on their own, so they’re pretty much running the whole thing themselves.”</p> <p>For this reason, he is ideally looking for someone with bookselling or publishing experience.</p> <p>Accommodation for one on the island is provided free of charge and all meals are free. There’s also a gym, access to a spa and watersports like diving, and staff have their own private beach.</p> <p>The basic salary is $750 a month (around £620) but it is expected the bookseller will be able to earn extra “service fees” on top by, for example, offering book-related workshops or classes to guests.</p> <p>Georgie Polhill, 27, who recently finished a six-month contract as a bookseller on the island, said one of the biggest challenges she faced as a “turbocharged Londoner” was getting used to the slow, relaxed pace of life on the island. “If you tried to fight it too much and harry everyone on to get things done, you would absolutely burst a blood vessel.</p> <p>“I came back a very different person. I learned an entirely new culture. I made friends that I will have for life.”</p> <p>She had previously worked for a bookseller in London but will start a new career in theatre on Monday.</p> <p>This has meant adjusting to wearing shoes again – something which she said “definitely felt weird,” at first. “I was so unused to wearing anything around my toes and my heels.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/jul/31/edinburgh-comedy-awards-nica-burns-fringe-40-years","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T09:00:51Z","webTitle":"‘It comes down to taste’: how the Edinburgh comedy awards find tomorrow’s funniest stars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/31/edinburgh-comedy-awards-nica-burns-fringe-40-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/jul/31/edinburgh-comedy-awards-nica-burns-fringe-40-years","fields":{"headline":"‘It comes down to taste’: how the Edinburgh comedy awards find tomorrow’s funniest stars","trailText":"Nica Burns, driving force of the festival’s comedy prize, talks about the winners and losers in 40 years of the hugely influential event","byline":"Vanessa Thorpe","body":"<p>Comedians have a reputation for being tough: the street fighters of the entertainment world. But in just a few weeks – on 27 August – a select group of hopefuls will be shifting from foot to foot, waiting to hear either good or bad news. For the 40th time in its quirky history the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/24/life-as-edinburgh-comedy-awards-judge-themes-of-2019-fringe\" title=\"\">Edinburgh comedy prize</a> – formerly known as the Perrier and now as the Dave award – will be made to the outstanding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jun/08/edinburgh-fringe-2022-here-are-20-shows-you-shouldnt-miss-best-theatre-dance-comedy\" title=\"\">Edinburgh fringe</a> act of the 2022 season.</p> <p>“Personally, the announcement is quite a difficult moment, upsetting even,” confesses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/aug/26/nica-burns-interview\" title=\"\">Nica Burns</a>, who has run the prize-giving process for more than three decades. “I greet the nominees and they are all reading my face to try and work out the result. I usually know who is going to be most disappointed, and I often hug them later.”</p> <p>Further consolation for this handful of defeated nominees can be found in the fact that they are the joint standard setters for comedy at the Fringe festival. This is because the history of the award, in its various branded versions, is also a map of British show business that revealed its future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7b984c1af04b2da3276dee2391896e313a4fb6cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b984c1af04b2da3276dee2391896e313a4fb6cd/171_302_2576_3804/677.jpg\" alt=\"Reginald D Hunter\" width=\"677\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reginald D Hunter was among those nominated for an award who is now a household name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Edinburgh’s twisting wynds and cobbled closes may still be booby-trapped with jugglers and mime artists every summer, but for a good 20 years now the real business of the fringe has been the training and recruiting of the comic talent that fuels British theatre, film and television. Back in 1996, the writer and actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/15/ben-miller-actor-netflix-bridgerton-tv\" title=\"\">Ben Miller</a> recalled his nerves on award night, when he stood with his comedy partner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/08/alexander-armstrong-at-home-im-just-the-bumbling-old-fool-in-the-corner\" title=\"\">Alexander Armstrong</a>, among fellow nominees, trying to push away the thought they might win. His dream was that, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/04/bill-bailey-keep-saying-funny-things-thats-quite-profound-advice\" title=\"\">Bill Bailey</a> was the odds-on favourite, old Perrier prize lore would prevail and an outsider would grab the trophy, just as they had when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/15/comics-on-camera-edinburgh-fringe-steve-coogan-rob-brydon--jo-brand?share=reddit\" title=\"\">Steve Coogan beat Jo Brand in 1992</a> and when Alan Davies was pipped in 1994.</p> <p>But in the end Jenny Eclair, the previous year’s victor and the first woman to win the prize, handed the title on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/dylan-moran\" title=\"\">Dylan Moran</a>, so Armstrong and Miller had to smile gamely alongside their fellow “also-rans”, Bailey, Al Murray, Rich Hall and Dominic Holland. (Hall and Murray went on to win in subsequent years, while Holland, father to Spider-Man actor Tom, had won best newcomer in 1993.)</p> <p>Burns is now one of the West End’s leading theatrical impresarios and so she really doesn’t need her sideline in Edinburgh. But she is wedded to the awards. “It is a belief and a passion,” she said this weekend. And she once put her money where her heart is, funding the prize herself, in lieu of a new sponsor.</p> <p>“It is part of my love of the whole of the fringe,” said Burns, adding that she learned her craft at the festival when she took up her own improvised show after university. It taught her the core skills of staging and promoting productions. “We made a profit of £40 that year and it was the best money I ever earned.”</p> <p>Her show transferred to a small London theatre. Soon she took over as artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse, before ultimately controlling a network of London venues from her Covent Garden eyrie at Nimax Theatres. In a deal struck with bosses at Dave in 2019, the awards are now sponsored by the television channel. Previous sponsors have included Foster’s lager and lastminute.com.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b211cb2046dd91d3be31d34a0696d262d0fc3c0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b211cb2046dd91d3be31d34a0696d262d0fc3c0e/0_233_2136_2135/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Brand in 1992\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Brand was pipped by Steve Coogan in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geraint Lewis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And the prize still matters, because its roll call of honour regularly predicts the household names of the future, from Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie and Emma Thompson, to the stellar cast of <em>The League of Gentlemen</em>, and to Frank Skinner, Richard Ayoade and Russell Kane. And if you include comedians who were merely nominated, things get really ridiculous. To start with there are Omid Djalili, Noel Fielding, Peter Kay, Alan Davies, Lee Mack, Jack Dee, Sarah Millican, Michael McIntyre, Reginald D Hunter, Sara Pascoe, Flight of the Conchords, John Bishop, Lily Savage (aka Paul O’Grady) and Nish Kumar. It is a tired trope to say it would be easier to list those big beasts in entertainment who have no Edinburgh comedy award past, but it would.</p> <p>Perhaps even more significant are the names of all the experimentalists lurking in the list of winners and nominees, the performers who still draw big audiences into live theatre because of the power of their vision, comic or otherwise. Among these titans are Eddie Izzard, Johnny Vegas, Simon Munnery, John Shuttleworth (aka Graham Fellows), Ross Noble, Milton Jones, Bridget Christie, Daniel Kitson, Mark Watson, Tim Key and surrealist theatre company Complicité. And among the mourned, the lost stars of live stand-up who regularly shone on television panel shows are the late Sean Hughes (still the youngest prize winner, at 24 in 1990), Sean Lock and Jeremy Hardy.</p> <p>The story of the prize is the story of comedy on the fringe, and is, of course, controversial because it reflects the wider rows that have beset popular culture. There was too much Oxbridge, then there was too much swearing and not enough women. Then it was too commercial and there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/17/people-just-do-nothing-stars-hit-out-at-lack-of-diversity-in-media\" title=\"\">no diversity</a>. More recently there have been concerns about protecting the mental health of performers and about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/10/cancel-culture-killing-comedy-what-a-joke\" title=\"\">fear of “cancellation”</a> from increasingly censorious audiences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6d0190cc89a293018838932d693074440e161aa2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d0190cc89a293018838932d693074440e161aa2/0_0_2733_3500/781.jpg\" alt=\"Nica Burns \" width=\"781\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nica Burns usually knows which nominee is going to be most disappointed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geraint Lewis/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Burns, the weightiest of these themes is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/14/the-boys-club-has-been-obliterated-meet-the-women-of-colour-shaking-up-comedy\" title=\"\">women’s growing contribution to</a> the world of stand-up comedy. “This was the biggest issue and also the slowest to develop,” she said. “It may have changed first on television, but it took a very long time for the clubs to change. There was a lot of verbal abuse. And I look back with horror at all those all-male shortlists for our prize.”</p> <p>But another major trend for analysts of the fringe is the huge increase in the size of the festival and the great dominance of comedy. When Burns began her reign, just 35 acts were eligible for the comedy award. In 2019, before two festivals were cancelled in the pandemic, there were 757. That is a lot of shows to see in 10 days before drawing up a shortlist.</p> <p>This year the number of comedy shows to be considered – they have to last more than 50 minutes and comprise mostly new material, is slightly lower, but there are still hundreds to see. The awards use 20 scouts – people who were previously on the judging panel – to score the shows and then the panel judges, critics, professionals and chosen members of the public, start criss-crossing the city to watch them all. In response to the size of the festival, the shortlist is now longer than it was in the early days – eight or nine acts rather than four or five.</p> <p>Burns has watched as the influence of the sketch show dwindled, then flickered into life again only intermittently. The stand-up is now king, or queen. Yet judging apples from pears remains a challenge for the judges. Although Burns is a disinterested party with no vote, she has observed tears and some raised voices, as well as some charming attempts to influence the result, as when<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/01/jeremy-hardy-obituary\" title=\"\"> Jeremy Hardy</a> jokingly handed her a note in 1988 saying, “Can I win this year?”. It was a genuine coincidence when the judges obliged.</p> <p>In 1991 there was a particularly “ferocious” debate, Burns recalled. Izzard, Dee, Savage and Skinner were all in contention. “The judges chose Frank in the end because he changed his set to suit the audience once his show started to sell out. That clinched it. The audience is always a character in a performance.</p> <p>“The nominees are always good, so it comes down to taste,” she added. “I sometimes disagree with the choice, but it is not about my opinions. Often there are just too many good nominees. We have had some golden years. In 1992, we had to create the best newcomer prize to reward Harry Hill, because all the other nominees were so good.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1bee4a54121946a76718924199352a4fe21dd724\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bee4a54121946a76718924199352a4fe21dd724/0_0_570_824/346.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Solon won in 2005\" width=\"346\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Solon, who won in 2005, is now a Hollywood screenwriter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shortlisted shows are so varied that fervent fans of one act can be left cold by another. Burns used to run a club night with all the nominees on the bill, each performing a bit of their set. She recalls that when The Mighty Boosh took to the stage in 1999, the audience just gaped blankly back at them. “When they came off I asked how they were and luckily they just laughed and laughed. They said, ‘They didn’t get us!’ I asked if they wanted to duck out of the next night’s show, but they wouldn’t hear of it.”</p> <p>The value of the awards as a test bed for future writers and directors is as crucial as the prize itself, Burns said: “A lot of the performers later move sideways. I saw Patrick Marber try different genres of comedy, and now he is a playwright – and a great stage director, too, in my opinion. His recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/05/travesties-review-tom-hollander-tom-stoppard-patrick-marber\" title=\"\">West End version of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/05/travesties-review-tom-hollander-tom-stoppard-patrick-marber\" title=\"\">Travesties</a></em>, a difficult Stoppard play, was so clever.”</p> <p>American Bo Burnham is making acclaimed films and Laura Solon, a winner in 2005, is now a screenwriter in Hollywood, while 2005 best newcomer Tim Minchin is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/mar/31/tim-minchin-matilda-comedy-stage-profile\" title=\"\">creator of the hit musical </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/mar/31/tim-minchin-matilda-comedy-stage-profile\" title=\"\">Matilda</a></em>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/06/almas-not-normal-school-drunk-bikini-sophie-willan-chaotic-childhood-sitcom-gold\" title=\"\">Sophie Willan</a> has just won a Bafta for the TV drama <em>Alma’s Not Normal</em>. Other comics are now established as chat or game show hosts, their audience skills honed on the fringe. Among this tribe are Graham Norton, Jimmy Carr, Greg Davies, Michael McIntyre, Sarah Millican, Adam Hills and Alexander Armstrong, of <em>Pointless</em> fame. Prominent “straight” actors include Lee Evans and Miles Jupp.</p> <p>The messiness of the fringe, its uncurated variety, is vital for Burns. But taking a comedy show there is not for the faint-hearted. “Dying on stage is an incredibly painful experience and a comic’s life is very exposing,” she said. “It is better, of course, if you are very successful.”</p> <p>The key, four decades of the comedy prize suggests, is to take being funny extremely seriously.</p> <h2>Edinburgh comedy prize controversies</h2> <ul> <li><p>Comedian and poet John Hegley was heavily tipped to win in 1989, so a Scottish newspaper carried his photograph the next day, even though rival Simon Fanshawe had won unexpectedly.</p></li> <li><p>In 1999, the awards panel reinstated comic Al Murray following an appeal against a ruling he was ineligible because he was too successful, having already been nominated four times.

It’s inevitable,” said Michael Green, an associate professor of history at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “It’s been sad to watch the lake drop, the islands appear, the bathtub ring, the marina being moved out further and further.”</p> <p>The recent spate of discoveries began in May when boaters spotted a barrel. Inside were the remains of a man who officials say was shot between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s. The killing has the signature of a “<a href=\"https://themobmuseum.org/blog/body-in-the-barrel-at-lake-mead-has-makings-of-mob-hit/\">mob hit</a>”, the local Mob Museum said, and coincided “with the most violent period in Las Vegas’s past – an era of unprecedented street crime and underworld killings”.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/09/lake-mead-human-remains-found-las-vegas\">week after</a> that discovery, two sisters paddle-boarding on the lake came across what they thought were the bones of a bighorn sheep, but which turned out to be another set of human remains.</p> <p>“I would say there is a very good chance as the water level drops that we are going to find additional human remains,” Ray Spencer, a lieutenant with the Las Vegas police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/02/lake-mead-barrel-human-remains-nevada\">said</a> in May.</p> <p>Earlier this week, someone alerted park rangers to additional human remains, partially encased in mud, along a beach.

It was formed with the creation of the Hoover Dam, which submerged St Thomas, a Mormon settlement founded in 1865. One of the town’s final residents left in 1938 when waters reached his front door, according to the <a href=\"https://www.deseret.com/2022/5/17/23076336/lake-mead-drought-water-levels-lds-mormon-ghost-town-st-thomas\">Deseret News</a>. Declining lake levels, which have exposed St Thomas several times over the years, have kept the settlement visible for the last 10 years.</p> <p>The lake also covered archaeological digs, said Green, who teaches about the history of Nevada and Las Vegas, meaning there could be historical items in the water.</p> <p>“There might actually be some archaeological relics,” Green said, adding that a nearby museum has artifacts from the Puebloan people, who lived in the area about a thousand years earlier. “Archaeologists were working there until the lake was rising around them.”</p> <p>The vast reservoir’s water level has dropped more than 170ft (52m) since 1983, the same year the Colorado River flooded the dam’s spillways. Over-extraction, extreme heat and decreased snowmelt have burdened the Colorado River Basin and nearly 40 years later, Lake Mead is down to about 27% of its capacity.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/projections-grim-for-future-of-the-colorado-river-2446452/\">forecast</a> is grim – the Colorado River has endured a drought for two decades and officials project Lake Mead’s water levels will continue to fall, meaning that more discoveries will be unearthed.</p> <p>“There tends to be plenty of stuff that goes to the bottom and you just wait around,” Green said. “Ideally we’ll get more water and we won’t find more.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/31/praise-be-to-mick-lynch-the-brexit-arse-made-good","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T09:00:50Z","webTitle":"Praise be to Mick Lynch, the Brexit arse made good | Stewart Lee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/praise-be-to-mick-lynch-the-brexit-arse-made-good","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/praise-be-to-mick-lynch-the-brexit-arse-made-good","fields":{"headline":"Praise be to Mick Lynch, the Brexit arse made good","trailText":"Yes, he’s a Lexit backer, but also the best spokesman for workers’ rights and leftwing values this century","byline":"Stewart Lee","body":"<p>It is Wednesday night and I am camping near a West Country gastropub, to snaffle its wild boar wares. But though the unacknowledged pre-Raphaelite triptych in the local church still shimmers secretly in the shadows, the inn once so welcoming is closed, except for weekends, due to staff shortages, doubtless off the back of Brexit. And so I sit alone, writing this in a wet field without the pleasures of draft cider or the eavesdropped tinkle of merry woodland banter, the sausages unsampled. Will the misery never end? And who is to blame?</p> <p>These sorts of privations mean top National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers entertainer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/23/mick-lynch-rail-union-bruiser-whos-more-than-a-match-for-the-media\">Mick Lynch</a> presents a conundrum to Remainer fundamentalists like me. For Lynch is undoubtedly a Brexit arse of the first water. And all Lynch’s Brexit-voting members are arses too. How’s that Lexit working out for you lads? How was voting against the EU because you “support basic socialist policies of workers’ rights, public ownership, and opposition to austerity and racism”? I hope Nigel Farage sent flowers and chocolates. Boris Johnson must have been laughing all the way to the next ex-KGB agent’s son’s private Italian hilltop party. Lynch and the RMT will be first up against the wall come my Crushed Velvet Remainers’ Revolution.</p> <p>And yet, as well as being a Brexit arse, Lynch is also the greatest British spokesperson for workers’ rights, and leftwing values generally, this century. His measured calm makes asinine fools of the usual tools dutifully dispatched to belittle his ilk – the BBC’s <em>Newscast</em> team, Sky’s Kay Burley, Rupert Murdoch’s Piers Morgan, Mental Vacancy’s Richard Madeley, Wheezing Badly’s Nick Ferrari and Anti-woke Wank’s Jonathan Gullis MP – simply by allowing them to parrot their gossamer toss uninterrupted, before courteously correcting them and then saying something drily amusing, which then goes viral and makes future Marxist guerrillas of millions of impressionable schoolchildren.</p> <p>Lynch is too effective a communicator – on the value of redistribution of wealth, public ownership, public housing and the fair wage – to be allowed on TV. So you won’t see Lynch popping up in the fist-puppet BBC’s fish-shooting barrel much any more. But is it possible for an arse who voted for Brexit to be redeemed? Lynch, it appears, has taught me the meaning of cognitive dissonance. He understands how the proto-fascist Brexit Tory government are planning to exploit the ongoing wave of industrial action, in a way that the Labour leadership don’t. Strikes? For the proto-fascist Brexit Tories they’re a win-win situation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They broke Butterfly Miliband on a bacon sandwich wheel.

The imaginary enemy of the EU is about to outlive its uselessness. On fluffy <em>Good Morning Britain</em> last week, the Skeletor-faced travel journalist Simon Calder explained patiently to Brexiter <em>Daily Mail</em> div Andrew Pierce how the new need to check passports on the way into Europe causes delays at Dover. This will happen irrespective of whether the French like us or not, because Brexiters voted to end freedom of movement and then drank Wetherspoons dry to celebrate. I can’t go anywhere! Mine’s a double!! Pierce simply smiled and went glassy-eyed as he was shamed and owned, like someone grinning through an especially invasive colonoscopy, doubtless ready to spew the same nonsense at his next media appointment, but to more compliant facilitators. It’s a shame Remain didn’t have a communicator as good as Calder. No one in the red wall was going to do what David Cameron told them, the lord of the manor popping into peasants’ filthy cottages to wish them a jolly merry Christmas.</p> <p>Even that serviceable imaginary enemy, the Woke Mob, may eventually no longer fly for the proto-fascists. Even your racist nan knows one of these transgenders now, who works in the Lidl and “they”, she says with comic pointedness, “seem very nice indeed”. And so the Tories have turned their attention to the unions, whom Liz Truss intends to “clamp down” on, the very phrase “clamp down” itself being a pejorative term suggesting the clamp-downee must be bad. You clamp down on crime, drugs, fraud, bullying, cockroaches, paedophiles and rats. And on a movement designed to bargain collectively for better pay and conditions and improve the quality of public services, apparently. Though I wonder where the “skilled agency workers” planned to break the strikes will come from, given that post-Brexit Britain is too short-staffed to grill my wild boar sausages on a Wednesday.</p> <p>By refusing to meet Lynch, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/15/grant-shapps-admits-he-had-second-job-as-millioniare-web-marketer-while-mp\">multi-identity fraud Grant Shapps</a> may force a long strike, driving home the unions’ bad narrative. And if, like the 1980s miners’ strike, it ends in violent confrontations with the foot soldiers of the state, and some unwanted benefit gigs by Crass, it is all gravy for the proto-fascist Tories. Bereft of actual values, each contradictory policy announcement designed only to maintain power, pitched police battles will only strengthen the strategy of division.</p> <p>Keir Starmer thinks if he keeps his politicians off the picket lines where they belong, he may be swept to power, and he may be, but only in the way some cat shit is swept into a dustpan. The Tory press will attack him anyway. They broke Butterfly Miliband on a bacon sandwich wheel. Starmer may as well strip naked, paint his body red and run into battle.</p> <p>What a mess. I wished I was cider-drunk and burping boar gas. But as I lay in the long midnight grass sucking Red Stripe reluctantly from a hot can I swear I saw a shooting star. Whoosh! And it’s gone. But a shooting star nonetheless. Not a satellite, no. And not a plane. An actual shooting star, in the northern sky over the A4137. Perhaps it heralds the arrival of a new messiah.

While they don’t know each other well, the two have many friends in common where they live only a mile apart in Glasgow.</p> <p>With his red hair and pale skin, Boyle looks particularly uncomfortable in the 30C-plus temperatures, and I half expect the punishing conditions to trigger his notoriously acerbic observational skills.</p> <p>But he’s a surprisingly benign presence, inclined to laughter, and so softly spoken it’s often hard to pick up on what he says. By contrast, Mina is as clear as a bell and unapologetically forthright in her opinions, which it’s fair to say have been well-earned. She is, after all, the seasoned writer in the room, having authored 16 highly regarded crime novels, not to mention three plays and various graphic works. Val McDermid has called her “crime-writing royalty”.</p> <p>She published her first thriller, the critically acclaimed <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/garnethill-9781784709549\">Garnethill</a></em><em>,</em> 24 years ago when she was 32. Boyle, who turns 50 next month, has just made his debut with <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/meantime-9781399801157\">Meantime</a></em>, a tale of a Glaswegian addict who haphazardly investigates the murder of his best friend. It boasts impressive tributes from Mina and Ian Rankin on its cover. “A darkest noir, unputdownable crime novel”, says Mina, while Rankin describes it as a “twisted Caledonian take on Altman’s <em>The Long Goodbye</em>”, referring to the subversive 70s film adaptation of Raymond Chandler’s finest Philip Marlowe novel.</p> <p>Rather than sit down at a blank screen and determinedly apply backside to chair, Boyle wrote the book on his phone as he walked around Glasgow taking in the various settings that he describes in the narrative. It’s a novel way of writing a novel, but why was he drawn to the already crowded field of crime fiction? In Scotland, the likes of Rankin, Mina herself, Val McDermid and many others have long been herded together under the title “tartan noir”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1cd1d811163904d14d7977fb6d2081d80332a56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1cd1d811163904d14d7977fb6d2081d80332a56/0_0_4171_2772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comedian Frankie Boyle, 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comedian Frankie Boyle, 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mina jumps in with an unusual explanation for Boyle’s and her own love of the form. “We both read comics,” she says, “and one of the things about comics is they talk about really difficult subjects in a really palatable packaging. That’s what crime fiction for me can do. And I think that’s what you’re doing as well,” she continues, looking across to Boyle, “talking about really difficult things that if you put them in an opinion piece or in a column would just bore the arse off anyone reading them. You’re kind of repaying the audience’s attention by entertaining them while at the same time talking about the things that preoccupy you.”</p> <p>Boyle agrees, developing Mina’s point. “The characters [in a crime novel] have a licence. I guess since Chandler or whatever they’ve had that licence to wander about places that we can’t go, to access different worlds.”</p> <p>There is another obvious draw of crime fiction: it sells. Its popular exponents sell a huge amount, but it’s a big, baggy category that necessarily contains James Ellroy and Agatha Christie, one moment unblinking visions of street life, the next decorous detection among the upper classes.</p> <p>Perhaps lying more towards the Christie end of the spectrum is the recent and highly successful arrival of daytime TV star Richard Osman. The brains behind the quizshow <em>Pointless</em>, Osman went straight to the top of the bestseller charts with both his debut mystery, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/22/the-thursday-club-by-richard-osman-the-diver-and-the-lover-by-jeremy-vine-review\">The Thursday Murder Club</a></em>, and his second, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/21/richard-osmans-second-book-is-one-of-the-fastest-selling-novels-since-records-began-the-man-who-died-twice\">The Man Who Died Twice</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/21/richard-osmans-second-book-is-one-of-the-fastest-selling-novels-since-records-began-the-man-who-died-twice\">.</a> His third in the series, <em>The Bullet That Missed</em>, will be out in September. Other famous names getting in on the act and writing thrillers and crime novels include Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, James Naughtie, Andrew Marr, Tom Watson, Robert Peston and the Reverend Richard Coles. Such celebrity turns have left many writers feeling envious of the heavyweight promotion that goes with the territory.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Among many offerings that the crime novel has bestowed upon us is the cutting comic simile</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a recent column for the <em>Observer</em>, the novelist Stephanie Merritt suggested, not entirely seriously, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/10/its-not-true-that-everyones-got-a-book-in-them-give-writing-back-to-the-writers\">celebrities should have to publish their first novels pseudonymously</a> with the same promotion budget as civilian debutants. What does Boyle think of that idea?</p> <p>“That’s strange,” he says, smiling. “I can’t think of many bad celebrity novels. Like I read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/22/brouhaha-by-ardal-ohanlon-review-whats-the-story\">Ardal O’Hanlon’s one </a>and I thought it was pretty good. Then I read a couple of reviews, one was really positive and the other negative, and neither was much like what I’d read.”</p> <p>“I got much better reviews in literary magazines when I got a better haircut,” the punkishly primped Mina says. “It’s all subjective.”</p> <p>Boyle adopts the persona of a precious critic: “‘Should these sort of people be allowed to write books or should we kill them?’ But a bad book is not going to get published, anyway.”</p> <p>He maintains that it’s a misconception that celebrities can easily get into print. Mina is quick to endorse his point. “I know so many people who are famous who have written books that didn’t get published,” she says. “It’s really hard. It’s hard to write a book first of all. You’re face-to-face with your own limitations. I mean, it’s not a pleasant experience. So a lot of people don’t have the discipline to sit down and do it. And editors can’t just swan in and fix a book just because someone’s really famous.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Boyle is a longtime reader of crime fiction, citing Ellroy as one of his favourite authors. By contrast, Mina was not a particular fan of the genre before entering it, although she’d been thinking about writing a novel for the previous 12 years. “I thought it was like being a pop star,” she recalls, “an exciting idea, but how would you even go about that?”</p> <p>She initially wrote 80 pages, came to a standstill, and took a writing course at the Women’s Library. She then sent a letter off to a literary agency declaring that she was a massive extrovert who “can’t wait to draw attention to myself”, even falsely claiming that a) she had done standup comedy and b) that she had completed the novel. When an agent wrote back asking to see the rest of the book, she set about writing it.</p> <p>Thriller-writing, she says, is “the job for an angry loner”. She looks across to Boyle and adds drily, “I don’t know if that’s something that appeals to you”, which brings forth a big guffaw from the comedian.</p> <p>Boyle’s route into crime fiction has been more circuitous but with a much shorter gestation. Having written a couple of memoirs, including the memorably titled <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/my-shit-life-so-far-9780007324514\">My Shit Life So Far</a></em>, he found himself experimenting with a narrator’s voice but not with the intention of developing it into a novel. Then he started looking at a detective format and decided he wanted to examine the “postcolonial thing in Glasgow”.</p> <p>If Boyle’s narrator is, like his creator, a straight white male, albeit one with multiple drug dependencies, almost everyone else in the book has what might be called a marginalised identity. Set in the wake of the referendum for Scottish independence, the city becomes a kind of battleground for different ideas of Scottishness, Britishness, history and globalism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ce83f8738a8b6274d4d69dfb5f6c6ca856cfcdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ce83f8738a8b6274d4d69dfb5f6c6ca856cfcdf/0_191_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denise Mina, 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denise Mina, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mina suggests that hardboiled crime novelists are able to explore “working-class social history” in a way that isn’t dull or worthy but is instead propelled by a powerful imagination.</p> <p>So far Boyle appears to have pleased the critics. The <em>Observer</em> reviewer, who happened to be Merritt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/17/meantime-by-frankie-boyle-review-the-comedians-dark-funny-glasgow-noir-debut\">gave it a rave notice</a>, calling it “enjoyably dark and entertaining”. The <em>Daily Telegraph</em> called the book “a gloriously funny treat of a novel”. How does it feel to get support from that quarter? “I’ll take it,” he says, although he admits that he hasn’t fully read the <em>Telegraph</em> review. “I don’t know that the paywall dropped long enough for me to finish it,” he quips.</p> <p>Among many offerings that the crime novel has bestowed upon us is the cutting comic simile, of which Chandler was the original master. Boyle has littered his novel with caustic and often surreal similes. For example, he describes a “man so enormously fat that he looked like he was sitting with his head out of a Fiat’s sunroof”. Sometimes the similes come in such quick succession that they almost act as the narrative engine in themselves. Was the opportunity to write such lines part of the attraction of a detective novel?</p> <p>“Well there’s a slight overlap between that kind of writing and insult comedy,” he says. “Chandler and those kind of people would have been writing at the time of Groucho Marx.”</p> <p>Mina instantly warms to this theme, noting that Chandler had worked with Billy Wilder (they co-wrote <em>Double Indemnity</em> but didn’t like each other), who was writing what Mina calls “that kind of staccato dialogue”. She posits the theory that the novelist may have stolen the technique from the director-screenwriter.</p> <p>Chandler fans would probably demur, as he’d already published several books in that style, but Mina does have a certain expertise in the field on account of the fact that she is actually writing a Philip Marlowe novel under agreement from the Chandler estate. “I just realised there’s not enough full stops,” she jokes about the project. “I need to get a big bucket of full stops!”</p> <p>In any case, she tells Boyle, she thinks his own voice is notably constrained in his crime novel.</p> <p>That’s all the Valium the narrator is taking, I chip in.</p> <p>“Yeah,” says Mina, “but it’s brilliant because it does feel like a modern-day Chandler book. I nearly complimented you there,” she adds, fixing her piercing eyes on Boyle. “If we were on Scottish soil we’d be engaged.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c306dcdbaa7d1e14b0b13f3ec7eec7efa2cbb3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c306dcdbaa7d1e14b0b13f3ec7eec7efa2cbb3e/0_425_6200_7748/800.jpg\" alt=\"Franke Boyle and Denise Mina in front of a wall shadowed by tree branches.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Partners in crime: Boyle and Mina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pål Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That brings forth another volley of laughter from the comedian, and it strikes me, not for the first time, that it’s Mina who’s the more natural comic performer – no wonder she told that agent she did standup comedy.</p> <p>Boyle has said that he was an alcoholic until he was 26, when he quit drinking, and he’s also spoken about using various drugs. He mentions that he wrote <em>My Shit Life So Far</em> on ecstasy. So what was the reason for making his narrator someone who is constantly under the influence of one drug or another?</p> <p>“I was reading that Don DeLillo book <em>White Noise</em>, where people just discourse. For instance, there’s this long passage in it about the dollar gap in the 1970s, which I think is really interesting – although most editors would probably want that out. Anyway, I thought it would be quite funny to do something like that, and it fitted in with the narrator being drunk and drugged a lot of the time that he might just ramble.”</p> <p>There are indeed many such digressions in Boyle’s book, which makes me think of something Mina <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/27/denise-mina-no-such-thing-apolitical-writer-crime-writing?CMP=gu_com\">once said in an interview</a>. If you’ve got the attention of the reader with the whodunnit aspect of the plot, she said, “you can’t bore the tits off them with your view of the world”.</p> <p>Did he have his own version of that injunction?</p> <p>“No,” he says, “because it was just like, what do <em>I</em> like to read? And maybe that’s part of this thing of not really needing to earn a living from it.” Giving his narrator a drug-fogged worldview is also in part a reaction to “this modern thing of people being incredibly emphatic. It partly comes from social media where everybody’s very polemical all the time, and I think it’s difficult to communicate that way.”</p> <p>“But you have communicated that way!” Mina interjects, not without cause.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You find you’re in a big corporate machine. And what they want you to do is write the same book over and over again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“I sure have,” he concedes, “but I thought it would be good to do someone who was less staccato and had more doubt because if you want to digress a fair bit into aspects of culture or society it wouldn’t work as well with someone who was very polemical.”</p> <p>Warming to the theme of complex plotting, Mina then tells the famous story of Howard Hawks, the director of <em>The Big Sleep</em>, cabling Chandler to ask who killed one of the characters – a question that none of the film’s scriptwriters, including William Faulkner, could answer. Chandler couldn’t help either and Hawks eventually decided that strong character development was more important than narrative coherence.</p> <p>Woody Allen had a similar realisation at the start of his career, Mina says, archly referring to the comedian-director as her “favourite guy”. “He used to do standup and just read the material he wrote for Sid Caesar, and then he realised that the audience don’t want that, they want someone that they want to spend time in the company of.” She stops herself suddenly, and looks at Boyle: “I’m explaining standup comedy to you.”</p> <p>That only serves to make the comic burst out laughing again.</p> <p>“But I think it’s the same in crime novels,” she carries on, “that the audience want to spend time in the company of that character.” </p> <p>Mina has certainly managed to keep a large following of readers down the years. Boyle, who counts himself among that number, notes that there has been plenty of variation in her output. “There are a lot of different types of your novels,” he says. “There are ones that are more straightforward, and some that are more high concept, and others that feature a true crime element. Do they all have, for you, different readerships?”</p> <p>“I do think you should lose your audience if you’re doing anything worth a damn,” she replies. “Because the thing is, you fight to become a writer. And then you find you’re in a big corporate machine. And what they want you to do is write the same book over and over again. You will face this pressure, if you haven’t already. So if you look at the pattern of my career, it’s one for them, one for me. The way I used to work a bar.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/17/meantime-by-frankie-boyle-review-the-comedians-dark-funny-glasgow-noir-debut\">Meantime by Frankie Boyle review – the comedian’s dark, funny Glasgow noir debut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By now we’re all sweating like Edward G Robinson in <em>Key Largo</em>, and it’s time for the two crime novelists, veteran and novice, to prepare for their closeups.

In July, the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, and defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, wrote a <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/07/commerce-secretary-raimondo-and-defense-secretary-austin-stress\">letter</a> to the Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, saying that the measure was “critical for our national security”.</p> <p>Mike Pompeo, a former secretary of state under the Republican president Donald Trump, made an unlikely contribution to calls for its passage. “Congress must pass the Chips Act for both our national and economic security. We have to become less dependent on China for critical technologies – and this is how we do it,” he tweeted as the House of Representatives was considering it.</p> <p>But some of the most influential conservative groups in Washington didn’t buy in.</p> <p>“The answer to the [Chinese Communist party’s] malevolent ambitions is not spending billions of dollars to help Fortune 500 companies, with no guarantee those dollars won’t end up supporting these companies’ business operations in China,” the Heritage Foundation president, Kevin Roberts, said in a statement.</p> <p>“Additionally, the act’s $250bn price tag will contribute to record inflation and increase the already historic cost of living for working- and middle-class Americans.”</p> <p>Americans for Prosperity, which was funded by the conservative industrialists Charles Koch and his late brother David, who are well known for their work promoting climate change denialism, sees the bill as “corporate welfare”.</p> <p>“The United States didn’t become the strongest and most prosperous society in the history of mankind by emulating the Chinese government’s central planning, and we shouldn’t start now,” the group’s vice-president of government affairs, Akash Chougule, said. “If we want to see more American investment, the US government needs to stay out of the way.”</p> <p>The effort ultimately failed, with 24 Republicans voting for Chips in the House and 17 Republicans in the Senate, along with almost all Democrats. While Sanders voted against it, none of his usual allies in that chamber or the House joined him in opposition.</p> <p>It wasn’t just the Biden administration that lawmakers were hearing from. Semiconductor firms invested heavily in lobbying to make the bill become law, with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-21/intel-spends-record-sum-on-lobbying-amid-global-chip-shortage#xj4y7vzkg?sref=fqqmZ8gi\">Bloomberg reporting</a> major manufacturers spent $19.6m in just the first half of this year, after $15.8m in the same period of 2021.</p> <p>Particularly vocal was Intel, which has announced <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-announces-next-us-site-landmark-investment-ohio.html#gs.7rfaxk\">a $20bn investment</a> in two new semiconductor factories in Ohio. But amid the Chips Act delay in June, the company announced those plans could be pushed back or curtailed without the funding.</p> <p>“My message to our congressional leaders is: hey, if I’m not done with the job, I don’t get to go home. Neither should you. Do not go home for August recess until you have passed the Chips Act, because I and others in the industries will make investment decisions. Do you want those investments in the US?” Intel’s chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1547972758843232259\">said in an interview on CNBC</a>. “Get the job done.”</p> <p>Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who sponsored a bill that was a precursor to Chips, denied that the legislation was corporate welfare, saying there were guardrails in its text to stop corporations from using the funds for their own enrichment. Instead, he likened it to a return of 1940s-era industrial policy, in which the government makes investments in industries deemed strategically important.</p> <p>“I think there’s understandable concern about corporate welfare, but corporate welfare is different than the FDR model of mobilizing for production,” he said, referring to the Democratic president Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who led the country through most of the second world war.</p> <p>He envisioned Chips as a template for future efforts that could boost green technologies such as electric vehicles, and solar and wind energy.</p> <p>“I think it’s a first step for how we continue to industrialize America, how we bring our production back, how we reduce our trade deficits. I absolutely think this should be a model,” Khanna said. “And the commerce department should enforce this so none of the money is going to stock buybacks, that it is going to building factories.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 1 August 2022.

A gold pendant bearing the Cross of Santiago (St James) and an Indian bezoar stone, then valued in Europe for its healing properties, is shaped like a scallop shell, the symbol recognised by pilgrims heading for Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. It is among finds linked to the sacred Order of Santiago, a military-religious order of knights, who protected pilgrims and were active in Spain’s maritime trade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/archive-2-zip/giv-6562RRen1dRqJWtp/\" data-alt=\"Bahamas map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/07/archive-2-zip/giv-6562RRen1dRqJWtp/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Another pendant features a gold Cross of St. JamesSantiago over a large, green, oval emerald framed by a dozen square emeralds, perhaps symbolising the 12 apostles.</p> <p>Clusters of emeralds and amethysts mined in Colombia and now recovered offer evidence of contraband trafficking as they were not registered on the manifest.</p> <p>Dr Sean Kingsley, an English marine archaeologist and editor of <em><a href=\"https://www.wreckwatchmag.com/\" title=\"\">Wreckwatch</a></em><a href=\"https://www.wreckwatchmag.com/\" title=\"\"> magazine</a> which will feature the finds in a forthcoming issue, told the <em>Observer</em> that such “marvels” are particularly dramatic as they were in the middle of nowhere, under dense sand. “This is successful key-hole archaeological surgery,” he said. </p> <p>The <em>Maravillas</em><em>, </em>named after a “miraculous” 13th-century sculpture of the Virgin Mary in a Madrid convent, was part of a fleet.

The pendant mesmerises me when I hold it and think about its history. How these tiny pendants survived in these harsh waters, and how we managed to find them, is the miracle of the <em>Maravillas</em>.”</p> <p>He added: “The wreck of the galleon had a tough history – heavily salvaged by Spanish, English, French, Dutch, Bahamian and American expeditions in the 17th and 18th centuries, and blitzed by salvors from the 1970s to early 1990s. Some say the remains were ground to dust.

Mid-pandemic predictions of Covid-19’s legacy. Claps aside, the promised new dawn of better conditions for essential workers never arrived. Meanwhile, the extension of furlough meant the feared wave of unemployment never arrived. Instead, one legacy that no one saw coming has: a major rise in economic inactivity (those neither in nor looking for a job) of around half-a-million people.</p> <p>Now, we shouldn’t forget the UK’s <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/emp/labour-force-participation-rate.htm\" title=\"\">very respectable levels</a> of labour market activity internationally, but understanding the drivers of this recent deterioration is important because its cause will tell us how worried to be about it. We know it’s concentrated among older workers and the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/movementsoutofworkforthoseagedover50yearssincethestartofthecoronaviruspandemic/2022-03-14\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics (ONS) has argued</a> that more retirements are the single biggest driver. In so far as this reflects older workers deciding they prefer not to work post-pandemic that’s something policymakers might be relaxed about.</p> <p>But the ONS also observes that ill health is playing a role and <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.haskel\" title=\"\">a new note</a>, co-authored by the Bank of England’s Jonathan Haskel, argues that the role of sickness in driving up inactivity is being underplayed. Why? Because the ONS focuses on people who report ill health as the primary reason for their inactivity. If you look instead at the increase in who reports being long-term sick, whether or not it’s their primary reason for being inactive, the authors argue it explains almost all (88%) of the rise in inactivity. This is about far more than long Covid, with long-term sickness rising well before the pandemic. And a sick Britain is something the next prime minister, and all of us, should be a long way from relaxed about.</p> <p>• Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

He talks about resisting categorisation, moral responsibility and why imagining dystopias is dangerous","byline":"Tim Adams","body":"<p>The writer Mohsin Hamid, who turned 50 this month, divides his time between Lahore, New York and London. He has worked as a management consultant and as chief storytelling officer for the advertising agency Wolff Olins. His second novel, <em>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</em>, told in the voice of a western-educated jihadi, sold 1m copies and was shortlisted for the Booker prize. His fourth novel, <em>Exit West</em>, a fable about migration and immigration, was also Booker shortlisted. His new novel, <em>The Last White Man</em>, is about a white American who wakes up one morning to discover he has turned a “deep and undeniable brown”. Over the course of the novel, more and more white people are similarly transformed.</p> <p><strong>You’ve talked a few times about the importance of urgency in writing, saying “only write if you need to write”. What was the urgency in telling this particular story at this moment?<br></strong>I think of myself as a thoroughly hybridised human being. I have lived in three countries for much of my life – Pakistan, the US and the UK – and someone like me has a difficult time thinking of their identity as just one thing. So the current impulse towards purity, towards identifying the “true people” of different countries or religions, of being “British” or “white American” or “Muslim” is fundamentally at odds with who I am. I wanted to write a book about that “sorting” mechanism, the way in which we put ourselves into groups. Because I think that the impulse to group identity is becoming overwhelming – and threatening to us all.</p> <p><strong>You have spoken about how the novel was rooted in your experience of 9/11 as a Pakistani man in America. What did you mean by that?<br></strong>This experience of loss, which the main character, Anders, has in my book, was something I felt very strongly at that moment. I went to elite universities, I lived in cosmopolitan cities. I wasn’t white, but I was, you could say, white enough. And then after 9/11 all that changed. When things didn’t go back to how they were it got me thinking: what is this thing – white America – that I used to have a probationary membership to?</p> <p><strong>It seems appropriate, given the book was written during the pandemic, that there also is a “viral” sense to the change it describes?<br></strong>Yes. It’s partly about accepting a new reality, a rupture. But it comes slowly. You hear about it first in the distance and wonder if it is real, if it will affect you. Anders in the book is sort of Patient Zero in that sense.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>History can be bent towards justice... but we have to do the bending</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Your novels explore very serious themes</strong><strong>: belonging, immigration, race. And yet you address them with a kind of playfulness. Is that tension between tones important to you?<br></strong>Yes, it is crucial. If you look at human culture from ancient Sumerian texts onwards, people have tried to use stories to amuse themselves and also to reckon with the fears they’re facing. The current moment is no different. We’re grappling with horrific environmental issues, the rise of militarism, enormous inequalities in what seem to be decreasingly tolerant societies. I don’t want to pretend that doesn’t exist. But we are also looking for transcendence, which we might get through love, or playfulness.</p> <p><strong>Is that unwillingness to write a full-on dystopia a psychological necessity for you?<br></strong>I think it’s partly in my character. At a personal level, I’m trying to fight off this sense of bleakness about the world. The danger, for us and for our children, is that we descend into a pessimism that invites a deeply nostalgic form of politics: let’s take Britain or America or Islam back to how it was. In the absence of being able to think through a better future, we fetishise an imaginary past. I think that is incredibly dangerous.</p> <p><strong>Despite all evidence to the contrary, there is still that faith among liberals that, as Martin Luther King said, “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice”. Is that helpful?<br></strong>I think that the way that sentence is constructed is very interesting. If we say that “the arc of history bends”, it suggests that we are passive in that process. But if we say it “can be bent toward justice” that then demands engagement. We are required to do the bending. And as humans, as citizens, as writers, artists, we constantly need to work out how we’re going to do it.</p> <p><strong>Your writing has proved grimly prophetic. In 2015, you wrote that “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/12/the-turmoil-of-todays-world-leading-writers-respond-to-the-refugee-crisis\">hardening borders and watching refugees drown offshore</a>” would soon not </strong><strong>be enough for European countries</strong><strong>. In order for governments to justify their political scapegoating of migrants, you said, “those who look like refugees [would] need to be terrori</strong><strong>sed</strong><strong>… rounded up, expelled”. It must have been profoundly depressing to watch that unfold in the UK?<br></strong>I have a sort of hypersensitivity to that kind of politics. I am deeply allergic to these conflicts between cultures. I know that when the political pollen gets high, I’m going to sneeze. The fact is, we now live in an economy that monetises attention, and [through social media] we are being subjected to an enormously anxiety-inducing reading of the world, and the politics that flows from that. That fearful idea of the world is winning out because it works on our biological design and on our current digital economy design. But how it looks isn’t particularly attractive to almost anybody.</p> <p><strong>So one antidote to that, for you, is to create the space to imagine other possible futures?<br></strong>Yes. What is interesting to me about fiction, and particularly the novel, is that it involves breaking down borders. When you read a novel, you contain somebody else’s consciousness within you. By its nature, it blurs the distinction between people. For me, it’s very potent to create stories that do not dismiss the fear of the other, that appreciate the magnitude of that fear, but that then find a way through. </p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Last White Man</em> by Mohsin Hamid is published by Hamish Hamilton (£12.99).

In the new Disney+ true crime seven-parter <strong><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/series/under-the-banner-of-heaven/71UQCphp9Ip2\">Under the Banner of Heaven</a></strong>, based on the book by Jon Krakauer, Andrew Garfield’s Detective Pyre does things differently. Called to the murders of Mormon mother Brenda Lafferty and her infant daughter in Utah in 1984, he reacts with visceral repulsion to the pools of blood and splattered walls. He has to steel himself to go into the baby’s room. He staggers, he chokes back sobs, he’s broken. You start thinking: dude, are you in the right job? At the same time, it’s moving and effective: Pyre, himself a Mormon, is us in these terrible moments, reacting and feeling as we would.</p> <p>Created by Dustin Lance Black (writer of <em>Milk</em>), a gay man raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, <em>Under the Banner</em> is less a murder mystery, rather a rumination on the fraught intersection between faith, fundamentalism, male entitlement and sanctioned misogyny. Lafferty, played in flashback by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/26/daisy-edgar-jones-normal-people-intimacy-coaches\">Daisy Edgar-Jones</a> (<em>Normal People</em>), is a modern Mormon whose attitude irks everyone bar her husband, Allen (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/26/im-drawn-to-darker-things-how-billy-howle-became-tvs-hottest-property\">Billy Howle</a> from <em>The Serpent</em>). His sprawling patriarchal clan, locally dubbed “the Utah Kennedys”, include brothers, played by, among others, Wyatt Russell, Rory Culkin and Sam Worthington, and their wives (Chloe Pirrie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/13/denise-gough-on-my-radar-cultural-highlights\">Denise Gough</a>).</p> <p>The general vibe is surly, dysfunctional Waltons. After the killings, there’s talk of a hit list (“God’s list”), and Allen babbles about “men with beards” and “prophets”. Privately, another detective (Gil Birmingham) growls that husbands are always the prime suspects: “We both goddamn know that.” “Language, please,” responds Pyre reflexively.</p> <p>This is an unapologetically gruelling drama, with such a muddy colour palette the screen feels like it could do with a good scrub. The momentum is wrecked by absurd depictions of 19th-century Mormon foundation stories that come across like low-budget historical re-enactments. You almost expect Lucy Worsley to float through, perkily explaining what’s happening. Great all-round performances though: Russell is excellent as a swaggering, superficially charming inadequate with delusions of God-given grandeur.</p> <p>We all know of <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/love-island/2a3697\">Love Island’s</a></strong> tragic legacy: the suicides of contestants Mike Thalassitis and Sophie Gradon, and presenter Caroline Flack. But the show goes on. ITV2’s latest series is staggering to a close amid soaring ratings and the by-now familiar formula of grinding monotony, lashings of fake tan and occasional cast meltdowns.</p> <p>The programme seems to have two settings: either it ramps up the drama (disrupting relationships and tormenting participants), or it “plays nice” and becomes an unwatchable bore-athon: swimwear-clad yoofs sitting on candy-coloured beanbags droning: “You tick all my boxes.” Generally, it ricochets between the two. As a longtime viewer (don’t judge me), few things are more tedious than a well-behaved <em>Love Island</em>. Especially right now with everyone eyeing the final – it’s all stilted “challenges” and coos of fake delight when villa-spouses trudge over with morning coffees.

I like former England footballer Michael Owen’s daughter Gemma, a straight-talking 19-year-old with the look of Ali MacGraw, but shouldn’t reality shows be for real people – well, real Instagrammers anyway? As it happens, with the final imminent, Ms Owen became involved in a genuine-looking rift and suddenly <em>Love Island</em> felt a little more real, a tad less manipulated.

Anna Torv (<em>Mindhunter</em>) is Helen, a news anchor with swept-up hair, shoulder pads spanning continents and a facial expression vacillating between fury, vulnerability and professionalism. Helen tussles with blatant sexism from her boss (William McInnes) and veteran co-anchor (Robert Taylor), and her poor mental health. After an “accident” with pills, she is watched over by broadcasting ingenue Dale (Sam Reid), who looks like a sandy-hued Clark Kent, and they start up what is initially a mentor-protege relationship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8da5f6115678523f250fd7942c8a981e0073fa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8da5f6115678523f250fd7942c8a981e0073fa0/0_0_4284_2772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Torv, Robert Taylor and Bert LaBonté in The Newsreader.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Torv, Robert Taylor and Bert LaBonté in the ‘touching and brilliant’ The Newsreader.

While it uses real events as hooks (Chornobyl; Halley’s Comet; the early days of Aids), and riffs on the dark cynicism of news reporting (“Vietnam was terrific for telly”), the real themes are timeless: love, disappointment, triumph, despair. Without wishing to give too much away (all six episodes are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0cgx4k0/the-newsreader\">on iPlayer</a>), it isn’t a female character who fears ageing.

My son had entered with us, but was soon marshalled back inside as we took our seats – my wife and daughter taking a child’s chair that sat about 4in above the ground, while I hunkered down on a low wall that ran along some plant beds. We sat for some minutes, awaiting the unshowy, dignified affair we’d been promised, in which a succession of absurdly cute four-year-olds would pass through a sliding glass door and emerge, triumphantly, as graduates.</p> <p>Graduation. The logical endpoint of any student’s labours – in my son’s case, two years of finger painting, picture books and tactile play – replicated here in a scaled-down satire of university convocation. I hadn’t been expecting this event before the email arrived a few days previously and I quickly became very excited. I did know nursery graduations existed, from people complaining about them online. Usually the sort of furious, red-faced scolds who’d clearly taken a five-minute break from screaming about pronouns or vegan sausage rolls so they could decry such fanfare as ridiculous or silly. I mean, a graduation ceremony for a dozen four-year-olds is ridiculous and silly, but that’s precisely what’s so wonderful about it.</p> <p>I don’t want to damage my rep as a hardened cynic, but I happen to think children doing incongruously mundane, adult things is an excellent thing. I consider myself a fairly empathic person, but I cannot imagine the mind of someone who’d take no joy in a group of confused but proud preschoolers, tumbling, in full regalia, through the motions of a graduation ceremony.</p> <p>We exchanged chat with other parents about the pleasing silliness of it all, confessing mock platitudes of the ‘they’re all grown up’ variety. But at some point my tongue-in-cheek declarations of pride gave way to something like the real thing, and I found myself oddly – perhaps absurdly – moved, as parents giggled and cheered, and children beamed, delighted to receive their certificate once their names were called. It’s fair to say most of the kids were not quite so emotionally invested and quite a few had little idea what was going on. Also, since there were only two sets of robes and hats to hand – expertly swapped between all the kids with military swiftness – there were a few logjams as and when each graduate proved reluctant to part with their new finery, perhaps hoping they’d just been permanently elected a supreme court justice and would get to wear their robes for ever.</p> <p>No such worry with our son, who refused to wear them or the mortar board outright. Our repeated attempts to get him to try on the single cutest outfit we could possibly imagine were met with sullen, teary refusal, so when he passed through the door to receive his certificate, it was in plainclothes, while holding my hand. Once presented with his paperwork, he beamed regardless, and we laughed at ourselves for taking 400 photos of the occasion. Within minutes we were eating sandwiches and comparing snaps, while the ladies and gentlemen of the class of 2022 got on with some tactile play.</p> <p><em>Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

This should be the start of opening up","byline":"Chris Daw","body":"<p>One evening in June 1994 – my first year as a criminal barrister – I arrived home from court, turned on the news and found myself watching something extraordinary, not only in the annals of crime but in the history of broadcasting.</p> <p>OJ Simpson was being pursued by the police on a California highway, broadcast live from a television news helicopter. Eventually, 20 police cars joined the chase before Simpson reached his home in suburban Los Angeles, where he was arrested and later charged with two counts of first degree murder.</p> <p>The high drama of the chase was just the beginning. Every moment of the legal process, including the enthralling jury trial, was captured on camera and broadcast live to the world. This was open justice in its most extreme form; nothing hidden, no broadcast editing or delays. Everyone had an opinion about the case but, in the end, only 12 opinions mattered. It took the jury just four hours to find Simpson not guilty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcc73894988990ce5d54a6a962702001b94ea6c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcc73894988990ce5d54a6a962702001b94ea6c6/0_127_1693_1015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"OJ Simpson trial 1995\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">OJ Simpson, right, confers with his lawyer Robert Kardashian, centre, during his murder trial in a Los Angeles court in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vince Bucci/taken from picture library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The verdict was highly controversial and opinion remains divided to this day, but at least we were all able to watch the evidence unfold for ourselves, without the filter of selectivity. For me, for all the flaws of the US justice system, the televising of the Simpson trial was a huge advance for transparency and public engagement.</p> <p>By the time of that verdict, I was almost two years into my career as a criminal defence barrister. Almost three decades later, now wearing a silk gown rather than the rough cotton of my junior robes, I still ply my trade in the criminal courts, often in cases making headlines around the world.</p> <p>I have become increasingly frustrated and angered at the disparity between what happens in court in front of my eyes and what is reported in the media. I frequently watch or read reports of my cases that simply bear no relationship to the evidence presented or the judgments reached. The law and the evidence are mispresented, key details are distorted or omitted altogether; the picture painted by reporters is often simply wrong.</p> <p>The problem is then compounded by news outlets further distorting the events in court, based on secondhand reporting by journalists who were nowhere near the courtroom. This is journalistic Chinese whispers of the most dangerous and damaging kind, distorting public perception of why a verdict was reached or a particular sentence was passed.</p> <p>We are at an all-time low in public confidence in the justice system, with almost daily calls for “soft judges” to be sacked or for the law to be changed in response to verdicts and sentences, which are not even properly explained in the media, let alone widely understood. When the public no longer trusts the courts to deliver justice, one of the vital pillars of a functioning democratic society is undermined. Our politicians, the present government more than most, ride every populist wave towards harsher, more irrational policies.</p> <p>Boris Johnson came to power in 2019 on a platform of “cracking down” on crime, increasing the length of sentences, criminalising more behaviour than ever before and reducing the discretion of judges in the sentencing process. His government has kept its promises. We do have more people in prison and for longer than ever before. We have also just seen the highest levels of recorded crime in history. These two statistics are not unconnected – quite the opposite.</p> <p>I have long been of the view that the only way to combat inaccurate reporting of events in court, whether in civil trials such as the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/29/wagatha-christie-win-vardy-v-rooney\">“Wagatha Christie”</a> libel case or in high-profile criminal litigation, is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jul/27/crown-court-sentencing-remarks-to-be-televised-for-first-time\">open up our courts to the television cameras</a>, once and for all. Finally, with baby steps at first, the courts are moving in that direction.</p> <p>Last Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jul/28/solemn-sentencing-is-no-circus-as-cameras-enter-english-courts\">Judge Sarah Munro</a> QC made English legal history, when she passed a life sentence on Ben Oliver, a “very damaged man”, for the unlawful killing of his 74-year-old grandfather, early last year. Judge Munro’s clear and cogent sentencing remarks were captured by television cameras, allowed to film proceedings in a crown court in England for the very first time. It was broadcast to the nation on every news bulletin. She explained all of the difficult balancing factors in sentencing a case of this gravity, complexity and sensitivity, most of which never make their way into media reporting of criminal cases.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What matters is that public opinion is built on the truth of what happened in court rather than a media soundbite</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I challenge anyone who watches Judge Munro’s carefully chosen words to find fault with her judicial reasoning, sensitivity and compassion. In a sense, however, it does not matter whether the viewer agrees with the sentence or not. What matters is that public opinion is built on the truth of what happened in court rather than a partial and misleading media soundbite.</p> <p>Open justice, of the kind we witnessed to a limited degree at the Old Bailey last week, is the only way we can hope that, when voters go to the ballot box, there is any chance that their views on the parties’ criminal justice policies will be informed by the truth.</p> <p>For me, this should only be the beginning. Most people do not have the time, money or inclination to travel to a court and sit in the public gallery during the working week, to exercise their right to watch justice in action. Why should they have to? We live in an age when cameras are ubiquitous, filming and recording everything we do and everywhere we go. It is time for every criminal court in the land to be thrown open wide to the public, through their phones, tablets, computers and television sets, so that everyone can finally see how justice is carried out in their name.</p> <p>Of course, we need to protect vulnerable witnesses and defendants but the courts and the broadcasters can easily cope with that. For everything else, as with the OJ Simpson trial all those years ago, let us give the people the information they need to judge our courts on what really happens, rather than the fiction of most media reporting. Knowledge, in the courts as much as anywhere else, is power. Let the people make up their own minds.</p> <p>• Chris Daw QC is a barrister and author of <em>Justice on Trial</em></p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Covid inquiry must also look into the impact the government’s mishandling of the pandemic had on the mental health of teachers and other frontline workers.”</p> <p>This comes with teaching leaders warning that working pressures, combined with a below-inflation pay rise offer, will intensify a crisis in teacher retention. Most have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/19/millions-of-uk-public-sector-workers-given-below-inflation-pay-rise\" title=\"\">offered a 5% pay rise next year</a> – higher than the original 3% offer, but well below the 9.1% rate of inflation. Starting salaries will rise by 8.9%. Unions have said they will consult their members on possible industrial action in the autumn as a result of the offer. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the 5% increase offered to most teachers would be “a total real-terms cut of nearly 12% since 2010”. Schools will have to fund the increases out of existing budgets.</p> <p>Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said stress and poor mental health had become “a really significant problem”. She said: “The biggest problem is workload and this is often cited, alongside pay, as one of the main reasons we have a very high staff turnover rate in education, with 40% of teachers leaving within 10 years of qualifying.</p> <p>“During the pandemic, schools and staff had to take on a great deal of additional work. All of this will have left many staff feeling burnt out and we are also hearing that some have come out of the pandemic with a view to reappraising their work/life balance and quitting teaching. This is of huge concern because the situation with teacher shortages is already pretty desperate and it seems likely to get even worse.”</p> <p>Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The government is failing to address the issues of unacceptable workload, supersized classrooms, punitive accountability measures, stress and pay needed to ensure teaching is a profession that is both attractive to graduates and which keeps experienced teachers in post.”</p> <p>A Whitehall official said the forthcoming Covid inquiry included a pledge to examine the impact on the nation’s mental health. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are incredibly grateful for the continued efforts of teachers and school leaders in supporting pupils, especially over the pandemic. We are taking action to support teachers to stay in the profession and thrive. This includes increasing pay and launching the Education Staff Wellbeing Charter, which commits to reducing unnecessary teacher workload, championing flexible working and improving access to wellbeing resources.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/jul/31/look-we-have-come-through-by-lara-feigel-review-living-with-dh-lawrence","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T08:00:50Z","webTitle":"Look!

We Have Come Through! by Lara Feigel review – a woman in love","trailText":"The author draws parallels between her own life and that of DH Lawrence, making this memoir-cum-self-help book more than a little mystifying","byline":"Rachel Cooke","body":"<p>Last year was an unexpectedly big one for DH Lawrence. Not only did Frances Wilson publish her <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/burning-man-9781408893654\">wild biography</a> of the writer, there were also two Lawrence-inspired novels: Rachel Cusk’s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/may/02/second-place-by-rachel-cusk-review-psychodrama-in-the-shape-of-a-social-comedy\">Second Place</a></em>, which transposes elements of Mabel Dodge Luhan’s memoir of her time with Lawrence in Taos, New Mexico, on to a contemporary East Anglian landscape; and Alison MacLeod’s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/06/tenderness-by-alison-macleod-review-polite-societys-rude-awakening\">Tenderness</a></em>, inspired by the publication of <em>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</em>. For some, all this will have been stirring. Even a Lawrence refusnik like me thrilled to Wilson’s confounding book. But others will have looked on, waiting for it to pass, trying hard not to shudder. To read Lawrence is, as even some of his admirers admit, to be in the company of a bully, a preacher and a narcissist. Fascinating, he might be (in small doses). Good company he most definitely is not.</p> <p>But, wait. It seems we’re not done with him yet. <a href=\"https://www.larafeigel.com/about-lara/\">Lara Feigel</a>, the academic and writer, now arrives late to the party, determined not only to reassess Lawrence, but to use him as some kind of guide to life. Yes, I know, this is somewhat hard to fathom. He’s not exactly M Scott Peck, is he? However, there are special circumstances. <em>Look! We Have Come Through</em><em>! </em>is a pandemic book, born in extremis, of sorts. As Feigel explains in the introduction, just before the first lockdown in 2020, she let her London flat and retreated with her two children to a cottage in Oxfordshire. Though she had, at the time, already “agreed” to write a book about Lawrence, the project now seemed to her to be newly “necessary”. She required him for “urgent literary companionship”, very few writers being, to her mind, so good on “extreme forms of proximity” as Lorenzo. “What I want to gain from him is… a sense of what it means to accept our lived experience as one of perpetual change,” she writes, as if any of us have a choice in the matter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To consider him a guru? To turn to him, as she does, for parenting advice? To do so seems rather extreme, not to say bizarre, to me.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At this point, the reader will wonder precisely what ilk of book she is holding in her hands. Is it criticism, memoir or self-help? This is a hard one to answer. Given that Feigel is looking only for certain things in Lawrence’s work – she divides her chapters according to subjects such as sex, parenthood and community – students of literature may want to go elsewhere. But it’s not much of a memoir, either. Yes, we read of a Lawrence-inspired jaunt she once took to Germany and Italy with a lover, during which she was irritable and insufficiently “gripped by carnality”. But this is about as intimate as it gets. Most of the time, the territory is humdrum. She tells off her children; she goes for walks; her partner looks at her bum and wonders if she will ever leave him for a younger man.</p> <p>Which leaves self-help. Like Feigel, I think most human beings feel, sometimes, that they would like to be able to break the rules – to be more free, less conventional, less atrophied – and it may be this that draws some to Lawrence, especially when young (he is, it seems to me, a writer for those whose sap is rising). But to consider him a guru? To turn to him, as she does, for parenting advice? To do so seems rather extreme, not to say bizarre, to me. But having embarked on her project, she gives it a good old go, reluctant ever to admit to failure. Take Lawrence’s attitude to democracy (he was against it). “This is one of the aspects of Lawrence’s thinking I find most difficult,” she writes, as if there may yet still be some way to come to terms with it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jul/18/book-beach-out-of-sheer-rage-geoff-dyer-sam-jordison\">A book for the beach: Out of Sheer Rage by Geoff Dyer | Sam Jordison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How she strains to find common ground between her life and that of Lawrence! Long accounts of the novels are bookended with observations so limp, so utterly banal, they could apply to almost anyone, in any situation. When she has a cold, for instance, it’s just like one of his. On and on she goes. Lawrence believed that the unconscious is to be found not in the head, but in the belly button, which brings her carefully to consider her stomach, happily still “taut”; now she lives in the country, she’s also content to agree with him that she would do well to “learn how to live from the sheep”, and pah! to psychoanalysis. At one point, she writes: “Our summer unfolds, rather like the one in <em>Women in Love</em>.” What? Pulse quickening, the reader pictures wanton frolicking, the “complete union” Birkin hoped to have with Ursula Brangwen. But, no. It’s more to do with the sun and the grass and Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>In her introduction, Feigel acknowledges the “brilliant women” who published books about Lawrence in 2021. The writer she doesn’t mention here, however, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/28/geoff-dyer-im-convinced-roger-federer-and-i-could-become-great-friends\">Geoff Dyer</a>, whose hilarious and wholly uncategorisable book about Lawrence, <em><a href=\"http://geoffdyer.com/books/out-of-sheer-rage/\">Out of Sheer Rage</a></em>, was published in 1997. And no wonder. It’s impossible not to think of – to long for – Dyer as you read <em>Look! We Have Come Through!</em>, his project being, in some senses, quite similar to Feigel’s. (Like her, he trails dutifully to Eastwood, in Nottinghamshire, where Lawrence grew up the son of a miner.) How baffling to find her – much later, in her acknowledgments – writing that she is “grateful to Dyer for showing that Lawrence is best written about irreverently”.<strong> </strong>She could have learned from his mercilessness and candour; she needs the occasional joke far more than anything Lawrence can give her. Who is her book for? It’s hard to imagine its intended reader. Far from encouraging me to rethink Lawrence, it seemed to confirm all my worst prejudices, chief among them the notion that those who are apt to stick up for him are usually to be regarded with deep suspicion.</p> <p>• <em>Look!

This century does not require a small state – it requires an agile state. More years of denial and the UK will be in very serious economic and social trouble.</p> <p>Last week came a vignette of small-state stupidity, ceding a major area of 21st-century economic activity to France and undermining our national security – with close observers believing that no minister even knew the magnitude of their crassness. I speak of the merger, on French terms, of the formerly British-controlled space company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/26/uk-satellite-oneweb-france-eutelsat-merger-deal-elon-musk-starlink#:~:text=The%20British%20satellite%20company%20OneWeb,bn%20(%C2%A32.8bn).\" title=\"\">OneWeb with France’s Eutelsat</a>, turbo-boosting the EU space effort. These Brexiters are remarkably incompetent at doing Brexit. But then incompetence comes with the territory.</p> <p>OneWeb was Britain’s opportunistic way of recovering the ground we lost in space because of Brexit and the consequent forced exit from the EU’s Galileo and Copernicus programmes. Rescued from insolvency by a daring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/26/uk-invest-satellite-rival-eu-galileo-system-oneweb\" title=\"\">£500m bid by the UK government two years ago</a>, OneWeb owns valuable allocated orbit “shells” and spectrum rights, reckoned to represent an astounding 15% of all space available for service delivery to Earth. This spatial real estate is the basis for a unique constellation of satellites and for the next phase of commercial space development and sophisticated communications – worth in the decades ahead tens of billions. Last week, Tory ministers let it slip through our fingers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Britain’s avowed aim is to be a globally competitive space power. Forget it. Be sure prime minister Truss will not dare to attempt any OneWebs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Ukraine war had forced OneWeb to reschedule its satellite launch programme, at some expense. Every shareholder agreed except the British: tax cuts were more important, the state must be shrunk and the market must rule. Eutelsat saw the opening, won the OneWeb board’s approval and offered the deal to buy the risk-averse British out.</p> <p>But beneath the face-saving baubles about retaining a board seat and golden share, crucially Britain will no longer have control over the future space systems developed by OneWeb or on how any of its spectrum is used. Johnson may be a liar, a constitutional vandal and corrupt, but he did have the chutzpah to launch the deal (driven by Dominic Cummings). Britain’s avowed aim is to be a globally competitive space power. Forget it. Be sure prime minister Truss will not dare to attempt any OneWebs.</p> <p>But it is exactly this agile state mindset that is needed across the gamut of policy – not guff about tax cuts, aspiration, the magic of markets, attacking wokeness and bringing back grammar schools.</p> <p>Our broken energy market is a case in point. British consumers face among the highest energy bills in Europe. It should be no surprise: the approach embodied by the OneWeb deal has been applied to the electricity market. The electricity tariff is not the average price of electricity produced by varying power generators, as it was when directed by the “big state” Central Electricity Generating Board, ensuring no violent spikes in prices. Amazingly, our bills are pitched at whatever price is needed to bring the most expensive producer into the grid to complete the necessary base load – not reflecting the contribution from low-cost renewables and nuclear. Consumer tariffs are thus the highest they could possibly be, reflecting the rising spot market price of gas.</p> <p>Nor does the market madness stop there. Unlike a car or a TV or a new dress, electricity doesn’t vary with the producer: it is invisible. There is nothing to differentiate electricity; it is the least apt material with which to constitute a market. But in the Tory small-state mindset, markets are always best, so the doctrine is that varying producers – wind farms, nuclear energy, gas-fired power stations – form a market selling electricity to one another within a short time frame. Long-term contracts? Averaging out the costs across all generators, rather than being keyed into the highest cost generator? That implies too much big state.</p> <p>The Ukraine war and rocketing oil and gas prices have blown the whole conception sky-high. Thirty suppliers have gone bust. Bills were always going to rise, but a more rational electricity production and pricing system, along with building in incentives to construct low-cost renewable capacity fast, could have drawn some of the sting. As UCL’s Professor <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2022/jan/opinion-renewables-are-cheaper-ever-so-why-are-household-energy-bills-only-going\" title=\"\">Michael Grubb argues</a>, the price differential between cheap renewables and hyper-expensive gas is now “unconscionable”.</p> <p>What to do? Every energy producer should be required to incorporate as a public benefit company in emergency legislation, constitutionally forcing them to put the consumer interest before profit as their corporate purpose. Engaging with these newly constituted power generators, the regulator Ofgem should gather their now open book costs and calculate a standard tariff for all consumers that reflects the lower production costs of renewables and nuclear energy. Expensive gas-fired generators that would now make losses can apply to be nationalised (as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/19/france-to-pay-nearly-10bn-to-fully-nationalise-edf\" title=\"\">French did with EDF recently</a>) or offered soft 50-year loans and grants to tide them over. It should be producers that take some of the hit over rising gas and oil prices; the hit should not be shouldered by consumers.</p> <p>Planning laws should be instantly relaxed to allow onshore windfarm construction, with those local communities sharing some of the revenue. Interestingly, Grubb proposes the creation of “green power pools” in which renewable producers store their cheap energy for sale to consumers. There should be a crash programme of home insulation and the creation of a national network of electricity charge points for cars. Rebates on consumer energy bills should be targeted on the least well off.</p> <p>This is the 21st-century agile state in action – a conception both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak know will win them no votes from ageing Conservative party members who deify Mrs Thatcher. Instead, better to give away Britain’s stake in space and attack cheap renewables as “woke”. That pleases the Conservative party. The gulf between the real world and Tory world has never been so deep.</p> <p>• Will Hutton is an Observer columnist</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2022/jul/31/carnacion-rocio-molina-teatro-alle-tese-venice-dance-biennale-review-petrushka-saburo-teshigawara-wayne-mcgregor","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T08:00:49Z","webTitle":"Carnación; Petrushka review – two contrasting personal visions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/31/carnacion-rocio-molina-teatro-alle-tese-venice-dance-biennale-review-petrushka-saburo-teshigawara-wayne-mcgregor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/jul/31/carnacion-rocio-molina-teatro-alle-tese-venice-dance-biennale-review-petrushka-saburo-teshigawara-wayne-mcgregor","fields":{"headline":"Carnación; Petrushka review – two contrasting personal visions","trailText":"Silver Lion winner Rocío Molina unleashes raw energy, while Golden Lion winner Saburo Teshigawara turns his gaze inward","byline":"Sarah Crompton","body":"<p>A woman in a pink tulle dress stands at the back of a wooden stage, covered with lime dust.

His girlfriend, Mariah, lived with her two children, Elliot and Viola, in a flat in nearby Frederiksberg. The couple wanted to move in together, but struggled to find a home that could accommodate their family. “With the prices in Copenhagen, we didn’t have enough money to buy an apartment that was the size we needed,” Lillelund explains.</p> <p>Luckily Mariah’s recently divorced neighbour was hoping to downsize.

The largest living room and master bedroom were kept intact, while the two younger girls, Clara and Viola (12 and 11), share a room. “Luckily for us, they hit it off from the moment we introduced them,” Lillelund recalls. “They are now best friends.”</p> <p>Every other week, the apartment becomes a bustling home for six but, when the children aren’t there, it transforms into a cocooning space for grownups. “I figured that we could divide the apartment into a section for the kids and a section for us, separated by the living room,” says Lillelund. “This gives us our own space when the kids are here and it makes it easy to ‘close off’ the kids’ section when they’re not here.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4bad9f24712b07e425bb2da1d2e6d65d42e20b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4bad9f24712b07e425bb2da1d2e6d65d42e20b6/0_233_3456_4320/800.jpg\" alt=\"Inner visions: a suspended child’s bed with its own climbing wall.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inner visions: a suspended child’s bed with its own climbing wall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christina Kayser/Living Inside</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once the structural changes had been made, the flat was ready to be redecorated. “There’s not a lot of natural light and even though the walls and ceiling were white, it was still very dark in here,” Lillelund recalls. “We could have opted for white floors, white sofas and a white kitchen, but that’s so bloody boring! Instead, we chose to embrace the ‘hygge’ factor by introducing this grey.”</p> <p>At first Mariah, who teaches meditation, was not convinced: “She thought I’d lost my mind when I told her I wanted to paint the walls, ceilings, doors and woodwork in grey,” says Lillelund. “But she trusted me.” He had tried the idea on a previous project, an intimate wine bar. “It worked so well in there and it is such a beautiful, deep, powerful shade, I knew it would give the entire apartment a warm and cosy feel.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cb470fbebdee1ee0e2cdbe1eca9f860338ea710\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cb470fbebdee1ee0e2cdbe1eca9f860338ea710/0_806_3456_4320/800.jpg\" alt=\"Grey matters: for the ‘hygge’ factor, here mixed with pink.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grey matters: for the ‘hygge’ factor, here mixed with pink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christina Kayser/Living Inside</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obviously, Clara and Viola had other plans. “We wanted a rosy pink for the two bathrooms,” says Lillelund, “but as soon as the younger girls saw the colour, they decided their room had to be pink too… Fortunately, the pink and grey work really well together and they provide the perfect background for the oak joinery.”</p> <p>Nearly all the furniture was custom-made by Lillelund, who took six months off work to complete the project. Rather than combine their bulky furniture, the couple agreed to sell it off and allow Lillelund to design and build the sofas, beds, bookshelves, dining table and kitchen from a combination of solid oak and oak veneer. “I’m most proud of the built-in shelf and sofas in the living room,” says Lillelund. “I just love things that are created specifically for the place. Now, I wouldn’t be able to go out and buy a new sofa – I wouldn’t know where to begin! – because I can always envision something better that I can build myself.”</p> <p>Having lived in the apartment for six years now, Lillelund is ready for his next personal project: “I want to recreate a modern summer house, with a completely handmade interior. I just need to find a unique plot to do it on.”</p> <p><em>For more information, go to <a href=\"https://www.rum4.dk/\" title=\"\">rum4.dk</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/rev-richard-coles-and-richard-dawkins-dine-across-the-divide-evidence-feeling","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T08:00:49Z","webTitle":"Rev Richard Coles and Richard Dawkins dine across the divide: ‘The problem is he’s not swayed by evidence but by feeling’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/rev-richard-coles-and-richard-dawkins-dine-across-the-divide-evidence-feeling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/rev-richard-coles-and-richard-dawkins-dine-across-the-divide-evidence-feeling","fields":{"headline":"Rev Richard Coles and Richard Dawkins dine across the divide: ‘The problem is he’s not swayed by evidence but by feeling’","trailText":"In our celebrity Dining across the divide special, the cleric meets the atheist biologist.

Starting out in 2007 as part of the pop-R&amp;B group the Stunners, who supported Justin Bieber on his debut tour in 2010, she went on to star in a series of teen TV movies, crowdfund a solo EP in 2013 and eventually release her debut album, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/01/hayley-kiyoko-expectations-review\">Expectations</a>,</em> in 2018.

Until, that is, the last line, when the music and laughter of the socially distanced sunbathers, cyclists and skateboarders he has encountered is suddenly drowned out by an all too familiar noise – “di unrelentin wailin soun of sirens” from passing ambulances.</p> <p>“The lockdown was extraordinary,” he tells me, as we sit, sipping iced water, in the sunny backyard of a bar in Herne Hill, “because most nights you could not hear a sound. In Brixton! But by daybreak it would start again and, from dawn to dusk, it was just sirens. Ambulances going up and down, up and down.” He pauses for a moment as if transported back there. “Lambeth got hit hard, but touch wood I was all right.”</p> <p>How did he deal with the long months of enforced isolation? “Well, I feel as if I lost two years of my life somehow,” he says. “I’m almost 70 and just when I should have been going about enjoying myself, this thing happened. And, after a while, I got lazy. And, what’s more, I got to like being lazy – sitting at home all day, watching rubbish on the telly, going for walks in the park. I had a little routine and I got too used to it.”</p> <p>Dressed for the hot weather in white T-shirt, baggy shorts and sandals, rather than his signature suit, tie and trilby, Linton Kwesi Johnson does not look his age. He is sprightly, more animated and mischievous than the serious young activist whose spoken word reportage, delivered over hypnotic reggae rhythms,<em> </em>almost singlehandedly defined the term<em> </em>“dub poetry”. On a quartet of groundbreaking albums made in collaboration with producer Dennis Bovell – <em>Dread, Beat an’ Blood </em>(1978), <em>Forces of Victory </em>(1979), <em>Bass Culture</em> (1980) and <em>Making History </em>(1983) <em>–</em> Johnson recited the words of anger, struggle and defiance he had written to the pulse of reggae bass lines he heard in his head. Many of those spoken word songs remain resonant today: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ_Y_Xlwnb4\">Mekin Histri</a>, a protest poem against police and government corruption; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsM1YOJRGLg\">Liesense fi Kill</a>, which tackles the deaths of young black men in police custody; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egye9tBl-y8\">Five Nights of Bleeding</a>, a visceral evocation of the internecine violence that could erupt without warning at a blues dance or a reggae gig – “cold blades as sharp as the eyes of hate”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These politicians are not representative of the black population… their sense of solidarity is with the rich</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“I was trying to find a bridge between standard English and spoken Jamaican,” he says of his initial decision to express himself in the vernacular of the London-Jamaican community to which he belonged. “A lot of poetry of the time sounded like Caribbeans trying to sound American, a bit like those Mick Jagger songs where he’s trying to sing like he’s from the deep south. For me, what was important was authenticity of voice. I didn’t want to emulate anyone else. I wanted it to sound like me.”</p> <p>In his introduction to the new edition of Johnson’s <em>Selected Poems</em>, the author and political journalist <a href=\"https://www.garyyounge.com/\">Gary Younge</a> recalls “the thrill of transgression” he felt as a teenager in the 1980s when he watched Johnson recite <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq9OpJYck7Y\">Inglan Is a Bitch</a> on television. “I didn’t know you could do that,” Younge remembers thinking, “effectively say what you’re thinking about racism in Britain out loud in public and still work again.”</p> <p>Others were not so thrilled by Johnson’s audacity and linguistic iconoclasm. In 1982, in the wake of the first Brixton riots, the <em>Spectator</em> railed against his phonetically transcribed patois poems, claiming they had “wreaked havoc in schools and helped to create a generation of rioters and illiterates”. Never one to seek mainstream or literary validation, Johnson’s politically anchored self-assurance was unshakeable in the face of such loaded criticism. “From the start, I saw my verse as a way of chronicling black British history as it was being made,” he tells me. “I certainly did not see myself as an angry young black poet, which was often how I was portrayed, but as someone who was attempting to articulate in verse the experiences of my generation.”</p> <p>The artist and film-maker Steve McQueen recently used Johnson’s angry elegy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUMYAqAlAXA\">New Craas Massakah</a> in an episode of his acclaimed BBC drama series <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000q6rf/small-axe-series-1-alex-wheatle\">Small Axe</a></em>. It was originally written in the wake of the 1981 New Cross house fire, in which 13 black teenagers died from a suspected arson attack. The young poet and critic <a href=\"https://kadishmorris.com/\">Kadish Morris</a>, who first encountered Johnson aged 13, when he came to a poetry workshop in Leeds organised by her mother, recalls the visceral charge of the poem in the context of McQueen’s film. “It was so powerful and raw to hear the poem over footage from the time,” she tells me, when I ask if his work still resonates with a younger generation of performance poets. “Everyone was on Twitter afterwards asking, ‘Who was that poet? What was that poem?’”</p> <p>McQueen also commissioned a new poem, Towards Closure, from Johnson, for his recent documentary series, <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m000y317/uprising\">Uprising</a></em>. It is the final poem in the book, a short, moving tribute in plain English to the memory of the victims. “It was perfect and it was powerful, because Linton has stayed true to the truth,” says McQueen. “The truth is his fire. And the truth is dangerous, but he knows how to handle it. It’s very difficult to do that as an artist, and for it to be piercing, but the truth vibrates through his words and his sound. There is a clarity to it.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The Penguin volume neatly divides Johnson’s verse into three chronological sections: the 70s, 80s and 90s. “The first decade was about urgency of expression, things I needed to get off my chest,” he says. “The second was all about learning my craft and how to structure my language, and the third was when I finally began to find my voice. I’m a classic late developer, so it took me 20 years to get there.”</p> <p>Was it difficult to decide which poems made the final cut? “It basically came down to how embarrassing they were to read again,” he says, laughing. “If they weren’t cringeworthy, they stood a chance.” Are there others that, with hindsight, bring him a sense of deep satisfaction? “That would be going a bit far. I’d say there are maybe five or six good poems in there and the rest I can live with.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f3556c6b74e6786b76b04e95108c3296185f499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f3556c6b74e6786b76b04e95108c3296185f499/0_151_3542_2125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson performing in the Netherlands in 1980: ‘I never saw myself predominantly as a reggae artist.

He came to poetry, he writes in his afterword, “from the backwoods of literary ignorance”. Born in the rural small town of Chapelton in the parish of Clarendon, Jamaica, he travelled to London in 1963, aged 11, his mother having made the journey before them. “I come from Jamaican peasantry,” he says, matter of factly. “My family were subsistence farmers, so basically we ate what we grew. Once in a while, we might have a few extra eggs to take to market, or some sugarcane or ginger. That’s how we lived.”</p> <p>He remembers as a child being enthralled by “nonsense rhymes, skipping rhymes and Anansi stories”, as well as the Bible verses he learned by rote at school. “You could say that I was well grounded in the Jamaican oral tradition by the time I left.”</p> <p>His activism began when he joined the youth wing of the British Black Panthers when he was still at school. What did that entail exactly? “Political education. You had to take part in demonstrations, sell the newspapers and study certain texts. We read <em>Soul on Ice </em>by Eldridge Cleaver and <em>Seize the Time </em>by Bobby Seale<em>,</em> but also <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/eighty-years-late-groundbreaking-work-on-slave-economy-is-finally-published-in-uk\">Capitalism and Slavery</a> </em>by Eric Williams and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/06/100-best-non-fiction-books-no-19-making-of-the-english-working-class-ep-thompson-1963-robert-mccrum\">The Making of the English Working Class</a></em><em> </em>by EP Thompson. For us, class was important as well as race in the struggle.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Playing to white crowds was an opportunity, because white people need to know about the black experience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Johnson went on to study sociology at Goldsmiths, and, for a time, wrote freelance music reviews and penned artist biographies for Virgin Records. In his afterword to <em>Selected Poems</em>, he writes: “Poetry for me was never a calling. It was more like a visceral need for self-expression at a formative period of my life, when I was trying to find my way in the world.”</p> <p>His poems first appeared in the journal <em>Race Today</em>, which was published by the Brixton-based radical black collective of the same name, which he belonged to alongside his friend, the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/apr/03/darcus-howe-race-britain-black-politics-tribute\">Darcus Howe</a>. They were written, he says, “out of the deep sense of alienation and rejection” that his post-Windrush generation experienced in Britain. “In Jamaica, we were schooled to be British, to wave the flag when the Queen came, but when we came here we were <em>othered</em> by the rest of British society. That kind of estrangement was profound and it is one reason why reggae was so important to us. It gave us a sense of independent identity that was all our own.”</p> <p>Two books followed, 1974’s <em>Voices of the Living and the Dead</em> and 1975’s <em>Dread Beat and Blood</em><em>, </em>the latter also providing the title for his first album, which was released by Virgin Records in 1978. Made on a budget of £2,000, it signalled much of what was to come. His spoken-word lyrics, anchored and given heft by Dennis Bovell’s deft, dub-wise production, often sounded like warnings from the heart of a disfranchised black British community, whose rage at heavy-handed policing would stoke the riots of the early 1980s in Brixton, Toxteth and St Pauls.</p> <p>The dub poetry that Johnson created drew on many diverse sources, including the work of groundbreaking black American poets of the 1950s and 1960s such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/10/amiri-baraka\">LeRoi Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/04/jayne-cortez\">Jayne Cortez</a>, Caribbean writers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/edward-kamau-brathwaite-obituary\">Kamau Brathwaite</a> and Andrew Salkey, and Jamaican reggae DJs or toasters such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/feb/18/u-roy-legendary-reggae-toaster-dies-aged-78\">U-Roy</a>, Big Youth and Prince Jazzbo, who improvised over instrumental cuts of well-known songs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebea077b3eace83a7679484c9ea31ddc98d0b77f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebea077b3eace83a7679484c9ea31ddc98d0b77f/163_240_1757_1054/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson with Darcus Howe at the Race Today office in 1979: ‘In Jamaica, we were schooled to be British, to wave the flag when the Queen came, but when we came here, we were othered,’ he says.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Darcus Howe at the Race Today office in 1979: ‘In Jamaica, we were schooled to be British, to wave the flag when the Queen came, but when we came here we were othered.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Boot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson’s arrival on the British music scene coincided with the birth of post-punk, when groups such as the Pop Group and the Slits were deploying dub-reggae stylings – Bovell produced records for both. On Christmas Day and Boxing Day 1978, Johnson played two shows in support of Public Image Ltd, John Lydon’s post-Sex Pistols group, at the Rainbow theatre in Finsbury Park. “Oh my God!” he exclaims, when I ask him about the experience. “It was just me and some backing tapes on a Revox tape machine facing an ocean of punks. I wanted to run offstage, but, to my surprise, they liked me.”</p> <p>He toured too, with Ian Dury and the Blockheads – “He was a perfect gentleman” – and Siouxsie and the Banshees – “They treated me real nice.” Did it trouble him, though, that he was performing to almost exclusively white audiences? “Not at all. I saw it as an opportunity because I was talking about the black experience and white people need to know about it. We black people already knew it because we were living it.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is important to educate yourself about what went before because continuity is crucial</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Johnson’s engagement with the music industry says much about his character, self-assurance and the strength of his political ideals. He turned down lucrative long-term record deals from both Richard Branson at Virgin and Chris Blackwell at Island, the man who had helped turn Bob Marley into a reggae icon. Some years later, Johnson tells me, he met Bob Marley’s ex-girlfriend Esther Anderson, who told him that Blackwell had been prepared to spend a million dollars to make him an international star.</p> <p>“But that wasn’t me,” he says, firmly. “I took myself seriously as a political activist and that kind of life was not conducive to political activism. Also, I never saw myself predominantly as a reggae artist. For me, it was a way to bring my poetry to a wider audience.” He has also, he says, been offered national honours, which he refused. Though last year, he received an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of the West Indies: “As someone who began life as a barefoot peasant boy, roaming about the hills of Clarendon, Jamaica, it doesn’t get any better than that.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>It is hard to think of anyone in today’s more corporate music scene with such deeply held principles, but, as Johnson acknowledges, “these are different times”. After a lifetime of activism, is he still an optimist? “An eternal optimist. You have to be. There is always hope, even if we seem to be moving backwards in terms of social justice, immigration, poverty. I don’t know how much reading the youngsters do who were inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, but it is important to educate yourself about what went before because continuity is crucial. You need to know where you are coming from to know where you’re going.”</p> <p>He tells me he did not vote in general elections until Jeremy Corbyn first ran in 2017: “His manifesto presented me with a genuine choice for the first time.” I ask him what he thinks of the rise of black politicians such as Kemi Badenoch who, when we met, had just announced that she was running for Tory party leader. He shakes his head. “These people are not representative of the black population. They are part of the black elite and their sense of solidarity is with the rich. They do not have any sense of solidarity with black people.”</p> <p>After our meeting, I walk down Railton Road, where I too used to live in the 1980s, taking in the inevitable changes. The Hamilton Arms, the local we shared back then, is now a supermarket. The all-night grocery-cum-off-licence that once stood on Brixton’s notorious “frontline” is now a minimalist cafe serving fresh-roasted coffee to the young professionals who have colonised the leafy sidestreet. The Rastas and the riots seem so distant as to be a mirage.</p> <p>Blessedly, the Methodist church and youth club where Linton Kwesi Johnson gave his first live performances is still standing. And the building that was <em>Race Today</em>’s office is now the Brixton Advice Centre, its windows bearing portraits of Johnson and his fellow activists. Round here, even amid all the changes, he remains a local and a legend. “If any young artists need to know about longevity and integrity, he is the one to look to,” says Steve McQueen of Johnson’s singular status in the British black community. “He knew his path and he walked it. His words are still relevant and that reggae bass is still vibrating.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Selected Poems</em> by Linton Kwesi Johnson is published by Penguin (£9.99).

Head boy at Winchester, one of England’s grandest private schools. A first in PPE at Oxford, nursery of so many Tory prime ministers, and a Fulbright scholar at Stanford. He talked his way into one of the safest Conservative seats in the country at the age of 34 and was chancellor before he turned 40.</p> <p>David Cameron once dubbed him “the future of our party” and ascending to Number 10 must have seemed the inevitable next episode of an irresistible story of upward mobility from the suburbs of Southampton to the pinnacle of power.</p> <p>Unfortunately for him, this chapter is being written by Tory members and it doesn’t look as though they will make it a happy one. The <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/07/26/tory-members-say-liz-truss-triumphed-bbc-leadershi\" title=\"\">polling suggests</a> that the majority want not him as their next leader, but Liz Truss. The Trussites are becoming so confident that some of them are risking sounding complacent and arrogant by suggesting that Mr Sunak ought to quit now before he falls even further behind. He is showing signs of being rattled, such as his abrupt conversion to suspending VAT on energy bills, an idea he previously dismissed on the correct grounds that this is not the way to direct help to those who most need it because a VAT cut will be of greatest benefit to affluent households.</p> <p>It is too early to definitively write off his bid for the leadership – an extraordinary event or revelation could still upend things – but we can draft a preliminary postmortem of why the golden boy lost his lustre.</p> <p>One big mistake was to think that it would be enough to present himself as the safe pair of hands who protected the economy during the pandemic and can be relied on to see Britain safely through an inflation-fuelled tempest. Running on competence looked like smart differentiation after the seedy farce of the Johnson premiership. The more so because Ms Truss has little to show for a decade as a minister, eight of them in the cabinet. Yet she has guilefully turned her absence of achievement into an advantage by running as an insurgent “change” candidate who was always, so she now tells everyone, appalled by the terrible failures of the governments she sat in.</p> <p>By contrast, Mr Sunak has a record that means he has had to spend a lot of his time defending it. He often dwells on furlough and the other crisis measures he introduced during the pandemic. He sounds almost nostalgic about that time. Rishi to the Rescue was the period when he became the most popular Westminster politician since Tony Blair was at his zenith. His enemies have focused on his more recent and much less liked iteration, Rishi the Tax Raiser.</p> <p>He presents himself as the candidate brave enough to confront audiences with tough trade-offs. “In this leadership election, I haven’t taken the easy road,” he says. Denouncing Ms Truss’s fantasy economics in one of their recent encounters, he declared: “It’s the same old having your cake and eating it.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To counter the portrait of him as an entitled elitist cocooned in privilege, he has sold his family history as a kind of rags-to-riches story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So it is, but the Tory party has not lost its sweet tooth for sugar-rush confections. If the polls are correct, there are more customers for the Truss cafe’s nut meringues, fondant fancies, gâteau magique and whoopie pies than there are for Mr Sunak’s dry “sound money” rock cakes. Being the “grownup” candidate has not been an asset but a handicap because the Tory party has had its synapses scrambled during its three years in thrall to the puerile antics of Mr Johnson.</p> <p>The former chancellor is dogged by claims that he was the orchestrator of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/28/nadine-dorries-suggests-rishi-sunak-part-of-coup-oust-boris-johnson-liz-truss\" title=\"\">a ruthless coup</a> to depose the outgoing prime minister. A preposterous but potent betrayal narrative is being propagated by the Johnsonites and in rightwing media, which is consumed by Tory members. At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/28/sunak-says-as-pm-he-would-back-creation-of-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">leadership hustings</a> in Leeds on Thursday night, one angry pro-Johnson activist rounded on Mr Sunak with the accusation “many people see that you’ve stabbed him in the back”. The right riposte to this is that the architect of Boris Johnson’s downfall was Boris Johnson. He debased and disgraced the premiership with his rule-breaking, his lies and his sleaze. If Mr Sunak and the dozens of other ministers who used resignation as a weapon of last resort should regret anything, it is that they did not act earlier. Yet the ex-chancellor dares not give a forthright explanation of why Mr Johnson had to be evicted for fear of further aggravating the significant cohort of Tory members who are still beguiled by him.</p> <p>The smoothness of the launch of Mr Sunak’s campaign attracted less praise for its professionalism than it did condemnation for proving that he had been preparing for a tilt at the top job for months. So had Ms Truss, but her backers now conveniently forget all those “fizz with Liz” receptions for Tory MPs and donors in swanky Mayfair clubs.</p> <p>The former chancellor has been the more fluent performer, and has demonstrated the better command of detail, in all the leadership debates. His foes have flipped that against him by saying he is too polished and packaged. Among a Tory membership that is concentrated in provincial England, it hasn’t been difficult for Team Truss to encourage mistrust of her rival as a metropolitan smoothie. The foreign secretary is the more lacklustre performer. So her camp are promoting that as a virtue. When Ben Wallace, the defence secretary and an admired figure among Tory members, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/ben-wallace-attacks-rishi-sunak-cabinet-resignation-after-backing-truss\" title=\"\">came out for Ms Truss</a>, he wrote that she was “a winner not because she’s a slick salesperson but because she is authentic”. I told you what I thought about her “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/24/liz-truss-reminds-me-of-a-tory-leader-but-its-not-margaret-thatcher\" title=\"\">authenticity</a>” last week and it is a bizarre leadership competition in which being the inferior communicator is touted as a superior quality. But then this is a very strange contest indeed.</p> <p>The Sunak family’s vast wealth was bound to be part of the conversation about whether he should be prime minister, not least because of the outrage that accompanied the revelation that his wife has exploited non-dom status to avoid UK taxes on her overseas income. For an Instagram politician, he took a very long time to grasp why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/10/stench-entitlement-now-oozing-from-rishi-sunaks-home-as-well-as-boris-johnsons\" title=\"\">shielding his family’s fortune</a> from his own tax collectors caused so much fury. </p> <p>To counter the portrait of him as an entitled elitist cocooned in privilege, he has sold his family history as a kind of rags-to-riches story. We’ve heard lots about the grandparents who migrated to Britain from east Africa, and even more about his GP dad and his pharmacist mum. I’d be as rich as he is if I had a tenner for every time I’ve heard him relate how, in his youth, he helped her to do the books and deliver medicines.</p> <p>This ought to be a persuasive tale for Tory audiences of parental sacrifice, hard work and aspiration as the foundations of his success. But it hasn’t inoculated him against the charge that he is a footloose financier, a citizen of everywhere and nowhere who kept a US “green card” secreted in his back pocket even while he was sitting in the cabinet and might up sticks to California if he doesn’t make it to Number 10. Ms Truss and her gang have made him the target of a Tory form of class war. She has mocked his expensive education. After one of the head-to-heads between them, one of her spinners attacked Mr Sunak’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/25/truss-sunak-trade-blows-tv-debate-tory-leadership\" title=\"\">aggressive questioning</a> of his rival’s economic prospectus as “shouty private school behaviour”.

That left him expending precious time defending his wardrobe choices.</p> <p>It is almost too late to arrest his rival’s momentum and wrest back the initiative.

If the foreign secretary wins, she is not going to bring him back as chancellor after all the contempt she has hurled at him as a “bean counter”. So venomous have been the exchanges between them, it is a struggle to see Mr Sunak in a cabinet led by Ms Truss or vice-versa. It is all or nothing for both of them.</p> <p>Unless Mr Sunak can change the trajectory of this contest and fast, he is going to become extremely well-acquainted with failure. </p> <p>• Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2022/jul/31/live-in-care-workers-have-pay-docked-by-agencies-to-cover-accommodation","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T07:23:09Z","webTitle":"Live-in care workers ‘have pay docked by agencies to cover accommodation’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/31/live-in-care-workers-have-pay-docked-by-agencies-to-cover-accommodation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/jul/31/live-in-care-workers-have-pay-docked-by-agencies-to-cover-accommodation","fields":{"headline":"Live-in care workers ‘have pay docked by agencies to cover accommodation’","trailText":"New report says policy changes are needed to protect ‘hidden workforce’ from exploitation <br>","byline":"Shanti Das","body":"<p>Live-in care workers recruited from overseas to care for disabled and elderly people in Britain are being exploited by “unscrupulous” agencies who dock their pay to cover “accommodation costs”, according to new research.</p> <p>The workers, who live with clients to provide round-the-clock care, in some cases had their pay reduced by hundreds of pounds a month despite being paid only the minimum wage to begin with.</p> <p>The practice is exposed in a <a href=\"https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/beacons-of-excellence/rights-lab/resources/reports-and-briefings/2022/july/the-vulnerability-of-paid-migrant-live-in-care-workers-in-london-to-modern-slavery.pdf\">landmark report published</a> by Nottingham University’s Rights Lab, the world’s biggest modern slavery research grouip, based on an 18-month study involving London-based live-in care workers from countries including Zimbabwe, South Africa, Hungary and Poland.</p> <p>It identifies several cases where workers were given “unclear payslips where the number of hours worked and any deductions were not specified”, including instances where pay appeared to have been withheld unlawfully.</p> <p>Employers can legally deduct £8.70 a day – up from £5.35 in 2016 – from workers’ pay if they are providing accommodation, as might happen with farm workers in rural areas.</p> <p>But Dr Caroline Emberson, who led the research, and Dr Agnes Turnpenny, from the Institute of Public Care at Oxford Brookes University, said it was unethical and “absurd” that low-paid live-in care workers should be charged for accommodation when their jobs required them to stay in clients’ homes overnight.</p> <p>As well as the deductions for accommodation costs, the research found that some workers were subject to sexual harassment or racist abuse, and were expected to carry out non-caring duties for the whole family such as cooking and cleaning. These workers were often left without support from their agencies, which act as an intermediary between workers and clients. Others were not given sick pay or holiday, were required to work more than 80 hours a week with insufficient breaks, and subjected to repayment clauses or exit fees – a practice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/27/overseas-nurses-in-the-uk-forced-to-pay-out-thousands-if-they-want-to-quit-jobs?onwardjourney=584162_v1\">first exposed by the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/27/overseas-nurses-in-the-uk-forced-to-pay-out-thousands-if-they-want-to-quit-jobs?onwardjourney=584162_v1\">Observer </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/27/overseas-nurses-in-the-uk-forced-to-pay-out-thousands-if-they-want-to-quit-jobs?onwardjourney=584162_v1\">in March</a>.</p> <p>One care worker said she had found caring for vulnerable clients “rewarding”, but that she had been left scarred by encounters with a bad employer. “The pay was very low, they charged a lot for accommodation, and they treated me very badly. Basically they wanted to keep me as a slave,” she said.</p> <p>The new research – which also involved academics from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the charity Focus on Labour Exploitation (Flex) and paid peer researchers with experience working in the sector themselves – will further fuel concerns about exploitation in social care, which is facing a staffing crisis and rising cases of modern slavery.</p> <p>It warns that migrant live-in care workers, many of whom are women, are particularly vulnerable to exploitation: it describes them as a “hidden workforce” that is often “invisible in the local community” and “unheard” in national policy debates. It calls for a series of policy changes to reduce workers’ vulnerability to labour exploitation, including reforming the system of tied visas, where workers require sponsorship from a particular employer; removing or cutting visa fees; and banning or regulating repayment clauses to ensure they are not used to tie workers to their jobs.</p> <p>It also suggests that, like agriculture, health and social care could become a sector licensed by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority – which would require recruitment agencies to register in order to supply workers to the UK, making it easier for employers to identify “fair and safe” recruiters.</p> <p>Another of its recommendations is for the Department of Health to expand the remit of the Care Quality Commission to oversee live-in care workers’ employment rights. However, the department said it had “no plans” to do so.</p> <p>Emberson said the research showed that urgent changes were needed to ensure live-in care workers, many of whom had come to Britain with the promise of good salaries and working conditions, were protected.</p> <p>They often found themselves “isolated” in clients’ homes and dependent on agencies to ensure their employment rights were upheld, she said. “These vulnerabilities can make this form of care work a trap where the unscrupulous may keep workers in exploitative situations.”</p> <p>Suzanne Hewitt, a care worker and one of the peer researchers, added that some care workers seemed to be “almost indifferent” towards their exploitation out of fear or because they believed that if they did speak up, nothing would change.</p> <p>“They silently stew in their frustration, because all they want to do is care for the most vulnerable, all the while being vulnerable themselves,” she said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/jul/31/wagatha-christie-big-budget-drama-joins-race-to-bring-libel-trial-to-screen","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T07:22:31Z","webTitle":"Wagatha Christie: big-budget drama joins race to bring libel trial to screen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/31/wagatha-christie-big-budget-drama-joins-race-to-bring-libel-trial-to-screen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/31/wagatha-christie-big-budget-drama-joins-race-to-bring-libel-trial-to-screen","fields":{"headline":"Wagatha Christie: big-budget drama joins race to bring libel trial to screen","trailText":"Poldark creator among writers and film-makers lining up to reconstruct spat between Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney","byline":"Vanessa Thorpe","body":"<p>A big-budget drama featuring major characters in the Wagatha Christie case is to join the slew of documentaries already in production, as the race to bring to the small screen the rancorous details of the high court battle that ended on Friday hots up.</p> <p>The row between two high-profile footballers’ wives, which ended last week when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/29/rebekah-vardy-loses-libel-case-against-coleen-rooney-wagatha-christie\" title=\"\">judge ruled in favour of Coleen Rooney</a>, is to be turned into television serial by one of Britain’s leading screenwriters.

In October, <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWFC/OJ/2021/B64.html\" title=\"\">the press was blocked</a> from naming an expert who was replaced after a mother complained about their qualifications.</p> <p>This latest case concerns the welfare of two siblings who have been the subject of litigation over many years since their parents separated. They were living with their mother when a shared custody agreement broke down because one of the children refused to see their father. </p> <p>A psychologist with experience in “parental alienation” cases, Melanie Gill, was jointly instructed. In October 2020, she filed a report concluding the children had been alienated from their father by their mother and the family needed therapeutic intervention. The children were transferred to their father’s care and the mother was granted limited contact, which has gradually increased over time.</p> <p>But at a hearing last month, a barrister argued that the mother’s case should be re-examined because the welfare orders made by the court were based on evidence provided by Gill, who was not properly qualified to provide the expert opinion or therapeutic recommendations she did, and should not have accepted the instruction. </p> <p>In documents submitted to the court, Jo Delahunty QC wrote: “In private law proceedings, few decisions are as draconian or potentially life-changing as the decision to transfer residence against the will of one parent and the wishes of the children.” </p> <p>She argued that the decision to transfer custody to the father and the welfare orders made were influenced by Gill, who reported in “circumstances where she was not and is not qualified to provide expert psychological evidence”. </p> <p>At the 7 June hearing, Delahunty told Her Honour Judge Davies that her client was applying to have her case re-heard following a flurry of official guidance issued since the court made its findings and which brought the subject of court-appointed experts and their qualifications into sharp focus. </p> <p>Delahunty quoted <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Supporting-Families-in-Conflict-Jersey.pdf\" title=\"\">a speech </a>given by the president of the Family Division, Andrew McFarlane, in which he said the court must be careful to only appoint experts with “relevant expertise” when “parental alienation” is raised. He added: “Pseudo-science which is not based on any established body of knowledge will be inadmissible in the Family Court.” </p> <p>The barrister<strong> </strong>also referred to a <a href=\"https://acpuk.org.uk/the-protection-of-the-public-in-the-family-courts/\" title=\"\">December 2021 statement</a> by the Association of Clinical Psychologists UK which highlighted cases where “psychological experts” who are not registered with the regulatory body the Health and Care Professions Council had in some cases made recommendations for children to be removed from their mothers based on “inappropriate diagnoses”. Delahunty told the court that Gill was not regulated and yet “attributes of her work fell within the skill base of a clinical psychologist”, which is one of nine protected titles that allow for regulation by the HCPC, which Gill is not qualified to register with. </p> <p>If an expert is not regulated, there is no way of holding them to account for any potential misconduct, Delahunty made clear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0875660aa90cf306bbbe7343afd54a2b8f7bd0bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0875660aa90cf306bbbe7343afd54a2b8f7bd0bb/0_266_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Professor Mike Wang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Professor Mike Wang, who submitted a letter to the court about the psychologist Melanie Gil’s role in the case.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She said that the chair of the ACP-UK, Prof Mike Wang, had submitted a letter to the court about Gill. “Mr Wang said she is not someone who should be calling herself a psychologist, is unregulated and should not be carrying out psychological assessments and making diagnoses.” She told the judge: “You now have cause to be deeply concerned about the evidence she gave.” </p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWFC/OJ/2021/B101.html\" title=\"\">earlier published judgment</a> noted that Gill – although her name had been redacted – had suggested “various forms of therapy should be undertaken by each member of the family”. It states: “The therapists have liaised with [Gill] who has drawn together the work they have been undertaking.” </p> <p>However, Delahunty <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FJC-interim-Guidance-use-of-experts-in-cases-with-allegations-of-alienating-behaviours.pdf\" title=\"\">highlighted guidance</a> issued in May 2022 which says the court should be “extremely cautious” when asked to consider assessment and treatment packages offered by the same or linked providers.</p> <p>She alleged that Gill had failed to disclose a business relationship with one of the two therapists involved with the family and claimed there was a “triangular relationship between the two therapists and Gill”.</p> <p>In February, the father made an application to suspend all contact between the children and the mother in order for the therapy to be effective. Gill had signed a joint letter with the therapists recommending a “minimum of 90 days of no contact whatsoever” with the mother.</p> <p>However, at a hearing the same month Davies advised that the therapy, which had been rejected by the siblings, should come to an end and the mother should have some contact. </p> <p>At the June hearing the court heard how Gill had been investigated for using a protected title after claiming to be “trained in child forensic psychology”. </p> <p>Delahunty said: “She was positively investigated by the HCPC that required her to cease using that title because she was in breach of the regulations order.” </p> <p>The barrister also said that Gill did not take account of a previous 2015 judgment by a district judge which found that there had been coercive and controlling behaviour on the part of the father. And, in documents submitted to the court, she said: “Ms Gill adopted an approach in her assessment in which no account was taken of the children’s wishes and feelings.”</p> <p>It was also claimed that, after her engagement as a court-appointed expert had ended, Gill was “inappropriately involved in therapeutic provision”, funded by the father without the mother’s knowledge.</p> <p>Delahunty told the court that the impact on the mother of Gill’s report caused her to react in distress, and her actions, which the court read as “parental alienation”, were “instead a reaction to the changed living circumstances and the grief at being separated from the children, and the real fear they would now be placed in the home of a man who had been found to be coercive and controlling”. </p> <p>The father, represented by Charles Hale QC, opposed the mother’s application on the basis that the same arguments were presented in court documents seeking permission for the mother to appeal in 2021 and rejected by a High Court judge, Mr Justice Peel.</p> <p>At the June hearing, Hale said: “It was found that the mother was not credible or reliable. In contrast, [Peel] was positive about the father. He made clear “there were no grounds for appeal”.</p> <p>Hale said the application should be struck out. He reminded the court there had been no appeal against Gill’s joint appointment at the time, adding: “Melanie Gill’s evidence was only one part of the evidence considered by the judge.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jun/12/parental-alienation-and-the-unregulated-experts-shattering-childrens-lives\"> Parental alienation and the unregulated experts shattering children’s lives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Everybody knew what her expertise was based on her CV, and nobody challenged it. It is an abuse of the process and an attempt to undermine the appeal process.” </p> <p>He went on: “In any event, the application must fail on its own merit. The children are thriving.” Addressing Davies, he added: “There is no solid grounds for a re-hearing of your decision. The importance of your judgment is and was in the best interests of the children, and that is undeniable in view of their current situation.” </p> <p>Handing down a <a href=\"https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2022/89\">judgment</a> on 15 June, Davies said she had taken account of the various guidance issued since the court made its findings.</p> <p>She said all the parties had agreed on Gill, who was jointly instructed because she had extensive experience in “parental alienation” cases. Davies said she had considered other evidence in addition to Gill’s report, including that of the children’s guardian and her own analysis of the “credibility of the mother based on her own evidence”.</p> <p>The judge acknowledged that “for many years” there has been a debate about the definition of a “psychologist”, arguments about the differences between types of psychologists – such as a clinical psychologist or someone who followed a degree course in psychology – and the various professional bodies’ opinions on whether or not only those registered with the HCPC should be instructed in cases.</p> <p>“At some point, simple guidance will be helpful to everyone to avoid the type of arguments that have arisen in the current case,” she said.</p> <p>Citing <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Psychologists-as-Expert-Witness-in-family-courts-in-England-and-Wales-standards-competencies-and-expectations-.pdf\" title=\"\">recent guidance</a>, Davies noted that it remains at the discretion of the courts to appoint experts who are not regulated. “Whether this is a good thing or not is not for me to determine,” she added.</p> <p>Of Gill’s findings, she said: “I accepted her conclusion about alienation. I did not agree with her recommendations for stopping all contact [with the mother]. The findings are and remain significant to the children.”</p> <p>The financial and emotional cost to the parties “has been immense” she said, adding that the children are thriving and another year of litigation would be damaging for them.</p> <p>Rejecting the mother’s application to reopen the final hearing, Davies told the court: “A new report by a new expert would not assist the children. This is not a case where new evidence has come to light. There is no reason to think a re-hearing will result in anything different.”</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> made an application to vary the automatic reporting restrictions applied to private family court hearings, and a further application to name Gill.</p> <p>Davies made clear she made no criticism of Gill and the court made no findings that discredited her.<strong> </strong> She told the court: “She had not held herself out as being something she is not. She fulfilled her instructions. I have come to the conclusion there is no reason why the name of the expert cannot be disclosed.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/james-wong-on-gardening-leafy-climbers-more-interesting-than-ivy","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T07:10:47Z","webTitle":"Wonderwalls: how to make the most of leafy climbers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/james-wong-on-gardening-leafy-climbers-more-interesting-than-ivy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/james-wong-on-gardening-leafy-climbers-more-interesting-than-ivy","fields":{"headline":"Wonderwalls: how to make the most of leafy climbers","trailText":"Ivy does a perfectly good job when it comes to covering bricks and fences, but there are more exciting options, says James Wong","byline":"James Wong","body":"<p>Ever since I saw photos of the very first living walls in Paris in the early 2000s, I have been fascinated by their gravity-defying beauty.

Why would one spend thousands of pounds cladding a building in irrigated panels which can cost per metre more than Italian marble, only to stuff them full of a plant that would soon drape the structure of its own accord?</p> <p>In fact, many evergreen climbers will do the job just as well as living walls. <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/types/climbers\" title=\"\">Research</a> commissioned by the Royal Horticultural Society has found that evergreen climbers can help cool buildings in the summer by providing an extra insulation of leaves that constantly evaporate off water, and also keep them warm in the winter by providing a layer of heat-trapping leaves. The same research also found that these climbers do not harm brickwork, as is commonly claimed, as long as the facade is in good condition when planted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbf78f64be6fa071a7f2acb51f3be73d6703e643\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbf78f64be6fa071a7f2acb51f3be73d6703e643/0_350_7500_4500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Star quality: the fragrant Trachelospermum jasminoides.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star quality: the fragrant Trachelospermum jasminoides.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mahir Ates/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ivy is the most obvious candidate for its glossy evergreen foliage, but there is a range of flowering options, too. <em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/8951/hydrangea-seemannii/details\" title=\"\">Hydrangea seemannii</a></em> has enormous, exotic, white-headed flowers on deep green leaves.

They count down the days to this. Everyone here knows they have football to keep them going.”</p> \n<p>Ahmed knows better than anyone how Changing Lives FC, the first team in the UK to comprise entirely refugees and migrants, has helped to do what its name promises. It has been there for him since he arrived on these shores after a terrifying journey from Egypt six years ago, when he was just 16; it has been a crutch through even darker times, which led to a suicide attempt in 2019. He is the team’s captain: a well-known and respected figure in the community who others now turn to.</p> \n<p>“I’m very famous in Harlow,” he says with a self-deprecating smile. “I try my best to help everyone. If anyone has an issue, I’ll do what I can. If I shout at them on the pitch they don’t take it personally: they know it’s from me, their friend.”</p> \n<p>There are about 25 players on the grass and Ahmed counts 10 nationalities: Syrians, Ghanaians, Sudanese, Chadians. “Five or six don’t speak English yet,” he says. “But that’s the role of football, it’s the common language.”</p> \n<p>Changing Lives FC play in the Harlow District League in Essex and its aims are threefold: improve the existences of its members, shift the often negative narrative around refugees and asylum seekers arriving in the country, and win games on the pitch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c59afeb57e3013eb74c4ba826cfc039678be2188\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c59afeb57e3013eb74c4ba826cfc039678be2188/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The team’s coach, David Simmons, with his players.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The team’s coach, David Simmons, with his players. ‘We try to strike a balance where we have fun as well as wanting them to learn,’ he says.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Their coach, David Simmons, is a 28-year-old with extraordinary energy and vision whose influence on the group is palpable. “Everyone needs to work hard today, I’m choosing players for Sunday’s game,” he tells them as they stand in a circle, before outlining plans for the training session. This large, outwardly disparate group of young men aged between 16 and 24 listen intently.</p> \n<p>“I believe we’re a good team,” Simmons says. “Some of these boys are talented enough to go all the way and become professional. What a story that would be. We try to strike a balance where we have fun as well as wanting them to learn. Enjoyment is important but another aspect of football is the discipline it brings.</p> \n<p>“It brings people together, makes them understand they’re not alone. Some of these guys live in hotels and only have the four walls of their room. Here they can be outside, playing, talking, interacting. It builds up their confidence and that’s so important.”</p> \n<p>The experience of Ussri Badawi, a versatile midfielder who fled war-torn Darfur at the age of 14 and describes himself as “one of the winners” for surviving a journey he finds too difficult to relive, reflects that. “At weekends I have little to do except play football so this is the best place I can be,” he says. “It’s a really supportive environment.”</p> \n<p>Badawi, who arrived via Calais underneath a lorry, works part-time at Ikea and will receive his HGV licence in around four months if his driving course goes well.</p> \n<p>The path has not been easy. Last season alone, Changing Lives FC were on the end of three instances of racial abuse; fortunately, their games are recorded on video and those offences could be reported to the FA.</p> \n<p>Simmons, who has also been attacked online by trolls, has worked hard to improve the team’s composure under provocation. Given many of the players are still processing deep-seated traumas that can sometimes resurface under seemingly mild, non-racialised triggers, it can be difficult. Changing Lives FC used to receive more yellow and red cards than anyone in the league, but Simmons proudly explains that has changed.</p> \n<p>While Ahmed and Badawi speak warmly of the reception they received in England and the lives they have been able to build, there is a sense they have thrived despite the system. Ahmed left home at 16 after being detained for six months in a local police station after the imprisonment of his father, who was an opponent of the government. He describes crossing the Mediterranean in a fishing boat crammed with about 600 people under the burning sun.</p> \n<p>It took a week, with no food and half a glass of drinking water each day if he was lucky. Unlike in Italy, where he ended up and was consigned to the streets, he was housed here and brought into the system. But his struggle with the Home Office took four and a half years, multiple court cases and an error that almost cost him his life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dfa74755088ac969bcdb414c631cdedfc7fa87fb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfa74755088ac969bcdb414c631cdedfc7fa87fb/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Changing Lives FC squad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Changing Lives FC squad.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“They realised the caseworker had made a mistake early on with my situation and granted me leave to remain in 2020,” he says. “It was the happiest day of my life. Those years when my application kept being refused were so tough. Would I end up in Egypt again? Would I go straight to prison?</p> \n<p>“One day I decided I couldn’t do it any more, I’d been waiting for so long and could not achieve anything in my life: you can’t work or study and live on £37 a week. I tried to jump off London Bridge, but an undercover policeman pulled me down. And from there, things turned around.”</p> \n<p>Ahmed works in a B&amp;Q store and also with Simmons in his wider Changing Lives community organisation. He expects to be able to apply for a mortgage next year. “Some people think we come here to take public funds but it’s just not like that,” he says. “I work, I pay tax, I pay road tax on my car, it’s the same as everyone else. I’m just getting the same chances as other people now. It’s the same with these boys on the pitch: look at them, they aren’t causing issues with anyone.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That is also the crux of the matter for Simmons, a former PE teacher who has started similar teams in Bishop’s Stortford and Chelmsford. “People forget these are human beings,” he says. “They’re young people who are risking their lives to get to the UK. Why would we not accept all these people who want to come here and do better for themselves? I want to be a voice who helps others see this, as they aren’t represented fairly.”</p> \n<p>With that, he and Ahmed return to keep a close eye on training. These players may, as Badawi said, already be winners in one sense, but Sunday is their primary goal now.</p> \n<p><em>Migrants United is a three-part documentary series coming soon, see <a href=\"http://loud-productions.com/\" title=\"\">loud-productions.com</a> for more information.</em></p> \n<p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans ie.</em><em> In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

But Labour has been known to ignore the inconvenient truths of economic management. So Keir Starmer was right to assert, in his speech to the Liverpool Labour party, that the overwhelming priority of the government he leads will be sustained economic growth. Without it, Labour would be able to finance few, if any, of its proposed reforms. What is more, the optimism that accompanies economic growth is essential to the promotion of greater economic equality – the socialist aspiration that dare not speak its name.</p> <p>Yet three weeks before the Liverpool speech, Sir Keir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/04/labour-keir-starmer-vows-cut-red-tape-not-unpick-brexit?CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium\" title=\"\">used an address to the Centre for European Reform</a> to reject categorically the suggestion that a Labour government should attempt to negotiate some form of customs union with the single market – a prospect of economic expansion so exciting that even the announcement that talks were being considered would stimulate a sudden surge in capital investment.</p> <p>Sir Keir does not suggest that a new Labour government should or would end all or any of its residual bilateral agreements with Europe. And I do not underestimate the importance of maintaining the mutual recognition of veterinary qualifications. But as a stimulus to economic growth, it hardly compares with access to the 450 million consumers in the world’s largest single market – a prospect that he seems willing to abandon for the strange reason that “you cannot win back the trust of those who have lost faith in politics if you are constantly focusing on arguments of the past”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are still influential voices in Europe who say that a EU without Britain is incomplete</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In fact, inconsistency does far more damage to political reputations than the stubborn refusal to abandon long-held convictions. Labour pronounced Brexit wrong in principle one year and promised “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/04/how-keir-starmer-hopes-to-make-brexit-work\" title=\"\">to make it work</a>” the next.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine how leaving the EU can be made “to work” for the majority of Labour voters who at the last general election wanted Britain to remain. It is not even working for most convinced leavers. I admit there is a gaggle of Brexiters so fixated on the idea of sovereignty for sovereignty’s sake that “taking back control” is an achievement in itself for which they are prepared to pay an economic price. But most supporters of withdrawal believed that Britain, alone and free, would enjoy an economic boom. Now they know better.</p> <p>According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the UK economy will stagnate next year. Which means that during the Brexit years, the British economy, which until then had grown faster than the economies in six of the world’s most industrialised countries, will in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62299490\" title=\"\">2023 record the slowest growth of all the G7 nations</a>. The promise was that all the economic damage of leaving the EU would be more than rectified by the new trade deals that would follow our withdrawal. Three treaties have been signed or are in prospect. The agreement with Japan is virtually identical to that which we would have enjoyed through the EU had we remained a member. Whatever making Brexit works means, it will be a waste of time.</p> <p>Brexit is a flop. And the voters know it. The opinion polls show both increasing regret that we left the EU and mounting disapproval of the way the government has managed withdrawal. This is not the time for Labour to talk of making Brexit work. It is time to expose its failure and to offer a radical alternative – a closer working relationship with the EU.</p> <p>That is not to argue that the outcome of the 2016 referendum can be ignored. Democracy demands it be respected, notwithstanding the fraudulent claims made by Brexiters. But the decision of a one-day referendum cannot determine a nation’s long-term destiny, as Brexiters must agree. Otherwise, they would have accepted that the argument ended in 1975, when Britain voted by more than two votes to one to remain in the Common Market. In any event, today the European argument is about partnership, not membership.</p> <p>No doubt Boris Johnson will lie about Labour’s true intention as he lied about “getting Brexit done”. But the minority of voters who believe a word he says will be convinced of Labour’s true intention by the way in which the party pursues a new relationship with Europe. Britain has chosen to be what the EU calls a “third country”. Siren voices in Brussels will argue against doing a bespoke deal with a nation that turned its back on full membership. But there are still influential voices in Europe who say that an EU without Britain is incomplete. They need to be reassured that a new Labour government will want closer ties.</p> <p>Switzerland has treaty rights with the single market that come very close to making it a full member. But Switzerland is special – special because of its size, because of its banks and because of its historical neutrality. Britain would have to give something in exchange and the first concession would have to be agreement to a measure of European immigration into Britain. Hackles rise at the mere mention of the subject. But unless we accept some immigration as part of the bargain, we will never sign a new free trade agreement. It is taken for granted in every negotiation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/uk-ministers-eager-to-ease-immigration-rules-for-indian-citizens\" title=\"\">as it was in the discussion of the deal with India</a>.</p> <p>It falls to the Labour party to keep the flame of European unity burning bright in Britain. Fortunately, it is possible to combine support for that noble aim in partnership with a hard-headed economic policy of promoting trade and increasing growth. The party’s annual conference is just a couple of months away. Good Europeans should, in a fashionable phrase, make the most of it.</p> <p><em>Roy Hattersley is a former deputy leader of the Labour </em><em>party </em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/ng-interactive/2022/jul/31/simone-lia-tips-for-a-happy-summer-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T07:00:49Z","webTitle":"Simone Lia: Tips for a happy summer – cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2022/jul/31/simone-lia-tips-for-a-happy-summer-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/ng-interactive/2022/jul/31/simone-lia-tips-for-a-happy-summer-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"Simone Lia: Tips for a happy summer – cartoon","trailText":"From lentil lollies to glamping on a budget…","byline":"Simone Lia","body":"<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/03/comics-master-2016/embed/embed.html?srcs-mobile=https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/0_0_830_1254/662.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/833_0_817_1254/652.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/1653_0_819_1254/653.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/2474_0_816_1254/651.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/3295_0_834_1254/665.jpg&amp;ratios-mobile=151.05740181268882+153.37423312883436+152.90519877675843+153.84615384615387+150.15015015015015&amp;srcs-desktop=https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/0_0_4129_1254/2000.jpg&amp;ratios-desktop=30.714285714285715&amp;credit=&amp;background=FFFFFF&amp;vpadding=20\" data-alt=\"Simone 31 July\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/03/comics-master-2016/embed/embed.html?srcs-mobile=https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/0_0_830_1254/662.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/833_0_817_1254/652.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/1653_0_819_1254/653.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/2474_0_816_1254/651.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/3295_0_834_1254/665.jpg&ratios-mobile=151.05740181268882+153.37423312883436+152.90519877675843+153.84615384615387+150.15015015015015&srcs-desktop=https://media.guim.co.uk/d95dc7240c31aba1bb3d6749ca4dd20b3d5051c6/0_0_4129_1254/2000.jpg&ratios-desktop=30.714285714285715&credit=&background=FFFFFF&vpadding=20\">Simone 31 July</a> </figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/got-the-ick-when-a-pang-of-disgust-ruins-your-romance","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T07:00:48Z","webTitle":"Got the ick?

Rhik Samadder explains the history of the ‘ick’ – a romantic gut reaction – and what to do when it strikes. Plus, below, Philippa Perry on its psychological meaning","byline":"Rhik Samadder","body":"<p>This is the summer of the ick. An ick is a point at which your initial attraction to a person flips into a feeling of disgust. The causes are many and various, but once someone gives you the ick, all desire is killed. You only want to get away. You cannot ignore an ick, despite your better judgment. It is an unconscious gut reaction, picking up on a cellular incompatibility, by which I don’t mean they have an Android phone.</p> <p>I felt a chill of recognition when I first heard the phrase. I immediately related it to my friends, who had all been using it for ages. One of them told me she got the ick off a boy who didn’t use pillowcases. Another from one who wore a lime green shirt. Another friend – for the sake of privacy we’ll call her Icarus – has experienced it many times, including once at the Prado in Madrid with her then-boyfriend. “We were looking at a painting of a fat little Bacchanalian nymph baby. I realised it was the spitting image of him,” she says. “We broke up shortly after, but I couldn’t tell him why.”</p> <p>Icks strike me as a horror story. How can the laws of attraction contain such perversity? I’ve noticed how sometimes it is the very quality we were first attracted to in a person that can flip like this. Whether a physical quirk, their dance moves or their laugh, what once was cute can become unbearable. How do you get over an ick? Should you even try? Is there any guarantee it won’t happen after, say, 30 years of marriage? These questions and more are being repeated in living rooms across the country, sometimes inspired by, say, the wrong shoes or a weird metallic smell, some by <em>Love Island</em>, a reality show where the ick is king.</p> <p>Quick cultural history: the phrase “Getting the ick” was actually coined for an episode of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/happy-birthday-to-ally-mcbeal-a-show-that-shaped-my-feminism\" title=\"\">Ally M</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/happy-birthday-to-ally-mcbeal-a-show-that-shaped-my-feminism\" title=\"\">cBeal</a></em>, in which Ally tried to date The Biscuit. An early noughties <em>Sex and the City</em> episode, “The Ick Factor” carried the torch for a while. Yet ickiness entered the popular lexicon after it became a stock phrase on the island-based reality show. (Priya Gopaldas got the ick on a date with Brett Staniland because he was boring and didn’t flirt enough. You probably read about it in the <em>LRB</em>.)</p> <p>For a time, I immersed myself. I scrolled through Instagram and TikTok, where users share their idiosyncratic turn-offs under hashtags like #theickisreal and #theickchallenge in their hundreds of thousands. As I did, I began to compile an unofficial taxonomy. The most obvious category was bodily. I saw his bumcrack. She pulled down her mask to kiss me, rather than taking it off. These closely correspond to the emotion of disgust, a safeguard against contamination. There were icks associated with obnoxious behaviours or beliefs. He votes Tory. He’s rude to waiters. Avoidant attachment styles showed up, in complaints that he texts back too quickly. He told his friends about us. Yet the most prevalent category was also the weirdest. Look up “Dumbest icks”. You won’t be disappointed.</p> <p>When he sits on a bar stool and his legs dangle. Seeing him struggle to find the end of the Sellotape. Seeing him pull out his railcard when asked by the train attendant. The litany of humiliation is more fine-grained than observational comedy. It felt like a new form, one with the attentiveness of poetry to intangible indignities. Hard to explain, impossible to justify, immediately resonant. When he commands Alexa to do something and she ignores him. When he can’t open the ketchup sachet and has to use his teeth. When he uses the menu card to pick out the chocolate he wants.</p> <p>Intriguingly, some people undergo elective ickiness, choosing to think of someone they fancy in undignified situations. They do this to take the shine off anyone who does not reciprocate their feelings. As an emotional hack, it’s brilliant. Imagine him trying to find a specific emoji but he can’t, and gives up because he’s feeling discouraged. Imagine him eating spaghetti, all red bits around his mouth. Imagine him trying to pat a dog, but the second before his hand reaches, the dog goes away.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She remembered swerving a boy after he… giggled at one of her jokes. She’s not proud of it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not everyone agrees that the phenomenon is real. At a picnic, my friend James tells me his theory that an ick is a self-created lightning rod for other dissatisfactions in the relationship, that haven’t yet come to the surface. “I believe in them. They’re awful and there’s nothing you can do about them,” chimes in his girlfriend. She’s never felt it for him, though, she adds. He hasn’t either, he replies, looking at her. They kiss for fully a minute, even though I’m right there.</p> <p>It’s certainly arguable that situations don’t give us the ick, only people. If I really fancied someone, I’m pretty sure they could tell me they want to dress up as Eva Braun while sitting on the toilet. I’d probably be into it. It’s all in the eye of the beholder. I think about Hugh Grant in the film <em>Notting Hill</em>, trying to break into a private garden before falling on his arse and saying “Whoopsie daisy” twice. That is the definition of an ick, but not to Julia Roberts, or any sane person. It’s one of the most charming moments ever filmed.</p> <p>I got a text. It was Icarus, who remembered swerving a boy after he… giggled at one of her jokes. She’s not proud of it. “It was a sort of childlike titter. My vagina immediately sealed over.” She admits this is perverse, as she spends all her time making people laugh. Her reaction doesn’t even agree with her politics. “I’m worried it makes me sound like a binary-gender stereotypes witch.” I privately recount all the times she’s made me laugh. Have I ever tee-heed?</p> <p>It set me thinking about the politics of the ick. The politicks. For instance, are they gendered? The examples on social media are overwhelmingly posted by women complaining about men. But culturally, the behaviour has as often been associated with captious boy-men, like Chandler from <em>Friends</em>. Jerry Seinfeld rejected women on a weekly basis for having man hands, being too tanned, talking too high or low, eating peas one at a time.</p> <p>I suspect the current trend is apolitical – a move away from the dominant dating rhetoric of toxicity, red flags and problematic behaviour. Icks are self-consciously trivial and, while humiliating for the ick-giver, hardly reflect well on the receiver, either. There’s fallibility on all sides.</p> <p>This is what I find so touching about the infinite list of icks. We all put our underwear on one leg at a time; some of us fall over while we do it. Do you really want to be with someone who doesn’t show their railcard when asked by the guard? If you break up with someone because they scream on a rollercoaster, who’s the loser?</p> <p>For balance, I should point out that there are videos posted by men, about the things women do that give them the ick. They’re funny, too. One of them was when a girl is called Amy Jones. It’s just a boring name.</p> <p>While they were funny, scrolling the infinite list of icks also made me sad. When the top of the bus is packed and he has to go back downstairs. His hands were small. He said, “Rawr.” Normally, I love things that are sad and funny. But it was time to delve deeper, understand what was going on here. He used an umbrella.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most of us are unheroic, occasional failures, some of whom keep a little trolley coin on their keyring</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“The ick is a projection of our own shame, through criticism,” says Jo Nicholl, a psychotherapist specialising in relationships, who hosts the <a href=\"https://www.lovemapspodcast.com/about\" title=\"\">Love Maps</a> podcast. We tell ourselves the other person is childish, unsophisticated and without style, because that’s what we are aware of in ourselves and cannot bear. It makes sense. The close observational skills of the posts demonstrate a super-vigilance towards embarrassment. A thousand ways to be lame, graceless, and not fit in. How easy it is to get it wrong.</p> <p>According to Nicholl, this mostly shows up in the early stages of a relationship, because that’s when we are most vigilant, scanning for flaws in our partner, second-guessing the criticism of our peers. Social media, unsurprisingly, amplifies this concern with how we appear to others, our tragic vanity and distance from perfection. When he takes a selfie and you see the reflection in the glasses. Nicholl also lays a fair share of the blame at the gates of <em>Love Island</em>’s Casa Amor. “They’re incredibly immature on that island, with not fully formed brains.”</p> <p>But for people who are predisposed to pernickety little turnings away, and not proud of it, what is there to be done? Surely the experience is too visceral to overturn.</p> <p>“You can absolutely get over an ick, because it’s coming from you,” says Nicholl. The medicine is not easy. Ick is short for sick, she reminds me. It’s baby talk, suggesting a childish engagement with adult relationships. Rather than treating an unexpected revulsion as an immediate deal-breaker, we could get curious about it. What are our associations? What do we feel? It’s telling us a story about ourselves and it will serve us to understand what that story is. (Fun reminder: it’s unprocessed low self-worth.)</p> <p>So no one gives you the ick – you do it to yourself. It is your infantilisation, your fear of the animal part, your smallness, your ugliness. But there I go again. I don’t mean you, I mean me. We are all critical all the time, even if we never voice it. But that’s not all there is to people and it’s not the better part. As for emotional hacks, it’s better to feel the pain of someone not fancying you back honestly. To honour your heart’s choice, without fouling them.</p> <p>Disappointment is a condition of being alive and not a minor one. If you do find someone you like, who feels the same way, do what you can to guard that tiny, intangible flame. Here’s the advice: treat an ick as a relational junction. You can turn left and keep looking for the elusive, perfect other who completes us. Or you can turn, terrified, towards real intimacy with a human being, accepting that attraction waxes and wanes like the phases of the moon. Because love of perfection is no love at all; that’s never where it shows up, thank God. Most of us are unheroic, occasional failures, some of whom keep a little trolley coin on their keyring. Our projects are necessarily small, our little caretakings pathetic hedges against catastrophes we cannot control.</p> <p>I just can’t look at icks in the same way, now I know what they are. Before I stop scrolling, I do one final search, turning up the hashtag #reverseicks. The same attention to emotional detail, but in the service of feelings far more hopeful. Them doing something to annoy you, then running away while you chase them. Reading a book together and they get closer to you, to see the words. Him letting you write on his hand. We are what we pay attention to.</p> <p>It is hard. Emotional maturity, is like, the worst. I’ve come up with a little poem to help:</p> <p><em>If you get the ick a few weeks in, they’re probably going straight to the bin! If your stomach is turned after a couple of years, consider having compassion for the failing creature who has pledged their time and body to you, failing creature that you are. Compassion for yourself, your rage that you will not have all the things you wanted on this earth. And patience for the consoling knowledge that you can have enough, and be enough.</em></p> <p>I’m not very good at rhymes. Oh, that’s a deal-breaker? Screw you and your poetry judgmentalism. I dump you first. </p> <h2>What is the ick?</h2> <p><em>We are masters of post-rationalisation. Psychotherapist Philippa Perry explains how this can affect our relationships</em></p> <p>Human beings are story tellers. Over thousands of years, we have evolved with our language and our storytelling. We hate not knowing and we invent stories to explain the unexplainable. </p> <p>Stories bond us together as populations, whether they are the histories that bind entire nations, for example religions or creationist accounts, or at a much more personal level, the theories we exchange in a gossipy way around the water cooler to explain why someone behaves the why they do.</p> <p>There are lots of things we don’t know, even about ourselves, but we rarely dig deep within ourselves to explore these things, instead we prefer to settle on an instant explanation. When we experience feelings of disgust or suddenly going off someone, we won’t tolerate not knowing why, we just know, which is why our clever brains then come up with an explanation. </p> <p>‘I just noticed his arms were ridiculously long, I could never have lived with those arms.’ </p> <p>We don’t feel we are making these things up, they feel real to us, but we <em>are</em> making them up. We are doing what some psychotherapists call ‘post-rationalisation’.</p> <p>Roger Sperry was an American neuropsychologist and neurobiologist who was awarded a Nobel prize for his split-brain research in 1981. One of the things he discovered was that when the corpus callosum – the large bundle of more than 200m myelinated nerve fibres that connects the two hemispheres of the brain, permitting communication between the right and left sides – is cut (which was then the only cure for some forms of severe epilepsy), you were able to give the right side of the brain a message or a command, such as ‘Get up and walk around the room’, by introducing it to the left ear or the left eye (the right brain controls the left side of the body). If you then asked the left side of the brain why the subject had got up and walked about the room, the person would always come up with a perfectly reasonable explanation, such as ‘I thought someone had knocked on the door’ or ‘I wanted to get a drink.’ The subject never said, ‘I got up because you are experimenting on me and told me to do some weird stuff!’ </p> <p>Sperry’s research proved that we always come up with a story to justify our actions, and I think this can be applied to our feelings, too. We will always come up with something to explain what we feel. </p> <p>In short, human beings are masters in the art of post-rationalisation, and what we need to do to evolve is learn to sit with not knowing the reason for a feeling. But that can be very tricky. I’ll let you know when I’ve mastered it!</p> <h2>Pick of the icks: here’s a few of our favourites</h2> <p>‘When they split the bill to the penny.’<br><strong>‘When they hold the remote up high to change the TV channel.’<br></strong>‘When they bite the fork while eating.’<br><strong>‘When they hold a fish in a photo.’<br></strong>‘When they Shazam a song from the back seat.’<br><strong>‘When they wait for the shower to warm up.’<br></strong>‘When the waiter says they’ve run out of what they want so they have to find something else on the menu.’<br><strong>‘When they chase a pingpong ball.’<br></strong>‘When they repeat a joke because they think nobody has heard it.’<br><strong>‘When they run with a rucksack.’<br></strong>‘When they walk angrily in flip-flops.’<br><strong>‘When they own a pencil case.’<br></strong>‘When they chase a piece of paper in the wind.’<br><strong>‘When they clap when the plane lands.’<br></strong>‘When they mix up their, they’re and there.’</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"food/2022/jul/31/sweetcorn-salsa-and-salads-joe-woodhouses-recipes-for-camping-out","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T07:00:48Z","webTitle":"Sweetcorn salsa and salads: Joe Woodhouse’s recipes for camping out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jul/31/sweetcorn-salsa-and-salads-joe-woodhouses-recipes-for-camping-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/jul/31/sweetcorn-salsa-and-salads-joe-woodhouses-recipes-for-camping-out","fields":{"headline":"Sweetcorn salsa and salads: Joe Woodhouse’s recipes for camping out","trailText":"Break out this low-hassle trio in front of the campfire: a lemony, minty carrot salad, a moreish sweetcorn and tomato relish, and a blue cheese and kidney bean shredded cabbage bowl","byline":"Joe Woodhouse","body":"<p>These recipes are really easy to pull together, even in a field with a tree stump as a countertop. Once the tent is up, I start on the food. It’s a good idea to have a small box of dedicated camping essentials: salt, vinegar, mustard, pepper mill, small knife, corkscrew, plastic bowls and boxes. I keep mine in the boot of the car. I’d happily have this trio as the meal with some crusty bread, although they accompany a barbecue well. I always hope there will be some left to make a flavourful breakfast the next day, with a fried egg or grilled halloumi – always the antidote to a deflated mattress or leaky tent. </p> <h2><strong>Moroccan </strong><strong>carrot </strong><strong>salad</strong></h2> <p>This salad has some of the flavours I associate with Morocco, but really it reminds me of my childhood summers. My mum would always have a variation of this on the table at parties. It’s very simple and keeps well if made ahead.</p> <p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4-6, as a side</strong></p> <p><strong>60g almonds</strong>, skin on, ideally, but blanched or flaked work<br><strong>600g </strong><strong>carrots</strong>, coarsely grated<strong><br>1 banana shallot</strong><strong> or 3 spring onions</strong>, finely sliced<strong><br>60g rais</strong><strong>ins</strong>, soaked in a cup of hot water for 15 minutes<strong><br>25g mint</strong>, leaves picked and chopped<strong><br>1 tbsp cumin seeds</strong>, lightly toasted and roughly ground<strong><br>1 tsp cinnamon powder<br>1-2 lemons<br></strong><strong>Flaky salt</strong></p> <p>Roughly chop through the almonds. Add these to a large mixing bowl along with the rest of the ingredients, except for the lemons.</p> <p>Add a good pinch of salt and mix everything well with the juice of one of the lemons. Taste, season, and add more salt and lemon juice to taste. </p> <h2><strong>Shredded </strong><strong>cabbage, </strong><strong>blue </strong><strong>cheese and </strong><strong>kidney </strong><strong>bean </strong><strong>salad</strong></h2> <p>Really quick to pull together as a light meal or a solid side offering. Great on the table during a barbecue, or piled into burgers, wraps or sandwiches.</p> <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4-6, as a s</strong><strong>ide<br></strong><br><strong>200g full-fat natural yoghurt<br>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br>1 heaped tsp garlic granules or powder</strong>, or one clove crushed to a paste<br><strong>Juice of </strong><strong>half a lemon</strong>, or to taste<br><strong>Flaky salt and black pepper<br>1 white cabbage</strong> (around 750g)<strong><br>1 tin kidney beans</strong> (drained weight 240g)<br><strong>15g parsley</strong>, finely chopped<br><strong>150g blue cheese</strong>, crumbled<br><br>In a mixing bowl, combine the yoghurt, oil, garlic and lemon juice with a good pinch of salt. Stir well to combine, check the salt and lemon levels and adjust accordingly. The dressing should be quite punchy, but keep the saltiness of the blue cheese in mind.</p> <p>Trim the tough stalk from the cabbage and remove the outer leaves. Cut the cabbage in half and cut out a triangle of the majority of the stalk. Slice as finely as you can from the top to the stalk end of the cabbage (a mandolin is particularly good for this).</p> <p>Add the cabbage to the yoghurt dressing, massaging the dressing into the cabbage so it becomes well combined. It benefits from resting a little bit. </p> <p>When ready to eat, add the rest of the ingredients and toss well to combine. Taste, adjust seasoning and lemon juice, and serve.</p> <h2><strong>Sweetcorn </strong><strong>salsa</strong></h2> <p>I love this on top of refried beans, sometimes with a fried egg too. It can be used in place of a relish or as an ingredient in other dishes such as quesadillas, or sprinkled over nachos. It’s also great in a simple wrap or sandwich with some feta and shredded lettuce.</p> <p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>6 as a side, topping or filling</strong></p> <p><strong>300g corn kernels</strong>, best fresh, but frozen or tinned are fine too<br><strong>1 red onion</strong>, peeled and finely diced<br><strong>1 red chilli</strong>, chopped, with or without seeds to your taste<br><strong>200g baby tomatoes</strong>, roughly diced to a similar size as the corn kernels<br><strong>15g coriander</strong>, finely chopped, stalks and all<br><strong>Zest and juice of 3 limes</strong><br><strong>Flaky salt</strong></p> <p>If using fresh or frozen sweetcorn, blanch it in boiling water for a couple of minutes until tender. Drain and refresh in cold water. This step can be done ahead – alternatively, use tinned corn.</p> <p>Combine the onion, chilli, tomatoes, coriander, lime zest and juice in a mixing bowl and add the drained corn. Season with salt and leave to sit for 15 minutes for the flavours to get to know one another.

You might remember it, that poster, that summer, when we were gently radicalised on our daily commute. The company denied it was “body shaming”, saying instead its intention was to make the “nation healthier and fitter”. You can see how the confusion arose – there was a lot of it about.</p> <p>2015 was also the year that a survey of adolescents revealed 60% of them exercised to lose weight (compared to 7% in 1986) and another of 10-year-old girls found 80% had been on a diet. An odd time. A moment. This was a time when burgers were “dirty”, of course, and the concept of “cheat days” had gone mainstream, and body-positive influencers were dancing in knickers all over Instagram. A moment maybe, when adults were starting to react, en masse, to decades of body shame and a diet culture that told us it was virtuous to stay thin. Were saying they refused to conform to the idea that our body weight had moral or ethical implications. But – we forgot to tell the children.</p> <p>Last week, it was reported there was an “alarming” rise in children trying to lose weight, with one in four on a diet. Diet is an old-fashioned word today, often couched in the velvet terms of “wellness” and “health”, but, even so, data analysed from 34,235 children found that, compared to 1997, in 2015 there had been a “significant increase” in weight-loss attempts. The University of Oxford’s researcher added there was also an “increasing proportion of children with a ‘healthy”’weight trying to lose weight. This… suggests greater attention is needed to target weight-control messages appropriately.” Like I said, it is confusing; even more so for kids.</p> <p>“Will this glass of milk make me fat?” a friend’s seven-year-old asked them yesterday – over lunch at school her classmate had told her that dairy was bad. Another girl had weighed in to explain why bread was worse. My daughter stumbles over words she’s been taught can be offensive, like “fat”, but knows, too, there’s a problem with “obesity” in children, which is why they don’t have sweets at school. Just before Covid hit, Weight Watchers (now called WW) released a free mobile app for kids to track their diets, a launch criticised for promoting disordered eating in children and for sending the message (one they’re not alone in promoting) that acceptance will only come once they’ve changed their bodies.</p> <p>It’s no wonder these subjects bewilder kids: they’re emotive, they’re complicated, and more often than not they’re fuelled by stigma rather than science. Definitions of obesity are based on the flawed metric of BMI (never intended to be used to measure individuals’ bodies), but numerous studies have shown a higher BMI doesn’t necessarily mean you’re less healthy. And it can shift: in the US in the late 1990s the BMI threshold was changed, meaning around 29 million Americans woke up to find themselves suddenly overweight.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s no wonder these subjects bewilder kids: they’re emotive, they’re complicated</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>2015 was also an odd year for my body personally, as (having recently been pregnant, and received congratulations from health workers on putting on so little weight) I was praised by strangers for “snapping back” to a pre-pregnancy body. Of course, I was lonely and depressed and thin because of the relentless breastfeeding. But I became horribly aware of the guilt and pride that comes with such scrutiny, and then, fascinated by the effects body image can have on pregnant women, and how problems can be unconsciously transmitted to their children. It was a stark realisation, of the link between how an adult treats their body and how a child learns to feel about their own.</p> <p>Today’s children are wading through badly mixed messages about food and bodies, living with parents who are struggling to afford basic dinners, or who’ve been dieting since their teens, or cutting out wheat, or dairy, or sugar at a magazine’s suggestion, or fasting for two days a week to lose weight, or saying all bodies are beautiful in the morning then standing by a mirror noisily hating their own by evening. And so it’s no surprise that, like their panicking parents, many are dieting, attempting to gain some control.</p> <p>But kids don’t need to diet. Like adults, most children who diet end up at a higher weight, and develop disordered eating patterns which are incredibly hard to unlearn. But the fact that so many feel they need to should be a huge wake-up call for us, the adults who taught them it was normal, through the long sighs at our bellies, and the hundred, “Oh I shouldn’t’s” when the cake came round. Can we really say the rise in dieting kids is “alarming”, when we have been silently telling them this quest for a smaller body is worthy and compulsory, something that makes us more human? By failing to make peace with our bodies, we’re passing the war on to our children. </p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/31/premier-league-2022-23-fan-previews-part-two-leicester-to-wolves","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T07:00:48Z","webTitle":"Premier League 2022-23 fan previews, part two: Leicester to Wolves","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/premier-league-2022-23-fan-previews-part-two-leicester-to-wolves","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/31/premier-league-2022-23-fan-previews-part-two-leicester-to-wolves","fields":{"headline":"Premier League 2022-23 fan previews, part two: Leicester to Wolves","trailText":"Fans have their say on key players, wonderkids and weak links – and make predictions for the season ahead","byline":"Observer fans' network","body":"<h2><strong>Leicester</strong></h2> <p>Am I optimistic?

We, as should all football fans, will be watching closely.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Salah. I’m made up he’s stayed. Same with Joe Gomez. Along with new man Calvin Ramsay, clearly one for the future, our defence looks solid for a while to come. Díaz made an off-the-scale start when he arrived and can only get better. Fábio Carvalho is here from Fulham to strengthen our front line, and the big one to replace Mané, Darwin Núñez. According to most pre-season reports he’s a flop – the four goals against Leipzig notwithstanding. No real weaknesses. Lots of hollering for a midfielder to join with Henderson and Milner, particularly, ramping up the average age. But we have youth in Harvey Elliot and Curtis Jones. There’ll always be cries for more signings, but we’ve got a strong, first-class squad.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>Goodison Park, for both. It’s easy to get to, it’s an old-fashioned ground, full and mostly we get a result there.

Things are looking rosy. Now, how about that new contract, Josep?</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Erling Haaland. Need I say much more? I can’t express how much of a game-changer I think he will be. After two years of false nine football we’ve signed the best young striker in world football. He’s the biggest signing of the Abu Dhabi era - and arguably the biggest signing of the Premier League era too. De Bruyne will also be fundamental, but I think Haaland is the key. If he hits the ground running, it could be game over. The weakness is the gaping hole at left-back. We’ve let the brilliant Zinchenko go without a ready-made replacement, and seem reluctant to match Brighton’s valuation for Cucurella. A big problem.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>I love going to Villa Park. Worst? If Bournemouth hadn’t have come up then it’d be the London Stadium.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Ederson; Walker, Dias, Stones, Cancelo; Rodri, Bernardo; Mahrez, De Bruyne, Foden; Haaland</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>David Silva - what side wouldn’t he improve? And Colin Bell wouldn’t be bad either.

Last season we were easily sussed out and even teams like Brighton bullied us and we rolled over. All teams had to do was work harder, run harder, get a bit physical and the usual suspects were straight on the back foot. We’ve been in an eternal transition since Fergie retired, but Ten Hag looks like the man for the job: players seem to be responding. He needs a few seasons, but could be the next great manager of the Premier League era.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>We can’t stagger on with the same midfield from the José era and expect things to suddenly change. We need players who are calm, can retain possession, have the courage to accept the ball in tight spots and can see a pass. If we can’t sign De Jong we have to find at least two combative midfielders. Martínez should provide bite in the centre-back pairing, but we still need a modern-day right-back who can defend and go forward. Our current two only have one of those attributes each.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>Best is Leeds for the history and hatred, and we usually turn them over. Worst is Newcastle: I usually need oxygen by the time I’ve climbed to my seat. Sticking away fans up there just kills the atmosphere.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>De Gea; Dalot, Varane, Martínez, Malacia; Eriksen, Fred; Fernandes; Sancho, Martial, Rashford</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>Bryan Robson and Roy Keane: true leaders with the highest standards. They would raise the game of everyone around them.</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>4th; <strong>Top four 1</strong> Man City <strong>2</strong> Liverpool <strong>3</strong> Tottenham <strong>4</strong> Man Utd; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Leeds <strong>19</strong> Fulham <strong>20</strong> Nottm Forest; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Frank Lampard.</p> <p><strong>• Shaun O’Donnell</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b63068e800fe28d50fb578f24b42933cbdb0e46e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b63068e800fe28d50fb578f24b42933cbdb0e46e/68_237_1012_607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisandro Martínez is unveiled by Manchester United.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisandro Martínez: bite at the back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester United/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Newcastle</strong></h2> <p>We’ve surely slipped into an alternative reality: Newcastle fans actually going into a season with optimism. Howe has transformed us with a committed, passionate, talented group: the last few months of last season felt like a rebirth. So we’re not expecting our annual relegation battle, but we’re also realistic … there’s a lot to do to reach the top four.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>With Matt Targett and Sven Botman we can field an entirely different defence to that which started last season. Add our Brazilian midfield maestros, Joelinton and Bruno Guimarães, to the mix, and we could be very difficult to beat. Also watch out for young midfielder Elliot Anderson, who starred for Bristol Rovers while on loan. We hope he gets a chance. Weak links? He’s been a great servant, but it’s not clear how Jamaal Lascelles will fit in now.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>Best is Goodison for its old-school charm, worst is the London Stadium, which just wasn’t built for football.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Dubravka; Trippier, Schär, Burn, Targett; Shelvey, Joelinton, Guimarães; Saint-Maximin, Wilson, Fraser</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>Alan Shearer and the much-missed Gary Speed, for their leadership, experience and grit. And Big Al could score a goal or two.</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>7th; <strong>Top four 1</strong> Man City <strong>2</strong> Liverpool <strong>3</strong> Chelsea <strong>4</strong> Tottenham; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Southampton <strong>19</strong> Fulham <strong>20</strong> Bournemouth; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Frank Lampard.</p> <p><strong>• David and Richard Holmes</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b58c7e1d22359328d7250d8d24f10d5b9d57dd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b58c7e1d22359328d7250d8d24f10d5b9d57dd7/608_633_2896_1737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sven Botman is unveiled by Newcastle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sven Botman: defensive overhaul.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Nottingham Forest</strong></h2> <p>As with most promoted clubs, I think we can go into this feeling optimistic but realistic (and 17th would be just fine). Last season we learned that Steve Cooper is the best manager we’ve had for at least 20 years, maybe more, so if anyone can …</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Just the 11 new signings so far – but we also lost quite a few over the summer, including our keeper and five key loanees. Obviously the headline grabber is Jesse Lingard, but we’re excited about Neco Williams and Omar Richards too. It will also be interesting to see how last season’s star Brennan Johnson copes with the step up. We’re looking a bit weak in centre mid, though; Jimmy Garner got better and better as last season went on, but the chances of signing him look fairly slim.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>I’ll get back to you – a lot has changed since we were in the Premier League 23 years ago. But I did go to Tottenham’s stadium to watch Guns N’ Roses recently, and it was very impressive.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Henderson; Worrall, Niakhaté, McKenna; Williams, Yates, Colback, Richards; Lingard; Johnson, Awoniyi</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>Let’s look back at our mid-90s heyday, with Stan Collymore scoring goals out of nothing, plus Dave Phillips to add some authority and bite.</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>15th; <strong>Top four 1</strong> Liverpool <strong>2</strong> Man City <strong>3</strong> Tottenham <strong>4</strong> Chelsea; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Leeds <strong>19</strong> Fulham <strong>20</strong> Bournemouth; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Jesse Marsch.</p> <p><strong>• Rich Ferraro </strong><a href=\"https://podcast.sport-social.co.uk/podcast/1865-the-nottingham-forest-podcast/\">1865: The Nottingham Forest Podcast</a>; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nottm_forest\">@nottm_forest</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04aacd4ac0a2da2690a5e95de8fbd1f529bf4efd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04aacd4ac0a2da2690a5e95de8fbd1f529bf4efd/235_233_4385_2631/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brennan Johnson in pre-season action for Forest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brennan Johnson: stepping up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Southampton</strong></h2> <p>Hard to be optimistic given the way our season collapsed last time around. The defensive catastrophe demanded an experienced head to marshal the promising younger talent; instead we’ve signed more promising talent. Otherwise the transfer business has been positive (and without having to sell before buying, for the first time in a while) – but pre-season betrayed a concerning lack of creativity.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Ward-Prowse will again be the talisman, but it looks like there will be a bit of dynamism alongside him in Roméo Lavia and Joe Aribo. Gavin Bazunu seems like an astute signing in goal with a year in League One under his belt, and Sékou Mara should give us a bit more penalty box end product. Weaknesses? Many. Defensively we were a circus act in the latter part of the season, and we lack a little bit of pace and power in wide attacking areas. Hopefully the youthful transfer policy pays off in the long run, but the early part of this season may be a bit of a struggle.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>Best is Brighton: we’ve a great record there, and the fixture and weather gods have managed to combine so that we always visit when the weather is excellent. Worst is Anfield, terrible record, terrible view and usually a terrible atmosphere. We’re not a big game for them.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Bazunu; Walker-Peters, Bella-Kotchap, Salisu, Perraud; Romeu, Lavia, Ward-Prowse; Aribo, Adams, Mara</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>Virgil van Dijk and Graziano Pellè in the condition and form they were in when they left us.

And this time it’s not even tinged with delusion. We are finally behaving like a club that wishes to project big-club vibes. Aggressive in the transfer market, backing Antonio and setting a benchmark. I’m hyped.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>We have both improved the first team and the bench: imperative with the five-sub rule. Yves Bissouma and Ivan Perisic give us extra quality, Richarlison is an option, Djed Spence is raw but exciting. We’re building on top of the 202 days Conte took to take us into the Champions League, cementing the energy and polish of Cuti Romero, Harry Kane and Son … I’m super hyped. No weak links, just a few evolutionary questions around the right-wing-back role. Spence? Doherty? Emerson? Or perhaps even Lucas<strong>*</strong>? <em><strong>*</strong>Not Lucas.</em></p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>Craven Cottage is simply a lovely day out and the home fans are super polite which is a little surreal. Worst? The Emirates because everything is so plastic.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Lloris; Davies, Dier, Romero; Perisic, Bissouma, Bentancur, Spence; Son, Kane, Kulusevski</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>Spoilt. A prime Dele, Eriksen, Modric and Bale would be delicious. But I’d probably opt for peak Paul Gascoigne, and two-knees Ledley King because we may as well have a Bentley parked up next to the Rolls Royce (Romero).</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>2nd. If I’m hyped and optimistic, I may as well enjoy the journey and throw myself unequivocally into the mix with Conte and his players. <strong>Top four 1</strong> Man City <strong>2</strong> Tottenham <strong>3</strong> Liverpool <strong>4</strong> Chelsea; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Nottm Forest <strong>19</strong> Fulham <strong>20</strong> Bournemouth; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Frank Lampard.</p> <p><strong>• Spooky </strong>Podcaster for <a href=\"https://thefightingcock.co.uk/\">The Fighting Cock</a> and <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/SpookyInPurgatory\">Spooky in Purgatory</a> (Patreon); <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lovetheshirt?lang=en\">@LoveTheShirt</a>; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Spooky23\">@spooky23</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fdf50d7df6eda5897b33e83d879191deffd9365\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fdf50d7df6eda5897b33e83d879191deffd9365/197_555_3137_1883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Djed Spence is unveiled by Spurs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Djed Spence: raw but exciting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>West Ham</strong></h2> <p>It’s a vital season after a tired finish last time out. An ageing team needs some rebuilding, but with Moyes’ record of building consistent sides, we can hope for a top eight finish and Europa Conference run. The flaky players have gone, our side will always put in a shift, and we’ve retained Rice and Bowen, so I’m cautiously optimistic. And the club was right not to pay Lingard’s inflated demands after he acted all Love Island, flirting with everyone, refusing to make a commitment, ghosting Moyesy and then dating the new arrival with big financial muscles.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Gianluca Scamacca is a massive boost: we last signed a striker in something like 1895. The big man looks a real handful and Antonio might even get a rest after participating in more work events than Boris Johnson. Nayef Aguerd has immediately got crocked in true West Ham style, but long-term will improve the left of central defence, and Areola is a proven keeper to take over from Fabianski, while Flynn Downes from Swansea likes a tackle and is the sort of hungry Championship player (and WHU fan) that Moyes should improve. But there’s no cover for the ageing Cresswell at left back, unless Filip Kostic signs. We also lack the sort of player who can try something different and win games with a flash of inspiration. Benrahma is sometimes that, but needs to be more consistent.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>Worst: Newcastle, for the sportswashing. Best is Arsenal – it’s always nice to catch up on my reading in a quiet environment.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Areola; Coufal, Zouma, Aguerd, Cresswell; Rice, Soucek; Benrahma, Fornals, Bowen; Scamacca</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>Trevor Brooking for his creativity and Julian Dicks to terminate wingers and test the limits of VAR.</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>7th; <strong>Top four 1</strong> Man City <strong>2</strong> Liverpool <strong>3</strong> Tottenham <strong>4</strong> Arsenal; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Fulham <strong>19</strong> Brentford <strong>20</strong> Bournemouth; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Steve Cooper</p> <p><strong>• Pete May </strong>Author, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Goodbye-Boleyn-Season-Kick-off-Stratford/dp/1785901478\">Goodbye to Boleyn</a>; <a href=\"https://hammersintheheart.blogspot.com/\">hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8e4403f7a1f317c55821666a1d1ea51325b3422\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8e4403f7a1f317c55821666a1d1ea51325b3422/178_101_3029_1818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gianluca Scamacca in action for Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gianluca Scamacca: massive boost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Yates/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Wolves</strong></h2> <p>Based on the horrific finish to last season and the fact we’ve only made one major signing to date, I’m not optimistic.

In that respect, José Sá, Max Kilman and Conor Coady were all key figures, and we’ve also added Nathan Collins from Burnley so have good options there. The returning Morgan Gibbs-White could be key to helping us improve a pitiful attack, as will a fully-fit Pedro Neto. But it still needs a lot of work.

A bit “meh” actually: the two early high-profile signings were good statements and we seem to have two decent players for every position.

It’s a big three months for Steven Gerrard: we have a relatively easy start and if we’re 15th in October the natives might just get a bit restless. Top 10 and a cup run would be my idea of a decent season but I sense it’s optimistic.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Diego Carlos and Boubacar Kamara have top-level experience; Archer could be exciting up front; Cash is mustard, and Ramsey will be wrongly overlooked by the England manager until at least North America ‘26 because he doesn’t pass the ball backwards enough at a big club.

So we’ll need a siege mentality, but Scott Parker has developed a style that’s probably better suited to the Premier League than the Championship, where we struggled against teams who sat back and defended deep. And we have a good balance: players with top-flight experience and points to prove, and some emerging talents.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>The ones with pedigree are Lerma, Cook, Billing, Kelly and Smith - all of whom need to have big seasons. Dominic Solanke’s goals will be key. And, as well as the returning David Brooks, watch out for Jaidon Anthony, Jordan Zemura and Mark Travers as three emerging youngsters who were all massive for us in winning promotion. The worry is central defence and how we’ll set up – will we stick with the attacking formation that won us games in the Championship or go ultra-defensive with a back five? We fear the latter.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>It’ll be emotional seeing Eddie Howe again. The worst trip is Arsenal: library-quiet, a terrible low-slung view, and we never pick up points there either.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Travers; Smith, Mepham, Kelly, Zemura; Christie, Cook, Lerma, Anthony; Billing; Solanke</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>Former loanee Rio Ferdinand, plus George Best – but in his prime, not the version we had at the fag-end of his career.</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>17th; <strong>Top four 1</strong> Man City <strong>2</strong> Liverpool <strong>3</strong> Tottenham <strong>4</strong> Chelsea; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Fulham <strong>19</strong> Brentford <strong>20</strong> Leeds; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Frank Lampard</p> <p><strong>• Jeff Hayward </strong><a href=\"https://www.afcbpodcast.com/\">Back of the Net</a> podcast</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"497d1f9d53259f979f82fca7477dd8a60f4b50ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/497d1f9d53259f979f82fca7477dd8a60f4b50ce/242_426_4464_2678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Brooks working out in pre-season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Brooks: back in action.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Brentford</strong></h2> <p>I’m feeling good about what’s to come. We showed the Premier League last season that not only can we play good football but we can hold our own when big players are injured. We’ve also made some key signings who will make us stronger once they bed in.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>David Raya is a brilliant sweeper-keeper, Christian Nørgaard is critical in the Brentford machine and Aaron Hickey is the full-back we’ve been looking for since Henrik Dalsgaard left for Denmark two seasons ago: a quality defender who can play on the left or the right, is good with his feet and can pick a pass. And teenager Yehor Yarmoliuk, signed from Dnipro, was described as “an incredible talent” by our Ukranian football expert on our Beesotted podcast. Exciting. As for weaknesses, our defensive display in the Wolfsburg friendly wasn’t great, but taking Ben Mee on a free looks a smart move.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>I loved Newcastle last season: friendly, great city, great atmosphere. Also looking forward to going back to The City Ground this season: beautiful by the river with lots of great pubs. Chelsea isn’t top of my list, though. Hard to get a drink as an away fan within a mile of the ground …</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Raya; Ajer, Jansson, Pinnock; Hickey, Nørgaard, Lewis-Potter, Henry; Mbuemo, Toney, Wissa</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>Hermann Hreidarsson for passion and solidity. And Saïd Benrahma, if managed well, is a genius who can pull a rabbit out of the hat. Thomas Frank knows how to make him tick.</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>12th; <strong>Top four 1</strong> Liverpool <strong>2</strong> Man City <strong>3</strong> Tottenham <strong>4</strong> Arsenal; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Fulham <strong>19</strong> Nottm Forest <strong>20</strong> Bournemouth; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Frank Lampard.</p> <p><strong>• Billy Grant </strong><a href=\"https://beesotted.com/\">Beesotted</a> podcast and blog; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Beesotted\">@Beesotted</a>; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billythebee99\">@BillyTheBee99</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d12f7a807d731fa1f6cadc221ad0728d22fd00c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d12f7a807d731fa1f6cadc221ad0728d22fd00c2/995_145_1815_1089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Raya in pre-season action for Brentford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Raya: sweeper-keeper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Brighton</strong></h2> <p>If we carry on our fabulous form from the end of last season, this one will be great. And we’ve now added Deniz Undav, who scored 25 goals for Tony Bloom’s Union SG in Belgium’s top-flight last season. We’re such a well-run club it’s almost unthinkable that we won’t get even better. Exciting times.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>It would be incredibly sad to see Marc Cucurella go to Man City, but our squad is stuffed with talent. Moisés Caicedo looks well capable of filling Bissouma’s boots, and last year’s young player of the season, Jeremy Sarmiento, should be great. As should 18-year-old Julio Enisco, bought from Libertad, who already has five Paraguay caps. The only weak link is the reliably terrible Southern train service to the Amex.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>Best is Villa Park for atmosphere and pubs. Worst is Selhurst: atrocious facilities; repetitive, zombie-like singing and - just as you breathe a sigh of relief at the end - you get kettled by police en route to another Southern train.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Sánchez; Dunk, Webster, Veltman; Cucurella, Caicedo, Gross, Lamptey; Mac Allister, Undav, Trossard</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>Dan Burn back from Newcastle, and the humble Spaniard Iñigo Calderón who took the club and city to heart from 2010-16. What a dream if he and Bruno were to manage us should Potter ever leave.</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>8th; <strong>Top four 1</strong> Liverpool <strong>2</strong> Man City <strong>3</strong> Arsenal <strong>4</strong> Tottenham; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Crystal Palace <strong>19</strong> Nottm Forest <strong>20</strong> Bournemouth; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Frank Lampard.</p> <p><strong>• Steph Fincham</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7647cd6ff4a24144e1479d2de448667b6b130740\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7647cd6ff4a24144e1479d2de448667b6b130740/375_716_3069_1841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deniz Undav in pre-season action for Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deniz Undav: goal threat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chelsea</strong></h2> <p>I’m optimistic: we’ve always delivered over the last 25 years, whatever is thrown at us. This is the start of a new era with new owners and a new approach – it’ll hopefully lift us after the impact of the sanctions last season. Bring it on.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Sterling, Mount, Koulibaly, Silva and Kovacic are key. Koulibaly should provide the leadership and drive we lost with Rüdiger leaving, and I’m expecting more new faces before the window closes. We also have Conor Gallagher and Ethan Ampadu back: they should carry on their progress. We still need a replacement for Lukaku, though, and our home form has to improve: we need to get back to the fortress Stamford Bridge used to be.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>I have a soft spot for old grounds - Everton is one of the best: tight with great volume. The worst by far is the London Stadium – it’s just not a football ground.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Mendy; Silva, Koulibaly, Chalobah; James, Chilwell, Kanté, Kovacic; Sterling, Havertz, Mount</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>John Terry and Didier Drogba: leaders who gave everything.</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>3rd; <strong>Top four 1</strong> Man City <strong>2</strong> Liverpool <strong>3</strong> Chelsea <strong>4</strong> Tottenham; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Everton <strong>19</strong> Brentford <strong>20</strong> Fulham; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Frank Lampard.</p> <p><strong>• Paul Baker </strong>in memory of Trizia Fiorellino</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e0d60fd2b662ca798820442849e0463c60268ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e0d60fd2b662ca798820442849e0463c60268ae/0_192_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raheem Sterling training with Chelsea in pre-season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raheem Sterling: key arrival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Crystal Palace</strong></h2> <p>It’s been a strange pre-season, with half the squad on the Covid-delayed Australian tour and the other half playing EFL teams in the south-east. However, most of the transfer targets have been signed in good time and the forward line in particular looks good.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Signing Cheick Doucouré was always the top priority, and we got him at a great price. Chris Richards from Bayern gives us the option of a back three, while Malcolm Ebiowei adds yet more attacking flair. A full pre-season for Eberechi Eze looks like it has paid dividends, too. The biggest doubt is how we fill the void left by Conor Gallagher: he’ll be a huge miss so finding a way to replace that forward energy is crucial. And an injury to Guéhi or Andersen would be a big problem – but Richards’ signing goes some way to addressing this.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>Best is Fulham: close by, old school ground, and we usually win … Worst: West Ham, a soulless athletics venue with away fans split into two sections, one of them perched on scaffolding. Awful.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Guaita; Clyne, Guéhi, Andersen, Mitchell; Doucouré, Schlupp, Eze; Olise, Mateta, Zaha</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>Andy Johnson, with his pace and killer instinct, would bag a hatful in this side. And Yohan Cabaye would be devastatingly effective too.</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>10th; <strong>Top four 1</strong> Man City <strong>2</strong> Tottenham <strong>3</strong> Liverpool <strong>4</strong> Chelsea; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Everton <strong>19</strong> Fulham <strong>20</strong> Bournemouth; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Eddie Howe.</p> <p><strong>• Chris Waters </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Clapham_Grand\">@Clapham_Grand</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef75967aaadca478869dcb643e42ba2c1fb8ad77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef75967aaadca478869dcb643e42ba2c1fb8ad77/0_183_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Ebiowei in pre-season action for Palace against Manchester United.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm Ebiowei (left): more flair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Keep/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Everton</strong></h2> <p>It’s extremely difficult to be optimistic: the squad that narrowly escaped relegation was stronger than the one we have now. Lampard having a full pre-season is a positive, but this is a team with a questionable defence (especially from dead balls), a lack of creativity, and where are the goals coming from? It’s the result of years of mismanagement and appalling recruitment.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Tarkowski seems very impressive, based on his performance at Blackpool (!). Pickford will keep maturing, Mykolenko and Patterson should show their promise, and signing McNeil from Burnley gives us much more balance and attacking threat down the right. Weak links? Still midfield, creativity and scoring.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>Best is Fulham: just a good old-fashioned away game, and it’ll be interesting to see their new stand. The worst, need I say, is our former ground, Anfield.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Pickford; Tarkowski, Mina, Godfrey; Mykolenko, Allan, Doucouré, Patterson; Gordon, Calvert-Lewin, McNeil</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>Dixie Dean for goals, and Alan Ball. He had it all.</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>14th; <strong>Top four 1</strong> Man City <strong>2</strong> Liverpool <strong>3</strong> Arsenal <strong>4</strong> Tottenham; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Southampton <strong>19</strong> Fulham <strong>20</strong> Bournemouth; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Ralph Hasenhüttl.</p> <p><strong>• The Esk </strong><a href=\"https://theesk.org/\">TheEsk.org</a>; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theesk\">@TheEsk</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5b730f9f55dc9ae0f48476983525919a804086b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5b730f9f55dc9ae0f48476983525919a804086b/422_160_4879_2929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Tarkowski in pre-season action for Everton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Tarkowski: impressive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Wood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fulham</strong></h2> <p>Our last two ill-prepared dalliances with the top-flight mean we’re desperately hoping for third-time lucky. Third-time competent would be a start. Marco Silva masterminded a goal-laden promotion campaign and deserves the chance to push on. The fans are wishing for that too: a chance. A balanced, integrated squad is a must. In recent seasons our scattergun, late-in-the-window recruiting left us lagging; this time it looks more promising, even if some talks have been bouncing on longer than Partygate.</p> <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Mitro is key. A fit, confident and motivated Aleksandar Mitrovic will score at any level. The marquee signing of João Palhinha looks a masterstroke, and Manor Solomon’s pace and trickery should be a perfect fit. Youngsters Jay Stansfield and Tyrese Francois could be involved, as might Luke Harris – only 17 but scoring for fun for the U-23s. The weak spot? We need a solid, pacy centre-back partnership.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away trips </strong>Best is Forest, if only for the riverside location. Worst: Newcastle. You need binoculars and vertigo tablets.</p> <p><strong>First-choice XI </strong>Rodák; Mbabu, Adarabioyo, Ream, Robinson; Palhinha, Reed; Wilson, Pereira, Solomon; Mitrovic</p> <p><strong>Two players from the past who would slot right in </strong>The ever-dependable Aaron Hughes for his clever reading of the game and general tidying up. And Moussa Dembélé: poise and strength in midfield.</p> <p><strong>We will finish </strong>Top 17 please; <strong>Top four 1</strong> Man City <strong>2</strong> Liverpool <strong>3</strong> Tottenham <strong>4</strong> Chelsea; <strong>Bottom three</strong> <strong>18</strong> Leeds <strong>19</strong> Nottm Forest <strong>20</strong> Bournemouth; <strong>First manager sacked </strong>Jesse Marsch.</p> <p><strong>• David Lloyd </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmltoofif\">@DMLTOOFIF</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c0e11fb707611e01c6a16fa1c7d0f9981976b58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c0e11fb707611e01c6a16fa1c7d0f9981976b58/0_116_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"João Palhinha in pre-season action for Fulham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">João Palhinha: marquee signing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran Santiago/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Leeds</strong></h2> <p>We’ve got a new coach, new tactics and half a new team, so there’s a feeling of starting again. I’m naturally nervous, though. Since a quick “sorry about all that” last season, the owners have been silent about what’s happening next, but better-than-last-time should be achievable. Now Jesse Marsch has his own squad, with three Red Bull alumni, he should deliver better football than he managed during the rescue mission of spring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/premier-league-2022-23-fan-previews-part-two-leicester-to-wolves\">Premier League 2022-23 fan previews, part two: Leicester to Wolves</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Key players/weak links </strong>Tyler Adams and Marc Roca are stepping in where Kalvin Phillips used to roam.

But Kansas’s legislature is “much more conservative than the average Kansan on abortion”, said Miller.</p> <p>It’s a dynamic that has played out across many US states, as well as in the US Senate. As the Republican party has grown closer to the anti-abortion movement, and lawmakers adopt more extreme positions, Republican-dominated legislatures have banned abortion even when public sentiment is mixed.</p> <p>An estimated <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx\">85% of Americans</a> support legal abortion in at least some circumstances, according to Gallup polling. Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/abortion-deserts-clinics-access-closed-map\">more than half</a> of US states are expected to try to ban abortion, and the procedure is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2022/jun/28/tracking-where-abortion-laws-stand-in-every-state\">already banned</a>, unavailable or legally contested in 17 states.</p> <p>Kansas also has its own history with abortion, one that touches on the most violent extremes of the anti-abortion movement.

It’s the latest move in a long and largely fruitless campaign by the Iranian authorities to silence an artist who continues to be an international beacon of inspiration – not least to his son, Panah Panahi, who worked on his father’s most recent films, and who here makes his own triumphant feature debut as writer and director.</p> <p>We meet the stars of <em>Hit </em><em>the Road </em>in the borrowed car in which they will spend much of the film. Hassan Madjooni is the outwardly grouchy Dad, wrestling toothache and a broken leg, the authenticity of which is slyly doubted by Pantea Panahiha’s quietly exasperated but endlessly loving Mum. In the driver’s seat is their elder son (Amin Simiar), who is apparently on his way to get married, but whose real purpose will be only gradually revealed. And then there’s the younger brother, a six-year-old whirling dervish played by Rayan Sarlak who leaps around the car like an untrained puppy (the family’s actual dog, Jessy, is quietly ailing in the rear), and whose babbling observations on life, the universe and everything drive his family to distraction, but also remind us of Psalm 8:2: “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67aad4b66355d2d5c1c7d1722c0015a10a80e6b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67aad4b66355d2d5c1c7d1722c0015a10a80e6b8/158_0_4130_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pantea Panahiha and Amin Simiar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pantea Panahiha and Amin Simiar in the ‘deceptively light-touch’ Hit the Road.

Later on they will meet a motorcyclist whose face is hidden by a sack, a potentially terrifying encounter that is utterly punctured by the six-year-old’s observation that he looks like Batman’s arch enemy, Scarecrow. The Dark Knight will, in fact, feature prominently in the en route conversation, not least during a gorgeously fanciful exchange between father and son on the depreciating value of a scratched Batmobile, provoking hilarity as they imagine Bruce Wayne weeping because his beloved car is now worth only $500m!</p> <p>It’s one of many superbly judged moments in which Panahi’s deceptively light-touch film hits that sweet spot between laughter and tears (the two elements are literally juxtaposed on screen). We understand that much is being hidden from the youngster – the dog’s illness; his brother’s true course – as we travel toward the border. Yet somehow we come to share his childish wonder at the mysteries of the world, causing him to kiss the ground and offer praise to the almighty at sublimely inappropriate moments.</p> <p>Cinematographer Amin Jafari, whose extensive CV includes Jafar Panahi’s <em>3 Faces</em>, lends a Kiarostami-esque sense of grandeur to the landscape, which changes from arid sands to verdant hills. In one superb twilight long shot, the players are tiny figures dwarfed by the vastness of the sky. Elsewhere, a thermal garment becomes a spacesuit as our down-to-earth characters slip into an intergalactic void, recalling an earlier conversation about Kubrick’s <em>2001: A Space Odyssey. </em>“It’s mesmerising,” says the older brother, sharing a moment of truthful intimacy with his mother. “Like Zen. It calms you down. Takes you deep into the galaxies.” (“Galaxies are full of wars,” retorts his mother. “How can it calm you down? I don’t get you men.”) And then there are the interludes of musical fantasia, as car-bound karaoke mutates into fourth-wall-breaking lip-syncing of popular tunes by artists who have long since fled Iran.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/21/jafar-panah-panahi-iran-film-director-censorship\">‘You cannot imagine how crazy the system is’: Jafar Panahi’s film-maker son on Iranian censorship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At times I saw echoes of the comic pathos of Laurel and Hardy, both in a slapstick brush with a cyclist and in a beautifully deadpan riverside scene in which Dad struggles to impart all the fatherly knowledge he will soon be unable to deliver. “Whenever you kill a cockroach,” he tells his son, “don’t throw him back in the toilet. Remember his parents sent him out in the world with lots of hope.” To which he then adds: “And stop whining in front of your mum.

But the <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/bailey-v-stonewall-garden-court-chambers-and-others/\" title=\"\">employment tribunal</a> last week found that Garden Court Chambers discriminated against and victimised its tenant Allison Bailey on account of her “gender critical” beliefs.</p> <p>It is the second such finding of discrimination by the courts in a month, after <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Forstater-JR-AG.pdf\" title=\"\">they ruled</a> that Maya Forstater was denied work by the thinktank CGD Europe because she articulated her belief in the scientific reality that someone’s biological sex is real and immutable. Like Forstater, Bailey disagrees with campaigners such as the charity Stonewall that someone’s self-identified “gender identity” should override their sex and argues that women have the right to access female-only sports, prisons, refuges and changing rooms. Garden Court announced that it was investigating her social media activity, including a tweet robustly criticising Stonewall for championing gender ideology and another calling out the coercive concept of the “cotton ceiling”, a reference to lesbians’ knickers in the context of the absurd view that lesbians who exclude males who identify as women from their dating pool are transphobic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The courts will not tolerate bosses victimising those they disagree with politically</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>(Stonewall maintains that <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10225111/Stonewall-brands-lesbians-sexual-racists-raising-concerns-sex-transgender-women.html\" title=\"\">discussion of this</a> is akin to “sexual racism”.)Bailey was treated appallingly by the human rights QCs who headed her chambers and was awarded <a href=\"https://www.bpe.co.uk/news-and-events/2013/05/aggravated-damages-to-award-or-not-to-award-that-is-the-question/\" title=\"\">aggravated damages</a>, which apply in cases where an employer has behaved particularly egregiously. It is a critical ruling not just for employee rights but for free expression, showing that the courts will not tolerate bosses interfering with their employees’ democratic rights by victimising those they disagree with politically. It sits alongside the court of appeal’s observation that gender ideologues have wielded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/policing-sex-and-gender-debate-worrying-freedom-of-expression\" title=\"\">false accusations</a> of transphobia to impede the free expression of their opponents.</p> <p>Bailey also accused Stonewall of unlawfully “instructing, causing or inducing” Garden Court to discriminate against her, after a senior member of staff wrote to warn the chambers about its association with her. (As a member of Stonewall’s Diversity Champions scheme, Garden Court paid it for employment advice and training.) She lost this part of her case, but the judgment far from vindicates Stonewall. The tribunal ruled that Garden Court was acting independently when it discriminated against Bailey, but that the Stonewall letter could credibly be read as a threat to terminate its relationship with Garden Court unless the chambers expelled Bailey. And that Bailey’s belief that Stonewall’s proselytisation of gender ideology is severely detrimental to women and lesbians is cogent, serious and important and so is a <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bailey-judgment.pdf\" title=\"\">protected belief</a> under equalities law. (It turns out Stonewall has a track record of targeting the employers of gender-critical black lesbians; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lucy-masoud\" title=\"\">Lucy Masoud</a> has discovered that it secured a meeting with her employer at the time, the London Fire Brigade, that was preceded by internal discussion of “how to tackle her.”)</p> <p>Moreover, a recent review by the barrister Akua Reindorf for <a href=\"https://www.essex.ac.uk/-/media/documents/review/events-review-report-university-of-essex-september-2021.pdf\" title=\"\">Essex University</a> found that its employment policies, reviewed annually by Stonewall, misstated equalities law “as Stonewall would prefer it to be rather than as it is”, paving the way for unlawful discrimination against two female academics. As a result, Reindorf, now <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/who-we-are/our-commissioners-committees-and-governance/about-our-commissioners\" title=\"\">a commissioner</a> at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, recommended that Essex reconsider its relationship with Stonewall.</p> <p>The information commissioner has also found that <a href=\"https://sex-matters.org/posts/updates/ico-stonewall/\" title=\"\">Stonewall operates</a> a “significant degree of influence” over members of its workplace index, in which organisations compete to show how aligned they are with its worldview.</p> <p>Universities are supposed to be bastions of academic freedom, senior QCs defenders of rights. It is extraordinary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58917227\" title=\"\">the extent</a> to which they and <a href=\"https://fairplayforwomen.com/fair-play-for-women-wins-high-court-challenge-against-ons-census/\" title=\"\">others</a> – including the BBC, government agencies and the police – have been captured by a controversial ideology that pushes the view that sex is irrelevant in law and society.</p> <p>But by far the worst example has been in children’s healthcare. Gender ideology posits the view that when children express discomfort about their sexed bodies, this must be understood as an indicator of a fixed trans identity that should be immediately affirmed as the basis of any clinical treatment for gender dysphoria. Stonewall claims that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/soniasodha/status/1550747603490439168?s=20&amp;t=KnRUQ3EBjW9wVKwNlzq7LA\" title=\"\">children as young as two</a> can have trans identities, which, given they can barely speak, is revealing of the extent to which adult identity politics is being imposed on children who do not conform to regressive gender stereotypes.</p> <p>Gender-non-conforming behaviour is something to be celebrated, rather than the basis for teaching children that they may have been born in the wrong body, as some schools now do. There are many reasons why children and young people may experience gender dysphoria: it may be a sign that a child will go on to have a fixed trans identity in adulthood, but can also be associated with discomfort about puberty, grappling with same-sex attraction and childhood trauma. There is a coincidence with autism.</p> <p>Yet the NHS has ignored this in embracing gender ideology’s unevidenced affirmative model and has put growing numbers of young people on the path of irreversible medical treatment that can make them infertile and has potentially significant risks for their brain and physical development, without adequately exploring the reasons for their gender dysphoria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"806191481eabe0dad3bd96b829ebb333675d8920\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/806191481eabe0dad3bd96b829ebb333675d8920/23_211_2977_1786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior of the Tavistock centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cass report has told NHS England to close the Tavistock centre’s gender identity development service clinic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Expert whistleblowers sounding alarm bells about the lack of caution have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/04/gender-identity-clinic-whistleblower-wins-damages\" title=\"\">tarnished as bigots</a> by fellow clinicians and institutionally vilified by the NHS. It has taken years of dogged campaigning and more than one court case to get the government to establish an independent review of NHS gender identity services for children, led by a distinguished paediatrician Hilary Cass.</p> <p>That review is yet to produce its final report, but <a href=\"https://cass.independent-review.uk/publications/interim-report/\" title=\"\">has already concluded</a> that the affirmative model is unevidenced and castigated the NHS for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/20/observer-view-cass-review-gender-identity-services-young-people\" title=\"\">failing to track outcomes</a> for children undergoing this experimental treatment.

It is a product of corrosive groupthink, charities whose campaigning hinges on bullying their opponents by traducing them as bigots and individuals so keen to prove they are on the “right side of history” they abandon the critical faculties that are core to their profession.

He is very easy to cast as a villain: even friends described him as bullying, overbearing, arrogant and impossible; he was a compulsive gambler, a distant and wayward husband, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/06/roald-dahl-family-apologises-for-his-antisemitism\">an unforgivable antisemite</a>. But then, with the assistance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/quentin-blake\">Quentin Blake</a>, there are also the books. Tens of millions of children – myself included – fell under the spell of his joyful, wicked, silly, inventive imagination in stories that suggested he was not of the adult world at all, but still leader of a childhood gang. Books that initiated you, as he hoped and believed, into a lifetime of reading. Books that – despite the waning reputation of their creator – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/25/roald-dahls-universe-might-not-be-a-golden-ticket-for-the-writers-fans\">Netflix last year paid upwards of £500m for the rights to adapt</a>.</p> <p>Several biographers have attempted to fill the gap between these polarities. Jeremy Treglown’s 1994 book <em>Roald Dahl: A Biography</em> set the parameters. Unauthorised by Dahl’s second wife and children, but with access to many of his letters, and to his first wife, the actor Patricia Neal, Treglown offered a seductive analysis of the writer’s psychology. He argued that Dahl’s life of tragedy – the writer’s father and sister had died by the time he was four, he lost his own eldest daughter to measles at the age of seven, and nursed both Neal and their son Theo through severe brain injuries – gave him a profound emotional darkness and the desperate need to find ways to transcend it. Dahl had asked his daughter Ophelia to write an authorised book, but when that proved too tough an ask, the family asked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/11/life-roald-dahl-donald-sturrock\">Donald Sturrock, in 2010, to step in</a>. Sturrock trod carefully around some of Dahl’s more uncomfortable behaviour and found a convincing fortitude and late-life generosity of spirit to balance it.</p> <p>Matthew Dennison’s new life is a well-researched, compact book drawn from the existing record. There are no new revelations or notable interviews but it turns the baggy complications of Dahl’s life into something brisk and manageable. Dennison is alive to telling detail but pulls a few punches. The <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/archive/2021/10/from-the-ns-archive-tale-of-the-unexpected\">infamous 1983 interview that Dahl gave to the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/archive/2021/10/from-the-ns-archive-tale-of-the-unexpected\">New Statesman</a></em>, for example, in which he told Michael Coren: “There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity, maybe it’s a kind of lack of generosity towards non-Jews” and: “Even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick on them for no reason” is referenced only in passing. Dennison tends to conclude that the charges against Dahl of lazy or deliberately provocative antisemitism are mostly evidence that contemporary “liberal shibboleths have little truck with former renown”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7fecfa3308159f3fcdffe645a96ec816e69955f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fecfa3308159f3fcdffe645a96ec816e69955f8/0_130_4108_2465/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dahl with his first wife, the actor Patricia Neal, and their children Lucy and Ophelia in 1968\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dahl with his first wife, the actor Patricia Neal, and their children Lucy and Ophelia in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is good on the strangeness of the early life.

After his death, Dahl, always preternaturally tall – he was 6ft 5in at the age of 15 – was forced to grow into a role as the man of the house. He craved a life of adventure, and discovered one, first as Shell’s representative in Dar es Salaam, then as a fighter pilot in the war (he crash-landed in Libya) and subsequently as a socialite (and spy for Winston Churchill) in Roosevelt’s Washington.</p> <p>It seems justifiably telling to Dennison, though he stops short of admonition, that Dahl recast the story of his near-death experience in the war both in print and in anecdote to emphasise his own heroism. Having dragged himself from the burning wreckage, he was partly saved by a fellow pilot who landed beside him in the desert and held him through the night to keep him warm. By the time of Dahl’s autobiography <em>Going Solo</em> (1986) that part of the tale was lost from his accounts. He became the singular author of his own survival. This nascent megalomania appears to inform one sense of himself throughout his life.</p> <p>The competitiveness expressed itself sexually before Dahl’s writing took off. In the US after the war the young fighter pilot was a magnet for wealthy married women of a certain age. One contemporary recalled that in that period: “I think he slept with everyone on the east and west coasts that had more than $50,000 a year.” Six months into his marriage to Neal, Dahl was convinced he should leave her: “I make the coffee in the morning,” he wrote to a friend. “She stays in bed. I work until lunchtime. Then I get my own lunch out of a can of soup.” He set about an attempted seduction of Gloria Vanderbilt, quickly abandoned. He and Neal went on to have five children, but it was never a happy union.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You begin to recognise the appeal of his fictional heroes – they are universally survivors against the odds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The life-changing books followed hard on the heels of tragedy. <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> (Dahl had previously thought of children’s books as “an uneconomic diversion” from adult fiction and screenwriting) was completed in the year after seven-year-old Olivia died. Dahl had retreated into silence and drink; his daughter Tessa recalled how the family thereafter “toppled unwittingly over the edge of a jagged cliff face into a canyon of darkness filled with sadness, such total devastation that we would never recover”.</p> <p>That despair was compounded by Neal’s brain haemorrhage during pregnancy in 1965 that left her in a coma, and requiring intensive speech and physical therapy for months and years afterwards. Dahl refused to accept the change in her, insisting on a fierce daily rota of rehabilitation, noting down the nonsense phrases she sometimes uttered for use in his books. Reading this account, you begin to recognise the appeal of his fictional heroes – Charlie and James and Matilda and Fantastic Mr Fox and all the rest – they are universally survivors against the odds, often orphaned, always alone against the world, before finding ways out.</p> <p>In his own life, Dahl escaped into an affair with a family friend, Felicity “Liccy” Crosland, more than 20 years his junior. The affair lasted 10 years before it ended his marriage to Neal. He married Crosland at the age of 67 and entered in some ways the most productive phase of his life, certainly the most serene. Right to the end, however, he never lost that will to prevail against all comers. Not long before his death, Dennison notes, Dahl recalled having persistent, “champion of the world” dreams in which he won Wimbledon or Open golf championships. He often woke up thinking: “I’ve beaten them all and everyone’s surprised.”</p> <p>• <em>Teller of the Unexpected: The Life of Roald Dahl</em> by Matthew Dennison is published by Head of Zeus (£20).

Ramsden’s village of Challock, perched in the uplands of the Kent downs, has already survived one bout without mains water this summer.</p> <p>For six days earlier this month, its taps largely ran dry, forcing its school to close. Challock’s village hall was converted into an emergency centre for distributing bottled water. And even that, residents say, ran out.</p> <p>Ramsden is among those who fear the taps being turned off again at any moment, saying that his home still has no supply at night. “I checked it again last night and there was none. South East Water monitor the wells, but they seem to have put nothing in place,” said the 79-year-old. He has lived Challock for 32 years, and this, he said, is by some distance the driest.</p> <p>South East Water deny doing nothing, raising tensions further yesterday by appearing to blame the “interruption to supply” on customers’ excessive use of water during the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/19/day-of-40c-shocks-scientists-as-uk-heat-record-absolutely-obliterated?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other\" title=\"\">heatwave</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04c542e2bd6758212b9e4da82dd7187f052df063\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04c542e2bd6758212b9e4da82dd7187f052df063/0_26_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bewl Reservoir near Lamberhurst in Kent which is currently measured at 67% of its capacity\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bewl Reservoir near Lamberhurst in Kent is at 67% of its capacity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of Challock’s 1,000 inhabitants believe it would still be without water if the parish council hadn’t lobbied their local MP, Damian Green, for help. “Within hours of him getting involved, the problem had been solved,” said Ramsden.</p> <p>At the nearby Halfway House, which stands guard over a busy crossroads, pub landlord Lee was trying to make up for lost trade. Challock’s loss of water meant he had to close for almost an entire week until last Sunday.</p> <p>“If you’ve got no water, you’ve got no toilets and you can’t open,” he said.</p> <p>The Halfway House is a popular gastropub, but ordering food supplies became a gamble because no one could predict when the water would return. His chef, unable to bathe or shower, had to return to his family home in Hastings, East Sussex, for a wash.</p> <p>With the Halfway House counting the loss of earnings, its landlord concedes that uncertainty has become part of the business landscape in this part of the county.</p> <p>“Previously, we’ve had the odd day without electricity but this was something else. Some days we were told that the water would be back at 2pm then 5pm – and at 8pm we’d learn there would be none. When’s it going to happen again?”</p> <p>Some of his patrons were equally perturbed. Sheltering from the scorching sun beneath an umbrella, Anna Butler from nearby Faversham said: “We need to rethink what we are doing with our water. We’re an island, surrounded by the stuff, we should start looking at desalination plants.”</p> <p>Another victim of the village’s vanishing water supply was its primary school. Hayley Leavey described how the abrupt disappearance of the village water caused instant chaos. During the last week of term, she said the school opened for just a few hours, denying school-leavers the opportunity to say goodbye to their friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3cf1db2a9feb6a9c8c8177795164f41a6563b95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3cf1db2a9feb6a9c8c8177795164f41a6563b95/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Challock Village, Kent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A parched Challock village in Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Missing their last week of school was a bit rubbish, especially with everything else those kids have gone through during the last couple of years,” said the 39-year-old, whose three daughters attend the school.</p> <p>“There was no warning about the water. Lots of people in the village have livestock and horses so it was a massive issue for people.”</p> <p>Leavey added that the prospect of having no water again had spooked the village.</p> <p>Dry weather is expected for weeks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/29/southern-water-announces-hosepipe-ban-amid-uk-drought-fears\" title=\"\">hosepipe bans are predicted</a> and locals fear that the underground wells that provide its water are perilously low. “Also, people have been getting narky because there was little or no communication with the water company,” said Leavey.</p> <p>South East Water says that work is continuing to ensure there is no repeat. The company said it was investing £433m and investigating options to ensure the network was “more resilient to periods of high demand in future”. Damian Green has called for a new Kent reservoir.</p> <p>Stressing that supplies to Challock had been normal since last Monday, the firm’s operations director, Douglas Whitfield, explained that, despite the company producing an extra 120 million litres a day, other customers had exhausted it before it actually reached the booster pumps that supported the village’s water supply.</p> <p>Leavey complains that villagers still do not understand what happened. “It just seems that there’s no real explanation.</p> <p>“We’ve had hot weather before but haven’t had to endure six days without water.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/jul/31/the-big-lie-review-jonathan-lemire-trump-republicans-january-6-capitol-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T06:00:47Z","webTitle":"The Big Lie review: Jonathan Lemire laments what Trump hath wrought","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/31/the-big-lie-review-jonathan-lemire-trump-republicans-january-6-capitol-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/jul/31/the-big-lie-review-jonathan-lemire-trump-republicans-january-6-capitol-attack","fields":{"headline":"The Big Lie review: Jonathan Lemire laments what Trump hath wrought","trailText":"The Politico reporter and MSNBC host’s book is an indictment of the former president but also his Republican party","byline":"Lloyd Green","body":"<p>Joe Biden sits in the Oval Office but Donald Trump occupies prime space in America’s psyche.

He is Politico’s White House bureau chief and the 5am warm-up to MSNBC’s Morning Joe. He has done his homework. He lays out facts. His book is a mixture of narrative and lament.</p> <p>Lemire contends that Trump birthed the “big lie” in his 2016 campaign, as an excuse in the event of defeat by either Senator Ted Cruz in the primary or Hillary Clinton in the general election. Trump held both opponents in contempt.</p> <p>In the primary, Trump lost Iowa – then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/03/donald-trump-ted-cruz-stole-iowa-caucuses-new-election\">falsely claimed Cruz stole it</a>.</p> <p>“Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified,” Trump tweeted.</p> <p>In the general, a half-year later, he dropped another bomb.</p> <p>“I’m afraid the election is going to be rigged. I have to be honest.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.debates.org/voter-education/debate-transcripts/october-19-2016-debate-transcript/\">In the final presidential debate</a> he upped the ante, refusing to say he would accept the electorate’s verdict.</p> <p>“I will look at it at the time,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/us/politics/presidential-debate.html\">Trump said</a>. “I will keep you in suspense.”</p> <p>He definitely warned us. Lemire’s first book is aptly subtitled: “Election Chaos, Political Opportunism, and the State of American Politics After 2020.”</p> <p>Then and now, Trump posited that only fraud could derail him. After he beat Clinton in the electoral college, he claimed he actually won the popular vote too. In Trump’s mind, he was the victim of ballots cast by illegal aliens.</p> <p>“<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/07/jonathan-lemire-the-big-lie-excerpt\">In addition</a> to winning the electoral college in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Trump tweeted.</p> <p>To those within earshot, he said people who didn’t “look like they should be allowed to vote”, did.</p> <p>To soothe his ego, he appointed a commission headed by Kris Kobach, a nativist Kansas secretary of state, to vindicate his claims. It found nothing.</p> <p>In a blend of fiction and wish-fulfillment, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/07/jonathan-lemire-the-big-lie-excerpt\">Sean Spicer</a>, Trump’s first White House press secretary, and Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser, embarked on flights of fantasy. Spicer declared that Trump’s inaugural crowd was larger than that for Barack Obama. Conway introduced us to alternative facts.</p> <p>Lemire’s indictment goes way beyond that offered by Clinton, who called Trump voters deplorable. He casts the issue as systemic – and punches up. He is angered but does not condescend. The Big Lie is also about elite conservative lawyers, Ivy League-educated senators, Republican House leadership and Mike Lindell, the My Pillow guy.</p> <p>Like Gollum in Tolkien’s Rings trilogy, the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, wants to get his hands on the speaker’s gavel <em>that</em> badly. Peter Navarro, Trump’s trade adviser and author of the ill-fated “Green Bay Sweep” plan to overturn the election, faces charges of criminal contempt. Such acolytes know <em>exactly</em> what they do.</p> <p>Extremists in Congress like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert are vocal totems, empowered by an enraged ex-president and a vengeance-filled base. In such a world it seems no surprise cries of “hang Mike Pence”, makeshift gallows and Confederate battle flags in the halls of the Capitol came to supplant “fuck your feelings”, the mantra of Trump 2016.</p> <p>As expected, Steve Bannon appears in The Big Lie. He loves dishing to the press. It is in his DNA. The former Trump campaign guru and White House aide, now convicted of contempt of Congress, trashes his former boss as a reflexive liar.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/16/steve-bannon-trump-would-lie-about-anything-book-jonathan-lemire\">According to Lemire</a>, Bannon said: “Trump would say anything, he would lie about anything.” On cue, a Bannon spokesperson disputed Lemire’s sources, telling the Guardian they were inaccurate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2377905398c607bbe8bc5d1f23c52da8e4f90979\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2377905398c607bbe8bc5d1f23c52da8e4f90979/0_106_2859_1715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin McCarthy follows Trump off Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland in May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin McCarthy follows Trump off Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, in May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/08/bannon-trump-escalator-ride-nazi-leni-riefenstahln-hitler\">In Jeremy Peters’ book, Insurgency</a>, Bannon mused that Trump would “end up going down in history as one of the two or three worst presidents ever”. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-russia-steve-bannon-michael-wolff\">Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury</a>, he described the Trump Tower meeting between Don Jr and a group of Russians amid the 2016 election campaign as “treasonous” and “unpatriotic”.</p> <p>And yet Bannon’s role in Trump’s bid to stay in power remains of central interest to the January 6 committee. On 5 January 2021, Bannon announced on-air that “all hell is going to break loose tomorrow”. He spoke to Trump that morning.</p> <p>Despite his thoroughness, Lemire does omit the role of one group of Republicans in giving the big lie added heft. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/trump-election-fraud-texas-businessman-ramsland-asog/\">In May 2021</a>, the Washington Post reported on the efforts of Texas Republicans led by Russell Ramsland, a businessman with a Harvard MBA.</p> <p>After the 2018 midterms, Ramsland and colleagues pressed convoluted theories concerning “voting-machine audit logs – lines of codes and time stamps that document the machines’ activities”. Pete Sessions, a defeated congressman, didn’t buy what Ramsland was selling. Trump did.</p> <p>For Trump’s minions, this remains a war over lost place and status.</p> <p>“Republicans need to prove to the American people that we are the party of … Christian nationalism,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patriottakes/status/1549519304961425411\">says Greene</a>, a first-term congresswoman from Georgia.</p> <p>Like a toxic weed, the big lie has taken root.</p> <p>“It is now part of the Republican party’s core belief,” Lemire writes.

Russia is also moving troops from its eastern military district, which was being used to attack Sloviansk, a town in Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk, and were in reserve in Russia’s southern Belgorod region.</p> <p>The open-source investigative group, Conflict Intelligence Team, <a href=\"https://te.legra.ph/Dispatch-for-July-20-07-21\" title=\"\">confirmed</a> Skibitsky’s claim in part last week.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in occupied eastern Ukraine, a prison holding Ukrainian prisoners of war was hit on Thursday night.

Russia denied responsibility and said Ukrainian forces had struck the prison with rockets. Zelenskiy said at least 50 people died. Ukraine’s authorities say they do not yet know the identities of the dead.</p> <p>Despite moving its tactical battalion groups to the south from the Donbas, Russia would continue to attack in the region, albeit with less intensity, said Skibitsky.</p> <p>In the Kharkiv area, he said, Russia was focused on defending positions and stopping Ukrainian forces from reaching the Ukraine-Russia border.</p> <p>If Russia won the battles in southern and eastern Ukraine, it would pursue new offensives to capture more Ukrainian territory using units it was currently forming in Russia, said Skibitsky. “They are currently creating rifle battalions of reservists in each Russian military district and a third army corps in [Russia’s] western military district,” he said. </p> <p>Training and equipping of the new corps had begun under the direct supervision of Russia’s minister and deputy minister of defence.</p> <p>Where Russia used the new corps would depend on how the battle developed in Ukraine’s southern and eastern regions, Skibitsky said.</p> <p> He warned that one of the Russian army’s “positives” lay in its ability to move troops and equipment quickly. He said Russia practised this during military exercises leading up to the war and pointed to how the Russian forces retreated from Ukraine’s northern regions in March and reappeared in the Donbas two weeks later. “We know they can return to Belarus in two to three weeks if they need to,” he said. </p> <p>Skibitsky said that aside from more weapons, Ukraine needed help training troops abroad. He said that Russia had been actively targeting Ukrainian training bases, giving several examples, including a strike on a military base just north-east of Kyiv that killed 87 Ukrainian soldiers in May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChiefMI6/status/1553309715299536896\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Running out of steam… <a href=\"https://t.co/bExZXZ3l3z\">https://t.co/bExZXZ3l3z</a></p>&mdash; Richard Moore (@ChiefMI6) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChiefMI6/status/1553309715299536896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 30, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Last Thursday Russian forces hit a military base north-west of Kyiv, according to Ukraine’s armed forces.

In the last two months, Russia has been using Soviet anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles on land targets.</p> <p>“They are using rockets which are, let’s say, past their sell-by date – over 30 years old – so are less effective,” he said. “But they have enough of them and any rocket works to scare the population.”</p> <p>Russia was ramping up production of new weapons, he added.

For those within this tradition the significance of education was not simply in providing the means to a better job but in allowing for new ways of thinking.</p> <p>“Books to me became symbols of social revolution,” observed James Clunie, a house painter who became the Labour MP for Dunfermline in the 1950s. “The miner was no longer the ‘hewer of wood and the drawer of water’ but became… a leader in his own right, advocate, writer, the equal of men.” By the time that Rose published his book in 2001, that tradition had largely ebbed away.

What it actually does is tell working-class students to study whatever best fits them for their station in life. So, philosophy, history and literature increasingly become the playthings of the rich and privileged.</p> <p>There is another way, too, in which the relationship between the working class and education has changed. A report last week from the thinktank the IPPR revealed the <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/2022-07/closing-the-gap-july22.pdf\" title=\"\">paucity of diversity among MPs</a>, a subject of much debate recently. The IPPR says there is a 5% “representation gap” on ethnicity – 10% of MPs have a minority background compared to 15% of the general populace. For women, the gap between prevalence in the population and in parliament is 17% and for the working class it is 27%. The biggest gap, however, comes with education – 86% of MPs have been to university compared to 34% of the population at large. The cleavage between voters and those who govern them is expressed through the class divide but even more so through the education gap.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8faf0d8940b9b8fda0c4dfcbd327c8939126f068\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8faf0d8940b9b8fda0c4dfcbd327c8939126f068/0_229_4921_2953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RMT union leader Mick Lynch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ability of union leader Mick Lynch to fight for his members stirs the imagination, but 50 years ago there were many Mick Lynches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Future Publishing/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The proportion of women and minority MPs has increased over the past 30 years while that of working-class MPs has fallen dramatically. In the 1987-92 parliament, 28% of Labour MPs had a manufacturing, manual or unskilled job before entering parliament. By 2010, that was 10%, rising to 13% for the 2019 intake. For Tories, unsurprisingly, the figure was consistently below 5% and fell to just 1% in 2019.</p> <p>Part of the reason for the decline in working-class MPs is that the institutions that gave workers a public platform, in particular trade unions, have waned. The RMT’s Mick Lynch, and his success in defending workers’ rights, has caught the public imagination. Fifty years ago, there were many Mick Lynches because the working class was more central to political life.</p> <p>At the same time, education has become a marker of social difference in a novel way. As western societies have become more technocratic, so there <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/05/trump-brexit-education-gap-tearing-politics-apart\" title=\"\">has developed</a>, in the words of the political scientist David Runciman, “a new class of experts, for whom education is a prerequisite of entry into the elite” – bankers, lawyers, doctors, civil servants, pundits, academics. The real educational divide is not “between knowledge and ignorance” but “a clash between one world view and another”. So, education has become a marker of <a href=\"https://kenanmalik.com/2018/12/31/posh-may-be-passe-but-contempt-is-not/\" title=\"\">the Brexit divide</a>.</p> <p>All this has led some to claim education, not class, is Britain’s real political divide. It isn’t. Education is, rather, both one of the most significant expressions of the class divide and a means of obscuring it.</p> <p>“If there is one man in the world who needs knowledge,” wrote the Durham collier Jack Lawson in 1932, “it is he who does the world’s most needful work and gets the least return.” That is as true today as it was 90 years ago.</p> <p>• Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p> <p>• This article was amended on 1 August 2022.

Lathigra made eight visits to Mumbai between 2016 and 2019, looking at it with an insider-outsider’s eye, going in search of images that seemed to conjure memories that he could not quite fathom. The project was originally provoked by Brexit. He had been working on a documentary in the lead up to the referendum that took him on a road trip from Calais to Glasgow. Speaking about that journey to the <em>British Journal of Photography</em>, he recalled a new atmosphere in his home country: “Visceral racism came to the fore,” he said. “People were happy to use racial slurs in my presence. I remember breathing a sigh of relief when I got back to London, but then I began to think, am I really ‘home’?”</p> <p>The pictures in <em>Memoire Temporelle</em> are punctuated with extracts from the writings of India’s Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore and poems by Lathigra himself. Caged birds are a theme. In Tagore’s Two Birds, a captive bird in a gilded cage talks to a free bird in the forest. “The free bird said, ‘The sky is blue and bright,/ And nowhere do I feel fettered.’/ The captive bird said, ‘The cage is proper and right,/ See how I am perfectly sheltered.’” Those voices of “anywhere” and “somewhere” sound throughout Lathigra’s pictures; a yearning to belong, a yearning to escape. </p> <ul> <li><p><em>Memoire Temporelle</em> by Kalpesh Lathigra, edited by Emmanuelle Peri, is available for £28 plus p&amp;p via <a href=\"https://www.kalpeshlathigra.com/books\">kalpeshlathigra.com</a></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"fashion/2022/jul/31/beauty-10-of-the-best-face-mists-funmi-fetto-chooses-her-favourite-cooling-spritzes","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T06:00:46Z","webTitle":"Face mists: 10 of the best","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jul/31/beauty-10-of-the-best-face-mists-funmi-fetto-chooses-her-favourite-cooling-spritzes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2022/jul/31/beauty-10-of-the-best-face-mists-funmi-fetto-chooses-her-favourite-cooling-spritzes","fields":{"headline":"Face mists: 10 of the best","trailText":"Chill with a cooling spritz from a bottle (kept in the fridge if you wish).

I understand its use over makeup – though you are better off getting a hydrating setting spray – but as a skincare product? Meh. Most mists do no more than you’d get from a bottle filled with chilled water. As I write this, however, we are in the midst of a heatwave. Everything – my laptop, face, nerves – is melting. I am too hot and impatient to seek out the right kind of bottle with the right type of spritz – ie, a “mist” not a “splash”. Hence, right now, a fresh, cooling spritz from a pre-packaged face mist stored in a fridge is the best invention since the lightbulb. That said, a heatwave is not a regular occurrence. So are face mists still worth it? Well, if you want something that simply feels refreshing on your skin, I still maintain filling a spray bottle with cold, filtered/mineral water. If you are going to spend on a face mist, focus on those with skincare properties. There is an increasing number of them: ones that shield the skin from environmental aggressors (Zelens, Gucci); calm redness (Dr Jart); are antioxidant rich (Elemis); tighten pores (Caudali – e); deliver intense hydration while also gently exfoliating (Glow Recipe, Sunday Riley); minimise inflammation (Niod)… So, if your face mist doesn’t deliver skincare benefits, don’t bother. </p> <p><strong>1.

Now I want to save the species’","trailText":"From near-fatal shark attack survivor to passionate sealife campaigner, unconventional conservationist Paul de Gelder is on a mission to change the way we see the world’s most misunderstood predator","byline":"Michael Segalov","body":"<p>As animal kingdom reputations go, sharks don’t exactly have the best of them. As any good publicist will tell you, “attack” isn’t really the word you want most closely associated with your brand. But Australian conservationist Paul de Gelder is a man on a mission, determined to change the way we think about these much misunderstood predators of the sea.</p> <p>“The problem is,” de Gelder says, “most people will never see a shark in their life, so their perceptions come from news reports, childhood fears and works of fiction.” As a presenter on Discovery’s popular <em>Shark Week</em>, 44-year-old de Gelder has spent more time around these creatures than many and he’s one of their biggest defenders.</p> <p>“Think about any wild animal on the planet,” he says, from his home in Marina Del Ray, Los Angeles. “A bear, or lion; tiger, hippo, cheetah. None will let you share their space with them: they’ll attack you and kill you.” A shark, meanwhile, de Gelder argues – the ocean’s apex predator – will almost always let you share its environment if you’re respectful. “They’re not vicious, man-eating monsters. They’re just sharks doing sharky shit in the ocean, trying to live their lives while we fuck with them.”</p> <p>And that’s something of an understatement. Official estimates suggest 100m sharks are killed annually. De Gelder believes that figure is in reality far higher. “That’s only the registered numbers,” he says, “slaughtered each year for food, medicine and in bycatch.” Consider the amount of illegal and unregulated fishing that occurs globally, he states, and that figure could easily be double. “If you did to land-based wildlife what we do to sharks,” he says, “you’d go to jail for it, no question. But because it’s unseen, out there in the deep blue sea, it goes unnoticed. Spend time with them and you’ll appreciate that’s barbarism and not sustainable at all.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e8429cdd70213643d9d2db55f2e9f2db11bab09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e8429cdd70213643d9d2db55f2e9f2db11bab09/0_144_2304_1382/1000.png\" alt=\"Paul de Gelder in diving gear at the bottom of the ocean, touching the nose of a tiger shark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eye contact: meeting a tiger shark for the first time</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not only are sharks anything but vicious villains, says de Gelder, they’re a vital cog in the ocean ecosystem that is now very much under threat. “Sharks are a keystone species,” he explains, “the bottom block of marine Jenga. Remove too many of those blocks and the whole ecosystem comes toppling down.” <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03173-9\" title=\"\">Recent research</a> has suggested oceanic shark and ray populations have decreased by 71% since 1970. “The special creature which keeps our ocean healthy is being slaughtered,” says de Gelder bluntly. “That simply has to change, otherwise there will be an environmental collapse.”</p> <p>That’s precisely what de Gelder hopes his new book, <em>Shark</em>, will help humanity avoid. It’s an ode to the species, with facts about their significance, and stories from his close encounters. “We need people to see sharks in a different light,” he says, “how I see them when we’re one on one, or when I’m taking celebrities to dive with them.” De Gelder’s passion is all the more impressive when you learn about his own first near-fatal encounter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being eaten alive changed my body, but spending time with sharks altered my mind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Born and raised on the coast just outside Melbourne, de Gelder spent his childhood both in and on the ocean. “If I wasn’t on the beach,” he says, “I’d be out fishing with my grandfather. For as long as I can remember, I was terrified of sharks.” De Gelder’s phobia extended far beyond sensible suspicion. “I was one of those people who thought if we killed all the sharks, life would be all the more sweet.” Watching <em>Jaws</em> certainly didn’t help. “I was frightened of them in the bathtub,” he says, grinning. “I was a state-level swimmer and reckon I only won most of my races because I was convinced there was a shark chasing me from behind.”</p> <p>In early adulthood, de Gelder bobbed about, working the bar at a strip club and finding modest success as a rapper. “I might have opened for Snoop Dogg in 1998,” he says, “but it wasn’t bringing in much money.” In 2000, he signed up to join the Australian military: first as a paratrooper, before being accepted into a prestigious unit of the navy as a clearance diver. “I was in the ocean all the time,” he explains, “traversing pitch black, murky shark-infested waters… Needless to say I was petrified.” Surely for someone with his phobia, I suggest, that was a slightly strange career jump. “Dude, have you met any Australians?” de Gelder laughs. “In both Aussie and military culture, we don’t let the things that scare us stop us from doing what we love.” It’s a mantra that would come back to bite him.</p> <p><em><strong>On 11 February 2009,</strong></em> de Gelder and his team were training out in the waters of Sydney Harbour. “It was just a run of the mill exercise to test new counter-terrorism equipment,” he recalls “alongside Garden Island, the big naval base there.” His task was simple: swim from point A to B, on his back along the water’s surface, wearing a wetsuit and fins. “After about five minutes, out of nowhere, a 10ft bull shark came up from underneath me.” Briefly, the two made eye contact. “Then it grabbed me in its jaw by the back of my right hamstring and my right hand – both in the same bite.” The pain, de Gelder says, was as excruciating as you might imagine. “Shit, I said to myself, you’re definitely not making it out of here alive.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fbedb866d34db5faec81b1ac8e478f631290074\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fbedb866d34db5faec81b1ac8e478f631290074/0_45_2048_1828/1000.png\" alt=\"Paul de Gelder leaning over the side of a boat to tag a great white\" width=\"1000\" height=\"893\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fin romance: tagging a great white – the shark is released unharmed</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was only the shark thrashing its tail to take off, the shock of that sudden movement, that brought him back to reality. Instinct and training kicked in, de Gelder knew he had to escape the blood-infused water with other sharks potentially circling. “I started to swim in the direction of our safety boat. That’s when I first realised my hand was missing, so I kept my arm raised. When he was pulled on board, his colleagues whirred into action before paramedics arrived. Unsurprisingly, de Gelder’s no stranger to retelling the story and these days it’s delivered playfully. “It was a right fucker of a day at work, man. And the footage is actually on YouTube,” he adds, “if anyone wants to check it out.”</p> <p>Then and now, de Gelder is pragmatic. He asked some of the police officers present on the day why it might have happened. “A dead body had been pulled out from under a wharf in the harbour the day before. The shark probably thought I was another corpse. Or I looked like an injured seal flapping about on the water’s surface.” That was always enough of an answer for him.</p> <p>“I had chosen this incredibly dangerous life,” he says. “Honestly? It’s almost inevitable. If it wasn’t a shark, it might well have been my motorbike. I didn’t blame the shark, but I certainly didn’t want to confront one again.”</p> <p>After nine weeks in hospital, de Gelder was discharged. Six months later, he returned to military training. Local media interest in the incident, however, didn’t die down. “Reporters wanted to know not just about my recovery,” he says, “but why the shark attacked me; how others can stay safe in the water.” He set about learning about sharks, to have a bank of educated answers. There was no great desire to understand the psyche of his attacker, de Gelder is certain: “I just didn’t want to look like a dumbass on TV.”</p> <p><em><strong>A few years later,</strong></em> a broadcaster invited de Gelder to join them on a shoot in Fiji. Producers wanted to capture him coming face to face with bull sharks in the wild. “The pull wasn’t the sharks,” he says, “I just saw it as a free holiday for me and my then girlfriend.” On his final day on location, de Gelder hand-fed the same species of shark that had maimed him. “Seeing them in their natural environment,” he says, “changed everything for me.” Within 10 minutes, there were 150 in sight. “And none were attacking me,” he says. “My preconceptions vanished. Everything I’d done in the military – rocket launchers, sky dives, deep sea diving – barely compared to the experience. Being eaten alive may have changed my body, but spending time with these creatures is what really altered my mind.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b041a80117b74123e6428e0d51add34252375889\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b041a80117b74123e6428e0d51add34252375889/0_87_2598_1559/1000.png\" alt=\"A giant whale shark in Mexico.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Open wide: a giant whale shark in Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Meyer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Returning to Australia, de Gelder became a fully fledged fanatic, absorbing every article, piece of research and documentary he could find. Back in the navy, meanwhile, de Gelder had come to accept that he’d never return to active service. For all the hard graft it was taking him to qualify as a military dive instructor, his heart wasn’t in it. Companies had regularly reached out, asking if he’d speak at their corporate events or to give public lectures. “But the only thing I was afraid of more than sharks was public speaking,” he explains. Until he received one invitation. “A cancer camp for kids got in touch,” he says, “asking me to address the children. He did the presentation – and walked out on a high. He’d remained in the military until then. “My only skills were to hunt, kill and defuse bombs… There weren’t many options for a one-armed, one-legged veteran. Maybe, I thought, I could have a future beyond the military if I confronted my other great fear in life.”</p> <p>In 2014, the Discovery Channel approached him to co-present a show about great whites. “After that, I was hooked,” he says, “I started to present <em>Shark Week</em> on the network, and relocated to Los Angeles. The assignments have been challenging but rewarding. There were the two days and nights he spent drifting through the Atlantic Ocean with no food or water, surrounded by a group of sharks known as the wolves of the sea. “They were supposedly responsible for the biggest shark attack in history,” de Gelder says, “in 1945 when the USS Indianapolis naval ship sank in the Philippines leaving survivors stranded in the sea for days – some estimates say up to 150 were attacked and eaten by circling sharks.”</p> <p>Yet de Gelder feels that saving shark populations is by far his toughest challenge. Far harder, he’s clear, than almost being eaten alive. “Physically that attack and what followed was rough for me,” he says, “the phantom pains; learning to walk on a prosthetic. Emotionally? It wasn’t as hard in all honesty.” He’s never suffered from PTSD, flashbacks or nightmares. “Don’t get me wrong,” he adds, “I had bad days: I cried myself to sleep in pain, frustration and fear more nights than I care to remember. But I never let it get on top of me.”</p> <p>Spending time with sharks up close, de Gelder says, is a life-changing experience.” I’ve introduced sharks to lots of different people and every time they come out of the water, they say it has shifted something inside them.” That’s not to say, he’s quick to add, that you should kick back and enjoy the moment if you encounter one while sea swimming this summer on a beach.</p> <p>“In that case, keep your eyes on it, if you can,” he says. “Sharks know when you’re looking at them. They are ambush predators, opportunistic hunters. They don’t want to fight or struggle. If it’s being aggressive, then do whatever you can to get away from it. If it’s just checking you out, show you’re strong, too. Put your hand on its head and push it away if necessary. Then just get to shore as quickly as you can.” </p> <h2>Why sharks are winners. An extract from Paul de Gelder’s new book, Shark</h2> <p>Not only do sharks exist in every sea and ocean around the world, they are some of the oldest species on the planet, pre-dating even the dinosaurs. They have survived five mass-extinction events and, despite 400m years of evolution, they remain wholly unchanged. Why? Because some things you just can’t improve upon and the anatomy of the shark is one such marvel of nature. Here’s why:</p> <h2>Teeth</h2> <p>Just like us, sharks lose their teeth throughout their life, but unlike humans, sharks continue to regrow them so that they’re never just a set of gums. Of course, sharks have evolved to have this trait because it’s essential for their survival. They can’t mash up their food by hand or with rocks like we can. A shark starts dinner by biting and ripping its meal into pieces, and you can’t do that without a mouthful of teeth. So why are they able to do this when so many other species of predator can’t? Well, the reason for this is because a shark’s teeth are held in the gums of its jaws, rather than being set into the bone, which is the norm for most toothy creatures, including humans. New teeth grow on the inside of the mouth, and over time, they grow and “roll” to the outside in their new rows. The great white can have up to seven rows of exposed teeth at once and can cycle through an estimated 30,000 teeth in its life-time – no wonder they don’t get cavities.</p> <h2>Fins</h2> <p>A fin coming towards you in the water is the last thing most people want to see. As you can imagine, a shark’s fins have an incredibly important purpose. There are the five different types of fin on a shark’s body. The most predominant and well known is the dorsal fin, which rides high on the shark’s back. All of a shark’s fins are there for a similar purpose – propulsion, stability and steering. The caudal fin is the driving motor for the animal, and in the case of the thresher shark, also a weapon. All of the other fins can be slightly or drastically adjusted to control the roll, pitch, depth, elevation and direction of movement through the water column; much like a pilot does with an airplane’s wing and tail flaps to control its position and direction in the air. A shark without fins would be like a human with no arms or legs: you wouldn’t be going anywhere very quickly. And without water moving over the gills, the shark would drown. Every shark that is caught and finned will die a slow and agonising death.</p> <h2>Sense of smell</h2> <p>Many sharks have a very powerful olfactory system (the bodily structure that serves the sense of smell), and this can detect tiny molecules of scent that have been left behind by other animals as they pass through the water. Smell is one of the senses that they use to locate prey, and also to find a mate over large distances in our oceans and it’s so important that large parts of its brains are dedicated to this purpose alone. The white shark (also known as the great white, or white pointer) has about 14% of its brain designated to its sense of smell, making it an incredibly efficient hunter and scavenger: a whale carcass can draw sharks from miles around, gathering great whites in numbers that you would rarely see anywhere else. The carcass releases scent into the ocean, and that’s like ringing the dinner bell for hungry white sharks who recognise it as decomposing whale blubber – a favourite dish of theirs.</p> <h2>Skeleton, skin and gills</h2> <p>Unlike other species of fish, sharks don’t have any bones. Not a single one. A shark’s skeleton is actually made from cartilage. Give your ear a squeeze right now, and the bridge of your nose. That’s cartilage; flexible, extremely durable, yet lighter than bone. This is another trick that makes the shark so energy efficient. The less you weigh, the less energy you need to expend to move yourself through the water. Simple and brilliant, and it adds a little more mystery to studying these creatures: one of the reasons that shark “skeletons” are so hard to find is because the salt water of the oceans breaks down cartilage a lot faster than bone.</p> <h2>Do sharks poop?</h2> <p>I’ve held back the most important, cutting-edge question for last. The answer is: indeed they do. Shark poop is actually really useful to researchers because it gives a great insight into what they’ve been eating. You’ve probably seen a goldfish poop. Despite being a fish, the shark’s toilet habits are a little different. Those like the basking or whale shark – with their diets of plankton – expend waste that comes out as a dark cloud. Meanwhile many a cage diver has been crop dusted by white sharks – with their mostly mammal diet, the cloud is more on the green side, and full of nitrates.</p> <p><em>Shark: Why We Need to Save the World’s Most Misunderstood Predator, by Paul de Gelder, is published by Mudlark at £16.99.

He will be paid £46,800 a year for working 12 hours a month through his consulting company, Map Advisory.</p> <p>Documents obtained by the <em>Observer</em> suggest Texas-based Linden Energy – founded by a former lobbyist for George Bush – pushed for the increased use of fossil fuels while downplaying the role of carbon emissions in the climate crisis.</p> <p>In a November 2021 presentation entitled “The reality of climate change”, Linden Energy’s chief operating officer, Ray Leonard, emphasises non-human factors in global warming and claims it is “virtually impossible” to avoid 2C warming by 2050, before arguing for more investment in natural gas.</p> <p>While there is no suggestion of wrongdoing, the findings have led to renewed calls for tighter rules on MPs’ second jobs, as well as fresh concerns about fossil fuel lobbying.</p> <p>Scientists have been warning of potentially catastrophic climate breakdown since the 1980s, but attempts by industry lobbyists to cast doubt on the science have been blamed for delaying the responses of governments around the world.</p> <p>Last year, following a series of lobbying scandals, Boris Johnson gave his backing to proposals to clamp down on MPs taking second jobs as consultants and lobbyists. The plans were later dropped.</p> <p>This weekend, the Green Party called on Pritchard to quit his role with Linden, while Edward Collins, a director at the InfluenceMap thinktank, which tracks lobbying by polluting industries, described the issue as “highly concerning”. “Tactics like retaining serving politicians for consultancy advice are part of a well-developed playbook from the fossil fuels industry,” he said.</p> <p>Linden Energy Holdings was founded in 2013 by Steve Payne, a former adviser to George W Bush. He resigned in 2008 in a scandal involving him being secretly taped offering access to top White House figures in exchange for a $250,000 donation.</p> <p>The company is understood to have several projects under consideration in Europe and last year bought a majority stake in Overgas, Bulgaria’s biggest gas company. It has also led ventures to exploit natural gas reserves in Africa, including drilling deep-water exploration wells off the coast of Guinea.</p> <p>Another company under the Linden umbrella, Linden Strategies, specialises in government relations, strategic communications and political consulting, and has clients across several sectors. Its slogan is: “Complex Issues. Discrete Strategies. Winning Results.” Payne is president of both companies.</p> <p>In the internal Linden Energy documents, understood to be part of the company’s pitch to potential clients, the firm is accused of using “well known climate delay tactics” including “doomism”, the suggestion that it is not possible to avert global warming so mitigation is futile.</p> <p>Linden’s presentation argues that averting 2C temperature rise by the 2050s is “virtually impossible”, and that the steps needed have “no realistic possibility of being accomplished”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d56393fb65c6057a322f6c925b5538445d385e0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d56393fb65c6057a322f6c925b5538445d385e0d/0_127_3800_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a natural gas storage facility in Bierwang, southern Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The company urges a transition to natural gas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lennart Preiss/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also devotes several slides to the “many factors” that have caused the climate crisis, emphasising “natural causes” and showing temperature change graphs over millions of years – despite the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s finding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/09/climate-crisis-unequivocally-caused-by-human-activities-says-ipcc-report\" title=\"\">almost 100% of warming since the 1950s has been caused by humans</a>.</p> <p>The presentation concludes by calling for more investment in fossil fuels and says a transition to natural gas could make “the biggest difference now” in reducing carbon emissions. Natural gas is cleaner than oil and coal, but experts say all fossil fuels must be phased out.</p> <p>Mark Maslin, a professor of Earth system science at University College London, said Linden Energy’s presentation was “riddled with soft denial” and appeared to be “a continuation” of attempts by the fossil fuel industry to delay action on the climate emergency. “It’s saying, ‘Oh well, it’s not really all about greenhouse gases, so you don’t have to worry so much,’ and ‘Climate change is happening but it’s impossible [to avert], so let’s not worry about it.’ This is classic denial 101,” he said.</p> <p>The Green Party co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, said it was unacceptable that a serving MP could be working for a firm that “appeared to be peddling climate denialism designed to keep us all reliant on oil and gas” at a time when “the UK is seeing the effects of climate inaction”, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/20/green-upgrades-could-cut-uk-energy-bills-by-1800-a-year-finds-study\" title=\"\">soaring energy bills</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/climate-breakdown-made-uk-heatwave-10-times-more-likely-study-finds\" title=\"\">extreme heat</a>.</p> <p>“The interests of fossil fuel companies should have no place at the heart of our democracy,” he said. “I would urge the government to force Mr Pritchard to choose between his new job in the industry and his position as an MP.”</p> <p>There are also questions over why Pritchard’s role, listed in the MPs’ register of interests, was not declared until July. According to the entry, he was first paid by Linden Energy on 6 June. but took up the role on 1 May.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/30/total-climate-meltdown-inevitable-heatwaves-global-catastrophe\">‘Soon it will be unrecognisable’: total climate meltdown cannot be stopped, says expert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>MPs are required to register all relevant interests, not just financial ones, within 28 days, including “any interest which someone might reasonably consider to influence their actions or words as an MP”.</p> <p>Neither Pritchard nor Linden Energy Holdings responded to formal requests for comment.

The first question from the audience – which included a host of world-leading researchers – was put by a young man. “You are famous for thinking outside the box,” he asked. “How do you do it?” Lovelock sat thoughtfully for a few moments, before replying: “What box?”</p> <p>The story, recalled by the conservationist Tim Flannery, was typical of a scientist who never accepted the intellectual confines that so many other researchers erect around their studies over the years. Thus the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/27/james-lovelock-creator-of-gaia-hypothesis-dies-on-103rd-birthday\" title=\"\">death last week of Lovelock</a>, at the age of 103, robs the world of a true scientific maverick. This was a polymath who never accepted a university-tenured position, although his academic influence was profound. He pioneered work in chemistry, exobiology, virology and atmospheric physics and as one of the originators of the Gaia hypothesis – which holds that our living planet can be viewed as a single biological system – he became a venerated figure in the environment movement. Life shapes the environment and not the other way round, he argued. At the same time, Lovelock also took work from Shell, Hewlett-Packard and the intelligence services. In this way, his original thinking graced industry, the green movement, government and, for good measure, the hunt for life on other worlds.</p> <p>“My role has been to bring separated things together and make the whole more than the sum of the parts,” he once told the writer Jonathan Watts. Such an attitude flies in the face of modern academia, which all too often is filled with those who specialise in ever more fragmented niches.</p> <p>Critical to Lovelock’s success as an independent thinker was his role in the invention of the electron capture detector – a matchbox-size device that can measure tiny traces of toxic chemicals in the environment. This earned him enough money to achieve academic freedom, a liberation from intellectual constraint that he relished with considerable enthusiasm. “As any artist or novelist would understand, some of us do not produce their best when directed,” he later explained in his autobiography, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/homage-to-gaia-9781788164603\" title=\"\"><em>Homage to Gaia</em></a>.</p> <p>The need for visionary scientists who choose to work independently and who can explore a number of different fields to reveal fresh intellectual insights has never been more acute. Modern science has not only become dangerously compartmentalised, it is also coming under increasing regulatory pressure from governments and politicians who seek more subservience from those scientists who accept their funding in order to carry out their research. Mavericks such as Lovelock who look beyond the confines of their laboratories and who reject attempts to restrain their activities are becoming a worrying rarity.An example of Lovelock’s broad-ranging thinking is provided by his studies, while working for Nasa, of the harsh, carbon dioxide atmospheres of Venus and Mars. By contrast, on Earth, nitrogen and oxygen dominate, he noted in the 70s. Together with the biologist Lynn Margulis, he argued that early lifeforms that began to extract carbon dioxide on Earth eventually led to the evolution of a biological system that manipulated atmosphere and water to its own advantage. Gaia had been born.</p> <p>Gaia was a major influence on the green movement, though Lovelock was suspicious of its claims and aspirations. “Too many greens are not just ignorant of science, they hate science,” he argued, and likened them to “some global over-anxious mother figure who is so concerned about small risks that she ignores the real dangers”. Such a judgment is perhaps a little harsh, though it also reveals an independence of mind that was the hallmark of a great scientist whose vision and creativity will be sorely missed.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/allan-jenkins-on-gardening-colourful-petals-and-proming-crops-its-all-go-on-plot-29","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T05:15:45Z","webTitle":"Colourful petals and promising crops on the plot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/allan-jenkins-on-gardening-colourful-petals-and-proming-crops-its-all-go-on-plot-29","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/allan-jenkins-on-gardening-colourful-petals-and-proming-crops-its-all-go-on-plot-29","fields":{"headline":"Colourful petals and promising crops on the plot","trailText":"There’s a lot to take in at the allotment in these heady days summer, says Allan Jenkins","byline":"Allan Jenkins","body":"<p>Howard has succumbed to the idea of the Ukrainian morning glory, mainly because I ‘accidentally’ scattered seed among the near-failing tear peas.

Failure to act now would leave Britain facing a future of queueing for emergency bottled water “from the back of lorries”.</p> <p>The government was warned four years ago by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/30/osborne-launches-national-infrastructure-commission\" title=\"\">National Infrastructure Committee</a> (NIC) that considerable new investment would have to be made in the nation’s water supply equipment by the 2030s. Although some improvements have been made by water firms, nearly 3billion litres of water is still lost every day.</p> <p>Plugging these leaks will require an investment of around £20bn, Sir John Armitt, chair of the committee, told the <em>Observer</em> this weekend. Failure to invest now will mean, he added, that more than twice as much will have to be spent on distributing bottled water to UK residents by lorry as increasingly frequent droughts grip the nation.</p> <p>“You have to pay for it, one way or another,” he said. “That could be investing in new reservoirs or moving water around the country, as well as stopping leaks.” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/dec/08/water-meters-help-cut-useage\" title=\"\">Water metering</a> is considered by the industry as the best tool for cutting water use – the UK has the highest usage in Europe.

The reaction is always kneejerk. What happens when we get to this stage – when it is very dry and hot –is that all of a sudden usage shoots up as people fill paddling pools and water their gardens.”</p> <p>Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the National Farmers’ Union, said more investment in water irrigation, on farm reservoirs and a better plan to manage water resources was needed. “The lack of rain means crops such as sugar beet and maize are showing signs of stress, while there are challenges for farmers needing to irrigate field veg and potatoes. The dry weather has also severely hampered grass growth, which could hit feed supplies for the winter.”</p> <p>Critics say the government has had plenty of warnings, but seems to have taken no action. </p> <p>“What we are seeing now is that climate impacts in terms of more extreme weather events are happening more frequently and at a greater magnitude than was anticipated,” said Martin Baxter of the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment. “We have really got to become more resilient to what we know is on the way.”</p> <p>A conglomerate of government bodies said that major plans were being prepared to improve water storage and transfer across England and Wales. A £500million scheme called Rapid – Regulators’ Alliance for Progressing Infrastructure Development – was set up jointly in 2019 by Ofwat, the Environment Agency (EA) and the Drinking Water Inspectorate.</p> <p>“We are now investigating different schemes with the aim of implementing the most promising in a couple of years,” said Paul Hickey, managing director of Rapid.</p> <p>Among the projects being considered are a series of new reservoirs that could be built in different parts of the country and schemes that would allow engineers to transfer water from the north of England, where supplies are not stressed, to the south. These would involve using the River Severn and the Grand Union canal as conduits for fresh water that would alleviate situation in the south of England, which has been worst affected by the drought.</p> <p>These schemes will cost billions of pounds, however, and are unlikely to be implemented in the next decade.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/29/southern-water-announces-hosepipe-ban-amid-uk-drought-fears?amp;amp\" title=\"\">July was the driest month on record since 1911</a>, with only 24% of the amount of rain that would be expected in an average July, according to Met Office data.

As in all extreme situations, there may well be a seeking-out of the comforts of long-gone safer-seeming times: a can of 1980s-style shandy or a stubby of the French version Panaché was what I found myself craving on one particularly sweltering afternoon. Whatever attributes it might have, bubbles, of varying degrees of frothiness and force (even a very slight tingle of spritz will do) seem to be a must for heatwave drinks, which I reckon has something to do with a barely conscious association of fizzy liquids with the cooling frothing waves of the sea. The other rule: low – if not (necessarily) no – alcohol, which explains the attraction of wines such as traditional Vinho Verde from northern Portugal, with, in the case of Vale Dos Pombos, a just-perceptible little prickle of CO2, and a pleasingly green apple sour-tang to go with its fruit-salad flavours.</p> <p><strong>Nivola Lambrusco, Emilia-Romagna, Italy NV (£14.99, or £11.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, <a href=\"https://www.majestic.co.uk/\">majestic.co.uk</a>) </strong>The Italians, who I understand have had some years of experience with the kind of temperatures we’ve been enduring, are absolute masters of the light and the fizzy. Prosecco, which often clocks in at about 11% abv or less, is the most famous example, of course, and that sweetly soothing cream soda foam, with or without a spicy seasoning of Campari or, if your sweet tooth must, Aperol, is almost the Platonic form of the refreshing beachside drink; <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/\">Aldi</a> Organic prosecco (£7.49) offers the experience for a very realistic price. I can’t quite imagine drinking it around the pool, but the darkly bubbling Italian sparkling red wine, Lambrusco, is every bit as good as prosecco in the heat. Wines such as Nivola or the even more vivid and vivacious Venturini Baldini Montelocco Lambrusco Rosso Biologico (£15.99, <a href=\"https://corksofbristol.com/\">corksofbristol.com</a>) are also 11% or thereabouts. And if prosecco is like a dripping sweet pear, these Lambruscos work their cooling mouthwatering magic like a cool draught of dark, tart-tangy, sappy blackberry and black cherry juice.</p> <p><strong>Sprigster Sparkling Botanical Infusion, Wiltshire, England NV (£15, <a href=\"https://www.sprigsterdrinks.com/\">sprigsterdrinks.com</a>) </strong>My other favourite light Italian fizz comes from Piedmont on the other, western side of northern Italy from prosecco country. Moscato d’Asti has half as much alcohol as prosecco (5%). But in the case of a wine such as Michele Chiarlo Nivole Moscato d’Asti 2021 (£11.50, 37.5cl, oddbins.com) it has around twice as much flavour: a wonderful frothy sweet swirl of peach, melon and pear and muscat grapes. Once the thermometer’s topped 40C, even 5% alcohol can seem counter-productive. Fortunately the revolution in adult no and low-alcohol fizz alternatives to wine has opened up other properly refreshing, dry-tasting drinks. My new favourite comes from Pythouse Kitchen Garden in Wiltshire, which sounds like the kind of place you’d be able to find plenty of fragrant shady corners to hide with a book in a heatwave. It’s made by blending a botanical mash of distilled grain vinegar, water, hops, fennel seeds, rhubarb and ginger with apples, gooseberries and spring water: a rejuvenating elixir, it turns out, on even the hottest of days.</p> <p><em>Follow David Williams on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/i-have-a-small-penis-will-i-ever-be-able-to-measure-up-ask-philippa","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T05:00:46Z","webTitle":"I have a small penis, will I ever be able to ‘measure up’? | Ask Philippa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/i-have-a-small-penis-will-i-ever-be-able-to-measure-up-ask-philippa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/31/i-have-a-small-penis-will-i-ever-be-able-to-measure-up-ask-philippa","fields":{"headline":"I have a small penis, will I ever be able to ‘measure up’?","trailText":"This may be body dysmorphia, where an innocent body part is taking the blame, says Philippa Perry","byline":"Philippa Perry","body":"<p><em><strong>The question </strong>I have a small penis. When I was 14 or so I was called out by a boy in the school changing rooms for “having a little one”. I felt humiliated. It had never occurred to me up to that point that it mattered.</em></p> <p><em>It seems to be something which, according to the media, is risible and makes me less of a man. The word “manhood” is used as a euphemism that equates desirable masculine traits with a big willy</em><em>.</em></p> <p><em>I am 55, a father of three and in a happy and loving relationship with a great sex life. No doubt you would say to me that if my partner is satisfied, then I should get over my insecurity</em><em>. I have much to be grateful for. I am not likely to be “playing the field” any more. </em><em>But I worry, fret and get depressed about this </em><em>and have done for </em><em>40 years.</em></p> <p><em>My upbringing was one where I was expected to “fail” and I did develop a deep-rooted low self-worth</em><em> and a sense of shame of not being enough as a person</em><em>. So “evidence” such as this for “coming up short” reinforces my feelings of inadequacy. I </em><em>had counselling, but didn’t feel </em><em>I was taken seriously</em><em>. I am still so heartbroken I can’t “measure up” in the way that I would ideally like to. I carry a sense of real anger that it seems broadly OK to deride the half of all men with smaller-than-average penises. “Oh, he has a big car with a long bonnet – what is he trying to make up for [titter].” How do I learn to love myself regardless of this one physical attribute that seems to me to be so crucial (and is stigmatised by most people) and forces me to hide my shame?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>I know it must have taken courage to write in and I applaud you for doing that. Talking openly about this is a step towards recovery.</p> <p>Your upbringing was one where you were expected to fail. It sounds as though you were regularly led to believe you were inadequate. I don’t think it is as much that your penis size gives evidence to this so much that it has come to symbolise how you had always been treated when growing up. It sounds as if you could be suffering from body dysmorphia.</p> <p>Body dysmorphia is a mental health condition in which you can’t stop thinking about a perceived defect about your body. It doesn’t make any difference if others think it is a flaw or not – you still feel so ashamed and anxious about it that it adversely affects your life. Body dysmorphia can be the result of being teased, bullied, overly criticised or abused when you were a child.</p> <p>I think your brain made the connection when you were humiliated about how a part of you looked in the changing room at 14 to all the times you were made to feel inadequate. The daily painful insults you had suffered up until then have all been heaped on to this innocent body part. It is a symbol for your psychological pain. Then every time in public or private you hear anything about small penises, it compounds the injury. Until it gets to the point where you fret and obsess about it, probably all the time, sometimes in the background of your mind, but often in the foreground.</p> <p>You probably think, if only there was a safe plastic surgical procedure, you would be cured. But it wouldn’t be that simple, because you would never be satisfied with the outcome: with body dysmorphia it isn’t the body part that is wrong, it is the body part which is taking the blame for the psychological injuries you suffered growing up. I get that it feels to you as though your body part is at fault, or society is at fault, but really it was how you were made to feel about your whole self when you were growing up that is the fault. And yes, why wouldn’t you be angry about that? It has left you with a difficult legacy to manage.</p> <p>Body dysmorphia usually doesn’t get better on its own. If left untreated, it may get worse over time. The usual treatments for it are cognitive behavioural therapy and/or antidepressant medication. You should be able to access these through your GP. Personally, I would favour hypnotherapy (see <a href=\"https://nationalhypnotherapysociety.org/find-a-therapist\" title=\"\">nationalhypnotherapysociety.org)</a> for body dysmorphia, because you will need to break the connection that you have made to your penis with that old injury of being made to feel as though you will fail. By making a good life for yourself you have proved your tormentors wrong. It is time to have an inner life to match that.</p> <p>I know it is difficult to talk about, but by taking the step of writing in, you have started that process. The next step will be visiting your GP. If it’s too hard to talk, show them this correspondence.</p> <p>And I promise I will never again trot out the old cliché about flash cars and penis size.

Fire? Sex. Swimming? Sex (‘the smoothness of motion through the water indicates the dreamers’ feelings about the act’). Keys and locks? Sex. Drowning? Sex. Doors?

Those concerned about existential threats to the NHS usually focus on the risk of the “free at the point of use” principle being dismantled. But by far the most significant political threat, as we are seeing at the moment, is the slow erosion of the guarantee that it will meet the needs of all, due to persistent underfunding and a failure to train the staff it needs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The NHS and social care service will require an extra 475,000 and 490,000 employees by the early 2030s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A report from the health select committee last week has concluded that the NHS and the social care system are facing their <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/23246/documents/169640/default/\" title=\"\">greatest workforce crises</a> in their history, with around 100,000 vacancies being advertised in each at the end of last year. It predicted that the NHS and social care service will require an extra 475,000 and 490,000 employees by the early 2030s, but highlighted that the government has no credible plan to meet that need. Hospitals are having to cope in a system where one in 10 clinical <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-vacancies-survey/april-2015---december-2021-experimental-statistics\" title=\"\">positions are vacant</a> in areas from intensive care to emergency medicine, maternity care and GP services. This is leading to low morale, high stress, burnout and higher levels of absence due to sickness right across the health service and social care systems, posing a grave risk to patient safety.</p> <p>Moreover, the NHS and social care systems have been chronically underfunded over the past decade: budgets have failed to keep pace with the demands placed on them by an ageing population and advances in medical technology. Long-term international data shows that the UK spends <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA\" title=\"\">significantly less </a>per person on healthcare than countries such as Germany, France and Sweden. We have far fewer hospital beds, nurses and doctors than our <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/unitedkingdom/health-at-a-glance-UK-EN.pdf\" title=\"\">best-resourced competitors</a>. This year alone, rising inflation means the NHS is facing a <a href=\"https://www.nhsconfed.org/articles/liz-truss-and-rishi-sunak-need-dose-realism-nhs\" title=\"\">real-terms funding cut</a> of up to £9.4bn.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic hit, the NHS was under significant strain, with important operations cancelled during winter crises due to insufficient capacity, and waiting lists growing. Covid has made things worse, adding to the backlog and to staff absences. As highlighted by the health select committee, NHS waiting lists now number 6.5 million – the highest they have ever been. People cannot access the critical care they need, of the quality they should be able to expect, in a timely manner. They are consigned to worsening health problems, living in pain and unnecessary death simply because the government has chosen not to provide adequate funding for health services.</p> <p>In social care, the situation is no better. Social care funding per person aged over 65 fell by <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/publications/15214\" title=\"\">an astonishing 31%</a> between 2010 and 2018. This has meant growing numbers of older and disabled people not getting the help they need with basic tasks such as washing, dressing and eating, heaping extra pressure on the NHS when they suffer the terrible costs, such as dehydration and falls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The NHS does not need a big-bang structural reform… its founding principles are as sound as they were back in 1948</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The NHS’s critics point to its worsening performance indicators to argue for abandoning its core principles altogether and moving to a system of social insurance. This ignores the fact that they are the direct product of sustained underfunding and a lack of workforce planning, both deliberate political choices taken by Conservative prime ministers, most recently by Boris Johnson. A huge issue of old and dated equipment has left the NHS operating below par. The UK certainly suffers poorer health outcomes than in some comparable countries, but this is in the context of spending less per person and in a society where there are greater social inequalities and higher levels of obesity, important determinants of health outcomes.</p> <p>The NHS does not need a big-bang structural reform imposed top-down on it by politicians; its founding principles are as sound as they were in 1948. It needs sufficient funding to ensure it has the capacity to adapt to a rapidly ageing society, to develop more integrated provision with social care at the local level, and to shift its focus to public health and preventative care alongside acute care, for example, through reducing levels of obesity and improving early diagnosis of diseases such as cancer and heart conditions.</p> <p>The remaining candidates to succeed Johnson as prime minister, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, have failed miserably to acknowledge the scale of the challenge facing the NHS and social care system. They have instead resorted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/brexit-realism-nhs-some-key-issues-ignored-rishi-sunak-liz-truss\" title=\"\">cliched soundbites</a> about reducing the number of NHS managers – as if multimillion-pound hospital trusts do not need people to run them – and improving the use of technology, without acknowledging that insufficient capital spending is why many hospitals are reliant on barely functioning IT systems. The lesson of the 1980s and 90s is that the problems created by an underfunded health system cannot be reversed overnight by turning the taps back on: they will leave a legacy for many years to come, which the nation will pay for with its health.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/jul/31/womens-euro-final-flypast-contest-fans","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"Women’s Euros final set for a female flypast and a full house at Wembley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/womens-euro-final-flypast-contest-fans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/jul/31/womens-euro-final-flypast-contest-fans","fields":{"headline":"Women’s Euros final set for a female flypast and a full house at Wembley","trailText":"Famous fans get behind England for a gripping contest against Germany that is expected to set records","byline":"Miranda Bryant","body":"<p>An all-female RAF flypast will grace the skies above Wembley on Sunday in celebration of a women’s football team that this weekend received good-luck messages from the prime minister, the leader of the opposition and the royal family before the Women’s Euro 2022 final against Germany.</p> \n<p>“Your passion for the game, your tenacity in tricky spots and above all your astounding talent on the pitch have already created a summer of fantastic memories for millions of us,” Boris Johnson wrote in a letter to the England team.</p> \n<p>“Whatever happens at Wembley this evening, I know that, come tomorrow morning, the pitches and playgrounds and parks of this country will be filled as never before with girls and women who know beyond any shadow of a doubt that football is not just for boys – it really is for everyone.”</p> \n<p>Keir Starmer, in his letter to the Lionesses, said: “As a parent, I know how vital it is to see strong, successful role models in sport.

I find this miraculous, but the miracle will not survive the deterioration of standards of care now becoming apparent. Once it is clear that those who can pay will get better care than those who can’t, equality disappears and we are back to poor services for the poor, as in the US, for example.</p> <p>This matters profoundly and is why the growth of private care will in itself undermine the NHS, quite apart from the economic forces that come into play once the NHS is not the dominant provider of healthcare, the setter of standards of excellence and innovation and the place where clinicians want to work, as it has been in the past. The NHS has been starved of resources and needs to be rescued, otherwise we will lose it.</p> <p>Put clinicians back in control. Get rid of the market in the NHS and save the 10% of the budget that goes to administer it. Then fund the NHS adequately, up to the level of our European neighbours, from general taxation as originally intended.

Starters £4.98-£8.98, larger dishes £6.98-£13.98, wines from £19.98</strong></p> <p>Gigi Gao is her own special creation, and what a fabulous creation she is. She serves us wearing a full-length, silvery, sequined fitted dress, and a veil of gold tassels. It becomes clear, when the house wine arrives, that this is a fashion, rather than cultural choice; on the bespoke wine bottle label she is pictured, unveiled, raising a glass. Another waiter is in a rainbow sequined dress, and a third has a black sequined dress with a dashing opera cape. Rightly, they pair these outfits with sensible-looking trainers. The brilliant thing about all of this dress up is that it suits the decor. It’s the best kind of nuts.</p> <p>The floors and many of the walls are painted mandarin orange, apart from those bits decorated with expanded images from Willow pattern, among many other things. The ceiling is strung with fairy lights and wide bolts of red, diaphanous cloth. In one corner there’s a huge, soft panda and in another a small deer. The stuffed toy animal looks thoroughly startled. I can quite see why. For no obvious reason, silver bunting reading “Happy 50th Birthday” is strung across our side of the dining room. Oh well. It’s bound to be somebody’s 50th some time. The table cloths, under thick, transparent protectors which your bare arms might later stick to, are decorated with Chinese stories and legends and the wine is served less in glasses than goblets, with multicoloured swirling and filigreed metal stems. Outside, overlooking the marina, are bright-red tables under a broad spreading tree hung with numerous lanterns. The laminated menu is an equally garish riot of images and typefaces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3ea2d7821d0165a5fd16b1c8b5ee9f58118349a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3ea2d7821d0165a5fd16b1c8b5ee9f58118349a/200_321_6070_3642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘A dear old friend’: spare ribs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A dear old friend’: spare ribs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of this pageant and jollity would be merely annoying if the food served at Gigi Gao’s Favourite Authentic Chinese wasn’t up to much, but it is very much up to everything. Aside from two deep-fried seafood dishes right at the start, which had been allowed to wallow in the deep fat fryer for too long, the largely Sichuan-accented food here is a grand old wallop of flavour and intent and just all round bloody good things.</p> <p>Gigi arrived in Swansea almost 20 years ago to study law at the university and was apparently struck by the dearth of good Chinese restaurants. Hence, in 2014, she opened this one at a location further into town, before moving it here in 2019 and letting her idiosyncratic eye for design run riot. By necessity, the long menu has a few standard Anglo-Chinese crowd pleasers, especially among the starters. Yes, you can have crispy duck and spring rolls, prawn toast and dumplings. There is a list of black bean dishes and another of sweet and sour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f26a3a9500fe2c2aa739f2f7cf368b3b056dbaac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f26a3a9500fe2c2aa739f2f7cf368b3b056dbaac/258_305_5953_3572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Fiery sauce’: lazy bean curd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Fiery sauce’: lazy bean curd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Don’t. Order instead a plate of the invigoratingly sharp black fungus salad or another of the smashed cucumber with julienned carrot. The menu is rich in these non-meat options, the most thrilling of which is a dish of griddled potatoes. They arrive in a small wok suspended within an ornate brass frame, with a guttering candle underneath. The discs of potato manage to be both crunchy and soft at the same time and appear to have been blanched, then deep fried, then turned in a mess of spice and chilli and black beans, to create a joyously massive hit of crusty flavour. They are so good, so compelling, we order a second portion. To be fair there were eight of us at the table. To be even fairer, it cost only £8.98, which I regard as a weird, vaguely arbitrary price, the weirdness of which is entirely appropriate to the location.</p> <p>I scan the menu. The price of almost everything ends in 98, presumably because it is 1p less than 99 and 2p less than the full rounded-up £1. Oh yes, I can do all the maths. The key thing, of course, is the number before the 98s. Mostly it’s 6s, 7s and 8s with a handful of seafood dishes reaching the lofty altitudes of 12 and 13. Or to put it another way, we rampaged through the menu like toddlers let loose on a no-limits sweetie pick’n’mix, did not skimp on the booze and still came in at under £40 a head. You could eat here for a lot less and have a fabulous time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c2195ed11d00fc134edb2d14ec1abe475092f48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c2195ed11d00fc134edb2d14ec1abe475092f48/0_215_6385_3831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Thumping flavours’: griddled potatoes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Thumping flavours’: griddled potatoes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The vegetarian options include a rarely seen dish of shredded potato, served with a little bite. I’m used to it being cold. This is served warm, though it works well with the thumping flavours of the griddled potatoes. We have long-stewed aubergines in the deepest and darkest of sauces, and bright, a verdant meadow of garlic spinach to freshen everything up. There is a list of “lazy” dishes, because customers kept mishearing and misreading the Chinese word <em>lazi</em>, for chilli. The lazy bean curd, made with tofu skin boasting a proud, determined meatiness, comes in another fiery sauce with peanuts and dried chillies to be pulled to the side.</p> <p>There is something called barrel beef which, as the name suggests, is a barrel-shaped receptacle, lined with foil and filled with the kind of broth you could lose yourself in on a cold night or even a warm one, thick with ribbons of just-cooked beef and fresh green herbs, fresh and dried chillies. We order the chicken wings in Coke and conclude from the eye-widening, tooth-juddering sweetness of the thickened sauce that it was indeed made with a lot of Coke. Spare ribs in the kind of glossy five-spice sauce with which you could varnish a boat deck are an old Cantonese throwback to another sort of Anglo-Chinese restaurant, the ones I went to as a kid and loved. It’s like going to a party full of interesting people you don’t know, and in the middle coming across a dear old friend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"669d03e67a947c0f108ddb5fd97e7f0da7db11c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/669d03e67a947c0f108ddb5fd97e7f0da7db11c9/0_90_6772_4064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Invigoratingly sharp’: black fungus salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Invigoratingly sharp’: black fungus salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesca Jones/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We had among our number the great Jeremy Pang, panellist on the world-beating BBC Radio 4 show <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01klvhq\" title=\"\">The Kitchen Cabinet</a></em> and host of his own terrific ITV show on <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/jeremy-pangs-asian-kitchen/10a2805\" title=\"\">Asian cookery</a>. He was able to guide us through the menu, but you really don’t need a Pang at your side. Just order anything that’s even slightly unfamiliar. It’s fair to say that Gigi took a shine to Jeremy, but in truth I think it’s just that we were a big table of enthusiastic eaters ready for everything she had to offer. And she offered the lot. To embellish the old line about Sinatra, it was Gigi Gao’s candy-coloured, garlanded, ribboned, sequined and tasselled world; we were just living in it. Is it really authentic? I don’t care. What matters is that it’s good.</p> <h2><strong>News bites</strong></h2> <p>Yorkshire-based Truefoods, which makes restaurant-quality stocks and sauces – I swear by their veal jus and so do many top-flight kitchens – has finally opened an online shop.

Afterward, the former two-division champion became overcome by emotion while still in the ring as he opened up about the debilitating anxiety and mental-health struggles he’s endured since that setback.</p> <p>“I did take a break going through mental things, things went dark, I went through anxiety, deep depression, just trying to be strong,” Garcia said, fighting through tears. “It was the pressure of life, being a good dad, just letting it out right now, because it was all stuck inside. It rained on me for a year and a half and the only way to do better was to fight again. I’m a fighter. If you battle anxiety and depression, you can get out of it, that’s what I did today. I fought.”</p> <p>Benavidez’s physical edges of nearly three inches in height and reach were even more apparent under the Barclays Center lights than at Friday’s weigh-in, but Garcia’s sure footwork left his opponent unable to exploit the advantages in the opening round. The Philadelphian continued to control the pace into the second and third frames, keeping his foe at bay with a steady diet of jabs to the body while easily sidestepping Benavidez’s lashing forays into the pocket.</p> <p>Feeling himself after closing the third with an exquisite four-punch combination, Garcia upped his activity and appeared in total command in the fourth and fifth as Benavidez’s already lagging work rate further dropped off and he began to show visible signs of frustration. Garcia pressed the issue with busy, dogged body work, using deft upper-body movement to make himself difficult to hit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce3dd426fbbebad6943a9e3100bfff1c7d411630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce3dd426fbbebad6943a9e3100bfff1c7d411630/0_0_3195_2130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danny Garcia v José Benavidez Jr\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny Garcia, left, landed nearly twice as many punches as José Benavidez Jr during their super welterweight fight on Saturday night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Hunger/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having built a comfortable lead on the scorecards as the fight entered its second half, Garcia began mixing in right hands upstairs with greater frequency, catching Benavidez flush with a crunching hook midway through the seventh that stopped him in his tracks.</p> <p>From there it was only a matter of whether Garcia, who struggled to carry his power up from junior welterweight to welterweight, could close the show with a knockout. The stoppage did not come, but not for lack of trying as Garcia poured on the punishment in the 12th round until the final bell.</p> <p>Compubox’s punch statistics lent numerical context to the one-way traffic. Garcia landed 223 of 746 punches (31.2%), including a career-high 153 body shots, compared to just 117 of 600 for Benavidez (19.5%).</p> <p>Benavidez, a one-time blue-chip prospect whose career trajectory was altered when he suffered a gunshot wound in his right leg while walking his dog near his Phoenix home in 2016, struggled with his mobility throughout the evening, but particularly over the final rounds when it was clear he needed to conjure something special to reverse the run of play but was reduced to a practically stationary target.</p> <p>The 30-year-old from Arizona entered Saturday’s bout having fought just once – a listless majority draw against the unheralded Francisco Emanuel Torres last year – since the lone previous defeat on his ledger against Terence Crawford in 2018. But he remained upbeat after the decision came down.</p> <p>“It’s tough, things don’t always go your way, they’re ups and downs,” said Benavidez, whose older brother, David, was a two-time super middleweight champion. “I try to be positive, like when the doctor said I would never walk again. I didn’t let that get to me. The only one that can stop me is me.”</p> <p>As he amassed a Hall of Fame resume during an electric run of wins over Lucas Matthysse, Amir Khan, Zab Judah and Érik Morales (twice) during a three-year reign at junior welterweight, Garcia was consistently underestimated because he was unexplainable. He was spectacular in no one facet, but hit hard with both hands, exquisite timing and could take a punch. Turns out that recipe can take you a long way.</p> <p>But after moving up to welterweight and outpointing Robert Guerrero for the vacant WBC belt in 2016, Garcia was unable to deliver a signature win against the division’s elite, coming up short in title fights against Keith Thurman, Shawn Porter and, finally, Spence.</p> <p>What that portends for his long-term outlook one division higher is anyone’s guess. But Garcia’s opening statement at 154lbs, coupled with his renewed presence of mind with respect to his wellbeing, make for a promising start even in a fight with no final victories.</p> <p>“I still battle some days,” he said. “I have dark days, but I try my best to stay positive. I feel good.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2022/jul/31/crime-writers-choose-their-favourite-thriller-fiction-nicci-french-val-mcdermid-anthony-horowitz","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T04:30:44Z","webTitle":"The joy of crime fiction: thriller writers on their favourite crime fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/31/crime-writers-choose-their-favourite-thriller-fiction-nicci-french-val-mcdermid-anthony-horowitz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/jul/31/crime-writers-choose-their-favourite-thriller-fiction-nicci-french-val-mcdermid-anthony-horowitz","fields":{"headline":"The joy of crime fiction: authors from Lee Child to Paula Hawkins pick their favourite books","trailText":"Val McDermid, Nicci French, Anthony Horowitz and more reveal what makes a great novel, celebrating writers including Patricia Highsmith, Donna Tartt and Dennis Lehane","byline":"","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"50aa0013bcd3e711755a8086c400175a9ee625d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50aa0013bcd3e711755a8086c400175a9ee625d5/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"Paula Hawkins\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Paula Hawkins</h2> <p><em>A</em><em>uthor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/08/the-girl-on-the-train-paula-hawkins-review-novel\">The Girl </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/08/the-girl-on-the-train-paula-hawkins-review-novel\">o</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/08/the-girl-on-the-train-paula-hawkins-review-novel\">n the Train</a></em></p> <p><strong>What makes a great thriller/crime novel?</strong><br>Memorable and compelling characters.

They deal with primal emotions, fears, longings. The things we try to hide, the feelings that bring us shame, the impulses we try to control, the guilt we can’t shake. In thrillers, it all spills over on to the page.

The people in the story have to be fully formed and real. The plot should be well paced, with breathless moments and moments where you can catch your breath.

In my experience, most of the brethren that face those challenges are labourers and they are very, very vulnerable to abuse.”</p> <p>In cases of rape, the pastor said, the person would contact the church first, which would then coordinate with the embassy to arrange a way to escape.</p> <p>“They have this special rescue team that communicates to get out of the building at a certain time and the car would be waiting for her,” the pastor said. “Obviously, in order for her to be able to trust this process, it needs to be arranged through someone who she actually knows – usually, that’s a church.”</p> <p>Due to secrecy around conversion in the Gulf, the exact number of Christians in the region is not possible to ascertain, but church leaders and researchers agree there are significant numbers of migrant workers converting in Gulf countries. While they are expressly forbidden from proselytising to Muslims, it is understood that some Islamic workers choose to be “born again”.</p> <p>In Qatar, home to <a href=\"https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/qatar-population-of-migrant-workers-swells-to-21-million-ahead-of-2022-fifa-world-cup/\">2.1 million migrant workers</a> who make up about 75% of the population, Google Maps lists scores of Pentecostal churches. Yet, as with other Gulf nations, many churches choose to remain as underground “house” churches for fear that conditions may change.</p> <p>At one such house church, which tells only trusted people its location via a WhatsApp dropped pin and a compound door left slightly ajar, the sisterhood is working overtime. On a hot Friday morning, a women’s apostle network explained how they had tried to look after rape victims.</p> <p>“If an unmarried woman shows up [pregnant] in hospital, they will look for her marriage contract. If she can’t show anything, she is reported to the police and put in jail – and they’ll take her children,” said one of the group’s leaders, who asked to be called Sister Mary.</p> <p>“Let’s just say that some churches have helped to hide the kids from the police. The pastor’s wife will look after them and she will try to get out while her tummy is still small. But you can’t hide kids for long.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>For some, converting to this fundamentalist form of Christianity marks their arrival as a global citizen and causes them to turn on their past. Pastor Luke, who has been working in one of the less strict Gulf states since 1991, is focused on converting people from Hinduism.</p> <p>“In our church, we’re seeing several people taking water baptisms each month and definitely more people are coming here than ever,” he said.</p> <p>Referring to adherents of his former faith as “idol worshippers”, he said people who converted tended to get their lives together – they settled down and got married, had children, and got promotions at work.</p> <p>“People come from India and Pakistan to increase the status of their family, but they arrive at the labour camps and they’re so crowded, and there’s so much drinking and smoking,” he said.</p> <p>“No one tells them that when they get here they often find more problems than they left behind.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/jul/30/archie-roach-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T03:45:48Z","webTitle":"Archie Roach obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/30/archie-roach-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/jul/30/archie-roach-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Archie Roach obituary","trailText":"Celebrated performer whose songs, including Took the Children Away, revealed the suffering of Australia’s stolen generations","byline":"Robin Denselow","body":"<p>Archie Roach, who has died aged 66, was an Indigenous Australian singer-songwriter, guitarist and writer, whose most famous song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aywDT6yHMmo\" title=\"\">Took the Children Away</a>, described his own painful life story – and in the process helped to educate Australians about one of the darkest chapters in their history. It won him two Aria awards (Australia’s equivalent of a Grammy) and an International Human Rights Achievement award, and established him as one of Australia’s most distinctive and celebrated performers, who would tour alongside Bob Dylan, Billy Bragg and Patti Smith.</p> \n<p>He was one of the stolen generations of Aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their families by government agencies<strong> </strong>for almost a hundred years, under protection era laws and policies. Aboriginal children were placed in homes and orphanages, or brought up by white foster families. The aim was that they should be assimilated into the white community, reject their heritage and language, and adopt white culture instead. Through his songs and later his powerful 2019 memoir Tell Me Why, Roach revealed the suffering that these policies inflicted on Aboriginal families for generations.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/30/archie-roach-australian-singer-songwriter-and-campaigner-dies-aged-66\">Archie Roach, Australian songman and voice of the stolen generations dies aged 66</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Born in Mooroopna, north Victoria, and brought up in <br>Framlingham mission near Warrnambool, in south-west Victoria, he was taken from his parents, Nellie Austin and Archie Roach Sr, at the age of “three or four”, along with his two sisters, and raised in Melbourne by a white family, Alex and Dulcie Cox, who had moved to Australia from Scotland. They were told that his parents had died in a house fire and were, he said, “blameless, as far as I’m concerned. They were used.”</p> \n<p>Growing up as a member of the Cox family, Roach listened to his foster father’s record collection, which included albums by the Ink Spots, Nat King Cole and Mahalia Jackson. He went to church, and here he heard a woman playing a Hank Williams song on the guitar. Roach decided that he too would become a guitarist.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff5ae80a-c0c7-4298-9f95-5176e62af6df\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1bdsM-mh40?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His life changed dramatically when he was 15, when he received a letter from a blood sister, Myrtle, then living in Sydney, whom he had never heard of until then. She told him that his real mother, Nellie, had just died, and that he was one of seven siblings. A few months later he left home in a quest to track them down, taking his guitar with him.</p> \n<p>He was lucky to survive. It took time for him to find his sister, and as he explained in his memoir, he spent years as an alcoholic, drinking in the parks and “empties” (the vacant buildings) of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. He suffered from epilepsy, spent time in hospital and in prison, charged with vagrancy, and attempted suicide, after a failed bid to dry out. But at 17, at a Salvation Army centre in Adelaide, he met another homeless Indigenous Australian teenager with a similar history to his own, who would change his life.</p> \n<p>Ruby Hunter was another child of the stolen generations, and also a musician. They married, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/16/archie-roach-on-meeting-loving-and-losing-ruby-hunter-she-had-this-glint-in-her-eye\">and became inseparable partners</a>, but, as the mother of his two children, Hunter threatened to leave unless he stopped drinking. “It turned my life around,” he said.</p> \n<p>Roach began working in a homeless shelter while also concentrating on music and songwriting. He wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/13/archie-roachs-took-the-children-away-how-one-heartbreaking-song-galvanised-a-nation\">Took the Children Away</a> after being encouraged by an uncle to write about his own experiences.

It was at first greeted by silence, said Roach, “and then the clapping started. It sounded like rain that starts with a pitter-patter and builds up and becomes a downpour. It was the most amazing experience I had ever had.”</p> \n<p>Soon afterwards, Roach was offered a recording contract. His first solo album, Charcoal Lane (1990), was produced by Kelly and Steve Connolly, and won Aria awards for best new talent and best Indigenous album. It included Took the Children Away and a powerful song written by Hunter, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZPhwEwXEdw\" title=\"\">Down City Streets</a>, which described her time as a homeless alcoholic. This brought her to national attention, and four years later she recorded her own solo album.</p> \n<p>Roach went on to record a series of solo albums, including Jamu Dreaming (1993) and Looking for Butter Boy (1997), and provided the soundtrack for the film The Tracker in 2002. In 2008 he sang Took the Children Away, with Hunter joining him on backing vocals, when the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, gave a public apology to the stolen generations<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p>Roach and Hunter also performed with the Black Arm Band, a political multimedia project involving white and Indigenous performers, who made a powerful appearance at the British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jul/27/womad-festival-review\" title=\"\">Womad festival in 2009</a>.

Predictably, there was another incident this weekend, with fresh allegations that a spectator racially abused Carlton defender Adam Saad on Saturday night.</p> <p>The simplistic slogan partly reflects the widespread ignorance of what racism is, how it functions and the ways in which it appears. But, as a microcosm of Australian society, it is also reflective of the AFL and its clubs, who maintain an unflinching emphasis on growing the game at significant moral and ethical cost.</p> <p>Racism has oxygenated the game and over the generations enabled it to grow. At this juncture, the only apparent evolution is that verbal and online abuse – the low-hanging fruit that is easily understood – is supposedly no longer tolerated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/21/former-afl-player-archie-smith-theres-actually-strength-in-being-vulnerable\">Former AFL player Archie Smith: ‘There’s actually strength in being vulnerable’ | Emma Kemp</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Without a shred of self-awareness, the Dockers have stood in solidarity with Walters and Frederick under the backdrop of a long-standing partnership with Woodside, Australia’s largest independent dedicated oil and gas company.</p> <p>Woodside’s proposed Burrup Hub LNG expansion is threatening Murujuga, a priceless cultural treasure on Western Australia’s Burrup Peninsula which archives more than 50,000 years of human ingenuity. Living within the lands, seas and skies, Murujuga holds the Lore, Dreaming and Songlines that have connected and sustained the region’s First Nations people since the first sunrise.</p> <p>If there really was “no room for racism”, then Fremantle would not be in partnership with Woodside.</p> <p>Nor would the West Coast Eagles and AFLW be in partnership with BHP, another multinational that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/11/bhp-to-destroy-at-least-40-aboriginal-sites-up-to-15000-years-old-to-expand-pilbara-mine\">destroys ancient Aboriginal cultural heritage</a> and has <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/aboriginal-group-says-miners-gag-092649105.html?guccounter=1\">exercised gag clauses</a> that render Traditional Owners unable to lodge objections or to prevent their sacred sites from being damaged.</p> <p>Port Adelaide wouldn’t be in partnership with Santos, whose offshore Barossa Project – <a href=\"https://www.ecnt.org.au/territorians_say_no_to_the_barossa\">described</a> by gas economist Bruce Robertson as a “carbon dioxide factory with an LNG by-product” and by Richie Merzian of the Australia Institute as “one of the dirtiest gas fields in Australia” – is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/07/tiwi-islanders-challenge-offshore-drilling-saying-santos-did-not-consult-them\">subject of legal action</a> by Traditional Owners from the Tiwi Islands who are seeking to stop the development. </p> <p>Not even the homelands that have birthed the Rioli football dynasty of Maurice, Cyril, Daniel, Dean, Willie and Maurice Jr, who as a collective have brought more joy to the game than any other family, is off limits.</p> <p>If there was “no room for racism”, then the league would not be so closely connected to Telstra, considering the telecommunications company was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/13/teltra-fined-50m-for-exploiting-indigenous-mobile-phone-plan-customers\">recently ordered to pay $50m in penalties</a> after admitting it took advantage of vulnerable Indigenous customers by signing them up to mobile phone contracts they did not understand or could afford.</p> <p>The AFL would not be in partnership with Coles, which has energetically promoted its Liquorland stores in the Northern Territory against the wishes of many Indigenous organisations, which represent communities with the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the country. </p> <p>Because fairness, justice and proportionality is defined and measured by those who don’t bear the brunt of racism, bigotry at an individual and institutional level is often met with a slap on the wrist and red-carpet ride into another prominent role within the industry. Like clockwork, the “no room for racism” crowd chants “stop living in the past, everyone makes mistakes, it’s time to move on”, just in time for the merry-go-round to complete another lap, only to then be propelled forward by more of the same stuff.</p> <p>The “no room for racism” crowd, many of whom have paternalistically positioned themselves as the knowers and tellers, also refuse to acknowledge the structural role that wealth, whiteness and the private school system plays for prospective draftees – who year after year, continue to dominate the draft.</p> <p>Just over a quarter – 25.6% – of players drafted to AFL clubs in 2017 came from the 11 schools who make up the Associated Public Schools of Victoria, which also supplied four of the first five picked. These 11 schools – Melbourne Grammar, Scotch College, Geelong Grammar, Xavier College, Wesley College, St Kevin’s College, Haileybury College, Caulfield Grammar, Brighton Grammar, Geelong College and Carey Grammar – <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/how-private-schools-have-taken-over-the-afl-20191121-p53cso.html\">are seen as “cradles of the country’s owners and decision-makers”</a>. </p> <p>Despite the outsized contributions Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander players make to the game, there is a silence surrounding the fact that Indigenous coaches make up <a href=\"https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/news/indigenous-sport-month-nathan-lovettmurray-on-nicky-winmar-photo-influence/news-story/868a382a81012ae8eaecc2d37ced7888\">1.5% of AFL coaches</a>, with Barry Cable and Polly Farmer the only two Indigenous head coaches in VFL/AFL history.</p> <p>As the old saying goes, a problem well stated is a problem half solved. For the AFL and its clubs, there are two prongs to the problem. The first is an ignorance of power brokers whose ascension and tenure depend on maintaining the status quo; and the second is a surrender to capitalist imperatives that define anything other than growth as a loss.</p> <p>Of course, the problem isn’t intractable.

The 28-year-old was born into swimming royalty: her father, Ron McKeon, is a former Olympian and four-time Commonwealth Games champion in middle-distance freestyle, while mum Susie McKeon and uncle Rob Woodhouse also swam for Australia. For decades the McKeon family have operated a swimming school in the Illawarra, and McKeon junior was in the water before she could walk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/false-news-kyle-chalmers-rubbishes-reports-of-rift-with-mckeon-simpson\">‘False news’: Kyle Chalmers rubbishes reports of rift with McKeon, Simpson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But McKeon’s glittering career – three days into the 2022 Commonwealth Games she is on the brink of all-time greatness – was almost over before it began. A decade ago, at 17, McKeon was a rising star. At the 2012 national championships in Adelaide, which doubled as the trial event for the London Olympics, McKeon was hopeful of qualifying for the women’s 4x100m freestyle relay.</p> <p>Yet on that evening at the South Australian Aquatics Centre, McKeon hit the wall in seventh place in the women’s 100m freestyle. Her time, 54.35 seconds, was one-tenth of a second off Alicia Coutts in sixth. Teams can take six swimmers for the Olympic relay, to allow rotation between the heats and finals. Coutts went to London and McKeon missed out (agonisingly, her semi-final time would have been enough).</p> <p>At the 2012 Olympics, Australia’s women won the 4x100m gold medal. McKeon was poolside – she had travelled to London to watch her brother, David McKeon, race for Australia, together with their training partner, Jarrod Poort. But while McKeon cheered them on, she was also on the verge of quitting the sport.</p> <p>“I was really upset after [missing out on London], and then I actually stopped swimming not long after the trials,” <a href=\"https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/emma-mckeon-and-the-story-behind-australias-most-underrated-star/\">she told Swimming Magazine</a> last year. “I knew I wanted to go to the Olympics, but I didn’t want to wait another four years, so I was like, ‘I’ll just stop.’”</p> <p>McKeon almost walked away. Her decision to stay has been a gift to the sport and her nation ever since.</p> <p>Twelve months later, the medal rush began – fittingly enough, in the 4x100m relay at the world championships. It was a silver, the Australians beaten by the United States, but that colour would change soon enough. McKeon dominated the 2014 Commonwealth Games: four golds (one individual and three in the relays) and two bronze medals. She was then a standout in the pool at an otherwise disappointing 2016 Olympics for Australia, winning gold, two silver medals and a bronze. More success followed in 2018, at the home Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast: four gold medals and two bronze.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8299375f5e17fe11ca463941915c535471ed5e19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8299375f5e17fe11ca463941915c535471ed5e19/0_0_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma McKeon (left) won her 10th Commonwealth Games gold medal with the women's 4x100m freestyle relay team on day two in Birmingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma McKeon (left) won her 10th Commonwealth Games gold medal with the women's 4x100m freestyle relay team on day two in Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By this point McKeon had established herself as one of the world’s best short-distance swimmers, a weapon at distances from 50m to 200m. She is a prodigious workhorse, usually swimming the most events of the Australian team at any given meet. Her versatility is impressive: while McKeon is the undisputed freestyle queen, her butterfly is world class, too. And ever since the 2013 world championships, McKeon has been the lynchpin of Australia’s relay success.</p> <p>But perhaps because of her quiet, understated nature, McKeon’s triumphs had not been fully appreciated by the wider public. Australian swimming already has a pantheon of greats in the likes of Dawn Fraser, Shane Gould, Ian Thorpe, Susie O’Neill, Leisel Jones, Grant Hackett and Kieren Perkins. McKeon’s achievements were putting her up there with the best, but she continued to swim under the radar.</p> <p>That began to change a year ago in Tokyo. McKeon’s four golds and three bronze medals made her the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/02/magnificent-mckeon-headlines-historic-day-for-australia-in-tokyo\">most successful Australian at a single Olympics</a>. Just one other woman in history has won seven medals at the one Olympics, and only two men have won eight. There was no longer any doubting that McKeon belonged at the top table of Australia’s best ever.</p> <p>And so, once again, almost a decade on but in vastly different circumstances, McKeon considered whether to hang up her googles. “She had three months out of the water, we just didn’t know what she was going to do,” her coach, Michael Bohl, told reporters in Birmingham <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/30/australian-rivals-thrash-out-a-thriller-in-200m-as-emma-mckeon-chases-more-games-history\">earlier this week</a>. McKeon, Bohl said, had finished her public health degree and “had to make a decision whether she would choose that path of work or whether she still had competitive ambitions in the pool.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/jessica-stenson-wins-marathon-as-australias-commonwealth-games-gold-rush-continues\">Jessica Stenson wins marathon as Australia’s Commonwealth Games gold rush continues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the second time in her life, McKeon opted to stick with the pool and continue that lifelong love affair. On Friday, despite the extended break and having missed the recent world championships, McKeon reprised her Tokyo form to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/30/swimmers-dominant-as-australia-get-off-to-golden-start-at-commonwealth-games\">anchor Australia to gold</a> in the 4x100m mixed freestyle relay. It was her ninth Commonwealth Games gold.</p> <p>On Saturday it was more of the same, with gold in the women’s 4x100m freestyle relay and silver in the 100m butterfly. McKeon is now level with O’Neill, Jones and Thorpe as the only Australians to have won 10 Commonwealth Games gold medals. In the days ahead, she will top that record – with six events to come, it is inconceivable that McKeon will not finish the meet as Australia’s most decorated Commonwealth Games athlete.</p> <p>McKeon is now firmly established as one of Australia’s greatest swimmers. She is – given her longevity, versatility and stamina – perhaps the nation’s best-ever female swimmer. She is already Australia’s most decorated Olympian to date, with 11 medals including five gold, the latter of which is only Thorpe is equal.</p> <p>And she’s not done yet. On Friday, after her first success of what promises to be a bountiful Birmingham campaign, the Australian swimming legend made clear she will not contemplate retirement for a third time just yet. “I haven’t raced in a long time, it’s getting back into the swing of it and I’m treating it as the first stepping stone back again on the way to Paris.”</p> <p>If McKeon keeps up this form at the 2024 Games, she will become – without any shadow of a doubt – Australia’s greatest Olympian of all time.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/31/i-thought-i-had-gotten-over-the-discrimination-i-faced-in-australias-newsrooms","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T01:00:40Z","webTitle":"I thought I had gotten over the discrimination I faced in Australia’s newsrooms | Karishma Luthria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/i-thought-i-had-gotten-over-the-discrimination-i-faced-in-australias-newsrooms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/i-thought-i-had-gotten-over-the-discrimination-i-faced-in-australias-newsrooms","fields":{"headline":"I thought I had gotten over the discrimination I faced in Australia’s newsrooms","trailText":"Watching Michelle Law’s Top Coat reinforced the prejudices I have faced, being overlooked because of my ethnicity and nationality","byline":"Karishma Luthria","body":"<p>When I walked into the Sydney Theatre Company’s Wharf 1 theatre to see Michelle Law’s production Top Coat, I was expecting to watch an entertaining retelling of how dire the situation in Australia’s news and media is for people of colour. What I was <em>not</em> expecting, but perhaps should have been, was how personally affected I would be by it.</p> <p>As a young woman of colour in the media I have faced discrimination in Australian newsrooms and I thought I was resilient. But Top Coat left me with a lot of questions, mainly personal ones: how am I not healed from the prejudice I experienced in various jobs in Australia’s white, male-dominated media industry?</p> <p>First, a bit about the show. Top Coat is Law’s STC debut and centres around two characters — Winnie (Kimie Tsukakoshi) and Kate (Amber McMahon). Winnie works at a nail salon that Kate visits between her very demanding schedule as a TV executive “girlboss” at a multicultural broadcaster. One evening, just before Winnie is closing shop for the day, Kate comes in asking for her chipped nail to be fixed – Winnie begrudgingly obliges. The two complain about the barriers they face in work and life and utter the same sentence: “I wish I were in your shoes.” A Freaky Friday situation takes place and they swap bodies. Now Winnie has to go to Kate’s TV job and face her boss Barry and entitled boyfriend Jeremy (John Batchelor) while Kate has to tirelessly give out manicures and pedicures for hardly any money.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/06/top-coat-review-race-swap-comedy-struggles-to-balance-jokes-with-lessons\">Top Coat review – race swap comedy struggles to balance jokes with lessons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since seeing the production, I’ve spent much time mulling it over, as well as my own negative experiences in the media, ones that I thought I had gotten over. But seeing similar experiences play out on stage gave them a fresh sense of reality, and more affirmation that I didn’t just make up the prejudice I’d faced in my head.</p> <p>I came to Australia to study journalism as an international student in 2016. A highly unorthodox career choice for someone like me – an Indian with parents who just wanted me to have a stable career in something like business or law. Even convincing them to let me study journalism was a hard task. There was a lot of arguing and a lot of, “yes, print may be dying but everything is moving online, Pappa!”. So I knew I had to make my time in Australia worth it – worth their investment, and worth my future.</p> <p>I have worked in multiple newsrooms, first as an intern and freelancer, and eventually a full-time employee – a prized possession for anyone in the media industry, let alone for an international student.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"weekend app\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&link=true&link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Each experience prepared me for the prejudice I would face in the next.

So I put my head down and did stories instead.

Lucky to get unpaid internships with broadcasters and news organisations. Lucky to get to certain stages of an interview process when many times I got an immediate rejection because of my visa. Lucky to be able to get a full-time job and be able to experience the stability and security that so many of my Australian citizen classmates at uni got to experience as soon as they graduated. Lucky to get a spot at the table, rather than to be seen as just another international student who has been unable to make it in the arts in Australia.</p> <p>But at some point, you have to look beyond luck and look at reality – Australian newsrooms and media organisations <a href=\"https://www.meaa.org/mediaroom/australian-media-must-do-better-on-diversity/\">have a problem with race</a>. They use people of colour for our connections to our communities, as Law’s play demonstrated with First Nations character Marcus (Matty Mills). They use us to get certain “sensitive” stories about our communities over the line. They also use us for their often celebrated diversity statistics. We are also often the newsroom’s reserve forces – casuals or part-timers who are called upon when the full-time white reporters and producers are burned out, on holiday in Europe, or taking annual leave.</p> <p>Let me be clear – I don’t have a problem with my white colleagues. I have a problem with the predominantly white agenda-setters at the top who allow this problem to happen. People who think they are progressive because they hire a token diverse person or they fit certain categories that mean they have faced prejudice in their life. And while I empathise with the barriers they have faced, they will never know what it’s like to be overlooked because of the colour of your skin, the texture of your hair, the accent you have and the nationality on your passport.</p> <p>Australia’s media industry needs a radical racial overhaul.

The Twitter account of Russia’s embassy in the UK called for Azov’s fighters to be executed by hanging rather than firing squad as “they are not real soldiers”. The statement has been criticised by commentators in the UK.</p> <p>It is impossible for the Guardian to verify the versions put forward by either side.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/wallaceme/status/1553120113808871425\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We should expel the Russian ambassador - the embassy is openly using the house room granted in the UK to advocate yet more war crimes. <a href=\"https://t.co/S0iWjM0Wc8\">pic.twitter.com/S0iWjM0Wc8</a></p>&mdash; Mark Wallace (@wallaceme) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wallaceme/status/1553120113808871425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 29, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Ukraine’s western partners appear to be on its side.

In a statement, its defence ministry said it was acting “in the interests of conducting an objective investigation” into what it called an attack on the jail earlier in the week.</p> <p>Nesterenko could not be sure her husband was safe as she had not heard from him since he left Azovstal, with matters complicated by the fact that Russia has refused to confirm his status in the prison.</p> <p>She said he was one the first to come out of Azovstal but the ICRC was not yet present. Since then, she said, she had completed the necessary ICRC forms and the Ukrainian side have confirmed he is a prisoner in Olenivka but Russia has not.</p> <p>“I know he’s a prisoner in Olenivka because I’ve periodically seen him in different photographs and videos of the cafeteria and in lineups,” said Nesterenko. “All [our] guys are almost unrecognisable, they look exhausted, thin, pale and their skin has gone some sort of yellow colour.”</p> <p>Though some of the families believed their loved ones had survived, others were nervously awaiting news from the responsible Ukrainian authorities, she said.</p> <p>“Three of us haven’t heard anything (from the Ukrainian authorities) so we assume they are fine, another girl’s husband was wounded and then there’s another whose husband was in the barrack that was hit but she has not heard anything,” said Nesterenko.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Under the Geneva convention they are allowed a phone call every two weeks, this has not happened,” said Nesterenko.</p> <p>She said work towards a prisoner exchange had seemed to have stalled since 144 heavily wounded fighters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/29/ukraine-announces-largest-exchange-of-prisoners-of-war-since-russia-invaded\">were exchanged</a> in June.</p> <p>Relatives of Ukrainian PoWs from Azovstal called on the world to recognise Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism “which violates the rules of warfare and does not comply with the Geneva conventions”.</p> <p>The statement further called on the ICRC and the UN, as guarantors of the Azovstal surrender, to travel to the prison to investigate what happened, check on the wounded and facilitate the transfer of bodies.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
