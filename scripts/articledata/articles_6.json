This serious underrepresentation of women is a huge problem, and we must recognise and dismantle the barriers that are standing in the way of women pursuing these subjects.<br><br>“The UK’s tech job market is projected to be worth £30bn by 2025 - six times larger than it is now. But as things stand, there will only be one qualified woman for every 115 roles by 2025. That means women are not benefiting from the salary and career opportunities afforded by the tech industry, and the tech industry does not have the access to candidates it needs to fill its growing skills gap.<br><br>“It is clear schools, universities and businesses need to do much more to support women into tech, at every stage of the pipeline.

As part of the Ofqual transition period back to pre-pandemic grades, AS, A-level and vocational and technical qualification results received today will be higher than in 2019 in recognition of the disruption students experienced during their exam years.</p> <p>Exams were taken with support and adaptions in place, including advance information of topics for A levels, and longer assessment windows for vocational and technical qualifications.</p> <p>Grades will be lower than 2021, when exams did not go ahead and grades were determined by teachers, as schools and colleges remained closed to most pupils until March. 36% of entries for A-levels are at grade A or above in the UK – up from 25% in 2019, and down from 45% in 2021, reflecting the target set out last autumn.<br><br>The education secretary, James Cleverly, said: “I want to congratulate students getting their results today and say a big thank you to the teachers who helped them get to this point.

Over the next few weeks our admissions teams will be working hard to place as many young people at our universities as possible, while making sure every student can receive the world class teaching and learning experience they rightly expect. As is the case every year, some courses will be more competitive than others, particularly those where numbers are capped by government like medicine and dentistry.</p> <p>“We would encourage students who miss out on their grades not to panic.

They wanted a chance to prove themselves. Students were full of praise for teachers and staff in their schools and colleges who had helped them prepare but they spoke of wanting that rite of passage to earn their results in their own right. It was therefore really gratifying to see that exams and assessments took place.”</p> <p>Noting that the exams “went smoothly” this year, she said that “because the same rules apply to everyone, exams and formal assessments are the best way to measure what students know, understand and can do”, enabling consistency across schools and assessments.</p> <p>An “unprecedented package of support” had been put in place to help students who hadn’t had the chance to take public exams before and who have experienced disruption to their learning, she said.</p> <p>This included changes to course work, advanced information in February about topics that would appear in exams to make them “less daunting” and help focus revision, and changed timetables to enable at least a 10-day gap between the first and last exams in a subject to reduce the risk of illness impacting results. “Students told me they preferred the timetable like this,” she noted.</p> <p>“We want to get back to pre-pandemic standards as we all take steps to get back to normality but it was important to me as chief regulator to balance our objectives of maintaining standards with promoting public confidence in exams and qualifications. In the interests’ of this year’s students we didn’t want to do it in one go.

As a strong conservative, she seems unlikely to attract significant Democratic or independent support.</p> \n<p>Hageman, an attorney, once opposed Trump herself but came round to win his endorsement.

bought almost 5m shares in the struggling US homeware retailer at less than $5.50 a share in July for a total outlay of about $25m.</p> <p>After an almost 500% increase in the shares, sparked <a

Its emphasis may have tilted this way and that as artistic directors have come and gone, but the basic ethos of bringing together top-quality performers and composers to work with students and amateur musicians in concerts and classes in a relaxed, informal atmosphere has remained.</p> <p>Dartington’s current artistic director is <a href=\"https://www.mohrpietsch.com/\">Sara Mohr-Pietsch</a>, whose tenure began two years ago. Covid forced the cancellation of her first summer school in 2020, and also severely compromised plans for 2021, but this year it has all been able to run as she envisaged, with a different emphasis in each of its four weeks. Contemporary music was very much to the fore in the final week, with the soprano <a href=\"https://www.julietfraser.co.uk/\">Juliet Fraser</a>, pianist <a href=\"http://www.rolfhind.com/\">Rolf Hind</a>, the Montreal-based <a href=\"https://quatuorbozzini.ca/en\">Quatuor Bozzini</a> and the composer <a href=\"http://www.foxedition.co.uk/\">Christopher Fox</a> all in residence to work with young composers and performers, and to give public concerts.</p> <p>Hind’s solo recital began with his own Bhutani, a set of eight studies composed during lockdown in 2020. Each carries the Sanskrit name of an animal – bird, wolf, fish, bee, and so on – and the piano writing not only exploits different aspects of technique, but also different timbral effects that Hind drew from his piano with the help of electronics; they are mostly pithy, immediate pieces, just a couple are a little overlong. He followed his pieces with <a href=\"http://www.claudevivier.com/\">Claude Vivier’s</a> Shiraz, with its echoes of Stockhausen and <a href=\"https://www.oliviermessiaen.org/\">Messiaen</a>, and finally some genuine Messiaen, Le Loriot (The Golden Oriole) from Catalogue d’Oiseaux, both played with tremendous intensity and dash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b30c178d22ab0baa7d9929dbc55902d6f2d9702\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b30c178d22ab0baa7d9929dbc55902d6f2d9702/327_774_2314_2890/801.jpg\" alt=\"Rolf Hind in rehearsal at Dartington\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pithy… Rolf Hind in rehearsal at Dartington</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Mount</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fraser and the Bozzinis gave two concerts together, fascinating, carefully programmed amalgams of old and new. In the first, two works by <a href=\"https://cassandramiller.wordpress.com/\">Cassandra Miller</a> were interleaved with well-known quartet movements: her brief, gentle Leaving was paired with the variations from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/30/schubert-where-to-start-with-his-music\">Schubert’s</a> Death and the Maiden Quartet, while the haunting Thanksong, receiving its first live performance, followed the Heiliger Dankgesang from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/01/know-the-score-beethoven-where-to-start-with-his-music-250th-anniversary\">Beethoven’s</a> A minor Quartet Op 132, taking up the opening phrases of Beethoven’s hymn to create four independent string parts, together with a vocal line that Fraser threaded delicately between the repeating phrases.</p> <p>The starting point for their second collaboration was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/arnold-schoenberg\">Schoenberg’s</a> second string quartet, for which Fox had composed a companion piece, The Air Is Just Desire. The quartet is famous as the work in which Schoenberg abandoned tonality for the first time, setting poems by Stefan George in the final two movements, and it’s often thought that the trajectory of the quartet reflected the turmoil in Schoenberg’s life at that time, when his first wife Mathilde left him for the portrait painter <a href=\"http://www.richardgerstl.com/\">Richard Gerstl</a>.</p> <p>With a text by Kate Wakeling, Fox’s work reflects on the breakup from Mathilde’s point of view, opening with descriptions of Gerstl’s paintings of the Schoenberg family, incorporating extracts from Mathilde’s letters to her husband, and finally echoing phrases from the George poems used in Schoenberg’s quartet. Fraser speaks the texts at first, only gradually introducing sung phrases as the piece gathers in intensity. Her lines become more expressive and the supporting string writing more febrile, until by the end she soars defiantly; it’s direct, and powerfully moving.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/french-fire-service-official-death-threats-covid-vaccine-stance","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T11:48:57Z","webTitle":"French fire service official tells of death threats over Covid vaccine stance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/french-fire-service-official-death-threats-covid-vaccine-stance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/french-fire-service-official-death-threats-covid-vaccine-stance","fields":{"headline":"French fire service official tells of death threats over Covid vaccine stance","trailText":"Firefighters’ spokesperson Eric Brocardi has said those refusing jab should remain suspended from job","byline":"Kim Willsher in Paris","body":"<p>A French fire service official says he has received death threats and been harassed after calling for firefighters who have refused the Covid vaccine to remain suspended.</p> <p>France’s interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, condemned the alleged social media threats against Eric Brocardi, who has reported them to police.</p> <p>Cmdr Brocardi, who is spokesperson for France’s national federation of firefighters (FNSPF), came under attack after saying that in his view, full-time and voluntary firefighters suspended for refusing the vaccine should not be allowed to return to the service.</p> <p>France’s fire brigade is divided into two groups: big towns and cities have professional brigades that are part of the military, while the rest of the country has volunteer brigades. According to officials, fewer than 200 professional firefighters out of 41,800, and 5,000 out of 197,000 volunteers have rejected the vaccine and are under suspension.</p> <p>Critics accused Brocardi of being a “collaborator”, a “traitor” and a “Macron lackey”. Brocardi told Agence France-Presse a number of threats had been reported to police, who were investigating. Darmanin said the threats were “unacceptable … whatever anyone’s opinion”.</p> <p>The question of whether the unvaccinated firefighters should be allowed to return to work came under scrutiny after France’s fire services said they were understaffed and struggling to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/12/eu-countries-rush-to-help-france-tackle-monstrous-wildfires\">deal with widespread fires</a> caused by the summer heatwave and drought.</p> <p>In an interview at the end of July, Brocardi told Marianne magazine that understaffing had been a serious problem well before the Covid crisis and would still be a problem even if all suspended staff were allowed back to work.</p> <p>“We need massive recruitment and to make people want to become volunteer firefighters. We’d have the same problems if these firefighters returned to work tomorrow,” he said. He repeated his opposition to their re-employment in the service on French television earlier this week, resulting in more abuse.</p> <p>The FNSPF also made a police complaint after the threats, said the organisation’s president, Grégory Allione.</p> <p>In France, official figures suggest just more than 92% of the adult population have been vaccinated against Covid, but vaccine hesitancy persists among those who have refused the jab.</p> <p>In Toulouse, the authorities have demanded anti-vaccine posters be taken down from private hoardings around the southern city. The posters, claiming the vaccination is dangerous, were paid for by the <a href=\"https://www.tf1info.fr/societe/le-collectif-reinfocovid-avec-louis-fouche-et-christian-perronne-d-ou-viennent-ces-affiches-publicitaires-antivax-visibles-a-toulouse-2229584.html\">RéinfoCovid collective</a> and are signed off by the organisation’s “independent scientific committee”.</p> <p>ReinfoCovid was set up as a citizens’ association in 2020 to oppose Covid-linked health restrictions imposed by the French government.

Arriving by coach from the then Yugoslavia, my Guardian was confiscated at the border, and my fashionably long hair was cut by the border hairdresser. (The newspaper was returned on our exit.) Our excursions included a visit to the Mao Tse-tung copper wire factory. Although we didn’t see any cinemas showing Norman Wisdom films, an open air theatre was playing Hitchcock’s Rebecca.

But the subjects I took aren’t much help to me now. I took English and drama, which helped with confidence,” she says. “But they’re not as useful as you think they’re going to be.”</p> <p>Landers, 25, soon found her calling in construction. “I did a painting and decorating qualification. That got me thinking about getting a house one day. I thought it would be easier if I could do all the maintenance work myself.”</p> <p>Then her training provider, <a href=\"https://b4box.co.uk/\">B4Box</a>, offered her the opportunity to take a course in retrofit. “I’m obsessed with recycling and biodiversity and stuff like that,” she says. “I’m always bringing in my WWF Living Planet reports to the workplace. It’s just the way I was brought up. It was drilled into us as kids.”</p> <p>Landers is retrofitting a redbrick, semi-detached house in suburban Stockport, Greater Manchester, with a team of builders from B4Box. From the outside the house is unassuming, on an ordinary council estate. Step inside, however, and the building has been gutted. The plaster is gone, with brickwork and wiring exposed. The sounds of hammering and drilling echo around, as builders in hi-vis workwear install insulation and block up the chimney.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97c2716fdba6c9aded6a0848c45df2b3bba9b62e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97c2716fdba6c9aded6a0848c45df2b3bba9b62e/0_505_8192_4915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A house in Stockport being retrofitted by B4Box.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A house in Stockport being retrofitted by B4Box.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Measures such as loft and external wall insulation, draught-proofing doors, and swapping double-glazed windows for triple-glazed will all help prevent the property leaking heat. “Every conceivable crevice is completely sealed,” Landers says. B4Box has even installed a switching monitoring system that reads humidity levels and feeds them back to the tenant to prevent damp.</p> <p>Buildings are among the biggest contributors to greenhouse gases. Figures released by the <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sector-summary-Buildings.pdf\">Climate Change Committee</a> (CCC), which advises the government on climate policies, show they contributed 17% of UK emissions in 2019, third only to energy generation and transport.</p> <p>Retrofit could also be a vital tool in alleviating the cost of living crisis. Household energy bills are expected to reach more than £3,300 a year this winter and more than <a href=\"https://www.nea.org.uk/news/8-2-million-uk-households-could-be-in-fuel-poverty-from-october/?parent=about-us/media-centre/media/\">8m UK households</a> face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/fuel-poverty\">fuel poverty</a>, so cutting energy demand could be crucial. “The cheapest energy is the energy we don’t consume,” says Chaitanya Kumar, the head of environment and green transitions at the New Economics Foundation thinktank. “We know that on average retrofit could cut household energy demand by about a quarter. A 25% reduction on a £3,000 bill is a chunky saving.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff7ba1e38fd0998da60a562de26da56e40d49eb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff7ba1e38fd0998da60a562de26da56e40d49eb3/0_549_8192_4915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A B4Box employee retrofits a house in Stockport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Retrofit could be a vital tool in alleviating the cost of living crisis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, rather than ramping up retrofit to address the climate and energy crises, successive Tory governments have <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/money/bills/nine-million-energy-bills-rise-170-green-home-grants-scrapped-1418228\">slashed</a> support for it, reducing uptake from 2.3m insulation installations in 2012 to 72,000 in 2021. The retrofit schemes the government has launched have been deemed inadequate, with a parliamentary public accounts committee last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/01/uk-green-homes-scheme-was-slam-dunk-fail-says-public-accounts-committee\">condemning</a> its flagship green homes grant scheme a “slam dunk fail”. The CCC, in its progress report this year, also <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/2022-progress-report-to-parliament/#key-messages\">criticised</a> the government for a policy gap on domestic retrofit.</p> <p>Decarbonising housing stock is a huge logistical challenge. The UK Green Building Council <a href=\"https://www.renewableenergyinstaller.co.uk/2020/10/the-uk-requires-a-retrofit-army-to-meet-net-zero-target/\">estimates</a> that to achieve net zero carbon by 2050 Britain will need to retrofit almost all of its 29m homes, working out as more than 1.8 homes every minute.</p> <p>Another significant barrier is that retrofit is perceived as being <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/288378234.pdf\">disruptive</a> for householders due to the building work involved.</p> <p>But B4Box may have found a solution. Its trainees study multiple trades (as “multis”) rather than specialising in one, meaning they can carry out general repairs and maintenance to brickwork, paint, plaster, woodwork and other elements of existing buildings.</p> <p>B4Box, which was recently <a href=\"https://ashden.org/news/2022-ashden-award-finalists-announced/\">nominated</a> for a low carbon skills award, could offer a model for scaling up retrofit, says Mark Cox, a B4Box site manager. “When you take a property apart, like you’re doing a deep retrofit, you’ll be doing a lot of the intrusive work like insulating the walls, which multis can do. And when you’ve completed the retrofit, the way the property comes back together – the plastering, joinery, painting and decorating – a multi can do that.”</p> <p>Jamie Hough, 38, had been unemployed for 18 months before joining B4Box in 2010. He now trains the multis and thinks multi-skill construction makes building more cost-effective and time efficient. “Other companies will send five different tradesmen in five different vans to the same job. We’ll send one van with three people in it who will do the same work that those five people will do.”</p> <p>Rather than performing one task on a project, trainees will also see it through from start to finish, which Hough believes improves the quality of the building work. “Plasterers can be messy. They can make hard work for you sometimes. But if you’re doing the plastering and the next step you want to be as neat as you can. The same with the joinery. You want to get it as neat as you can because you’re going to be painting it afterwards.”</p> <p>Training multis could also address the lack of skilled workers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/18/uk-government-failing-to-help-local-leaders-achieve-net-zero\">UK100</a>, a cross-party network for locally elected leaders in the UK who have pledged to switch to 100% clean energy by 2050, estimates the country needs 455,076 full-time construction jobs. “Even if you pumped hundreds of billions of pounds right now, there isn’t enough capacity in the system to soak it up,” Kumar says. “You still have a lag between investing £1m today and seeing the result of it because the skill supply is so short at the moment.”</p> <p>For Aileen McDonnell, who set up B4Box in 2008 and sits on the Greater Manchester mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham\">Andy Burnham’s</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/aug/18/retrofitting-why-carbon-reducing-renovations-are-going-to-be-big-business\"> retrofit taskforce</a>, this labour shortage is an opportunity to give local people meaningful employment. “I grew up in Wythenshawe [a working-class area of Manchester]. I had a university grant, the state paid for me to study. That was a good investment in me that doesn’t happen any more. It’s about finding people like Jamie – and there are thousands of them.”</p> <p>B4Box trainees include people disadvantaged in the labour market such as women, older workers, people with disabilities, the long-term unemployed and ex-offenders. It has trained 1,400 people in Greater Manchester since 2008 and 80% of its current operatives live in Stockport.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49faf5f0529e883d8f66e62ab5b4ebcc33d1aa6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49faf5f0529e883d8f66e62ab5b4ebcc33d1aa6f/943_952_7247_4348/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aileen McDonnell of B4Box\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aileen McDonnell of B4Box: ‘I had a university grant, the state paid for me to study.

The lack of on-site experience means many fail to qualify, causing a skills supply shortage compounded by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ddd9b7e-781c-477e-87b2-d4fd283362da\">exodus</a> of eastern European construction workers since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/18/im-fully-booked-but-cant-take-on-jobs-a-builder-on-life-without-eu-workers\">Brexit</a>.</p> <p>For Roy Cavanagh, a former training and apprenticeships executive at Seddon Construction and former chair of the Construction Industry Training Board’s Construction Skills Network for the north of England, the B4Box model shows the possibility of tackling the climate crisis while at the same time investing in workers. “B4Box doesn’t treat people like commodities,” he says. “They treat them like people.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/environment_2022\">Tell us what you think about the Guardian’s climate reporting – it takes just 2 minutes</a></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2022/aug/18/a-level-joy-for-sixth-formers-in-wales-after-difficult-few-years","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T11:08:06Z","webTitle":"A-level joy for sixth formers in Wales after ‘difficult few years’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/a-level-joy-for-sixth-formers-in-wales-after-difficult-few-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2022/aug/18/a-level-joy-for-sixth-formers-in-wales-after-difficult-few-years","fields":{"headline":"A-level joy for sixth formers in Wales after ‘difficult few years’","trailText":"At the Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen school in Caernarfon, all 56 students achieve results they need – despite Covid disruption","byline":"Steven Morris","body":"<p>There were lots of tears but they were largely the good, joyful, relieved ones for sixth formers at <a href=\"https://www.ysgolsyrhughowen.org/\">Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen</a>, a secondary school in the town of Caernarfon, north Wales.</p> <p>Despite two years of studies being disrupted by the Covid pandemic meaning precious little real-life experience of actually taking an exam, all 56 pupils achieved the results they needed for the places they aspired to.</p> <p>“It’s been a bit hectic, to say the least,” said Catrin Lloyd, who opened her envelope in the school hall under a bunting of Welsh flags to find she had three A*s.

The UK government has indicated it will provide replacement funding through its own research and innovation scheme, but it is not yet fully clear if it will match all the terms of the ERC programmes – the prestige, the flexibility, the connections.

I know some others <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02120-0\">made the difficult decision</a> to leave the country and take up their work in Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/uk-border-privilege-low-ranking-passport-brexit-international-travel\">Only a country as complacent as the UK could give up its border privilege so easily | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this issue is far bigger than just our work, or that of the other researchers affected. Scientists can do incredible and innovative work that benefits wider society, but they need stability and support. This recent debacle contributes to science in the UK seeming more uncertain and uninviting. The UK was previously very good at attracting young and talented students and fellows, as well as older researchers and professors. This was good for the economy, and for the social and intellectual life of the country.</p> <p>But I sense this is changing. The UK is now not an attractive place. I know far fewer EU-based researchers have chosen to move their work and funding here in recent years. If the politics don’t change, I expect this will continue. I know many people here have taken up a very British attitude, thinking they will simply manage. Some have told me things will be fine because I will have my grant money replaced, or as an established researcher I can get another grant. But that isn’t the point. I worry about the position of UK science in the world, and what will happen in the future for younger scientists.</p> <p>I do love this country. I came here from Europe in 2013 and I have stayed. I am grateful to do my work here, and I have always felt welcome. In fact, I’ve never really felt like an immigrant. But I worry about someone making the same decision today. Things are far less certain.</p> <ul> <li><p>José R Penadés is professor of microbiology at Imperial College London and the director of the MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/18/wanted-middle-eastern-dips-that-arent-hummus","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T11:00:45Z","webTitle":"Middle Eastern dips that aren’t hummus | Kitchen aide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/18/wanted-middle-eastern-dips-that-arent-hummus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/18/wanted-middle-eastern-dips-that-arent-hummus","fields":{"headline":"Wanted: Middle Eastern dips that aren’t hummus","trailText":"Think charred or roasted mashed spiced veg, or yoghurt laced with lemon and garlic …","byline":"Anna Berrill","body":"<p><strong>I always make my own hummus, but what other Middle Eastern dips should I try?<br></strong><em><strong>Jo, Merseyside</strong></em></p> <p>“The whole idea of dips and meze is that you can use whatever you have in the fridge,” says Eran Tibi, chef-owner of <a href=\"https://balabaya.co.uk/\">Bala Baya</a> in south London. And a good template to have in your arsenal is Tibi’s “bonfire veg dip”. Start by charring your preferred veg (tomato, garlic and chilli in Tibi’s case) over a flame until “mushy”. Once cool, “roughly chop [skin on], then put in a bowl with fresh coriander or oregano, a bit of lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, salt and pepper.” Mix and you’ll have “the most luxurious, smoky, delicious dip to go with grilled meat, fish or bread”.</p> <p>Bread won’t be lonely with fried <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/sep/25/how-to-make-perfect-baba-ganoush\">baba ganoush</a></em>, either. Reem Kassis, in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-palestinian-table-9780714874968\">The Palestine Table</a>, fries small cubes of aubergine (that have been salted, rested and rinsed) in vegetable oil until golden, then, once cool, adds tahini, yoghurt, lemon juice, crushed garlic and salt. Mix with a fork, “breaking up any large pieces or lumps as you go”, and sprinkle with parsley and chopped tomatoes or pomegranate.</p> <p>Alternatively, try <em>tershi</em>. “It’s a Libyan-Jewish dip consisting of pumpkin, potatoes and a toasted spice mix,” says chef Oded Oren, whose cookbook, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/oren-9781784884437\">Oren: A Personal Collection of Recipes and Stories from Tel Aviv</a>, is out in September. He roasts pumpkin wedges with olive oil, cooks potatoes, then mashes the lot together. “Toast and grind caraway and coriander seeds, then add sweet and spicy paprika and a little olive oil.” Once combined, toss the spice mix into the pumpkin/potatoes, and serve cold.</p> <p>“Lemon and artichoke is a favourite flavour combination of mine,” writes Salma Hage in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-mezze-cookbook-9780714876856\">The Mezze Cookbook</a>. And to speed things up, she uses the jarred variety (“preserved in oil, rather than brine”), which she blends with parsley, tahini, olive oil, lemon zest and juice, and garlic. You want to add just enough water so it “starts to look fluffier”, then season. Another lucky dip is <em>peynir ezmesi</em>, made with grated tulum (Turkish goat’s milk cheese). In <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-turkish-cookbook-9780714878157\">The Turkish Cookbook</a>, Musa Dağdeviren pounds this into a paste with stale, crustless bread (which has been soaked, drained, and squeezed), then adds sliced onion, parsley, garlic and walnuts, and pounds again. He finishes things off with hot paprika, dried dill and oregano, plus a drizzle of olive oil. Easy-cheesy.</p> <p>Don’t dismiss hummus completely, though, Jo. You could, for example, add beetroot or carrots to your chickpeas, or swap the latter for butter beans or, as Tibi recommends, sweet potato. He bakes a whole one until it’s “really, really soft”, then, when it’s cool enough to handle, he scoops out the middle and whips it with tahini, maple syrup, lemon juice, salt and pepper. “If you put a good heap of dukkah, ras el hanout or chilli flakes on top, it’s mesmerising.”</p> <p>Alternatively, if yoghurt is on rotation in your kitchen, courgettes are a good companion. “Cut them into quarters, dress with olive oil, salt and pepper, then char on all sides in a cast-iron griddle pan,” says Daniel Alt, head chef at <a href=\"https://www.thebarbarynextdoor.co.uk/\">The Barbary Next Door</a> in London – make sure they still have some crunch, mind. “Chop the courgettes with garlic, add mint for freshness, lemon juice, a little chopped fresh chilli or chilli flakes, and turmeric, so the whole thing turns yellow.” Mix into thick yoghurt and eat with “everything on the grill”.</p> <p>Another big dipper is labneh (strained yoghurt), which Oren suggests loosening with cucumber to make a sort of tzatziki. “I don’t use herbs – just garlic, lemon juice and salt.” The other option is to serve your labneh straight and concentrate on the topping instead. Right now, Alt is all about “burnt” aubergines: “Scoop out the meat and chop with chilli and garlic, then add olive oil, lemon juice, and season with salt.” Pile on to labneh and scatter over some chopped parsley. Pitta or flatbread would make fine accompaniments or, for “a guilty pleasure”, chips: “If you go to the beach in Israel, you can order French fries, labneh, pitta and a cold beer. It’s the perfect lunch.”</p> <p>• Got a culinary dilemma?

He who pays the piper should feed them properly too","byline":"Jay Rayner","body":"<p>The online world can be a scary place. For me, one of the internet’s most dismaying corners is a members-only forum on Facebook called Bandwiches. It’s a portmanteau word, the crashing together of “band” and “sandwiches”, coined by the saxophonist Stan Harrison after a particularly dismal experience. It celebrates or, to be more exact, bemoans the grim quality of so much of the food offered to musicians on gigs in UK hospitality settings. Here are numerous shots of terrible, cold mini sausage rolls the colour of yesterday’s porridge. There’s a meagre plate of biscuits alongside some orange juice with a handwritten note saying: “Out of date. Help yourself at your own peril.” There are polystyrene boxes filled with a tiny number of indeterminate deep-fried things. And, of course, lots and lots of terrible, floppy sandwiches made with the pappiest of pappy white bread. It’s all so damn beige. And the portions! So small!</p> <p>This could be dismissed as the nichest of niche problems. Then again, the Bandwiches Facebook group has 4,300 members. That’s a significant slab of the UK’s gigging musicians. And even if it is a side issue, it’s <em>my</em> side issue. I am both a jazz musician and a journalist who writes about food. If I don’t complain about this, who the hell will? People in the hospitality industry do their jobs around meal times. For many years the meals offered both to waiters and kitchen staff was a major issue. Too many restaurants simply didn’t seem to care. Happily, that is generally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/nov/14/you-cant-run-a-team-on-empty-how-the-restaurant-staff-meal-is-changing\" title=\"\">no longer the case</a> (although there are still exceptions). Musicians, the ones who work in bars and restaurants, hotels and events such as weddings, are too often the forgotten hospitality workers.</p> <p>There are good stories. Let’s hear it for the Pig Hotel and the magnificent spread they laid on recently for the Jools Holland Big Band. I know from experience that dedicated London music venues such as Brasserie Zedel, Boisdale and Ronnie Scott’s look after their performers. But there are so many other truly lousy stories. The worst offenders are often at the very top end. A pianist pal recently played a four-hour solo piano wedding gig at one of the most garlanded and expensive hotel restaurants in the country. (I wish I could name and shame, but lawyers get twitchy.) His lunch: a single, clingfilm-wrapped sandwich.</p> <p>Another musician posted an image of an empty table at a significant London restaurant world event. They’d offered him precisely nothing. Then there are the horror stories from weddings, especially if you have the audacity to be, say, a non-meat eater. At best it can be a case of: you can have a go at the buffet but only once everyone else has finished at 11pm. As one musician put it: “We cost less than the flowers, but we’re the thing your guests will remember. Show us a little respect.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/30/what-happened-when-jeff-goldblum-met-jay-rayner-interview\">When Jay Rayner met Jeff Goldblum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We’ve all heard of the gig economy, with the implied issues of chronic job insecurity.

Hence, I’m complaining for them. Please god, let’s abandon bandwiches. Away with the beige. Offer a hot meal. In short, if you are booking musicians for an event don’t forget to feed the piper. And the guitarist. And the pianist and the rest. They are there to bring your guests significant pleasure; don’t make their lives a misery. After all, it’s called the hospitality business. That means being hospitable to everyone. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/18/aitch-close-to-home-review-100000-manc-album-not-just-for-the-lynx-lads","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T11:00:44Z","webTitle":"Aitch: Close to Home review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/18/aitch-close-to-home-review-100000-manc-album-not-just-for-the-lynx-lads","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/18/aitch-close-to-home-review-100000-manc-album-not-just-for-the-lynx-lads","fields":{"headline":"Aitch: Close to Home review – ‘100,000% Manc album’ not just for the Lynx lads","trailText":"Referencing the Stone Roses and featuring Shaun Ryder, the Manchester rapper’s debut album stops short of a second coming – but it pushes his musical boundaries and subverts traditional hip-hop narratives","byline":"Alexis Petridis","body":"<p>At the time of writing, the face of Harrison Armstrong – better known as Aitch – stares down from bus shelters around Britain advertising Lynx deodorant. You can snigger at this development if you like – it’s hardly Jay-Z endorsing luxury Swiss watches – but it’s worth noting that not every multi-platinum US rapper deals exclusively in high-end products: as well as promoting Balenciaga, Megan Thee Stallion recently recorded a track shilling Cheetos, the American equivalent of becoming the glamorous face of Wotsits. Moreover, it tells you something about the spread of UK rap and the position Armstrong currently occupies in British youth culture: there was a time, before Skepta and Stormzy, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/15/a-funny-accent-draws-bare-attention-how-regional-rappers-stormed-the-charts\">a rapper with a Mancunian accent would have got no further than a tiny local label</a>.

A rumoured collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/liam-gallagher\">Liam Gallagher</a> is nowhere to be seen, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shaun-ryder\">Shaun Ryder</a>’s voice booms out between tracks (as does that of Aitch’s dad, calling him “a knobhead” for failing to provide receipts for his expenses). His song 1989 samples the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stone-roses\">Stone Roses</a>’ Fools Gold and pays homage to Madchester’s annus mirabilis in its title, if not its lyrics. The special edition vinyl cover is by Matt Carroll of Central Station Design, the company best known for designing the Happy Mondays’ album sleeves, who has been quick to place Aitch in a lineage of “great wordsmiths from Manchester’s past” – including not just Ryder, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/john-cooper-clarke\">John Cooper Clarke</a>. Those comparisons are pushing it a bit. (And perhaps not helped by his team accidentally destroying a beloved local Ian Curtis mural.) You could just about make a case for a similarity between Aitch’s nasal delivery and that of Cooper Clarke, though there’s none of Ryder’s drugged-out surrealism about his lyrical approach. But Aitch’s lyrics are definitely at their most striking when they abandon the standard-issue stuff about trapping in the bandos to root themselves in his home town, whether hymning family ties on R Kid or mistily recalling a youth spent “smoking in the alley and buying singles from a shabby gaff”. “Back then I had to Rusholme if you grew up in Moston,” he recalls in a neat bit of wordplay on Money Habits.</p> <p>While Aitch is reliably dispiriting and cliched on the subject of sex (he’s going to “put that pussy to sleep”, she’s “getting nasty in the ride”, etc), presumably that’s the kind of thing the Lynx Epic Fresh massive want to hear. In fairness, he’s pretty sharp on other topics, not least the title track’s exploration of the tension between his roots and success, the push and pull between his love of home (“I got Manny in my core”) and the belief that “at this point, staying local’s just a big mistake”. Flipping the standard hip-hop narrative of complaining that fame makes everyone around you treat you differently, he suggests that it’s actually him that’s changed, not the folks back in Moston.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GWw2p_X6Lg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3GWw2p_X6Lg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Aitch: 1989 – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The production, meanwhile, leaps around all over the place, engaged in the act of covering bases with mixed results: trap-influenced beats on Bring It Back and Cheque, pop R&amp;B on Baby, a children’s choir on the title track. Complete with a guest appearance from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/26/bakar-nobodys-home-review-a-spectacularly-strong-sense-of-place\">Bakar</a>, the great In Disguise sounds not unlike Gorillaz, while My G features a turn from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran\">Ed Sheeran</a> at his most nondescript, redeemed by the evidently heartfelt and moving lyric addressed to Aitch’s younger sister, who has Down’s syndrome. The song 1989 was a noticeably smaller hit than Baby, with its sped-up Ashanti samples: perhaps a 33-year-old Stone Roses single is just too old, too locked in its original era, for a teenage audience. Certainly, it isn’t an indication of its quality: overlaying the old John Squire riff with Theme from Shaft horns and vocals that sound as though they’ve stepped off an old rave track. In purely musical terms it might be the album’s best track, although the cut-up Spanish guitar of The Palm runs it close.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related:</span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/18/im-not-trying-to-be-anything-im-not-rapper-aitch-on-his-rise-to-the-top\">‘I’m not trying to be anything I’m not’: rapper Aitch on his rise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For all his success, at 22, you get the feeling that Aitch is still working out his identity, testing the water to see how far he can pull away from the standard UK rap template without alienating its core audience. The result is an album that’s alternately charming and cliched, that involves boilerplate beats and sparky musical invention. That said, nothing about it is going to turn off the teens that constitute Aitch’s fanbase. “I ain’t going anywhere,” he says at the album’s conclusion. He’s referring to Manchester, but it could just as easily be a reference to his current status.</p> <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong>flowerovlove – Get With You</strong><br>Perfectly turned, short but sweet alt-rock that avoids the cliches from a 16-year-old hailing from south London.</p> <p>• This review was amended on 19 August 2022.

The director had just started casting club acts in his dramas, bringing to the screen authentic local accents, a lack of self-consciousness and the performers’ ability to think on their feet – especially when not told what was going to happen in the story, a trick Loach used to trigger realism.</p> <p>Brown’s sister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/27/obituaries.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Lynne Perrie</a>, a cabaret singer and later Coronation Street star (as Ivy Tilsley), landed a leading role as Billy’s neglectful mother after Loach saw her on stage in Barnsley. Brown, recommended by a Leeds theatrical agency, was given the small part of a milkman from whom Billy steals eggs and milk.</p> <p>Loach, who regarded Brown as a good team player, always arriving with a smile and ready with an impromptu line, then cast him in three television plays, most prominently as the besuited assistant colliery manager in The Price of Coal (1977). Hines’s two-part story, set at a pit in the same landscape inhabited by Kes, starts with comedy, the cleaning up of the mine for a royal visit, and finishes with tragedy, an explosion killing two miners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74838787a6932055169c145b95fd7db8566cc73e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74838787a6932055169c145b95fd7db8566cc73e/0_72_2008_1205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duggie Brown, second from left, as Bernie, with, from left, Honor Blackman as Rula, Barbara Knox as Rita and Malcolm Hebden as Norris in a 2004 episode of Coronation Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duggie Brown, second from left, as Bernie, with, from left, Honor Blackman as Rula, Barbara Knox as Rita and Malcolm Hebden as Norris in a 2004 episode of Coronation Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brown also took the title role in The House That Jack Built (1977), a six-part serial written by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/21/shelagh-delaney\" title=\"\">Shelagh Delaney</a> charting 10 years of a marriage, with Sharon Duce playing his wife.

But forced motherhood is fine?","trailText":"The Florida court’s decision is shameful, nothing less than an ideological assault on a teenager","byline":"Jill Filipovic","body":"<p>A Florida court has held that a pregnant and parentless 16-year-old is not mature enough to have an abortion – but is, apparently, mature enough to raise a child after being forced into childbirth by the state.</p> <p>This case illustrates the utter absurdity and deep cruelty of parental consent laws, which are in place <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/parental-involvement-minors-abortions\">in 21 states</a>. While parental consent laws seem reasonable enough on their face – who wouldn’t want to know if their child was having an abortion? – they are in practice alternately duplicative or dangerous. If a parent is supportive of their child’s bodily autonomy and has raised that child into a thoughtful, mature teenager, that teenager will either feel comfortable telling their parents about an unplanned pregnancy, or will have the ability and wherewithal to make their own decision and get themselves to an abortion provider. If a parent is abusive or unsupportive of their child’s basic rights, why should the state put young people at risk by requiring that their parents be notified?</p> <p>The reality of abortion is that it essentially maintains the status quo. A teenager who ends her pregnancy does not risk her life in childbirth. She is able to continue her schooling or her work without interruption. She is able to remain on whatever path she was walking before her pregnancy, and she can pursue her goals and dreams on the schedule she had in mind.</p> <p>Making the decision to keep one’s life moving forward on the same path requires far less maturity than making the decision to become a parent – a decision the state does not interfere with, and for good reason. If the idea of a parent or a panel of judges forcing a teenage girl into an abortion against her will disgusts and outrages you, so should the idea of a parent or panel of judges forcing a girl to go through the much more dangerous, physically demanding and permanently life-altering process of giving birth and becoming a mother.</p> <p>While an abortion is a medical procedure, ending a pregnancy is overwhelmingly safe, and a woman is about <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abortion/abortion-safer-than-giving-birth-study-idUSTRE80M2BS20120123\">14 times more likely</a> to die of complications from childbirth than from complications from abortion. And yet the state – rightly – does not require pregnant teenagers to get their parents’ permission to carry to term, nor allow parents to force their children into abortions against their will.</p> <p>In the situation playing out in Florida, the teenager girl in question does not have parents in the picture. Her guardian is supportive of her choice to end her pregnancy. She has managed to get herself into court and before a panel of judges – that is how badly she does not want to be forced into continued pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood.</p> <p>And she is right that having a child before she’s ready could be devastating. She is reportedly working on obtaining her GED, but it’s infinitely more difficult to study when you’ve just given birth, or when you’re the sole caregiver for an infant. She lives with a guardian, but she will be a legal adult in less than two years’ time. The man or boy who impregnated her seems to have no intention of being involved; she has no parents to help her, and it sounds like very little in the way of a familial safety net. She is going to need money for diapers, wipes, baby accoutrements, food, transport, childcare and eventually a place to live for herself and a child. How is a single teenage mother without a high school education and no parental support, and who has been forced to endure the trauma of unwanted pregnancy and birth, going to adequately support herself, let alone a child, under these circumstances?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ansirh.org/research/ongoing/turnaway-study\">Researchers have found</a> that when women are denied abortions and forced instead to give birth, the results are dire. They are much more likely to remain in poverty than women who were able to end their pregnancies. They are more likely to be tethered to abusive men. They end up in worse health. Their children are worse off by many measures. And they are more likely to die.</p> <p>And these poor outcomes are only magnified when the people in question are teenagers. While <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/01/12/the-unreported-gender-gap-in-high-school-graduation-rates/\">nearly 90%</a> of American girls graduate from high school, only about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/index.htm\">50%</a> of teenage mothers do. While about <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/04/12/10-facts-about-todays-college-graduates/\">four in ten American</a> women have a bachelor’s degree, only about <a href=\"https://youth.gov/youth-topics/pregnancy-prevention/adverse-effects-teen-pregnancy\">one in 10 women</a> who gave birth as teenagers has finished at either a two- or four-year college.</p> <p>Pregnant adolescents are more likely than adult women to experience <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17978452\">a host of health- and life-threatening pregnancy complications</a>, including pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. They are more likely to go into labor early, and more likely to have a lower birthweight baby. Their babies are more likely to die. Their <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/index.htm\">children</a> also do worse in school, are less likely to graduate high school, are less likely to be employed in adulthood, are on average in poorer health, and are more likely to be placed in <a href=\"https://youth.gov/youth-topics/pregnancy-prevention/adverse-effects-teen-pregnancy\">foster care</a>.</p> <p>None of this needs to be a foregone conclusion, of course. States could invest much more heavily in healthcare and support for all families, and for low-income families and those led by single parents in particular. But <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/upshot/abortion-bans-states-social-services.html\">conservative anti-abortion states</a> overwhelmingly do not support pregnant women, children and families nearly as robustly as progressive pro-choice ones. Florida is the 46th worst-ranked state in the nation when it comes to the percentage of uninsured women; it’s the 29th worst in maternal mortality, 30th in infant mortality and 33rd in child poverty. It offers no paid leave for new mothers.</p> <p>Teenage girls and adult women alike, no matter how allegedly “immature”, are overwhelmingly capable of looking at their lives and deciding, “carrying this pregnancy to term would make things worse, and I don’t want to do it”. Being able to make that assessment is itself a sign of maturity – certainly much more so than deciding one is ready to care for a baby when one is not yet able to fully care for themselves.</p> <p>The Florida court’s decision is shameful, nothing less than an ideological assault on a teenager. She knows exactly what the stakes are here, and yet three adults who are strangers to her have decided to force her – a child they have deemed immature and incapable of making her own decisions – to become a mother, in charge not only of herself but of a vulnerable infant.</p> <p>Decisions like this one may very well drive young people to bypass the courts entirely and take matters into their own hands – a worse and potentially far more dangerous outcome. At the very least, this decision will curtail a teenager’s future, compromise her health, force her to suffer through one of the most painful processes human beings endure, threaten her life and the life of her child, and then charge her with the lifelong care of a new person.</p> <p>That’s a lot to put on a girl who allegedly isn’t mature enough to have a medical procedure utilized by one in four women worldwide. Not mature enough for an abortion, but mature enough for a child? It simply defies reason. And that is, perhaps, because it’s not about reason or maturity at all. It’s about control – and a court imposing its misogynist anti-abortion ideology on a teenager who came to them for help.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jill Filipovic is the author of the The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/18/mp-margaret-ferrier-pleads-guilty-to-breaching-covid-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T10:41:35Z","webTitle":"MP Margaret Ferrier pleads guilty to breaching Covid rules","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/mp-margaret-ferrier-pleads-guilty-to-breaching-covid-rules","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/mp-margaret-ferrier-pleads-guilty-to-breaching-covid-rules","fields":{"headline":"MP Margaret Ferrier pleads guilty to breaching Covid rules","trailText":"Prosecutors say former SNP politician made several journeys after being told to self-isolate in September 2020","byline":"Libby Brooks Scotland correspondent","body":"<p>The MP Margaret Ferrier has pleaded guilty to breaching Covid rules by travelling on a train between Scotland and London after being told to self-isolate in September 2020.</p> <p>At a hearing at Glasgow sheriff court on Thursday, Ferrier, 61, admitted she had culpably and recklessly exposed the public to the virus.</p> <p>The former Scottish National party politician, who now sits as an independent MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/01/snp-mp-margaret-ferrier-took-train-after-positive-covid-test\">suspended from her party</a> after the rule-breaking came to light in October 2020.</p> <p>She immediately referred herself to the police and to the parliamentary commissioner for standards.</p> <p>The charge stated she wilfully exposed people to “the risk of infection, illness and death”, travelling throughout Glasgow and the surrounding areas as well as making journeys to and from London, where she sat in the Commons.</p> <p>Sentencing has been deferred until next month to gather background reports.</p> <p>Ferrier spoke in the Commons on Monday 28 September while awaiting the results of a Covid test.

At least, that’s what Liz Cheney and a whole host of political pundits would have you believe.</p> <p>How else can you explain her suicidal mission to confront the all-powerful, almost-indicted former president who trashes the Espionage Act as easily as the constitution.</p> <p>Of course she stands for democracy, free and fair elections, and all the rest of that ballyhoo. But her resounding defeat in Tuesday’s primary in the near-empty state of Wyoming must mean Something More.</p> <p>So Liz Cheney is obviously, naturally, running for president. Or at least running to stop Trump becoming president. Or at the very, very least, running to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/us/politics/liz-cheney-concession-speech.html\">become</a> Abraham Lincoln.</p> <p>“The great and original champion of our party, Abraham Lincoln, was defeated in elections for the Senate and the house before he won the most important election of all,” Cheney <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?522338-1/rep-cheney-loses-wyoming-republican-primary-harriet-hageman\">said</a> in a concession speech that sounded more like the kickoff of a presidential campaign.</p> <p>“Lincoln ultimately prevailed. He saved our union and he defined our obligation as Americans for all of history.”</p> <p>Stirring stuff. But as campaign strategies go, Cheney’s path to the presidency is even less likely than Lincoln’s. Two years ago she won her Republican primary with 73% of her party, and the general election with 69% of the state. This week she failed to crack the 30% mark.</p> <p>Losing more than 40 points of support among your own voters in your home state does not represent a strong foundation for a national campaign.</p> <p>Yes, it’s true – to echo Ronald Reagan’s quip about the Democrats – that Liz Cheney did not leave the Republican party; the party left her.</p> <p>But the Fateful Tale of Liz Cheney is not about whether the Trumpist fever will ever break on the right wingnut fringe of American politics. It’s not a measure of whether Trump is stronger or weaker, closer to prison or the presidency.</p> <p>This story is about the animating nature of Trumpism: the lifeblood of the cult itself. It may have no principle or purpose, but it sure knows how to keep itself busy.</p> <p>In a traditional cult, public adoration of the iconic leader might be enough to keep the mob together. And yes there are plenty of grotesquely Trumpy memes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0tE6T-ecmg\">polluting</a> the internet.</p> <p>But this curiously pigmented icon represents a perpetual test for his loving fans and the elected officials who pander to them. Beyond the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/12/trump-affair-adult-film-star-stormy-daniels\">hush money</a> to porn stars, there is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/trump-papers-kim-love-letters-national-archives-mar-a-lago\">cozying up</a> to foreign dictators and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/12/fbi-search-trump-mar-a-lago-home-classified-nuclear-weapons-documents-report\">nuclear secrets</a> in his basement. Ideology and consistency are almost entirely absent.</p> <p>If you stand for nothing, what are your followers to stand behind?</p> <p>Trump is the least lawful lover of law and order. He is both <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/trump-in-1999-i-am-very-pro-choice-480297539914\">pro-choice</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/trump-abortion-supreme-court\">anti-abortion</a>, pro-<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-decries-outsourcing-family-brand-manufactured-abroad/story?id=37502012\">outsourcing</a> to China and anti-trade with China, a hawk against Iran and a dove towards Russia, an American nationalist who somehow marries foreigners and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/donald-ivana-trump-cemetery-golf-course-taxes\">buries them</a> on his golf course.</p> <p>This presents something of a challenge to the lickspittles who follow him. You can wait for the latest pronouncement and endorsement, but it’s hard to show your undying enthusiasm for such an unprincipled, unpredictable and untruthful man.</p> <p>That’s why every good cult of personality needs more than a test of loyalty. It desperately needs a good purge. It lives and breathes with the energy of the eternal hunt for the enemy within.</p> <p>Mussolini <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1942/08/14/archives/mussolini-purges-party-66000-stricken-from-fascist-roll-to-end.html\">purged</a> tens of thousands of Italians from his fascist party in the middle of the war for transgressions that ranged from refusing to join his militias to being only lukewarm in enthusiasm for the little man. Peron <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/07/26/84574372.html?pageNumber=18\">embarked</a> on a purge of his own party around the same time in Argentina, before his Peronist successors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/24/archives/peron-widens-purge-of-leftists-and-crackdown-on-guerrillas.html\">extended</a> the purge in their dirty war against leftists a few decades later.</p> <p>It’s not enough just to love the great leader. You need to demonstrate that love by finding your secret enemies and expunging them from the cult.</p> <p>That’s how a charlatan like Harriet Hageman can seek redemption in Wyoming. Just six years ago, Hageman was – like Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham and the rest of those principled, family values conservatives – disgusted by Donald Trump.</p> <p>She fought hard to stop his nomination, well after he had won the primary contests of 2016. The party would be weakened, she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/us/politics/harriet-hageman-liz-cheney-trump.html\">argued</a>, by “somebody who is racist and xenophobic”. Now she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HagemanforWY/status/1529571556984332288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">says</a> he is “the greatest president of my lifetime”.</p> <p>At this rate, there won’t be enough superlatives to shower on the DeSantis administration.</p> <p>It’s no coincidence that the power of the purge was a feature of Trump’s time in office. According to Jared Kushner’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/books/review-breaking-history-jared-kushner.html\">execrable</a> new memoir, Breaking History, he was forced to purge several figures in Trump’s inner circle of hell, including a couple of chiefs of staff, a few political strategists and a secretary of state.</p> <p>This is something of a travesty for the true Trumpists, such as Peter Navarro, a trade adviser whose grasp of rational thought is as shaky as his grasp of international economics. Navarro describes Kushner as the true rat in the kitchen, or as he <a href=\"https://amgreatness.com/2022/08/15/the-clown-prince-of-pennsylvania-avenue/\">puts it</a>, a “run-of-the-mill liberal New York Democrat with a worldview totally orthogonal to the president he was supposed to serve”.</p> <p>The great orthogonal irony of the purging of Liz Cheney is that this kind of sack-based ferret fight was perfected by one Dick Cheney during the previous Republican presidency. It was old man Cheney whose cabal of loyalists did so much to undermine the technocratic Republican establishment so that he could happily invade Iraq in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/02/13/cakewalk-in-iraq/cf09301c-c6c4-4f2e-8268-7c93017f5e93/\">cakewalk</a>. That was before they turned on one another for their sheer incompetence.</p> <p>Party purges are hard to sustain without a Stalinist grip on power. Instead they tend to consume themselves in the shape of a circular firing squad.</p> <p>Say what you like about Trump’s threat to democracy, but right now the purger-in-chief is <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/11/trump-evidence-fbi-search-00050990\">consumed</a> with uncovering the rat who told the world about his secret stash of nuclear secrets.</p> <p>It could have been the Secret Service. It could have been the domestic help. Or it could be someone even closer to Trump.</p> <p>One thing is clear: the purge that ended Liz Cheney must not stop in Wyoming. For the sake of our democracy, it needs to go all the way to Mar-a-Lago.</p> <p>People say there’s an old New York Democrat down there who doesn’t believe half the things that come out of his own mouth.</p> <ul> <li><p>Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/18/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-69","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T10:00:44Z","webTitle":"Witch trials, angels’ weight and Huw’s Bond cameo – take the Thursday quiz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/18/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-69","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/18/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-69","fields":{"headline":"Witch trials, angels’ weight and Huw’s Bond cameo – take the Thursday quiz","trailText":"Fifteen questions on general knowledge and topical trivia plus a few jokes every Thursday – how will you fare?","byline":"Martin Belam","body":"<p>The quiz master is away, but the moment has been prepared for.

The end result was Star Trek: The Motion Picture in 1979, now re-released in a 4K restoration, directed by veteran all-rounder Robert Wise with Douglas Trumbull on special effects. This is the “director’s edition”, first authorised by Wise in 2001: it brightens and clarifies the effects, enriches the sound mix, adds minor expository and ambient scenes and emphasises the unhurried visionary grandeur that Wise was aiming at.</p> <p>At the time of its original release, I was disconcerted by the Enterprise crew’s silly new uniforms: the men’s tunics are extended downwards at the waist to form an entirely ridiculous triangular flap over the crotch area. And living in the eternal TV present as I was, I was secretly shocked at how much older the main cast suddenly looked, everyone’s hair greyer and more precariously bouffant-ed. With this first movie, the Star Trek concept had evolved into something more ambitious and Kubrickian, with plenty of andante outer-space sequences and an entire pre-credit “overture”, just dark starry space to a muted orchestral theme. I missed the cartoony narrative snap of the TV show and the original signature tune, but the doors still go fshhhht-fshhhht and the dialogue scenes between Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy (DeForest Kelley) still have that wonderfully theatrical resonance and serio-comic panache, Shatner’s DRAMATIC way of SPEAKING, often-doing-a-one-breath-run-up-to-a-big-EMPHASIS is still a joy. It’s only now I can see that the relationship of Spock and Kirk has a Jeeves/Wooster drollery.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrXvBaFFu80\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zrXvBaFFu80?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The setting is 10 years on from the original show and Kirk, now an admiral, demands to be given command of the refitted USS Enterprise once again, because this is the only starship in a position to intercept a destructive alien cloud-formation with a hyper-evolved intelligence at its centre, heading for Planet Earth: a sinister entity that appears to call itself “V’Ger”. Kirk’s high-handedly pulling rank to assume command infuriates the existing captain, Decker (Stephen Collins), whose competence and loyalty Kirk nonetheless comes to respect.</p> <p>Kirk gets the old gang together for his new Enterprise jaunt, the most important of course being the stonefaced Spock, who – in an outrageously enjoyable and over-the-top scene – has had to abandon the “Kolinahr” ceremony on his home planet, in which he would renounce emotion for ever. But his human side would not permit it. There is also a new crew-member: Lieutenant Ilia from the Planet Delta IV, played by Indian star Persis Khambatta, a mysterious and elegant figure with a shaved head who once had a relationship with Decker on her home planet and it soon becomes clear that Decker is still deeply in love with her. (Deltans are said to be more attractive than other people and can only serve aboard Starfleet vessels if they have taken “oaths of celibacy” – a sexier thing can hardly be imagined.)</p> <p>All this is to have important consequences when a probe from V’Ger invades Ilia’s body, effectively making her its avatar, but with Ilia’s own memory and consciousness still intact somewhere within her. It’s a bit overextended but very watchable with flourishes of exotic invention: I was sorry that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/01/nichelle-nichols-groundbreaking-figure-black-women\">Nichelle Nichols</a>’s Uhura is not given greater prominence but I love the “giant’s causeway” of stepping stones leading from the Enterprise to the centre of the alien.</p> <p>• Star Trek: The Motion Picture is released on 19 August in UK cinemas, and is streaming on Paramount+ in Australia.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/18/china-convenient-historical-tales-taiwan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T10:00:43Z","webTitle":"Don’t believe China’s convenient historical tales.

Taiwan belongs to the Taiwanese","trailText":"There is much talk from Beijing about how the island has been part of China since time immemorial. The reality is more complicated, says journalist Brian Hioe","byline":"Brian Hioe","body":"<p>The American sinologist Lucian Pye <a href=\"https://www2.gwu.edu/~sigur/assets/docs/scap/SCAP1-Pye.pdf\">famously said</a> that China is a “civilisation pretending to be a nation-state”. But it is precisely the opposite: China is a modern nation-state that pretends to be an ancient civilisation – when it suits its expansionist ambitions.</p> <p>Nowhere is this clearer than it the way it talks about Taiwan, which it claims has been part of China since time immemorial.<strong> </strong>The government recently published a <a href=\"https://english.news.cn/20220810/df9d3b8702154b34bbf1d451b99bf64a/c.html\">white paper</a> – released in the context of unprecedented live-fire drills aimed at intimidating Taiwan after Nancy Pelosi’s visit – which begins by referencing the dispatching of troops to Taiwan by the Sui Dynasty (581–618). Chinese territorial claims over Taiwan often cite the history of the Ming dynasty warlord Koxinga, who made Taiwan his base of operations during his short-lived Kingdom of Tungning (1661-1683), or Taiwan’s formal incorporation into the Qing dynasty as a province in 1887.</p> <p>Yet references to dynastic Chinese history to justify contemporary territorial claims are spurious. After all, the Chinese Communist party, which rules over the People’s Republic, is precisely one of the historical forces that <em>overthrew</em> imperial China. And the CCP has never controlled Taiwan in its 75-year history. It is not as though a pre-modern polity simply sending troops to Taiwan means that an entirely different polity, 1,500 years later, has the right to control it. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/us-and-taiwan-to-hold-formal-talks-to-boost-trade-ties-amid-china-tensions\">US and Taiwan to hold formal talks to boost trade ties amid China tensions </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where Koxinga is concerned, while Chinese nationalists revere him as a historical figure seen as subjugating Taiwan for China, he was also half-Japanese. As a result, during Taiwan’s 50-year period under Japanese colonial rule, from 1895 to 1945 – another event that splits Taiwan’s history from that of the Chinese mainland – Koxinga was used to <a href=\"https://www.goteamjosh.com/blog/koxinga\">emphasise Japanese claims over Taiwan.</a> Lastly, Koxinga is remembered as <a href=\"https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/05/04/2003714536\">a genocidal Columbus-esque figure</a> by Taiwan’s indigenous people, who had settled the land and were its original inhabitants long before Han settlers arrived.</p> <p>Even during its incorporation under the Qing, China did not control all of the island of Taiwan, and it seemed uninterested in it as a territory. Hence it was ceded to the Japanese in 1895 after the Sino-Japanese war, <a href=\"https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2018/02/27/2003688328\">only a short eight years after its incorporation.</a></p> <p>One has to wonder why ancient, pre-modern history seems to trump the contemporary will of the Taiwanese people for self-determination, which is to say, the pragmatic position of maintaining Taiwan’s status quo of de facto independence. Polls released by <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/taiwan-china-politics-identity-independence-unification-public-opinion-polling-1724546\">National Chengchi University’s Election Study Center last month</a> found that more than 80% of the population prefer maintaining the democratic status quo in some form, while only 1.3% wanted immediate unification with China.</p> <p>While Beijing threatens force against the Taiwanese if they pursue independence – as seen in the China ambassador to the UK’s recent declaration that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/16/taiwan-uk-us-china-nancy-pelosi\">“‘Taiwan independence’ means war”</a> –<strong> </strong>it also militarily threatens Taiwan for simply seeking to maintain the democratic freedoms that it already has. </p> <p>China otherwise touts three communiques between the US and China on Taiwan in the 1970s and 1980s, or the 1992 consensus between the CCP and Taiwan’s ruling Kuomintang (KMT), as more historically recent rationales for its claims over Taiwan. Yet the US and China did not come to any agreement on Taiwan in the three communiques. <a href=\"https://www.ccpwatch.org/single-post/2017/12/29/one-china-multiple-interpretations\">And China frequently conflates</a> the US One China Policy, which <em>acknowledges</em> (but does not <em>recognise</em>) the PRC position that Taiwan is part of China, with its own One China Principle, which asserts that there is only one state that is China, which is the PRC, and that Taiwan is part of China. </p> <p>The 1992 consensus was the result of a meeting between the KMT and the Communist party on the mainland. Both parties agreed that there was “One China”, but the meaning of this term was interpreted differently.<strong> </strong>Moreover, non-KMT political parties <a href=\"https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/12/25/2003491835\">have long questioned whether </a>any agreement was actually made<strong> </strong>or was a post-facto fabrication – ultimately, this was not a decision negotiated by a democratically elected Taiwanese government. Rather it was negotiated solely by the KMT, which ruled over Taiwan for decades<strong> </strong>as a one-party dictatorship, before the first direct presidential elections in 1996.</p> <p>Nationalist renderings of history are always suspect – and the official Chinese line on Taiwan is no different. The Taiwanese have long sought pragmatic ways to maintain their democratic freedoms, without becoming entangled in a bloody war with China that would cost both Taiwanese and Chinese lives. So what is the way forward? Perhaps it begins with listening to Taiwanese voices about how they view their own history and the paths that they see to preserve political freedoms and avoid conflict – rather than heeding to views imposed from without on the basis of dubious history.</p> <ul> <li><p>Brian Hioe is one of the founding editors of New Bloom Magazine, an online magazine covering activism and youth politics in Taiwan and Asia Pacific</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is frequented by locals who queue to buy enormous tubs of homemade ice-creams, sorbets and tiramisu to take away, and by tourists who perch on the rickety red metal chairs. The standout ice-cream flavour, Saveur du Sud (clementine, fig, almond and honey), is to die for. The refreshing sorbets, including pink grapefruit and lemon, and artisan granitas are a perfect way to cool down after meandering around the cobbled streets of this historic town. <br><strong>Jenny Vickery</strong></p> \n<h2>Napoli nudge, Totnes, Devon</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2b256d92628bf270bc95f371a5a43e7e1e35bb9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2b256d92628bf270bc95f371a5a43e7e1e35bb9/0_0_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delphini’s Gelato Totnes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delphini’s</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“<em>Che buono</em>!

But a lesser known part of the speech was addressed to universities: “In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.”</p> <p>We didn’t listen.</p> <p>For the better part of the pandemic, I’ve been researching the defense industry’s ties to college campuses as part of an investigative fellowship for the magazine In These Times. On 11 August, we published a 4,300-word <a href=\"https://inthesetimes.com/article/lockheed-martin-recruiting-military-industrial-complex-student-debt\">feature article</a> on Lockheed Martin’s sweeping recruitment on college campuses.</p> <p>We found an environment in which Stem students are funneled into the defense industry through recruitment, research, financial assistance or some combination of the three.</p> <p>Lockheed offers cash-prize competitions, scholarships and paid internships to students which have served as pipelines to employment. In 2020, the company hired 2,600 interns and claimed over 60% of graduating former interns converted to full-time jobs.</p> <p>On campus, Lockheed has set up recruiting tables in the lobbies and hallways of student buildings and hosts workshops on everything from space exploration to résumé-building. At the University of Texas at Arlington, a $1.5m donation resulted in one of their buildings being <a href=\"https://news.cision.com/university-of-texas-at-arlington/r/lockheed-martin-donation-to-fuel-career-development-at-uta,c2220215\">renamed</a> the Lockheed Martin Career Development Center.</p> <p>But the company’s signature recruiting event, which is hosted at more than a dozen universities, is something called Lockheed Martin Day. Recruiters attract students with virtual reality demos, flight simulators and, in some cases, landing their helicopters directly on campus. Company officials have been known to offer on-the-spot job and internship opportunities to students during the event.</p> <p>Additionally, Lockheed has poured resources into the financial support and recruitment of students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), earning its place as the number one industry <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk00t0LYopPDmYKQpvAMYWZbITcCWdA%3A1604178888277&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=yNOdX8D3DdGxytMP7eGy8AE&amp;iflsig=AINFCbYAAAAAX53h2FfWBt1dE58La54NG0ru27nkMO5u&amp;q=lockheed+martin+number+1+hbcu+supporter&amp;btnK=Google+Search&amp;oq=how+to+get+smooth+painting+canvas&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIICCEQFhAdEB4yCAghEBYQHRAeOgQIIxAnOgUIABCRAjoLCC4QsQMQxwEQowI6CAgAELEDEIMBOgUIABCxAzoECC4QJzoECAAQQzoICAAQyQMQkQI6AggAOgUIABDJAzoLCAAQsQMQgwEQyQM6BwgAEMkDEA06BAgAEA06CQgAEMkDEBYQHjoGCAAQFhAeOgUIIRCgAVDBB1iWMWDSMmgBcAB4AYABtwGIAdcUkgEEMzEuM5gBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA-6eG4N_sAhXRmHIEHe2wDB4Q4dUDCAk&amp;uact=5\">supporter</a> of HBCU engineering institutions for seven years in a row.</p> <p>But before anyone says this is a good thing, it’s worth pausing to ask ourselves how we got here in the first place.</p> <p>When Black women hold the <a href=\"https://www.aauw.org/app/uploads/2021/05/Deeper_In_Debt_2021.pdf\">highest average</a> student loan debt ($41,466), it’s hard to argue against additional financial support no matter where it comes from. Unless you start with a more basic question: why do Black women graduate with the largest debt burden? Why are HBCU endowments, on average, 70% smaller than other universities?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why is $1.7tn for Lockheed’s F-35 fighter jet considered a worthwhile investment but $1.7tn in student debt relief considered a handout?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why is $1.7tn for Lockheed’s F-35 fighter jet considered a worthwhile investment but $1.7tn in student debt relief considered a handout?</p> <p>The answer boils down to what priorities we set as a nation and the investments we are willing to make based on those priorities.</p> <p>Last year, the Biden-Harris administration <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/17/fact-sheet-the-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administrations-historic-investments-and-support-for-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/\">announced</a> an unprecedented $5.8bn investment for HBCUs. By comparison, the administration has <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/1-billion-in-new-u-s-military-assistance-for-ukraine/#:~:text=This%20package%20provides%20a%20significant,the%20beginning%20of%20this%20Administration.\">sent</a> nearly twice that figure in military assistance to Ukraine.</p> <p>This country reached a grim milestone in 2020. For the first time, government funding to Lockheed Martin <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2021/Profits%20of%20War_Hartung_Costs%20of%20War_Sept%2013%2C%202021.pdf\">exceeded</a> funding to the Department of Education. When a nation spends more on a single military contractor than the agency tasked with overseeing college financial assistance, Lockheed’s scholarships seem less like an act of charity and more like intentional policy choices.</p> <p>While Lockheed’s presence on college campuses goes back decades, its scholarship program was only launched in 2019. Following Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Lockheed made a <a href=\"https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/eo/documents/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act.pdf\">commitment</a> to invest $50m in Stem education enrichment programs and a Stem scholarship program over the next five years. Hundreds of millions of dollars more went to employee training and other education initiatives including tuition assistance for employees, research and development, and award money for competitions.</p> <p>Corporations will have saved millions in profits while <a href=\"https://budget.house.gov/publications/report/cbo-confirms-gop-tax-law-contributes-darkening-fiscal-future\">adding</a> nearly $2tn to the deficit over the next decade. At the same time, Republican officials in congress argued that universities, which have traditionally been tax-exempt, were hoarding their wealth and needed to pay up.</p> <p>The 2017 tax cuts included a provision to impose a 1.4% excise tax on the endowments of the wealthiest private universities in the country. One Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/07/01/feds-release-long-awaited-rules-college-endowment-tax/\">reporter</a> explained that “the revenue from the endowment tax will not be used to lower the cost of higher education but instead to offset corporate tax cuts”.</p> <p>If budgets are moral documents, what do ours say about us?</p> <p>By the air force’s own admission, the F-35 <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/02/23/the-us-air-force-just-admitted-the-f-35-stealth-fighter-has-failed/\">has been</a> a failure. What was supposed to be a lightweight, low-cost, multi-purpose fighter jet has, over the years, gotten heavier, more expensive and less effective. As the air force’s top general put it last year, “The F-35 is a Ferrari. You don’t drive a Ferrari to work every day, you only drive it on Sundays.”</p> <p>I’ll acknowledge that these policies have resulted in a complicated reality. Millions of people around the country, including students, now depend on exorbitant defense spending. According to a 2021 Bloomberg <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/can-anyone-slow-down-the-joint-strike-fighter\">report</a>, “nearly every US state has economic ties to the F-35, with 29 states counting on the project for $100m or more in economic activity.” A similar analogy can be drawn based on the defense research at universities that support students, professors and institutional budgets.</p> <p>But knowing that all of this work is underwritten by the federal government and funded by taxpayers, we could just as easily decide that investing in jobs that improve human lives is more important than investments in ending them.</p> <p>Lockheed’s presence on college campuses poses this question to us and underscores two competing visions for the university: a political and economic tool in service of the world as it is or an institution dedicated to advancing critical thinking and civic engagement for the world as it could be.</p> <p>Once the question has been asked, it’s up to us to decide whether we will continue to prioritize war profiteering over posterity.</p> <ul> <li><p>Indigo Olivier is a Reporter-Researcher at The New Republic</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/blog/2022/aug/18/arsenal-fast-start-planning-patience-mikel-arteta","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T10:00:43Z","webTitle":"Arsenal’s fast start is no accident: it is a reward for planning and patience | Karen Carney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/18/arsenal-fast-start-planning-patience-mikel-arteta","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/aug/18/arsenal-fast-start-planning-patience-mikel-arteta","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal’s fast start is no accident: it is a reward for planning and patience","trailText":"Fixture list may have been kind but Mikel Arteta has rebuilt the culture and the squad look ready for a return to the top level","byline":"Karen Carney","body":"<p>Mikel Arteta has been given the time required to shape a squad over two and a half years. Everyone wants a quick fix in football but sometimes changing a club’s strategy takes time and Arsenal could be about to reap the rewards. We are only two games into the new Premier League season so no one should get too carried away with six points against Crystal Palace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/arsenal-leicester-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">and Leicester</a> but the signs are promising. The victories have set the platform for a great start to the campaign, especially with winnable matches against Bournemouth, Fulham and Aston Villa before the month ends. If they get maximum points it will help build momentum and confidence, two incredibly important traits.</p> <p>Arsenal have had another successful window this summer, adding players with experience of winning the Premier League. Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko know what it is like to fight at the top of the league and can lead the team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/09/arteta-gives-gabriel-jesus-spotlight-to-transform-arsenals-upward-ambition\" title=\"\">to reach higher levels</a>. Managers always want to add winners to the dressing room, they’re resilient. Arteta signed two players he worked with previously at Manchester City; his methods are not identical to Pep Guardiola’s but they are of the same ilk so both will know what is wanted from them. It was a smooth transition for Zinchenko and Jesus and both wanted to play in this type of football environment.</p> <p>The technical director, Edu, must take credit for the work he has done in the market. When recruiting Jesus, he explained that he thought the striker had lost his spark and wanted to get it back at Arsenal – Jesus agreed with him. I like that interesting way of recruiting and the two goals against Leicester show it is already working.</p> <p>I was always told a manager should be given three transfer windows. I realise Arteta has had more than that but each has been used to carefully plot the squad’s make-up. Last summer the goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale was recruited to be the long-term No 1. Some people were surprised by the signing, especially considering he arrived following back-to-back relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5b8b27860fd8de0aa8ed561218adf0018ef8d2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5b8b27860fd8de0aa8ed561218adf0018ef8d2c/185_126_3482_2091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mikel Arteta and Martin Ødegaard (right)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mikel Arteta decided to make Martin Ødegaard (right) his captain during the summer, another decision that looks a good call.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But during the lockdown I went to watch a few games in which he played. I thought he was a breath of fresh air; his communication was something I had not heard before. He was providing information, knowledge and fine details to his backline. It wasn’t just a one-off, I went to a lot of games during that period and since and have not heard that much detail coming from a goalkeeper.</p> <p>I always feel the best defenders don’t have to defend because they are organised by the best goalkeepers, who should be coaches who can see everything and articulate it – it keeps them switched on. I think the confidence of being selected for the Euros has really helped him. Sometimes a player has to feel at home somewhere and he looks right at home at Arsenal.</p> <p>Martin Ødegaard is another player who was carefully selected by Arteta and he has been allowed to find his feet in England and settle in his role at Arsenal. The Norwegian was appointed captain over the summer at the age of 23. I always think it is a risk giving a creative player the armband but he is incredibly experienced for his age because of his time at Real Madrid and various loan spells and has already earned 43 caps for his country. Arteta obviously loves him and what he believes in. He has picked him for a reason.</p> <p>As pundits, fans and ex-players we often don’t know exactly what happens inside the club, but internally they know what he offers, whether it’s calmness, attitude, leadership, or all of the above. Arteta, a former captain himself, must have seen something in Ødegaard that made him captain material and so far it is working well. I enjoyed watching Arsenal in pre-season; I saw them against Chelsea and they impressed me with their patterns of play and fluidity, qualities they have carried in to the start of the season. I have enjoyed their resilient moments in the first two games and I am really looking forward to seeing what they can do this season.</p> <p>I am sure there are elements Arteta is not happy with and it is really good to avoid complacency and keep pushing them forward. They conceded two against Leicester and they will be disappointed with that. Ramsdale certainly will be because goalkeepers and defenders always want clean sheets. There will be areas in which Arteta will be telling his players they need to be better, but momentum is all-important and they have had a good start. That feeling of confidence is key to this group succeeding.</p> <p>To get to that next level, after finishing fifth last season, they will need to do better against the teams that finished above them. They picked up six points from their eight matches against Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Spurs, indicating that they are a long way behind the teams they aspire to beat. They face Spurs on 1 October, a moment to gauge the progress they have made.</p> <p>Arsenal need to aim to finish in the top four this campaign, without a doubt. They have had a good window and start, but it is a long season. If they can break that top four it will allow them to bring in a few more pieces of the puzzle and push on to be competitive at the next level. Arteta will want a top-four finish foremost and if they can get a trophy along the way that would be a bonus. To go to that next level, they need Champions League football.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/18/democrats-local-races-elections-midterms","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T10:00:43Z","webTitle":"Democratic boot camp: party intensifies local tactics ahead of midterms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/democrats-local-races-elections-midterms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/democrats-local-races-elections-midterms","fields":{"headline":"Democratic boot camp: party intensifies local tactics ahead of midterms","trailText":"Democratic groups are training candidates up and down the ballot in the hopes that a successful voter turnout will help limit losses this fall","byline":"Joan E Greve in Washington","body":"<p>Democrats knew going into this midterm election campaign season that they would have their work cut out for them. History shows that the president’s party usually loses House seats in the midterm elections, and Joe Biden’s approval rating <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/\">has been underwater for almost a year</a>.</p> <p>But that does not mean that Democrats are giving up. Despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/04/us-economy-joe-biden-democrats-midterms\">grim forecasts of a Republican shellacking</a> in the midterms, Democratic groups have doubled down on training candidates to compete up and down the ballot in November. Party leaders have expressed hope that teaching these candidates how to tailor a campaign message to their communities’ concerns and execute a successful voter turnout operation can help Democrats limit their losses this fall.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/07/democrats-boosted-extremists-republican-primaries-was-that-wise\">Democratic ads boosted extremists in Republican primaries. Was that wise?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the groups leading those efforts is the National Democratic Training Committee (NDTC), which coaches candidates and their staffers on the best strategies for managing successful campaigns. The NDTC has held more than 150 trainings this year, both virtually and in person, and 8,000 participants have joined the sessions.</p> <p>“This all goes back to our core mission, which is lowering the barrier of entry for anyone who wants to get involved in Democratic politics and our belief that Democrats need to be preparing and building for long-term power,” said Kelly Dietrich, NDTC’s CEO and founder.</p> <p>NDTC’s bootcamp training sessions instruct candidates and their staffers on everything from building personal connections with voters to executing a successful “get out the vote” strategy. Ebony Lofton, who is running to be the mayor of Dumfries, Virginia, has attended several NDTC trainings, and she said the advice she has received has already paid dividends on the campaign trail.</p> <p>“It’s important to me, as someone who doesn’t have a huge staff, to just have some idea of the direction I’m going,” Lofton said. “You have so many other people from all over the country who are providing nuggets – like someone told me about [getting] signs on the cheap, from the chat in one of the trainings I had – and I’ve been using them, so it’s just been great all around.”</p> <p>While much of the national conversation around the midterm elections has focused on control of Congress, Dietrich said that Democrats need to be paying just as much attention to state and local races like Lofton’s.</p> <p>“We all focus on these big and sexy races of running for Congress, but it’s only a couple of dozen of competitive races,” Dietrich said. “There are literally hundreds of thousands of state [representatives], city council, school board [candidates] that are running.”</p> <p>Dietrich advises trainees running in those local races to carefully consider the issues affecting their communities, and then craft a campaign message around those concerns. For many candidates, that strategy means addressing the way that rising prices have constrained family budgets in recent months.</p> <p>In July, the annual rate of inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/10/us-inflation-rate-july-2022\">hit 8.5%</a>, which was slightly down from a month earlier but still close to a 40-year high for the US. A <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/18/politics/cnn-poll-joe-biden-economy-us/index.html\">CNN poll conducted last month</a> found that 75% of Americans consider inflation and the cost of living to be the most important economic problem facing their family.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You need to be talking about what matters in your community</p> <footer> <cite>Kelly Dietrich</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“When you’re running in those local communities, the national mood and national environment can affect your race. But you need to be talking about what matters in your community,” Dietrich said. “If inflation is top of mind, how does that affect your community?”</p> <p>James Reavis, an NDTC trainee who is running for a seat in the Montana house, said voters have told him that their top concerns are the rising cost of housing and the state’s high property taxes.</p> <p>“I’ll run on tax issues all day because that’s what the constituents are talking about,” Reavis said. “So I’m still listening to the constituents, and that’s my number one driver.”</p> <p>During the NDTC trainings that Reavis has attended this year, he has been able to talk to other Democrats in traditionally Republican states about the best tactics for reaching out to reluctant voters.</p> <p>“There were lots of people on that phone call that were like me, which were people that were running in red states, and we were talking about the challenges that we have,” Reavis said. “We really have an uphill battle in places like Montana. If you have an R next to your name, you’re doing pretty good. You’re already a step ahead of the game. But if you’ve got a D next to your name, you’ve got to work really hard.”</p> <p>The importance of helping state legislative candidates like Reavis has been thrown into stark relief for Democrats in the past couple of months. After the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June, individual states have been able to ban abortion access, and a number of Republican-led states have already done so.</p> <p>The end of Roe has shifted the conversation among voters about the upcoming election, said Donna Dill, an NDTC trainee and campaign staffer for a Democratic candidate seeking a seat in the Texas house. After the supreme court overturned Roe, abortion became illegal in Texas under a 1925 law.</p> <p>“We’re in Texas, and we’re in the fire,” Dill said. “What we’re trying to do is reach out to young women because they’re the ones that are going to bear the consequences of the law.”</p> <p>Dill and her team have pointed to Texas’s abortion ban as a devastating example of the importance of electing Democrats to the state legislature, and she said the NDTC trainings have helped guide her efforts in reaching out to right-leaning voters who may have concerns about the law.</p> <p>“There’s a lot of Republicans in Texas that understand that the way our state government is moving is not in a good direction for the state,” Dill said. “We’re trying to make inroads with them.”</p> <p>Reavis agreed that abortion has become a more prominent issue in his race, but he emphasized that kitchen-table issues like rising prices were still dominating voters’ attention.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When they’re delivering solutions up at the national level, that makes it easier for us down here</p> <footer> <cite>James Reavis</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“The constant message down here in Montana has been the rising price of housing, property taxes [and] public safety,” Reavis said. “Those are still the top two or three issues. Those haven’t changed.”</p> <p>With that in mind, Congress’s passage of the Inflation Reduction Act has provided a boon to Reavis’s campaign. The spending package, which Biden signed into law on Tuesday, includes provisions on limiting Medicare recipients’ prescription drug costs and investing in renewable energy to reduce America’s planet-heating emissions.</p> <p>“President Biden gets a lot of complaints down here in Montana. After the news came out about the Inflation Reduction Act, those complaints really dropped,” Reavis said. “When they’re delivering solutions up at the national level, that makes it easier for us down here to work on those state issues.”</p> <p>The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act was one of several recent victories for Biden and his party. On Wednesday, Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/03/senate-passes-pact-act-veterans-toxins-burn-pits\">signed the Pact Act</a> to expand healthcare benefits to millions of veterans. A week before that, Biden announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/us-strike-afghanistan-kills-al-qaida-leader-ayman-al-zawahiri\">the death of the al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>, who helped coordinate the September 11 attacks.</p> <p>Those accomplishments, combined with concerns over the end of Roe, appear to have bolstered Democrats’ midterm prospects. Earlier this month, Democrats surpassed Republicans on the generic congressional ballot for the first time this election cycle, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/\">according to FiveThirtyEight</a>.</p> <p>Although there are still three months left until election day, recent developments in Washington have made Reavis and other NDTC trainees more optimistic.</p> <p>“In the last two weeks, I have felt some wind being lifted in the sails,” Reavis said. “Because we are getting things done at the federal level and we’re working really hard at the state level, I’m feeling really excited about the midterms.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/18/look-we-have-come-through-by-lara-feigel-review-in-lockdown-with-dh-lawrence","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T10:00:43Z","webTitle":"Look!

We Have Come Through! by Lara Feigel review – in lockdown with DH Lawrence ","trailText":"Feigel gives a candid account of how reading Lawrence made her confront difficult questions about who she is and what she believes","byline":"Blake Morrison","body":"<p>“The vast marvel is to be alive,” DH Lawrence wrote in his last book, Apocalypse, while he was dying. “The magnificent here and now of life in the flesh is ours, and ours alone, and ours only for a time.” Many people had a similar feeling during the Covid lockdown: how precious life is and how easily snatched away. For Lara Feigel there was a mix of exhilaration and unease as she decamped from London to make a home in the Oxfordshire countryside, along with two small children, her new partner and a stack of Lawrence’s books. She had long planned to write about Lawrence, but it was only in lockdown that he possessed her, as a companion, disputant and “guide to life”.</p> <p>She finds him posing difficult questions about who she is and what she believes. Is she too wilful? Too frightened of anger? What is her unconscious (does she even have one)? Is she a good mother? Does she ask too much of her friends? How can she get closer to the natural world? Her book is a critical biography but also a pandemic memoir – a story about how an author can inform and change your life.</p> <p>As she admits, there has been a recent spate of books about Lawrence by women, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/25/burning-man-by-frances-wilson-review-meets-dh-lawrence-on-his-own-terms\">Frances Wilson’s biography</a> and novels by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/may/02/second-place-by-rachel-cusk-review-psychodrama-in-the-shape-of-a-social-comedy\">Rachel Cusk</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/06/tenderness-by-alison-macleod-review-polite-societys-rude-awakening\">Alison MacLeod</a>. She also points to a longer tradition of women writing astutely about him, from Anaïs Nin, Simone de Beauvoir and Susan Sontag to Angela Carter and Doris Lessing. Lawrence’s disapproval of suffragettes and hostility towards the “beak” of the clitoris are an affront to any feminist. But Feigel doesn’t accept Kate Millett’s famous denunciation of him. On the contrary, she’s struck by how perceptive he is about how women think, feel, dress, eat, make love. In Gudrun and Ursula Brangwen especially he created independent, forthright women “who ask for something more from the world than the rhythms of procreation”.</p> <p>It’s in relation to children that Feigel writes most originally about Lawrence. He was known to be unusually good with them, she says, and finds his theories of child-rearing (“see that your children get their dinners and clean sheets, but don’t love them”) both wayward and “helpfully bracing”. She’s enraged by his failure to understand Frieda’s maternal grief after she left her children to be with him. But even this anger is “thrilling”. The thrill is his challenge to her ideas about life.</p> <p>As she writes about parenthood, Feigel is immersed in an agonising legal tussle with her ex-husband about where their children should live and go to school; there’s a court case, which she loses. Part of the attraction of the book is her candour: the charting of her ups and downs as the seasons pass. If she weren’t so attuned to Lawrence, it would feel ickily self-absorbed. But she writes insightfully about his central themes, and though she torments herself unduly by taking his wackier theories too seriously, her intensity and intimacy are engaging.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It hasn’t been easy for Feigel to have a ‘grizzled, chuntering ghost’ as a literary co-habitee for a year</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She’s particularly keen to emphasise his ambivalence – a self-contradictoriness which mirrors her own. “Once a book is fathomed,” he wrote in Apocalypse, “once it is known, and its meaning is fixed or established, it is dead,” and she’s good in bringing out the ambiguities of his novels and, aside from misfires such as The Plumed Serpent, their refusal to be nailed down. The rhythms of his sentences seduce her; the kisses of his couples make her swoon. But she’s too watchful and cerebral to succumb to his more repellent ideas.</p> <p>“I think that one thing he has taught me is to battle to become more myself,” she decides while analysing Lady Chatterley’s Lover (which she thinks a tremendous novel and Connie “one of the great portrayals by a man of a female character”). It hasn’t been easy for her to have a “grizzled, chuntering ghost” as a literary co-habitee for a year. But he has helped her gain a clearer sense of who she is and how to accept change. Along the way, between looking after her children or going on walks with her philosophising lover, she puts together a perceptive book about Lawrence, whose view on our Covid pandemic, she thinks, might have echoed Birkin’s in Women in Love: “One is ill because one doesn’t live properly.”</p> <p>• Look!

During the 10 months, she used seven keeping in touch (KIT) days to attend area manager meetings and training courses, and changed her store region to be nearer to her home, so that both she and her husband would be able to do nursery drop-offs. Then, for her, the time felt right to go back to work. “There was absolutely no pressure – I could have taken a year off, and followed that with a sabbatical,” she says. “But everyone’s different. When I returned, I had a four-week training and handover period so I could find my feet again.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0bb6f94998645a5fcbca5650eec0164b16ff10b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bb6f94998645a5fcbca5650eec0164b16ff10b4/0_489_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aldi staff in the warehouse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aldi offers employees with children the flexibility to create a healthy work-life balance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As children grow, the challenges of juggling parenthood and a career change with them. Eaton says she’s felt supported every step of the way. During lockdown, Sebastian wasn’t eligible for a nursery key worker place, so Eaton, by now working in HR, changed her hours to share his care with her husband. If there’s an emergency, Eaton can be there. “There’s a complete understanding that if your child is ill, you need to go,” she says. When her son starts school in September, Eaton will flex her hours to ensure she’s there for his first day – and she also has the freedom to work from home two days a week, which is great for work-life balance.</p> <p>And, of course, fathers need that all-important work-life balance too. Area manager Tom Stead joined Aldi’s graduate area manager programme in 2020, aged 28. He’d previously worked in recruitment but was looking for a new challenge. “The Aldi area manager programme really stood out in terms of salary and benefits – but also the opportunity to work independently, running your stores your way, and building a career,” he says.</p> <p>His wife became pregnant when Stead was a few months into the one-year training programme. When Stead told his manager the good news, he was immediately offered a range of support options, including training at stores nearer his home, and time off to attend appointments. “As long as I put the effort in while I was at work,” he says, “Aldi was more than happy to accommodate the needs of my family life.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98b4b895b0cd0422b4de456c3cf8a51ac74ae07a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98b4b895b0cd0422b4de456c3cf8a51ac74ae07a/1034_0_2416_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Area manager Tom Stead at Aldi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Area manager Tom Stead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @pramodini_roul</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Area managers are responsible for recruitment in their stores, and Stead was interviewing a candidate when he got the phone call telling him it was time to get to the hospital. Within a few minutes, the store manager had stepped in to finish the interview, and Stead was on his way. “At Aldi, area managers also have what we call cover partnerships,” he says. “We’re a team, so if you can’t work, there will always be someone to cover your role.”</p> <p>He also appreciates the flexibility Aldi offers as his family situation changes. Now that his wife has gone back to work, Stead takes his daughter to nursery three days a week, and is able to choose which two days to have off each week.</p> <p>“I get more flexibility at Aldi than I’d get in a traditional nine to five office role,” says Stead. “It’s all about trust. The business trusts me to work my hours and get everything done. I’m happy to give that trust back.”</p> <p>Eaton agrees. “Aldi is a brilliant place to work,” she says. “There’s so much opportunity – I started as an area manager and now I’m working in HR.

And supermarkets are no exception – most supermarkets are focusing on everything from the environmental impact of mass-consumed food, to food poverty and its connected social issues.

The supermarket’s core CR principles focus on its customers, supply chain, its people, the communities it serves and the environment. This is all brought to life by a programme called Better Everyday, through which it works to be greener, fairer and healthier. “I suppose the purpose of that is a little bit of humility, which our brand has as a business, in saying: ‘Look, we appreciate we’re not perfect, we’re not exactly where we need to be, but with continued effort, ongoing policies and evolving investment, we’re going to get better every day.”</p> <p>The “greener” pillar of the programme covers everything from solar panels on stores to switching HGVs to low-carbon fuels and encouraging staff to switch off lights. In Ireland, the company has pledged to plant a million trees by 2025.</p> <p>“The big piece of the pie is our supply chain,” says Fox. “And we are working to reduce carbon emissions across it.” In addition, <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/food-waste\" rel=\"nofollow\">food-waste-reduction programmes</a> include a 75% price reduction on food products on the last day of life and 30% off products with imperfect packaging, creating less food waste. There’s also a partnership with the platform Neighbourly, which donates surplus food to local good causes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"984d3b9231b9790d3e7d7a1de351b7b4fca13199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/984d3b9231b9790d3e7d7a1de351b7b4fca13199/109_0_1414_1026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People outside an Aldi store carrying a box of produce\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aldi’s partnership with Neighbourly reduces food waste by donating surplus food to local groups.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Graves Photography/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aldi’s <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/corporate-responsibility#healthier\" rel=\"nofollow\">“healthier”</a> pillar aims to help customers make more sustainable and healthier choices. While the <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/corporate-responsibility#fairer\" rel=\"nofollow\">“fairer”</a> pillar covers everything from protecting human rights, animal welfare and increasing the sale of certified products, to supporting charity partners (Teenage Cancer Trust in the UK and Barnardo’s in Ireland). “It’s very wide-ranging,” says Fox.</p> <p>Fox is hopeful that these goals are attainable and suggests that one way forward is to demonstrate to customers that shopping in a more environmentally considerate way doesn’t have to be more expensive.</p> <p>“We need to look after our world,” she says. It’s more important now than ever that we provide affordable, sustainable and responsible shopping baskets for our customers. With the cost-of-living crisis, the value we offer is even more important, and our community partnerships become invaluable.”</p> <p>It’s not just customers who are looking at the company’s environmental impact, future employees are too, says Fox. As someone who has worked her way from graduate to director, she recognises that Aldi’s CR credentials could be key to recruiting new talent. “People want to understand that the company they’re working for is going to look after the planet that they’re living on.”</p> <p>Reflecting on her own career to date, Fox speaks glowingly about the graduate scheme, admitting that the range of subsequent career opportunities took her by surprise. “I knew that there were opportunities for progression but in terms of the breadth of opportunities, that was not something I was aware of.” And in her current role, she feels “very lucky” to work in a position “that I hope can make a real positive impact on the world we live in”. <br><br><em>Are you ready for a career that means more?

Having joined from university – graduate area managers now earn £44,000 – he’s a great advocate for the ‘massive opportunities’ on offer","byline":"Emma Sheppard","body":"<p>When Sireesh Nallanthighal joined Aldi’s graduate area manager programme after leaving the University of Birmingham with a computer science degree, he knew things would move fast. And sure enough, four months in he found himself taking on responsibility for a 30-strong team of store colleagues. “It was a big learning curve, but also an amazing experience,” he says of the training scheme.</p> <p>“Of course, I was initially attracted to the company car and one of the highest graduate salaries in the UK. But the opportunity of the role itself is massive. It’s a level of responsibility I could never have dreamed of elsewhere.”</p> <p>Aldi recruits approximately 100 graduates to its area manager programme throughout the year. It’s competitive but the graduates who make the grade will be rewarded with a package that includes a company car, £44,000 starting salary (rising to £81,415 by the fifth year), five weeks’ holiday (plus bank holidays), and private healthcare.</p> <p>Participants will learn leadership, teamwork and strategic thinking skills, as well as how to motivate and develop a team. After a year-long training programme, they’ll be given the responsibility of looking after the people, processes, efficiencies and targets for a group of stores, effectively running their own multimillion-pound business. Beyond that, the sky’s the limit – Aldi’s CEO and many of the senior directors started out as area managers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee21f00158dbf0a1a55426d73a96bfc78c2fed5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee21f00158dbf0a1a55426d73a96bfc78c2fed5f/231_0_1630_1248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head of digital transformation Sireesh Nallanthighal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sireesh Nallanthighal is leading Aldi’s digital transformation</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Nallanthighal, the graduate scheme proved to be a springboard to a successful career in retail. After completing his training, he was given responsibility for five stores in Northamptonshire and on the Leicestershire border, something he describes as “a very proud moment”.</p> <p>After a few years, he moved across to the company’s national IT department at its head office, where he would eventually become national IT director. “Timing wise, it was a fantastic opportunity. My team was responsible for the technology in stores, covering software, hardware, openings, closures, networks and payments. We opened an additional 450 stores while I was there.”</p> <p>He now has responsibility for digital transformation projects across the UK and Ireland. One of his more recent successes was opening Aldi’s first checkout-free store, Aldi Shop&amp;Go, in Greenwich which recently won the Grocer Gold Awards’ technology initiative of the year. “My parents raised their eyebrows a bit when I said I was joining Aldi but have always supported my decision – and now they shout it from the rooftops,” he says, adding that there was probably an expectation from his British Asian family that he’d become a doctor, dentist, solicitor or accountant.</p> <p>He says: “The opportunities at Aldi have been fantastic. I’ve really appreciated the trust and credibility that I have within the organisation, as well as being able to lead and work with lots of great people.”</p> <p>Aldi is growing its workforce alongside its store expansion plans and recognises the need to reflect the communities that it serves. Last year, it launched a new diversity and inclusion strategy called Embrace.</p> <p>Embrace is built on five strategic pillars, and includes training, support, raising awareness and tracking workforce diversity data. At a graduate level, Aldi engages with a diverse range of universities across the country and is working with <a href=\"https://www.brightnetwork.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bright Network</a> to target candidates from underrepresented backgrounds. It is also running a series of colleague listening groups where people can share their experiences, and leaders will undergo unconscious bias training. Thanks to some of these initiatives, Aldi has just been named employer of the year at the Grocer Gold Awards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59cf215c4c1a968d056173e702d2c7e42a333815\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59cf215c4c1a968d056173e702d2c7e42a333815/0_183_7987_4793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aldi staff working together\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aldi is focused on diversity and inclusion as it grows its workforce</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many studies have demonstrated the business benefits of diversity. Organisations with a diverse workforce and leadership team are more likely to be innovative and profitable. One research paper found that inclusive teams make better business decisions <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriklarson/2017/09/21/new-research-diversity-inclusion-better-decision-making-at-work/?sh=51bb324a4cbf\" rel=\"nofollow\">up to 87% of the time</a>. The decisions they make also deliver 60% better results, the study found.

It’s not just about goodwill. It has to be a directed effort,” he says.</p> <p>“And this is a topic right at the most senior level of the business. I’ve always felt very secure at Aldi and I’ve had an incredibly varied and rewarding career,” says Nallanthighal. “For me, Embrace gives us the strategic and structured vision to build on what’s already there in terms of positive initiatives, and proves that diversity and inclusion is an intrinsic part of how we operate as a business.”</p> <p>For those considering applying to the Aldi area manager <a href=\"https://www.aldirecruitment.co.uk/area-manager-programme/graduate-area-manager-programme\" rel=\"nofollow\">programme</a>, his advice is clear: “Don’t hesitate.

He has became ubiquitous across the BBC in recent years, having also hosted episodes of The One Show and acted as a stand-in host for both Zoë Ball and Jeremy Vine’s Radio 2 shows. When he takes up the University Challenge job he will be stepping down as BBC media editor, a post he has held for six years.</p> <p>Before joining the BBC, Rajan was the final editor of the print edition of the Independent, having been appointed to the role aged 29 in 2013 by the owner, Evgeny Lebedev. Rajan had previously worked for Lebedev as a media adviser.</p> <p>His appointment to the University Challenge job has attracted some controversy around the hiring process. When it was announced this week that Paxman would be stepping down, Samira Ahmed, a fellow BBC presenter, publicly stated that she was unhappy with the application system.</p> <p>Ahmed, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/24/samira-ahmed-and-bbc-reach-settlement-over-equal-pay-claim\">previously won an unequal pay claim</a> against the BBC, said she had approached the production team about the job, having worked on the show as a stand-by presenter for the past year.</p> <p>“I approached University Challenge myself months ago … I’ve loved working with the fab team who seem to love me and just narrated a UC [University Challenge] documentary that’s going out on BBC Two. But no one from the BBC has spoken to me yet about taking over. I’ve always been happy to go through an honest fair process and be judged on my merits. I still am.”</p> <p>Rajan said he was delighted to become only the third host in the show’s 60-year history, following Paxman and the recently deceased Bamber Gascogine.</p> <p>He said: “Being asked to host my favourite TV programme is dream-come-true territory. I have watched University Challenge obsessively for years, addicted to its high standards, glorious title music, and inspirational contestants. It’s the best possible antidote to cynicism about young people, allowing millions of us to test our wits against the best minds of a new generation, and annoy and impress our families by barking answers from the sofa.</p> <p>“I am very conscious that in the late, great Bamber, and that giant of British culture, Jeremy, I have vast shoes to fill. With his immense intellect, authority, and respect from students and viewers alike, Jeremy hands over a format, and show, as strong as ever.</p> <p>“I won’t stop thinking today about my late, beloved Dad, whose devotion to education brought him to England, whose love of knowledge I imbibed as a kid, and whose belief in the noble challenge of university so shaped my life. I’ll devote my first ”starter for 10” to him – and to the millions of quiz fiends who, like me, love those rare occasions when they know the answer before the students do.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/aug/18/scott-morrison-david-hurley-governor-general-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-australian-politics-climate-emissions-industry","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T09:08:36Z","webTitle":"Albanese says former PM owes apology to Australian people – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/18/scott-morrison-david-hurley-governor-general-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-australian-politics-climate-emissions-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/18/scott-morrison-david-hurley-governor-general-anthony-albanese-indigenous-voice-australian-politics-climate-emissions-industry","fields":{"headline":"Albanese says former PM owes apology to Australian people – as it happened","trailText":"This blog is now closed","byline":"Mostafa Rachwani and Natasha May","body":"<div id=\"block-62fdf82e8f080eafb8917ddb\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T09:05:57.980Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">What we learned: Wednesday, 17 August</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And with that, we will close the blog for the day.

covers about 80% of Australia’s population totalled $114m.</p> \n  <p>A separate tab, the <strong>reliability and emergency reserve trader </strong>that paid energy users to reduce demand, came in at

<p>The period leading up to and including the suspension of the NEM spot markets was one of the most complex and challenging that Aemo has experienced.<br><br>While the claims we’ve received are considerable in value, the total is well below external expectations, which is positive for consumers and market participants already facing challenging conditions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Claims estimates reported in some media outlets apparently reached <strong>$1.7bn</strong>, or about an order of magnitude more than the final cost.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/31/reprehensible-facebook-posts-emerge-as-qld-police-boss-lauds-excellent-domestic-violence-response\">Guardian Australia</a> reported the posts were made in a private Facebook group for current and former Australian law enforcement personnel.</p> \n  <p>The posts were made at the same time as public hearings in a commission of inquiry into Queensland police responses to domestic violence unearthed numerous allegations of a misogynistic culture within the service.</p> \n  <p>The inquiry heard on Thursday the police officer who made the posts is being investigated, along with 78 other police officers who had responded to them.</p> \n  <p>The officer, who is almost 50 years old and was sworn into the QPS in 2020, has a history of not complying with police operational procedures, the inquiry heard.</p> \n  <p>Last February, the officer failed to enter a domestic violence occurrence in police software, Q Prime and was dealt with through “local managerial resolution”, the inquiry heard.</p> \n  <p>The officer also was investigated for posts on another police Facebook page in February 2021, along with 30 Queensland police officers who responded to the posts.</p> \n  <p>The inquiry heard 22 of those officers were disciplined via “local managerial resolution”.</p> \n  <p>In August 2021, the same officer was also found to have not been wearing a body-worn camera when attending incidents.</p> \n  <p>“So he’s presently under investigation and decisions have not yet been made about what happened to him for this particular instance?” counsel assisting Ruth O’Gorman asked.</p> \n  <p>“That’s correct,” the police commissioner, <strong>Katarina Carroll</strong>, responded.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

I’m following the debate and I would like to have - horror of horrors - more information ... but anything that I think has the potential for division, has the potential for establishing a body that is seen as exercising, coercive influence on the government.</p> \n   <p>Bear in mind that the prime minister has said some very contradictory things about this, although he’s got a lot of credit for what he said at the Garma festival. He said on the one hand, very simple language, you know, ‘nothing to see over here’. Then in one of the interviews he gave to <strong>David Spears</strong> ... he made the comment that it would be a ‘very brave government that would ignore the recommendation from this body’. Now, if that’s his opinion, then he must deep down, see more to this than ‘nothing to see over there’. And I’m a little confused.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Howard suggested the voice could be “trialled in legislation” before constitutional entrenchment. He said the government is “hell-bent” on a referendum first.</p> \n  <p>Howard also made a version of the argument that somehow a Voice will harm practical action:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are a lot of people who think that we if we expend all of our emotional energy and debate on the voice and when that’s over irrespective of what the outcome is, there’ll be a feeling in the community that ‘well, we’ve dealt with Indigenous affairs’, let’s get onto something else’. But as people like<strong> Jacinta Price</strong> has said the glaring challenge in Indigenous affairs, is to do something about the deprivation of Indigenous people in particularly, but not only the Northern Territory.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It’s hard to understand why people would conclude Indigenous affairs is done and dusted if the outcome of the referendum is a constitutionally entrenched body to advocate for Indigenous people.

In 2018, the freshly-minted Liberal leader posted a video on his social media from Question Time, where he asked his MPs to raise their hands – with the clip soundtracked by Fatman Scoop’s song, Be Faithful.</p> \n  <p>That song featured the lyrics “get your hands up”.

Flustered, fumbling her file cards, more than moist with anxiety (“I sweated through a coat once”), she’s hiding out in a storeroom when another woman (Alice Franziska) comes in cradling a birthday cake. Cue the rolling eyes and Bea gabbling her life story, or at least her love story.<br><br>In flashback, 17-year-old Bea meets an intriguing older neighbour, Margot (Olivia Dowd). Margot makes medical wax figures, painstakingly crafting “hideous diseases in 3D form”. It’s an arrestingly niche calling, and Bea falls for both the art and the artist. In Margot’s flat, smelling of “stewed apple and stamps”, she gets to experience the joy of wax and soon she’s making eyes at and for Margot, and her detailed recreations of gout, plague and pox.

She leaves her debit card at home when she does her weekly food shop, bringing only the budget she has allocated in notes. As a result, Thomas could “sit here and tell you to the penny” what most items in the supermarket cost. “I know that if I go to Aldi something would cost me 6p less than if I went to Asda and about 5p less than if I went to Tesco,” she says. Thomas’s “solid money” habit hasn’t just changed her attitude to Starbucks; it’s changed the way she spends and saves entirely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03b32dc86d3e53187109bd6af77a2003ac1726ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03b32dc86d3e53187109bd6af77a2003ac1726ca/0_26_8660_5199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Research shows that we experience the ‘pain of paying’ when spending cash.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Research shows that we experience the ‘pain of paying’ when spending cash.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: georgeclerk/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thomas is not the only one turning to cash during the cost of living crisis. In July, more than £800m in banknotes was withdrawn from Post Office counters, a 20% rise from the same month the year before. Martin Kearsley, banking director at the Post Office, told the BBC: “We’re seeing more and more people increasingly reliant on cash as the tried-and-tested way to manage a budget.”</p> <p>Since records began five years ago, Post Office withdrawals have exceeded £800m only once before – and that was last Christmas, a time when a lot of cash is tucked into cards. Shortly after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/uk-wages-in-june-fall-at-fastest-rate-for-20-years\">UK wages fell at their fastest rate</a> in 20 years, Kearsley said it was clear that Britain is “anything but a cashless society”.</p> <p>Thomas first ditched her debit card post-lockdown after she was troubled by her online spending during the pandemic, but she says her cash-only budget is helping her to prepare for rising costs. “I feel like I’m ahead of the game, I feel like I’ve got an advantage,” she says. “It’s definitely going to be tricky, but I feel like I’ve already got lots of tools in place to help me.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Contactless promotes increased spending and increased use of debt</p> <footer> <cite>Warwick business school</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Personal finance and consumer expert <a href=\"http://www.suehaywardmedia.com/\">Sue Hayward</a> concurs that “handing over cold hard cash often makes you think twice about how much you’re spending”. She also notes that it’s easier to keep track of purchases when paying with banknotes, “as contactless payments can take several days to show up on your statement”.</p> <p>In 2020, <a href=\"https://sjdm.org/presentations/2020-Poster-van_den_Akker-Merle-contactless-spending-debt~.pdf\">researchers from Warwick business school</a> analysed more than 300m transactions from 260,000 consumers and found that people with contactless cards spent “significantly more” than those without. Contactless spenders were also more likely to be charged overdraft fees and made more purchases overall. The researchers concluded that contactless: “promotes increased spending and can promote decreased cash usage and increased use of debt.”</p> <p>Conversely, almost 30 years of academic research have shown that we experience the “pain of paying” when spending cash: handing over money feels like losing it, activating the <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01188/full\">insular cortex</a>, the part of our brain that deals with physical pain. (Interestingly, it seems that some alternatives to cash are less painful than others. One 2018 paper, from the Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management, found that consumers feel lower levels of pain when they pay with mobile phones and smartwatches than when they use credit cards.)</p> <p>“It’s just being savvy and going back to old-school ways,” Thomas says of her cash use. On her YouTube channel, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/thebudgetmumuk\">The Budget Mum UK</a>, she shows her 2,600 subscribers how she withdraws her wage at the start of the month and separates the notes into different laminated envelopes.

She says she has seen a recent rise in sales. In total, Edmondson personally uses 30 cash-stuffing envelopes for things such as petrol money, Christmas savings and her Slimming World membership. Putting away money gradually in one envelope over the course of the year helps Edmondson save for bigger costs: she now has £350 saved to buy her four children’s school uniforms. “If this was me last year, I would be panicking: ‘How am I going to pay for all of this?’” she says. “Whereas actually now, I don’t worry about money.”</p> <p>Yet a cash-only lifestyle can cause problems in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/18/uk-cashless-society-a-step-closer-as-more-than-23m-people-abandon-coins\">increasingly cashless society</a>. In 2010, half of the UK’s transactional payments were made in cash, but by 2020, this had <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2021/update-on-the-future-of-wholesale-cash-distribution-in-the-uk\">dropped</a> to just 17%.

Six weeks ago, she decided to set up Apple Pay on her phone as a backup for emergencies, but she refuses to leave her credit card in her car to avoid temptation.</p> <p>Natalie Ceeney, chair of the Cash Action Group, says many small businesses don’t accept cash because it’s increasingly difficult to deposit takings due to the closure of high street banks. Ceeney is now campaigning to get ATMs to take cash deposits (you can currently do this inside banks, but opening hours can be prohibitive). However, she says, “setting up a whole new network” is “not quick”. Meanwhile, Ceeney notes that many consumers depend on cash due to “some form of vulnerability”, such as not having a proper internet connection, smartphone or bank account, or having a disability. A May study by the <a href=\"https://www.cashmatters.org/blog/millions-would-struggle-in-a-cashless-society\">Royal Society of Arts</a> found that 15 million people in the UK rely on cash to budget.</p> <p>“The main reason people will tell you they use cash is for budgeting: you can see it, you can feel it,” Ceeney says. “With the cost of living crisis, more people are strapped for cash so it shouldn’t be a surprise that people are going back to using cash, withdrawing money to get through the week safely without getting overdrawn.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/24/app-shoppers-money-making-shepper-easyshift-field-agent\">Appy shoppers: are the new money-making services worth it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although cash can have its advantages, Ceeney warns that there’s a “poverty premium” when avoiding cards. “The reality is, if you can’t shop online you will pay more using cash because you can’t get online deals or direct debits where you often get a discount, you can’t shop around or buy in bulk,” she says. Ceeney explains that although many families know this, they’re “going back to cash because they can’t afford to go overdrawn – this is about necessity”.</p> <p>Even with cash-stuffing systems in place, Thomas and Edmondson are concerned about the ever-increasing cost of living. “I feel like it’s going to be a big hurdle,” Thomas says of rising bills, while Edmondson adds: “It’s still very nerve-racking. It’s like: ‘Where are we going to find this extra money from?’” While using cash can be helpful for individual consumers, it is not a substitute for government intervention, nor a long-term solution to our economic crisis.

But if you remember him from the 90s, when Hayes was the frontman of Savage Garden, you wouldn’t have known about his sexuality. He spent the most successful years of his life in the closet, quietly processing and then guarding the truth of who he was as he toured the world, sold 23m albums and collected 14 Aria awards. Hayes eventually came out, but feels being an openly gay man at the turn of the century thwarted the solo career he embarked on after the breakup of Savage Garden – which is why he has chosen to recline behind that blazing neon epithet.</p> <p>“I did not want to be gay. I just didn’t,” he says of those late 90s days. “So [I thought] I’m going to take this word, and I’m going to turn it into the best compliment ever.”</p> <p>We are seated in a Sydney hotel room in the middle of a confessional 70-minute conversation that will bring the former frontman to tears more than once.

The story of how he came to make Homosexual is emotional, but it is one that Hayes wants to tell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2aea669cc027ba687f4f708d7dc54d5e7bdca0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2aea669cc027ba687f4f708d7dc54d5e7bdca0d/0_0_4134_2232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darren Hayes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"540\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m so comfortable in my skin’ … Darren Hayes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It took a long time for Hayes, now 50, to be able to embrace his sexuality. He grew up in the rigidly conservative Queensland of the 1970s, where his father called him the F word, he says, and kids at school bullied him for being gay before he knew what that meant. In retrospect, he believes his sexuality was obvious to almost everyone but him.</p> <p>But Hayes only began to confront his attraction to men in his mid-20s, when he was married to and deeply in love with a woman he had met at university, Colby Taylor. He and then-bandmate Daniel Jones had been sent to Sydney to work on the first Savage Garden album when, one day, he walked into a gay porn cinema “in a trance”. His first reaction was shock. Next came arousal, followed immediately by overwhelming guilt. He ran out, found a public phone box and called Lifeline.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just thought, I don’t want this. I love my wife. She was my best friend in the whole world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“I was crying,” Hayes remembers. “I had the most amazing person on the other end of the line, and they said, ‘Listen, it’s fine, you’re probably gay. I think what you should do is go home and talk to your wife.’ And it was horrific. It was the most horrible news to me. Because I just thought, I don’t want this. I love my wife. She was my best friend in the whole world.”</p> <p>Hayes took that advice, and Taylor was “so amazing” in her response – but she didn’t immediately accept what it meant for their relationship. They swept his confession under the rug and kept going.</p> <p>Then Savage Garden blew up. The duo’s self-titled debut was an instantaneous and international success, an overnight catapult to fame Hayes found overwhelming. He remembers “crying a lot” and being subject to an extraordinary tour schedule that would take him to as many as three different European countries per day. Hayes was anxious about the world finding out the radioactive secret of his sexuality when he and Taylor eventually began marriage counselling. In those sessions, a faith-based practitioner told Hayes he would “just have to deal with [his sexuality]”.</p> <p>“That was when I first became suicidal,” he says, wiping away tears. Managing his mental health had always been difficult for Hayes, but that experience made it an acute battle. “I remember just thinking, well, I’ve had [the marriage counsellor] say to me you’re a terrible person. And this is what you have to be forever.”</p> <p>He and Taylor eventually split. While that separation was an immense loss, Hayes says “she was an incredibly beautiful person about it all”. He turned his heartbreak into songs such as I Don’t Know You Anymore on Savage Garden’s second album, 1999’s Affirmation. That LP was another monumental success, but he and Daniel Jones parted ways soon after its release – a split <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/no-friendship-the-rift-that-destroyed-savage-garden/news-story/1ff795f81ea3ca65663fc15d7300431c\">much less amicable</a> than his divorce – spelling an end to the band.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6c801f241e7557b87861c96217e628f54db8046\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6c801f241e7557b87861c96217e628f54db8046/0_8_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hayes and Jones perform as Savage Garden at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones perform as Savage Garden at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the next couple of years Hayes began to come out to his label and those around him, before embarking on a solo career that began with the 2002 album Spin. Hayes feels that new chapter was never given the chance to succeed, describing his experiences of homophobia in the industry at that time.</p> <p>“I remember being in meetings where they were openly mocking Ricky Martin,” Hayes recalls, his posture stiffening. “I did my first video for [lead single] Insatiable … I had blonde hair, I was dancing [in it] and the head of the record company told everyone that I looked ‘too gay’. They cancelled all of the promotion in the US for that album.” After that, Hayes says, “My career in Australia and in the US pretty much just stopped.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was constantly put in music videos where I was in a romantic situation with a woman or I was muted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Guardian Australia contacted Columbia Records – Hayes’s label at the time – for comment, but they declined.</p> <p>The video for Insatiable was eventually reshot <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u7hGkL57N8&amp;ab_channel=DarrenHayesVEVO\">with a female love interest</a>. It was a “horrible time”, Hayes says.</p> <p>He relocated to the UK – where Insatiable had hit No 2 on the charts – on the advice of his friend Kylie Minogue, who told him to “go where the light is”. But Hayes remained suicidal for many years until meeting his now-husband, Richard Cullen, and never fully relinquished the pain he carried over what happened to his career after coming out. He felt desexualised and condescended to by an industry that was happy to have him be a talking head but had no intention of taking his music seriously.</p> <p>“I never expected my solo career to be as big as Savage Garden. I knew the lightning in the bottle aspect of what had happened to us,” he says. “But it became increasingly difficult to battle this feeling of being marginalised and that this is what happens when you do come out.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a0f1cd0bcfa857221a179cd2a47d3cd44118b9f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0f1cd0bcfa857221a179cd2a47d3cd44118b9f2/0_0_2756_4134/667.jpg\" alt=\"Darren Hayes called his record Homosexual as a way to ‘take that name back for myself’ and ‘to turn it into the best compliment ever’.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darren Hayes says he named his new record Homosexual as a way to ‘take that name back for myself’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hayes released three more solo albums then took 10 years off from music. At home in Los Angeles, he busied himself with everything but writing songs: he studied improv, wrote a play, started a podcast and made friends who had no idea about his past life as a pop star. But he also began to witness the cultural shifts around the acceptance of homosexuality and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/31/how-queer-male-pop-is-finally-back-in-bloom\">new wave of openly gay pop artists</a> who were climbing the charts. His reaction was one of grief for the youth he never got to have.</p> <p>“I realised that the entire time that I was famous, all this energy and all this love was being received by an avatar. It wasn’t being received by me,” Hayes says. “And I looked at Troye Sivan, I looked at Brendan Maclean, who’s a local Sydney gay artist that I love, I looked at Lil Nas X, and I saw this new generation who just arrive as their authentic selves. And I was so angry that I had been extinguished. I’d been extinguished by men in suits.”</p> <p>It was a powerful personal reckoning, heightened by watching the #MeToo movement sweep the entertainment industry. (“[I] stand in a tiny shadow of that same misogyny because there is a similar misogyny that happens to gay men,” he says. “We experience a similar tone of that dismissal from straight white men.”) But that grief and anger is also what brought him back to music.</p> <p>“I just thought it would be such a shame, now that I’m so comfortable in my skin, to not write about my full, vibrant, high-definition, 3D presence,” he says.</p> <p>Hayes eventually began work on a new type of album: one that he produced, arranged, composed and performed entirely on his own. He studied music production and engineering and dived headfirst into researching the history of disco and house, fusing elements of those genres into tracks like the shimmering, six-and-a-half-minute lead single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8FUtMI8644\">Let’s Try Being in Love</a>. Then, for the music video, he cast a male love interest – a small but powerful victory for Hayes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8FUtMI8644\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m8FUtMI8644?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>“I was constantly put in music videos where I was in a romantic situation with a woman or I was muted,’’ he says of his early career. “And for me, it was like, ‘No, I’m going to show you, I’m going to cast a man that I think is really fucking sexy.’”</p> <p>Much of the record is devoted to celebrating his eros and sexuality. But Hayes also used his songwriting to interrogate the stuff that has been “under the surface [my] whole life”, delving into his family history of suicide on the track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBQWCjRf298\">Poison Blood</a> and his own mental health struggles on Hey Matt. Managing his mental health is an ongoing struggle for Hayes (“I take a cocktail of medication, and I go to therapy every week in order for me to stay here every day,” he says) and he had to think long and hard about whether to return to an industry that can be brutal. But Hayes is releasing the album on his own label, a move that freed him to make music completely on his own terms, without the input of those men in suits. That felt like catharsis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/20/flume-finally-finds-happiness-i-didnt-want-to-tour-any-more-i-hated-my-job\">Flume finally finds happiness: ‘I didn’t want to tour any more.

It’s called I Am Not a Gorilla so she took to the streets in a gorilla costume. She did not expect to encounter daily sexual harassment.</p> <p>Mehta has experienced “persistent verbal and physical harassment” such as “non-consensual touching, including men coming up behind me and grabbing my bum”. She continues: “I’ve experienced men and women hugging me, and tweaking, touching or rubbing the nipples of my gorilla costume, which are obviously directly on top of my actual breasts. These interactions have made me feel so unsafe that I now wear a bra over my costume.”</p> <p>On one occasion, two men who were abusive on the street came to her show and continued to harass her. Her venue, Underbelly, stepped in and removed them, but she has experienced further unpleasant incidents since. An Underbelly spokesperson said: “Performers should always feel safe when flyering and performing. We’ve since spoken with Posey to discuss ways in which we can support her moving forwards.

Faye Treacy originally had an early-evening show, but soon discovered that her noisy venue wasn’t suitable for her solo musical act. She felt forced to move venues, taking the only free slot at 11.50pm. When she finishes work at around 1am, the street near Cowgate is flooded with drunk people. Treacy is staying on the outskirts of Edinburgh to save money, but there are no night buses. “Night after night, I stand alone waiting for cabs while I get harassed on the street,” Treacy says. “I’d like to see a fund for cabs for performers and employees working anti-social hours.”</p> <p>In past years she was aware of the <a href=\"https://funnywomen.com/2018/07/17/home-safe-collective/\">Home Safe Collective</a>, established by Angela Barnes in response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/15/eurydice-dixons-killer-stalked-her-for-5km-before-in-melbourne-park\">murder of comedian Eurydice Dixon</a> in Australia. “It shouldn’t be left until there is a tragic incident for us comics to set up a fund. Even then, when something terrible happens, it is talked about for a bit, then it goes away and we end up in this cycle of inaction,” Treacy says. “It should be something the Edinburgh Fringe Society and/or venues commit to providing every year without fail.” Representatives for Treacy’s venues have been approached for comment.</p> <p>Many of the issues that exist on the comedy circuit all year round – precarious working conditions, late-night finishes, alcohol and close contact with relative strangers – can be exacerbated at the fringe. Nina Gilligan is the co-founder, along with Kiri Pritchard-McLean, of <a href=\"https://getofflivecomedy.co.uk/\">Get Off! Live Comedy</a>, an organisation that launched in late 2021 to tackle sexual harassment. Comedy venues and promoters become paid members, giving them access to sexual harassment policies, training and an independent HR service.</p> <p>At Edinburgh this year, as participants faced the uncertainty of a post-pandemic festival, “safety seems like a luxury instead of a necessity”, says Gilligan. “It’s not top of people’s priority list, but it should be.”</p> <p>New research from Get Off! and the University of Sunderland saw nearly 850 members of the live comedy industry (more than half of which were men) responding to an anonymous survey. Of these, 21% said they had personally experienced or witnessed sexual harassment, and 74% said it was regular or frequent. Only 11% reported sexual harassment to an authority at work, citing belief that nothing would be done and fears of being dismissed or facing retaliation. Just 6% felt their incident was dealt with appropriately. One in three women in the industry said they had experienced or witnessed sexual harassment.</p> <p>While Get Off! now has multiple members fully signed up and contributing financially, Gilligan stresses that the whole industry needs to come together. “We’ve had incredible support, we just need to push it over that final bit.” She and Pritchard-McLean are hosting an event at Pleasance Courtyard to raise funds and awareness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcf18cf5a5ec493f75c69e49f37801e7ffe15cfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcf18cf5a5ec493f75c69e49f37801e7ffe15cfa/74_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posey Mehta’s show is called I Am Not a Gorilla\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posey Mehta’s show is called I Am Not a Gorilla</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the festival, trade union Equity launched its own attempt to tackle industry issues. <a href=\"https://www.equity.org.uk/news/2022/august/comedians-charter-launched-at-edinburgh-fringe-to-improve-the-working-lives-of-comedians/\">The Comedians’ Charter</a> includes sections on late night safety and harassment, calling for comedy venues and promoters to consider arrangements for late-night travel and develop anti-harassment policies. Equity’s organiser for comedians, Rob Lugg, says: “There is a lot of vulnerability, so we need a systemic approach to who is responsible for that safety.” The Stand comedy club has become the first to adopt the charter and Equity hopes others will follow suit, and that more comedians will join the union.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Fringe Society says that its Artist Services team is available to support participants, and two staff members are trained as part of the Old Vic’s <a href=\"https://www.oldvictheatre.com/author/kate-varaholdvictheatre-com/\">Guardians Network</a>, allowing them to listen confidentially and advise colleagues on what action they can take.</p> <p>However, Mehta and Treacy say they feel it is unclear where to turn. Both express fears that speaking out could jeopardise their shows. “I should be able to concentrate on performing, not wondering if I’m going to make it home safely,” Treacy says.

intention to push Labor on fossil fuel projects as it revamps the safeguard mechanism to cut industrial emissions.</p> \n<p>Following the government’s release of a discussion paper on the measure on Thursday, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, suggested the party was prepared to use its balance of power position more assertively than it did during negotiations over the legislation to enshrine the 43% emissions reduction target.</p> \n<p>The mechanism, which is needed to cut pollution from the country’s biggest polluters, will require legislation to establish new baseline settings for emission limits, which will also put in place a new credit trading scheme.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a

big polluters by up to 6% a year</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, Labor is confident the legislative elements of the policy will have bipartisan support, limiting the Greens’ ability to secure any concessions from the government as the bill goes through the Senate.</p> \n<p>The new rules are slated to come into effect in July next year, with legislation to be enacted by March.</p> \n<p>Industrial emissions covered under the safeguard mechanism account for 28%, or 137m tonnes, of Australia’s emissions, and the government <a

3.5% and 6% a year.</p> \n<p>The task to reduce emissions will also depend on the number of new entrants and economic growth, with the paper outlining a more ambitious abatement task depending on how much the industrial sector grows.</p> \n<p>In a scenario of “modest” emissions growth of 0.5% each year, safeguard facilities would contribute about 170m tonnes of abatement to 2030.</p> \n<p>Growth of 2% annually would increase the abatement task to 230m tonnes.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a

mechanism changes, the government will not be able to avoid the issue of new coal and gas,” Bandt said.</p> \n<p>“With the government’s low targets and new fossil fuel projects, the pollution from new coal and gas being burnt overseas will dwarf any emissions cuts made at home.”</p> \n<p>He said the Greens would use its balance of power in the Senate on the legislation and regulation required to change the safeguard mechanism to push the government on new coal and gas projects, including Scarborough in Western Australia and Beetaloo in the Northern Territory.</p> \n<figure class=\"element

People are getting poorer every day of the week. People can’t pay their bills. They’re getting treated despicably at the workplace. I think there will be generalised and synchronised action.

For one thing, employees may be doing better than the general wage statistics indicate.</p> <p>The WPI, for instance, won’t include the 5.2% rise in the minimum wage affecting about a quarter of workers until the current quarter. Someone who takes on new roles – such as a cafe barista who becomes a manager with higher pay – would also not be captured in the WPI as an increase in wages, Smirk said.</p> <p>The ABS, meanwhile, reckons growth in average weekly earnings has held back an increase in relatively low-paid restaurant and accommodation jobs as the economy bounced back from Covid lockdowns. That altered the composition of jobs, as did the rise in youth employment.</p> <p>Westpac predicts the WPI will rise to 4.5% by late this year or early next year, an improvement but still shy of CPI. The RBA expects inflation to peak at 7.75% by late 2022.</p> <p>As proof of where the bargaining power still lies, companies are tending to offer employees one-off bonuses or negotiating shorter term agreements rather than locking in longer-term permanent rises, Smirk said.</p> <p>The banking sector is one case in point, according to Julia Angrisano, national secretary of the Financial Sector Union.

Sensitively translated from French by Aneesa Abbas Higgins, it won the US National Book award for translated literature. In Elisa Shua Dusapin’s second novel, The Pachinko Parlour, Claire, a Korean-Swiss graduate student just shy of 30, spends an insomniac summer treading water in Tokyo while visiting her grandparents, Korean immigrants who own a pachinko parlour. Japan’s 20,000-plus parlours are exclusively run by Koreans, who are exempt from the steep taxes levied on the pinball-type arcade game, the country’s only legal form of gambling.</p> <p>Like Min Jin Lee’s novel Pachinko, Dusapin’s book illuminates the legacy of 20th-century Korean migration to Japan, the homeland of their colonisers. Claire is planning to accompany her grandparents on their first trip back to Korea since they fled the civil war in 1952. Gradually, she realises the roots of their reluctance to organise the journey lie deeper than mere inertia.</p> <p>As the setting for stories from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/07/convenience-store-woman-sayaka-murata-review\" title=\"\">Convenience Store Woman</a> by Sayaka Murata to Jessica Au’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/26/cold-enough-for-snow-by-jessica-au-review-a-ghostly-mother-and-daughter-journey\" title=\"\">Cold Enough for Snow</a> and All the Lovers in the Night by Mieko Kawakami, Tokyo has become a byword for urban alienation – and so it proves here. Claire struggles to bridge the gap between herself and her grandparents, who grew up in a Japanese-occupied Korea where speaking their own language was punishable by death, and now resist speaking Japanese. Because Claire lives in Switzerland, where Korean is not taught, she is studying Japanese, but must communicate with her grandparents in basic English. To add another linguistic layer, Claire is tutoring a local child, Mieko, in French. Mieko lives with her mother, and her memories of a vanished father, in a deserted hotel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Dusapin is developing a distinctive style with signature motifs that interconnect her work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So Dusapin assembles her themes: absence and abandonment, cultural history and identity, belonging and otherness, language and connection. Claire passes as Japanese, but she’s “never felt more foreign” – and her grandparents seem scarcely more integrated. As she drifts through a heatwave, a sense of foreboding builds, spun from small grotesqueries (“a jar of pickles, greenish, floating like embryos”), off-kilter interactions and startling glimpses of darkness, such as Claire’s grandmother’s volatility and occasional cruelty.</p> <p>Dusapin, 29, is developing a distinctive style with signature motifs that interconnect her work. Fragmentation, recurring imagery and a flair for evoking atmosphere so effective that lassitude seems to seep through the pages recalls Deborah Levy’s writing. Fish populated Winter in Sokcho, and are here again – in a cityscape where “everything seems to float”; in the bullet trains that “look like fish”; in Mieko’s opening and closing mouth. Another Dusapin trope is food as a conduit to the emotions; foodstuffs are cast as comforting, painfully nostalgic or queasily alien. She captures place with assurance, from the gently comic surrealism of the “Heidi’s Village” theme park to the melancholy of the pachinko parlour The Shiny, whose name gathers irony with every passing day. This pathos infuses the novel, as Claire feels worlds apart from her grandparents, witnessing the insularity and disorientation of old age.</p> <p>As in Winter in Sokcho, the narrator seeks refuge from her fraught family relationships in an unexpected new friendship. In that book, a sexual frisson sucked the reader in, while in this one the tensions derive from unspoken family histories; if you’ve read Dusapin’s debut, the shape and mood will feel a little too familiar. Nonetheless, this is a masterclass in narrative control and subtlety, exemplified by the currents eddying beneath the surface of relationships and Claire’s dawning understanding of the scars left by her grandparents’ pasts. Dusapin is clearly an exceptional writer – sharply focused, delicate – but she could shake things up next time.</p> <p>• The Pachinko Parlour by Elisa Shua Dusapin is translated by Aneesa Abbas Higgins and published by Daunt (£9.99).

So why has he played for two professional teams?","byline":"Joseph Palmer","body":"<p>The Scarborough Shooting Stars came within a single basket of winning the <a href=\"https://www.cebl.ca/\">Canadian Elite Basketball League</a> (CEBL) title on Sunday, losing to the Hamilton Honey Badgers by just two points after a run of 17 unanswered in the fourth quarter. Despite their heartbreaking loss, Scarborough’s season should still be considered a success – the team made it to the championship game in their first year in the league, and the high-scoring duo of <a href=\"https://www.scarboroughshootingstars.ca/jalen-harris---bio-page\">Jalen Harris</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scarboroughshootingstars.ca/kassius-robertson---bio-page\">Kassius Robertson</a> are a dynamic backcourt around which to build. Harris even once scored 31 points against the Luka Doncic-led Dallas Mavericks. Yet, despite his NBA pedigree, Harris is not even the most well-known guard on his team. That distinction falls to Grammy-winning rap artist J Cole. Or, more accurately in this context, 6ft 3in Shooting Stars guard Jermaine Cole.</p> <p>Hip-hop and basketball have maintained their ongoing relationship ever since the former first emerged in 1970s New York. Kurtis Blow, widely regarded as rap’s first commercially successful artist, famously announced in the 1980s that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_shxzlTRK44\">basketball was his favorite sport</a>, 90s rap mogul Master P <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/sports/2015/08/master-p-nba-career-oral-history\">played on the preseason squads</a> for both the Charlotte Hornets and Toronto Raptors, and platinum-selling artist 2 Chainz released a 2010s album called <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/1BR69wIifGZUSimcuTjWVg?si=m3762p4TR_mh9TKHNvQv_w\">Rap or Go to the League</a>. Comedian <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko-vlqbl9KU\">Dave Chappelle even once humorously observed</a> that it seemed like rapping or playing basketball were the only two ways to make it out of America’s inner cities. And yet, even with hip hop’s well-established relationship with basketball, there’s probably never been anyone who better personifies the connection than J Cole.</p> <p>“<em>Jermaine</em> Cole,” corrects Ansh Sanyal, the CEBL’s senior marketing director. “That’s his basketball name.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdQgGYB3fzc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GdQgGYB3fzc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Basketball has been a big part of Cole’s life since childhood. In <a href=\"https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2013/06/12/j-cole-on-his-hoop-dreams-and-why-the-world-wont-allow-lebron-to-be-as-great-as-mj\">a 2013 interview with Sports Illustrated</a>, he said, “I was always in love with basketball as a kid, but I thought I was way better than I really was.” He also admits that, although he did play on his high school team, he wasn’t a star. <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2704529-the-oral-history-of-j-coles-basketball-career\">Neither did he make the cut</a> when he tried out for the college team at St John’s University during his freshman year. It was at that point that Cole decided to fully turn his attention toward a career in music. Basketball, however, always remained in the background.</p> <p>Cole’s rap fame eventually allowed him to play in settings where his basketball talent was noticed by the broader public. His <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42W-I9MTyQo\">alley-oop on a pass from comedian Kevin Hart</a> in the 2012 NBA All-Star celebrity game is one of the best highlights the (often unmemorable) event has ever produced. Eventually, Cole was able to leave novelty basketball behind for professional competition in the CEBL.</p> <p>It’s reasonable to conclude that Cole’s career in the CEBL was established primarily for non-basketball (ie, marketing) reasons. The situation offered Cole a chance to live out his dream of playing professional basketball as a sort of midlife vanity project. Cole’s presence, not so coincidentally, would allow the CEBL the kind of media attention it wouldn’t have received otherwise, equivalent to millions of dollars in advertising.</p> <p>Sanyal is keen to stress that the marketing benefits were not the primary reason for Cole’s signing. “The big thing was: ‘Can he play? Can he hold up?’” says Sanyal. “And it seemed like yes, that was the case.”</p> <p>This is, of course, what a marketing director is supposed to say. Bluntly, Cole is a 37-year-old musician who was a good, but not great, high school player. The data doesn’t provide much supporting evidence for his basketball skills either. For example, Cole is one of only two players on the Shooting Stars who didn’t play college basketball (guard <a href=\"https://www.scarboroughshootingstars.ca/sarunas-vasiliauskas--bio-page\">Sarunas Vasiliakuskas</a> is from Lithuania, where college basketball is less relevant. He previously played on Lithuania’s national team). Additionally, the CEBL skews young and Cole is much older than most other players on the team. Even Cole seems to have a sense of humor about his single-digit scoring tendencies. After hitting two three-pointers against the Newfoundland Growlers, he <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CejeRGxli-i/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=53bec111-d478-4ae4-b8cb-9254ac23a598\">posted to Instagram</a> that he’d “shattered [his] previous career high.”</p> <p>And what do players and coaches say about Cole’s skills? He played in practice sessions with the women’s team at St John’s to help sharpen their skills. His peers saw him as a competent player: “I thought he was decent,” former St John’s player <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2704529-the-oral-history-of-j-coles-basketball-career\">Monique McLean told Bleacher Report</a> in 2017. “His best thing was just getting to the basket, because he’s kind of tall and long. Finishing around the basket, he could shoot a little bit.”</p> <p>Fred Quartlebaum, who was assistant coach on the men’s team during Cole’s time at St John’s, praised the rapper for “working hard and doing some really, really good things”, but added: “I think he made the right choice, in terms of a music career”.</p> <p>Indeed, the more one examines the situation, the more difficult it becomes to believe he’s there for anything other than commercial purposes.</p> <p>This isn’t the first time these issues have been raised. In 2021, Cole played for the Rwanda Patriots of the <a href=\"https://bal.nba.com/\">Basketball Africa League</a> (BAL) and many of the same concerns emerged. “I think [Cole] took someone’s job that deserves it,” <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/31504107/j-cole-presence-bal-disrespectful-game-sale-stoglin\">guard Terrell Stoglin said at the time.</a> Stoglin is a former University of Maryland standout who played for the BAL’s <a href=\"https://www.assbasketball.com/\">AS Sale</a> during Cole’s stint with the Patriots. “For a guy who has so much money and has another career to just come here and average, like, one point a game and still get glorified is very disrespectful to the game. It’s disrespectful to the ones who sacrificed their whole lives for this.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"49d730e7f7be7fbdb9430eb3286ee6856b91ad6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49d730e7f7be7fbdb9430eb3286ee6856b91ad6f/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"J Cole’s Scarborough Shooting Stars made it to this season’s championship game\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J Cole’s Scarborough Shooting Stars made it to this season’s championship game. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Osorio/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Stoglin’s opinions may represent the feelings of some players – after all, Cole is taking up a roster spot that could go to a young player more in need of a job and an opportunity to enter the professional game – he didn’t play on Cole’s team. The rapper’s actual teammates appear to value him, including those players whose playing time is most affected by his presence.</p> <p>“<em>I</em> was in that position,” says Scarborough forward <a href=\"https://www.scarboroughshootingstars.ca/olu-famutimi---bio-page\">Olu Famutimi</a>. “In the CEBL, you only have 10 active players for each game, and there were games [in which Cole played] that I didn’t make that 10-man roster. I was OK with it. Yes, I wanted to play but, being a vet, I understood.”</p> <p>At 38, (the only player older than Cole on the Shooting Stars) Famutimi’s opinions are informed by <em>a lot</em> of experience. In 2003, he was the first Canadian ever named to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_McDonald%27s_All-American_Boys_Game\">McDonald’s All-American</a> team, and he would go on to represent Canada at the Olympics and play against some of the greatest players of all time, including Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. (“Dwyane Wade was the toughest matchup that I ever guarded,” Famutimi says. “Every jump shot he took, I felt like I was contesting his knees.”)</p> <p>Famutimi played college basketball in the US, played in different leagues around the world (France, Germany, and Turkey were favorites), and played (preseason) NBA basketball. And, in his well-informed opinion, Cole’s presence was a good thing for the team.</p> <p>“When I first heard about [Cole’s signing], just like anybody else I was like: ‘This is a probably a good marketing scheme.’ [But] during training camp, when he was working hard, sweating his butt off just like everybody else, buying into team concepts … 100% he earned the respect of all of us. He fought and played hard in order to get on the court.”</p> <p>Cole’s stint in the CEBL turned out to be short-lived. He only played four games before leaving to perform (music) at some of this summer’s big festivals. But Famutimi believes Cole’s time with the Shooting Stars was a beneficial experience for everybody involved. “We wanted him to stay,” he says.</p> <p>Cole was similarly enthused by his teammates. “I’m on a team with a bunch of amazing guys,” <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cekd_C9lJjK/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=903024ed-e8f8-43e2-aff1-537988848464\">he said</a>. “And the league – it’s priceless what they’re allowing me to come in here and do, and experience, so I really appreciate it.”</p> <p>Whatever his merits as a player, Cole has had an impact. “I’m thankful to Jermaine Cole … for bringing that light to the CEBL,” says Sanyal. “What [Cole’s presence] did was amplify attention to the product we were confident of showcasing … it’s some darn good basketball.”</p> <p>This is, of course, what a marketing director is supposed to say. But many CEBL fans and players – Cole included – may well argue it’s also true.<br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/18/fishermans-friends-one-and-all-review-flavourless-reheat-of-factory-made-britcom","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T08:00:40Z","webTitle":"Fisherman’s Friends: One and All review – flavourless reheat of factory-made Britcom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/18/fishermans-friends-one-and-all-review-flavourless-reheat-of-factory-made-britcom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/18/fishermans-friends-one-and-all-review-flavourless-reheat-of-factory-made-britcom","fields":{"headline":"Fisherman’s Friends: One and All review – flavourless reheat of factory-made Britcom","trailText":"Sequel to comedy about a singing group of mates fortuitously brought to fame is likable enough but all too predictable","byline":"Cath Clarke","body":"<p>In 2019, Cornwall’s sea shanty group Fisherman’s Friends got the Full Monty treatment, when the story of how they hit the big time after a record exec discovered them singing down their local pub inspired <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/13/fishermans-friends-review-seaswept-britcom-reels-in-the-laughs\">a good-humoured harmless comedy</a>. One the major charms of Fisherman’s Friends is their authenticity: a bunch of mates singing for pleasure and for each other is a world away from manufactured pop.

James Purefoy returns as lead singer Jim, who has hit the bottle after the death of his dad, Fisherman’s co-founder Jago, at the end of the first movie.

But they’re most devoted to each other, uploading their daily private lives into a shared virtual diary until the day Leni disappears in a suspected burglary, pulling Gina back to Mt Echo.</p> <p>Unfortunately, little of the tension you could infer from this description makes it to the screen in this seven-episode series, which has some wild gesticulations but featherweight emotional heft. Created by Australian writer-director Vanessa Gazy, Echoes is both ridiculous and cheap-looking, neither of which is a crime if you can deliver on at least one dramatic hook – suspense, creepiness, a suspicious backstory, a haunting, envy, sex. Echoes reaches for all of these, yet struggles to capture a real feeling, its mysteries hollow, its deceptions shallow, and its various tones at best out of rhythm.

It’s impossible to describe the rest of the show without this so, spoiler alert, although it’s in the official synopsis (if not the trailer): since they were children, Leni and Gina have occasionally switched places, pretending to be each other and thus experiencing both lives (and romantic partners and, eventually, Leni’s daughter Mattie). As adults, they switch every year on their birthdays; the “Gina” we meet is actually Leni, desperate to find “Leni” (Gina) and playing both roles in the meantime in Mt Echo. (The Australian-produced series was filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina, which believably stands in for Virginia). Gina as “Leni” left a mess – she and Jack are estranged, her best friend Meg (Alise Willis) won’t speak to her, she’s been selling ketamine on the black market. The first four episodes (of six available for review) follow Leni as she attempts to decipher why an antagonistic Gina has fled from her, her distress often conveyed in clumsy voiceover via the virtual diary.</p> <p>Echoes limply tries several different lanes for this mystery: thriller, in “Leni’s” suspicious disappearance and Leni’s search for Gina; crime drama, as a jarringly condescending sheriff, Louise Floss (Karen Robinson), puts together the pieces; psychological drama, as intrusive memories – flailing limbs in a tub, a burning church, their mother’s death from cancer – paralyze Leni in blunt, unprovocative blurs; romance, as flashbacks reveal the young Leni’s relationship with Jack and Gina’s bond with a troubled boy named Dylan, played as an adult with an edginess too sharp for this series by Jonathan Tucker. There’s even a swerve into horror lite with a sequence involving a beheaded doll, a secret language, and seemingly voodoo ritual for the twins’ switch – which, it turns out, amounts to merely changing hair, makeup and accent (Leni’s is southern).</p> <p>None of these really work despite Monaghan’s best efforts in two puddle-deep roles; for the bulk of the series, Leni and Gina’s characterizations essentially boil down to Leni loved one boy and Gina loved another, with some jealousy mixed in. Leni’s act upon returning to Mt Echo is transparent (the other characters think she’s acting strangely because it <em>is</em> strange that “Leni” would have no context for the last year of her life), but Monaghan plays Leni with such tunnel-vision focus, and her deceptions are presented with such ominous-score seriousness, that it almost comes off as funny.</p> <p>The show’s ambient meh-ness – not once did its plays for shock or suspense elevate my heart rate, and that includes several shots lingering on a fake burned body – makes it easier to notice the seams that would otherwise flow by. The young actors cast to play teenage Leni, Gina, Jack and Dylan barely resemble their adult counterparts, if at all. Gina’s plan, once revealed in a Gina-centric episode that offered the most surprise of the season, makes negative sense. Jack and Leni are written as if they barely know each other. Maybe the seventh and final episode will wrap up several threads left dangling, but Echoes offers little incentive to stick out its 40 to 50-minute chapters.</p> <p>My physical reactions while watching this series – shrug, eye roll, blank stare, “huh” – are typical for a certain category of Netflix original: disposable content that’s barely passable but just watchable enough to likely garner millions of views. Echoes is less in the lane of Stranger Things, Russian Doll or the OA and more like last year’s irksome thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/23/clickbait-review-silly-netflix-thriller-series\">Clickbait</a>, part of what Slate fittingly called <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2021/08/netflix-top-10-movies-shows-clickbait.html\">“the clickbaitification of Netflix”</a>.

It had burst the banks and was extensive.</p> <p>That evening heavy rain returned and came in steady for a few hours. I went to bed at about 10pm. I was lying in bed listening to the rain. I grew up with tin roofs and heavy rains so I love the sounds and the abundance it symbolises. I was drifting, thinking about healing Country – as I often do – and waterscaping the garden to better harness the rain.</p> <p>Suddenly, around 11pm, the rain intensity increased. I felt the energy shift and a deep, hollow feeling filled within my belly.</p> <p>A massive recovery effort followed the evacuations. There was an amazing community response but it appears that agencies involved were very under-resourced and not well prepared for such an extreme event.

They are critical ecosystem functions which act to recharge and clean out catchments but they are bad if people clear land, carve up the earth and drain the wetlands, which is what happens to most of the affected areas.</p> <p>There is growing recognition of the role Indigenous people can play in dealing with extreme events and mitigating impacts on their communities, including cultural and environmental values.</p> <p>Indigenous communities display great resilience and have longstanding connections to their Country. They hold traditional knowledge and continue customary practices that can assist in planning, response, recovery and resilience to climate change and extreme events.</p> <p>For millions of years, water has flowed across this place we call Bundjalung Jagun, shaping the landscape and teaching us Lore. There are many traditional stories that teach about the way the ancestors shaped the Country. We also have stories about how people cared for Country by protecting areas and species in places or seasonally or how species moved or were shifted around to maintain kinship and abundance. I believe the 2017 and 2022 floods, and the 2019 and 2022 bushfires, are important stories that our old people would have created stories about and told them for thousands of years.</p> <p>Many people don’t trust the river as it bursts its banks and flows across the floodplains inundating homes and livelihoods.

The truth is that people are both the problem and the solution, not the river. The only way to learn is from the river, like our old people did when they sat on its high banks of red and green.

Healing the river will help heal people too. Hopefully we will all learn and share these connections. We need to trust the river more now than ever before.

It is because most people have forgotten the Lores of the sky, land and water. Bundjalung Jagun was once a very healthy place for our old people and the ones before them.

Brunch. Iced coffee. All beloved by the gay community way before they went mainstream. Similarly, no celebration of a decade of dating apps would be complete without acknowledging that the LGBTQ+ community ran to a different calendar there, too.</p> <p>The daddy of our contributions to now-ubiquitous swipe culture is the infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/grindr\">Grindr</a>, launched in 2009 and originally designed to coordinate hookups between likeminded gentlemen tired of chatting on glitchy websites or over discounted cocktails in samey bars. Grindr’s runaway success wasn’t just down to cutting out various dating-world middlemen, it also fulfilled a genuine need for the LGBTQ+ community.</p> <p>Marginalised people have always found sanctuary on the internet, scurrying to secluded corners to be better understood by those who shared their distinctive struggles, kinks or slightly nerdy hobbies; all things that might be mocked by the more conventionally attractive bantersauruses roaming our school corridors and haunting the chain pubs on our high streets. The walled gardens of early hookup apps also offered protection. There was no chance of barking up the wrong tree, or the immediate fear of physical violence. The rules of engagement were crystal clear and all but unspoken: the only prerequisite for entry was that you understood why you were there.</p> <p>In 2011, the founder of Grindr, Joel Simkhai, launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/sep/12/blendr-straight-dating-app-grindr\">Blendr</a>, to include women and straight men, beating all-in apps like Tinder by a full year. “Are there women out there who want to semi-randomly meet and hook up with guys just because those guys are good-looking and located close enough to them that it would be convenient to do so?” <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/grindr-creator-launches-blendr_n_954752\">asked HuffPost</a>, incredulously. Imagine! The answer was not really. Not yet.</p> <p>Although looking for sex on the internet wasn’t a new idea, Blendr distanced itself from its little yellow sibling and positioned itself as an app for “friendship”, confusing straight people more accustomed to making friends on social media rather than specialist apps. Tinder’s later success perhaps hinged on being more upfront about its romantic intentions. Either way, Blendr was soon hijacked by gay and bi men seeking … each other, with a veneer of respectability that Grindr’s reputation as a knocking shop didn’t offer.</p> <p>Complaining about the “state of the apps” is now a rite of passage for everyone, and LGBTQ+ users road-tested the uglier side of virtual interactions: from scolding each other for requesting nudes without a decent prelude; or imploring potential mates to “say more than just hi”; to enduring, then screenshotting and sharing, racism, fetishisation, fatphobia, transphobia and ageism, to name just a few. Calling out these behaviours may not have lasered them out of existence, but there’s been a definite shift toward kindness, and an understanding that noxious creeps won’t be tolerated.</p> <p>Nostalgic romantics will tell you pulling is best done in real life. A ritual meant to be performed in packs, where chemistry can brew and sparks can flare and any losers can be weeded out by your supporting crew. All well and good if you’re popular and live in a big city. Elsewhere, the LGBTQ+ scene is likely to be much reduced and underfunded, if it exists at all. Coming-of-age dramas are packed with brash, sprightly upstarts who jump on trains with all their belongings in a backpack, but for the shy and retiring, the financially stretched or those perfectly happy in the provinces, it’s not an option. The apps provided a space for those still curious about what was out there and who might struggle with the cut and thrust of IRL courtship rituals.</p> <p>Just as the squeakiest wheels always get the oil, the ripped torsos no doubt receive the most attention, but dating apps still forge communities among those who don’t fit that aesthetic, and they’ve been an important place for anyone struggling with their sexuality, or unable to live authentically publicly. Toxic arseholes aside, there has always been a sense that there’s someone out there for everyone and specialist apps carry a “take me as you find me” attitude that has perhaps been missing from real life interactions.</p> <p>Away from the sneers of peers, people were more willing to give each other a go. You could shoot your shot and, as long as you’d been respectful, hold your head high in the face of rejection. Listing your (harmless) likes and dislikes might seem cold and distant to a casual observer, but those who might otherwise have been ignored slowly managed to find each other.</p> <p>For lonely people, or those less able, less body confident, or less conventional, getting yourself in the room in the first place was always the hardest part. With dating apps, the room came to you – and so for once, you had the chance to own it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Justin Myers, also known as The Guyliner, is a freelance writer, and author of three novels, including The Fake-Up</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There were infrequent stops with Liverpool, taking part in pre-seasons but it never led to a competitive outing. Awoniyi always speaks glowingly of his times on the books at Anfield despite never pulling on the red shirt in anger, a sign of his positive attitude.</p> <p>He used last summer with Jürgen Klopp and the Liverpool first team to analyse Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and, in particular, Roberto Firmino to educate himself. It was instilled in him during Liverpool’s pre-season camp in Austria last summer that to reach the top a player needs to be dedicated and work hard every day.</p> <p>Not all Awoniyi’s loans were fruitful; he had to learn the hard way, cutting short a spell with Gent after failing to score in 15 league games. He was generally limited to time off the bench in a side that did not suit his style but it was acknowledged as another learning curve. His faith in God has always been very important to him, ensuring he continues to trust in the process to get him to where he is today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0c13d8441755d1bc4eb2fabc323f947e7ce27cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0c13d8441755d1bc4eb2fabc323f947e7ce27cd/0_100_2634_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taiwo Awoniyi training with Sadio Mané in 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taiwo Awoniyi training with Sadio Mané in 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were a plethora of reasons Forest targeted the 25-year-old as their first-choice No 9: he has speed, stamina to press – like Steve Cooper intends to play – and he scored 15 goals in 31 league matches for Union Berlin last season thanks to his smart movement in and around the area. The striker works incredibly hard off the ball and Forest are realistic enough to know they will spend most of the season without it. He is one of 16 signings to have arrived at the City Ground since Forest beat Huddersfield in the Championship playoff final – the latest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/18/nottingham-forest-35m-fee-wolves-morgan-gibbs-white\" title=\"\">Morgan Gibbs-White, is the new club record signing at £35m</a> – and provides a focal point in a team trying to gel.</p> <p>Forest had to beat off plenty of competition, including from Premier League rivals, to sign Awoniyi. He was taken to Athens with his agent to talk to Cooper about the role envisaged for him in this new-look Forest. The discussions were enough to persuade Awoniyi that Nottingham would be the perfect place to finally make his Premier League impact.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f633f78061b753574d59e655c477b52cbe7c2fe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f633f78061b753574d59e655c477b52cbe7c2fe8/0_0_2066_1343/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taiwo Awoniyi takes on Lukasz Fabianski.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taiwo Awoniyi takes on Lukasz Fabianski.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Brough/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Awoniyi is one of four players to join Forest from the Bundesliga this summer. The club saw greater value in Germany, where they could recruit ideal candidates for less than they could in England, and Bundesliga clubs needed money. Moussa Niakhaté and Orel Mangala also impressed in Forest’s first win of the season against West Ham. The trio are aged between 24 and 26, making them ripe for improvement and they could form the spine of the team for years to come. Omar Richards, meanwhile, joined from Bayern Munich but he is currently injured with a fractured leg.</p> <p>Admittedly, Awoniyi may not have imagined his first goal in the Premier League, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/nottingham-forest-west-ham-premierr-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the winner against West Ham</a>, would be from a clearance bouncing in off his knee but his chest-thumping celebration showed he did not care. “I’m really happy with the goal because it took me a long journey to get back to the Premier League,” he told BBC. “That’s why I’m very, very proud of myself, and of course I am grateful to God about it.” Awoniyi is from humble beginnings in Nigeria and has always had an incredible work ethic wherever he has played, focused on getting the chance to prove himself as a Premier League striker.</p> <p>As a child he had to sew his own boots to play. Those days are long behind him, but he never forgets where he came from or the ambitions he wants to achieve. He finally has the opportunity of stability to prove himself in the Premier League with a five-year contract at the City Ground thanks to years of hard graft in Nigeria and Europe. Awoniyi can now make England his long-term home and the Premier League his hunting ground.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/18/victoria-state-election-former-political-journalist-carol-altmann-seeks-to-ride-teal-wave","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"Victoria state election: former political journalist Carol Altmann seeks to ride ‘teal’ wave","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/18/victoria-state-election-former-political-journalist-carol-altmann-seeks-to-ride-teal-wave","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/18/victoria-state-election-former-political-journalist-carol-altmann-seeks-to-ride-teal-wave","fields":{"headline":"Victoria state election: former political journalist Carol Altmann seeks to ride ‘teal’ wave","trailText":"Warrnambool-based independent will challenge Liberal MP Roma Britnell in the seat of South-West Coast","byline":"Adeshola Ore","body":"<p>A former political journalist will run as an independent candidate in Victoria’s November election in the Liberal-held marginal seat of South-West Coast, in an attempt to leverage the “teal” wave that dislodged Coalition candidates at the federal election.</p> <p>Carol Altmann, a Warrnambool-based independent journalist, will challenge lower house Liberal MP Roma Britnell, who holds the seat on a margin of 3.2%, after a redrawing of electoral boundaries.</p> <p>The seat sits within the federal seat of Wannon, where Liberal MP Dan Tehan suffered a swing of more than 6% after the campaign of teal independent candidate Alex Dyson at May’s federal election.</p> <p>Altmann, 57, told Guardian Australia she had drawn inspiration from Cathy McGowan , the former federal independent MP for the rural Victorian seat of Indi, after growing a following through her local independent publication, the Terrier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/nomi-kaltmann-announced-as-the-first-teal-candidate-selected-to-run-in-victorian-election\">Nomi Kaltmann announced as the first ‘teal’ candidate selected to run in Victorian election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“That kind of community grassroots activism – that is now forming the basis of the teals – was really what I’d been doing here for nine years,” she said.</p> <p>“But I’m different because … a lot of the [teal] candidates are coming out of other political backgrounds.”</p> <p>Altmann – who was born in Warrnambool and had covered South Australian politics for News Corp – launched her campaign 100 days before November’s state election.</p> <p>She said she was open to funding from fundraising group Climate 200, which had backed teal candidates at the federal election.</p> <p>The executive director of Climate 200, Byron Fay, said there was “significant” potential for an independent campaign to be “competitive” in the South-West Coast electorate.</p> <p>“Alex Dyson ran an incredible grassroots community campaign in his bid to become the federal member for Wannon and came within a few thousand votes of winning,” Fay said.</p> <p>“Voters in the western districts are clearly looking for a different type of more meaningful political representation.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e46658756f7d58f7c7f2715f7f71f4f102eb239\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e46658756f7d58f7c7f2715f7f71f4f102eb239/0_212_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carol Altmann is standing on a pier leaning up against a white railing.

It is believed to be the world’s largest GPS drawing. You can see photos of their trip <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bicycleswillsavetheworld_/\">on their Instagram account</a>.</em></p> <p>We really, really love cycling. Like everyone, we’ve become more aware of climate change, and we wanted to add our voices to what should be a bigger chorus. We think using the bike as a form of transport is a wonderful thing, and wanted to do something.</p> <p>The idea of the trip was a gradual thing. We thought about trying to inspire people somehow about bikes. We can’t even remember who first came up with the idea of drawing the bike. But it seemed like the best and most fun way of putting across our message. We’re both physicists, but we both quit our jobs as researchers and decided to do it.</p> <p>Arianna used a computer programme to draw a bicycle, and then Google Maps to match it to a route. The first attempt didn’t go very well. The drawing was almost done and we realised there was a big bump in the route. Zooming in, we saw we had put it right through Charles de Gaulle airport. So we had to move everything by a few kilometres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f000df8e3db6fdf3a57445eb32f3ef99709a4d67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f000df8e3db6fdf3a57445eb32f3ef99709a4d67/0_229_1144_686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The GPS image of a bike, which took 4,500 miles of riding to create.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The GPS image of a bike, which took 4,500 miles of riding to create.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Rayneau-Kirkhope/Arianna Casiraghi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We actually started in 2019, and should have finished it then. But Arianna had a knee injury, and we had stop after a couple of months that summer. We began again that November, but had to stop again because it was too cold to camp. We were going to start again in March 2020, but then the pandemic happened.</p> <p>It’s been very start-stop, and quite difficult. This time the heat was difficult. With cycling at least you get a breeze, but it got up to 39C. But we’ve finished now – on 9 August. Overall, it was 131 days of cycling, and some rest days, so about four months.</p> <p>Daniel built both the bikes, and Zola – she’s named after Gianfranco Zola, the footballer, even though she’s female – went in the cargo bike. She jumps in and out happily, and makes it plain when she wants to walk. She’s a Lagotto Romagnolo, an Italian water dog.</p> <p>We were carrying a lot of stuff – tents, sleeping bags, all that. And Zola. We tried to camp most of the time but did also stay in hotels and Airbnb occasionally. Before the pandemic we stayed with some people with the Warmshowers community, who host people who are touring by bike.</p> <p>The bicycle picture shows the full ride, apart from a few places where we had to go off the route to a campsite, and then back to the same point. One time we came to a crossing of the Rhine, with a very small ferry, and it wasn’t running, so we had to do a deviation of 50km, which we removed. So there is a small point where it isn’t continuous, which is annoying.</p> <p>Apart from that, it was only broken at the end of the handlebars. We didn’t repeat the route on the handlebars. But we did ride the fork and the seatpost twice.</p> <p>We didn’t stick 100% to the route we planned. It’s so big that if you wiggle around it by 5km or even 10km it’s OK. So we tried to go on small roads where possible, or off road, also so Zola could walk a bit.</p> <p>Being able to finally see the bike on the map is mainly a relief. We had so many obstacles. When we started this time we were thinking – what can go wrong this time? We felt we had let people down by not completing it, and our life felt kind of stuck. So we’re very happy now.</p> <p>If people see the image, the message we want to put across is: please do remember that you probably have a bicycle somewhere, and it would be nice if you could use it a little bit more, rather than a car, for short journeys. At least think about using a bike – it’s cheaper and healthier. And, of course, it’s really enjoyable.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/18/exit-of-stalwarts-james-hildreth-darren-stevens-reminds-english-cricket-what-it-is-losing","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"Exit of stalwarts Stevens and Hildreth reminds English cricket what it is losing | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/18/exit-of-stalwarts-james-hildreth-darren-stevens-reminds-english-cricket-what-it-is-losing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/18/exit-of-stalwarts-james-hildreth-darren-stevens-reminds-english-cricket-what-it-is-losing","fields":{"headline":"Exit of stalwarts Stevens and Hildreth reminds English cricket what it is losing","trailText":"Veteran duo never quite made it to the international arena and their type of long county careers might not be seen again","byline":"Andy Bull","body":"<p>The announcements have fallen like raindrops in the last few days. Jonny Bairstow has joined the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders, Jos Buttler has signed for the Paarl Royals, Samit Patel, Will Smeed and Jordan Thompson have all been picked up by Mumbai Indians’ Emirates team, Sam Curran and Liam Livingstone by their side based in Cape Town. Each one is a sign of changing times. It felt like two smaller, but more significant, press releases out of county cricket got lost among the rush. Darren Stevens has been released by Kent, after 26 seasons on the circuit, and James Hildreth has retired from Somerset, after 19.</p> <p>Stevens hasn’t given up on cricket yet. He told the BBC: “I still feel like I can do a job with bat and ball,” and you can imagine him saying much the same thing to the nurse leaning over him on his deathbed. Stevens, who has the indefatigable optimism of a man who has spent his 40s bowling medium pace against the best batsmen in England, was never going to leave the game of his own volition. Hildreth, though, really has finished. He was going to play out the rest of the season, but he brought his retirement forward after he injured a hamstring in a one-day game against Durham last week. It’s a quietly understated exit for a quiet and understated player.</p> <p>You’ll find the two of them right near each other in the list of the County Championship’s leading run-scorers. Stevens is 222nd, with 15,740, Hildreth is two places behind him, 224th, with 15,698. There isn’t another player around now in the top 250, or even anywhere close. Of course, the two had more opportunity to do it, because neither ever played international cricket, although both came close. You could argue into the night about which of them you might describe as the best player of their generation never to be picked by England.</p> <p>Hildreth played for England through the age groups, from the under‑15s through to the under-19s and on into the Lions team, which he ended up captaining. He scored plenty of centuries along the way: 116 in an under‑19 Test against South Africa, 210 in another against Bangladesh, 206 for the England Performance team against Queensland, 149 against the Leeward Islands and 100 more against the Windwards for the Lions. But he only ever made it into the full England side as a sub-fielder in the 2005 Ashes, when he caught Ricky Ponting at Lord’s. That was the same year he hit 38 off 24 balls against Australia, when Somerset scored 343 to beat them in a one-day game.</p> <p>Everyone knew then that Hildreth was going to make his Test debut sooner or later. They had been talking about it since he was a student, when he took 101 off a Durham attack led by Shoaib Akhtar in his second championship match. Akhtar didn’t take kindly to being hit for four by a student, and bowled faster, and faster, at him. It didn’t make any difference. Hildreth might have been called up in 2007, when he averaged 53, or 2010, when he averaged 65, or 2012, when he averaged 52, or 2015, when he averaged 55. But he wasn’t. And as the seasons went by the talk turned, so that it wasn’t about when he would be picked but whether he ever would and then why he never was.</p> <p>Hildreth said himself he had never been consistent enough. “I’ve not had a poor career, but I’ve been inconsistent,” he said, when he’d been left out again. “I’m around the 1,000-run mark most years but I don’t kick on. That’s the story of my career.” In his early days his elegant strokeplay meant he was often compared to Mark Lathwell, the lavishly talented Somerset opener who played two Tests and was never picked again and, as with Lathwell, there was a lingering suspicion that Hildreth wasn’t tough enough to make it in Test cricket. I was once told, off the record, that he had scored poorly in the personality tests England use to evaluate future players.</p> <p>Why that mattered more than the fact that Hildreth once scored 135 in a crucial championship match against Nottinghamshire batting on one leg after Jake Ball fractured his ankle with a yorker, I’m not sure. That was in 2016, the year Somerset finished runners-up, again, thwarted this time by Yorkshire’s late collapse at Lord’s. You guess the selectors were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/24/darren-stevens-has-a-cult-following-but-is-still-sorely-underappreciated\" title=\"\">wrong, too, about Stevens</a>, who should have played white-ball cricket for England. He never had Hildreth’s problem. It wasn’t for a want of wanting it that he was never selected. He got five games for the Lions in 2010, and did well, with three half-centuries in four innings against India A, but not so well that he persuaded the men who mattered that his bits and pieces were enough for international cricket.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c9c4ca6a5efed0ce7644365042d888d20677218\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c9c4ca6a5efed0ce7644365042d888d20677218/0_291_5412_3249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner at Canterbury says it all.

And, of course, there’s something bittersweet about that, too, now. They are champions of a competition which has underpinned English cricket for more than 130 years but which, in the current era, has been poorly treated by administrators who prefer to invest in popcorn cricket between teams whose histories were invented by the marketing department.</p> <p>Hildreth spent his entire career at Somerset and he never played for a franchise team, in England or anywhere else. Back in his early years, plenty of people had that career. Twenty years later, it seems unlikely any will ever have it again.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/18/couple-draw-giant-4500-mile-gps-bicycle-across-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"Couple draw giant 4,500-mile GPS bicycle across Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/18/couple-draw-giant-4500-mile-gps-bicycle-across-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/18/couple-draw-giant-4500-mile-gps-bicycle-across-europe","fields":{"headline":"Couple draw giant 4,500-mile GPS bicycle across Europe","trailText":"Anglo-Italian pair – accompanied by their dog – hoped to highlight scale of climate crisis and encourage bike use","byline":"Peter Walker","body":"<p>Faced by the threat of the climate emergency, some people recycle more, or turn down the central heating thermostat a notch.

But grades are likely to be significantly lower than last year, when almost 45% of all A-levels were graded A or A*.</p> <p>Schools that benefited from the biggest grade uplift during the pandemic are likely to see the sharpest falls, among them independent schools where the proportion of top grades rose by nine percentage points to 70%, compared with six percentage points elsewhere.</p> <p>On Thursday, the education secretary, James Cleverly, said it was “always the plan” to get results down this year after more generous grades during the pandemic, but insisted that most students would get their first choice of universities.</p> <p>Speaking to Sky News he said: “Students might get slightly lower grades than perhaps they were expecting and hoping for [but] I think we should see the majority of students get into the institutions they want to.</p> <p>“Today we are going to see hundreds of thousands of happy students getting into their first choice institutions and plenty of others going to great universities or apprenticeships or employment, using clearing, or clearing plus all the other advice and assistance available to them.”</p> <p>He added: “What we have got to do is get back to school-based teaching and exam-based assessment. This year, we have taken a step towards normality. This is what the teaching profession wants and its students, employers and institutions want. We have done it in a progressive and fair way.”</p> <p>Headteachers in the state sector – who have had an early viewing of their results, which went out to schools on Wednesday – were cautiously optimistic, reporting few surprises and in some cases better than expected results. Uncertainty remains around university places, however, with higher demand from a bigger cohort and conservative offer-making from leading institutions.</p> <p>Cleverly<strong> </strong>said: “Despite the nerves that people will feel, I want to reassure anyone collecting their results that whatever your grades, there has never been a better range of opportunities available.</p> <p>“Whether going on to one of our world-leading universities, a high-quality apprenticeship, or the world of work, students have exciting options as they prepare to take their next steps.”</p> <p>An analysis from the Liberal Democrats suggested 75,000 A-level entries would be downgraded from A and A* because of changes to grade boundaries. The research, based on a simplified version of exam boards’ grading process that draws a rigid midpoint between 2021 and pre-pandemic grading, suggests some subjects may be worse affected than others.</p> <p>Mathematics, sociology, law, English and business studies had the smallest reduction in A and A* grades, whereas music, drama, Spanish, performing arts and PE had the biggest. There was a broad trend towards humanities subjects being more affected by the shifting grade boundaries.</p> <p>Mark Corver, founder of dataHE, which advises universities on admissions, said he expected “the gap between expectations and outcomes might be very wide this year”, given that the current cohort had seen their slightly older peers “going to selective universities in record numbers”.</p> <p>“It wouldn’t have been unreasonable if they envisaged a similar future for themselves, but that’s quite unlikely to occur,” he said. He added that this year’s admissions cycle would feel like a step backwards, closer to the “supply-constrained” years of 2010-12, and reversing “a decade of essentially increasing student choice”.</p> <p>The university admissions service, Ucas, expects “the majority” of students will gain a place at their first choice university, but the situation on the ground is still fluid.</p> <p>Ella Kirkbride, the head of admissions at the University of Hull, said: “We anticipate demand for places through clearing will be high.

Freud by Andrew Nagorski review – a real-life thriller","trailText":"A gripping account of how colleagues and admirers spirited the psychoanalyst from Nazi-controlled Vienna to London","byline":"Kathryn Hughes","body":"<p>By the spring of 1938 everyone in Sigmund Freud’s circle, apart from the great man, could see that the game was up. In March, the Nazis had annexed Austria, putting the founder of psychoanalysis – known to them as “a Jewish pseudoscience” – at enormous risk. By now Freud was 82, terminally ill and determined not to panic. Five years earlier, when the Nazis had made a public bonfire of his books in Germany, he had breezily declared: “What progress we are making. In the middle ages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/24/history1\" title=\"\">they would have burnt me</a>; nowadays they are content with burning my books.” If only that had been the case.</p> <p>Why was Freud so convinced that he didn’t need to worry? Partly because he had spent a lifetime claiming that he didn’t do politics, apparently unaware that politics might still insist on doing something to him. The <em>sturm</em> and <em>drang</em> of Bolshevism and nazism and everything in between struck him merely as a noisy sideshow, the outward manifestation of various individuals’ ragged inner lives. Sort out the oedipal complex, the death drive and other bits and pieces, and international common sense would return. So the old man clung on in Vienna, the city where he had lived for all but the first three years of his life, convinced that things would come right in the end.</p> <p>They didn’t, of course, and this thrilling book, as edge-of-your-seat gripping as any heist movie, tells the story of how a “rescue squad” was marshalled to get Freud out of danger before it was too late. It included Freud’s devoted daughter Anna, his first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/10/biography.features\" title=\"\">biographer Ernest Jones</a> and Marie Bonaparte, not only a pioneering female psychoanalyst but, most usefully, a princess of both Greece and Denmark. Even more important was Max Schur, Freud’s personal physician, who was tasked with taking care of a man so riddled with jaw cancer that even his beloved dog shied away from the stench of decay. Together, this devoted team managed to get permission for Freud and his extended family to travel by the Orient Express to Paris and from there to London.</p> <p>Britain suited Freud. He’d visited as a young man and maintained that he would be happy to live there permanently despite “the rain, fog, drunkenness and conservatism”. America might have been a safer bet, but Freud had spent his career being rude about it. On 28 July 1938, the family bought a house at 20 Maresfield Gardens in Hampstead with a mortgage of £4,000 from Barclays Bank. By this time, Freud was too ill to work, although he did feel strong enough to have Leonard and Virginia Woolf over for tea. Just over a year later he was dead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/10/biography.features\">Observer review: Freud’s Wizard by Brenda Maddox</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrew Nagorski spikes his thriller with truly terrifying notes. Shortly before the dash for freedom, two of Freud’s children, Anna and Martin, were questioned by the Gestapo. They had taken the precaution of asking Schur for a deadly barbiturate to take if torture ensued. Moreover, four of Freud’s elderly sisters stayed in Austria; three perished in Treblinka, while the fourth starved to death. At the end of this otherwise excellent book we are still left pondering how Freud himself, whose work was all about facing up to the unpleasant realities of human life, could carry on believing for so long that he alone could give History the slip.</p> <p><em>• </em>Saving Freud: a Life in Vienna and an Escape to Freedom in London by Andrew Nagorski is published by Icon (£20).

But the country is rapidly expanding cervical cancer testing and has deployed tens of thousands of community health workers to raise awareness of the disease.

Instead, they are caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types are cancers, chronic respiratory illnesses, diabetes and cardiovascular disease – heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 80% are preventable, and all are on the rise, spreading inexorably around the world as ageing populations and lifestyles pushed by economic growth and urbanisation make being unhealthy a global phenomenon.</p>\n    <p>NCDs, once seen as illnesses of the wealthy, now have a grip on the poor. Disease, disability and death are perfectly designed to create and widen inequality – and being poor makes it less likely you will be diagnosed accurately or treated.</p>\n    <p>Investment in tackling these common and chronic conditions that kill 71% of us is incredibly low, while the cost to families, economies and communities is staggeringly high.</p>\n    <p>In low-income countries NCDs – typically slow and debilitating illnesses – are seeing a fraction of the money needed being invested or donated.

It can take five to 10 years in women with weakened immune systems, such as those with untreated HIV.</p> \n<p>“We know that cervical cancer is a preventable cancer, which is also potentially curable should we be able to diagnose it early enough,” says Dr Princess Nothemba Simelela, assistant director-general for family, women, children and adolescents at the WHO. “Women continue to die needlessly from this cancer.”</p> \n<p>The burden is the greatest in Africa, she adds, because access to public health services is limited and screening and treatment for the disease have not been widely implemented.</p> \n<p>The WHO has sought to galvanise efforts to tackle the disease. In 2020, it adopted the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/cervical-cancer-elimination-initiative#cms\">global strategy for cervical cancer elimination</a> by 2030. To eliminate cervical cancer, all countries must reach and maintain an incidence rate of below four per 100,000 women. In Rwanda, the rate in 2020 was 28.2. In Eswatini it was 84.6 – one the highest in the world. In the UK, meanwhile, the rate was 9.9 and in Australia, 5.6.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If this was a cancer that affected men in the way it does women, we would be having a different conversation</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dr Princess Nothemba Simelela, WHO</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>To achieve the goal, countries must ensure 90% of girls are fully vaccinated with the HPV vaccine by the age of 15; 70% of women must be screened by the age of 35, and again at 45; 90% of women who are pre-cancerous should be treated while 90% of women with invasive cancer should have the condition managed.</p> \n<p>In 2011, Rwanda became the first African country to introduce a national HPV vaccination campaign, offering vaccines to all 12-year-old girls in schools. Since it began, the programme has consistently achieved over 90% coverage. More than 1.2 million girls and women have been fully vaccinated with two doses.</p> \n<p>Before the vaccine was introduced, teachers told students about the importance of the vaccine, and the threat posed by cervical cancer. Community health workers went from house to house explaining the benefits of the vaccine and dispelling myths, such as links with infertility.</p> \n<p>Coverage over the past two years has dropped as the Covid-19 pandemic forced schools to close. Dr Hassan Sibomana, who works for Rwanda’s ministry of health and is responsible for coordinating immunisation programmes, says catch-up campaigns are under way.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/25/diabetes-and-high-blood-pressure-why-are-urban-diseases-affecting-refugees-acc\">Diabetes and high blood pressure: why are ‘urban’ diseases affecting refugees?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But eliminating cervical cancer isn’t cheap. The HPV vaccine programme is being financed by the Rwandan government and Gavi, a global vaccine alliance. </p> \n<p>“More than 80% of the cost of vaccines are covered by Gavi, so you understand it is not easy to sustain this programme,” says Sibomana.</p> \n<p>Screening is also expensive. An HPV test is $25 (£20). The Rwandan government covers part of the cost,with the rest coming from Unitaid (via the Clinton Health Access Initiative), Partners in Health and the World Bank.</p> \n<p>Uwinkindi has plans to get the screening programme included under Rwanda’s community health insurance plan, which costs $3 per person for a year.</p> \n<p>Similela, at the WHO, admits that “costs [of preventing and identifying cervical cancer] are prohibitive”, though says work is being done to change this. She wants to see manufacturing of vaccines, tests and devices move to Africa.</p> \n<p>She believes costs are so high because cervical cancer affects women, not men. “I believe that if this was a cancer that affected men in the way it does women, we would be having a different conversation,” she says. “Advocacy and allocation of resources would be a different ballgame altogether.”</p> \n<p>She adds: “What I see [worldwide] is women get a lot of attention when they’re pregnant, but beyond that nothing exists really in the public health system for women.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7abfc557a4537bfeecea27bd0c5ccb04ed2f46a8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7abfc557a4537bfeecea27bd0c5ccb04ed2f46a8/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Midwife Patricie Mukarukundo hold up a swab as she explains the HPV test.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women wait to be screened for cervical cancer.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Johnson/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Rwanda appears to be going against this narrative. “In our culture, we consider women as the hearts of the family,” says Uwinkindi. “We know that if you empower women, you empower the entire family and society.”</p> \n<p>The country provides chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cervical cancer, and gynaecologists can learn how to perform advanced procedures through a fellowship programme. Uwinkindi admits some women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer “get lost in follow up”. </p> \n<p>Similela recognises that Rwanda is “a frontrunner” on the path to eliminate cervical cancer and is an example for others to follow. The Gambia and Malawi are also doing well, she adds.</p> \n<p>She says she thinks Rwanda could be the first country to eliminate cervical cancer. “[I feel it] very strongly, because of their political leadership, the commitment that you see when you speak to them and the conviction of their efforts.”</p> \n<p><em>Sign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly:</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Her Stage\"> \n <iframe id=\"her-stage\" name=\"her-stage\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/her-stage\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--her-stage\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up for Her Stage – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>• This article was amended on 23 August 2022 to clarify that part of the funding for Rwanda’s HPV screening comes from Unitaid, not the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which helps to implement the programme.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/17/storms-and-flash-floods-hit-southern-england-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T06:15:18Z","webTitle":"Storms and flash floods hit southern England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/storms-and-flash-floods-hit-southern-england-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/storms-and-flash-floods-hit-southern-england-london","fields":{"headline":"UK weather: storms and flash floods hit southern England","trailText":"Amber warning issued for London with risk of transport disruption and power cuts","byline":"Nadeem Badshah","body":"<p>Thunderstorms and flash floods have hit parts of southern England, amid warnings that the unsettled weather is expected to continue into the weekend.</p> \n<p>There were torrential downpours in London, with the rain spreading across the south-east until about 10pm.

An unworthy thought, I know.</p> <p>And then, this week, it happened for real. As I walked to the shops some lads packed into a small car all had a right yell at me, making various hand signals.

Before I knew it I was hurrying away, resisting the urge to punch the air. But before long guilt had set in. It was hardly my fault: apart from looking round at them, I hadn’t engaged at all. They had meant no real harm, though, and the poor bloke in front was plainly blameless. I couldn’t imagine anyone was hurt; it was a relatively minor shunt.

Those with an international licence can expect to pay more than £1,500. Insurers call it “risk assessment”; to the rest of us it looks like discrimination.</p> <p>According to the Association of British Insurers, providers always comply with equality legislation, even though the Equalities Act says customers cannot be disadvantaged because of their nationality. In practice, it seems that they can be, provided companies have strong justification for doing so. “Strong justification” in this situation is the insistence by insurers that drivers born overseas tend to make higher claims.</p> <p>Alex Hasty, director at comparethemarket, says: “When calculating your car insurance premium, insurers use many factors including your age, occupation, annual mileage, address, the make and model of your vehicle, your driving history, and any no claims discount. Ultimately, insurers need to assess how likely it is that you will make a claim and they may increase the price of your premium if you passed your driving test outside of the UK.”</p> <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission was asked to comment.</p> <p>As always, insurers have different attitudes to risk and some have been known to raise prices higher for foreign-born applicants than others, so it pays to shop around.</p> <p><em>Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

The journey from Edinburgh to Tweedbank<strong> </strong>is only an hour, but today I’ll be venturing further: I’m hiking for three days in search of both history in the Borders Badlands and a brace of new museums that are bringing that tumultuous history alive.</p> <p>For centuries the Borders were fought over by England and Scotland with rampaging armies battling north (and south). The “Borders Reivers”, who swept back and forth across the frontier, are still celebrated at annual festivals in Borders towns. Today, the rolling hills of Scotland’s south-eastern flank are peaceful. Decades of economic depression are easing too. Yes, many of the Tweed mills that swallowed up swathes of the Ettrick Forest have gone, but the new Borders Railway line has opened the area up to a new wave of historically minded visitors – in a part of Scotland that is unexplored, compared with Edinburgh and the Highlands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1536be0b5de01870bc9bfe7cdd65f8470d8e27d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1536be0b5de01870bc9bfe7cdd65f8470d8e27d2/0_262_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A train on the Borders Railway near Gorebridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A train on the Borders Railway near Gorebridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Top of my list of must-sees and just an arrow shot from the Borders Railway Line’s penultimate stop, Galashiels, is the world’s largest community-created tapestry. Galashiels is a former textile town, and its riot of modern architecture is evident in the striking concrete angles of the stand Peter Womersley designed for Gala Fairydean Rovers’ stadium and the dramatic pitched roof of <a href=\"https://greattapestryofscotland.com/\">the Great Tapestry of Scotland Museum</a>.<br><br>An avant garde architectural creation that<strong> </strong>opened last year, the museum is home to tapestries twice the length of the Bayeux, which tell the story of the nation from pre-history through to the opening of the Scottish parliament in 1999. Susie Finlayson, my guide and self-taught stitcher (who also worked on the tapestry), sweeps me from volcanic ferment to modern Scotland. “Originally it was just meant to be 80 panels. Then it became 120 and then 160, with over 1,000 weavers involved,” she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa5cca18deba53a9e032de923bbf1e7d626a2f64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa5cca18deba53a9e032de923bbf1e7d626a2f64/0_0_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eildon hills panorama from Scott’s View.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eildon hills panorama from Scott’s View.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Cuthbert/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From here, my hike begins as I join the 212-mile coast-to-coast <a href=\"https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/southern-upland-way.shtml\">Southern Upland Way</a>, walking east along the River Tweed.

Melrose itself is a crossroads of walking trails: the 67-mile <a href=\"https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/borders/borders-abbeys-way.shtml\">Borders Abbeys Way</a> circles through it, connecting the quartet of Borders Abbeys, and the <a href=\"https://www.stcuthbertsway.info/#163-slide-2\">St Cuthbert’s Way</a> to Lindisfarne begins at Melrose Abbey (where the heart of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, was buried).</p> <p>This trim market town, where I stay for two nights at the <a href=\"https://www.thetownhousemelrose.co.uk/\">Townhouse Hotel</a> (run by the Henderson family for 50 years), turns my understanding of the Roman occupation of Scotland on its head. The site of a Roman fort, Trimontium (named after the three peaks of Eildon Hills), lays just east of Melrose – and the brilliantly revamped <a href=\"https://trimontium.co.uk/\">Trimontium Museum</a> explores its history.

The current 1872 structure feels incongruously modern, so I head across it to the Temple of the Muses, a dramatic tribute to James Thomson, on the opposite bank of the Tweed. Some Scots aren’t fans of Thomson, writer of the words to Rule Britannia! I prefer to associate him with his poetic love letter to nature: The Seasons.

Of all the gloriously ruined abbeys in the Borders, Scott eulogised Dryburgh the most.

Last month, singer Alison Moyet joined Tears for Fears for a huge concert in the grounds.

It’s a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog\">fairly sisyphean beat</a>.</p> <p>The latest chapter in this struggle came in a story that appeared on the front pages of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllieHBNews/status/1559654316415369218\">Daily Mail</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AllieHBNews/status/1559655646185889802\">the Times</a> yesterday: a promise to beef up the regulation of cyclists and increase punishments for dangerous riding. The story appeared precision-engineered to appeal to the subset of drivers who view cyclists with the same kind of befuddled fury as a gorilla does a mosquito, and some of the response was correspondingly spittle-flecked in its delight.</p> <p>Among them was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TalkTV/status/1559869681242103811\">this fantastically weird but undeniably entertaining rant</a> from the TalkTV presenter Jeremy Kyle, who professed himself “so excited” at the prospect of more fines for the “leg-shaven, Lycra-wearing, lazy” cyclists who have apparently made his life so totally impossible.</p> <p>“It’s not that I think cyclists are morally superior,” said Peter. (I didn’t ask whether he shaves his legs, but I’ve not seen him in Lycra lately.) “And you do get plenty of idiots riding a bike.” He notes that cyclists and motorists aren’t discrete groups: most of the time, they’re the same people in different parts of their routine. “But it’s the sheer practicalities. If you’re on a bike, it’s far, far harder to do serious harm.” As he pointed out in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/cyclists-grant-shapps-culture-wars\">this excellent piece</a> yesterday, cyclists kill an average of two people a year in the UK; around 1,700, in contrast, die in car accidents.</p> <p>Anyway, here are some of Grant Shapps’ proposals to take on the two-wheeled scourge, with some cautious observations about why they may not be totally solid.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Speed limits</p> <p>At the moment, speed limits don’t apply to cyclists. Shapps wants to change that, arguing that there is a particular problem with cyclists “easily exceeding” 20mph limits where they apply.</p> <p>In reality, 20mph is almost always an aspirational speed in the built-up areas where such a limit would be in place. “You’d be putting an absolute shift in – it’s not normal casual cycling,” said Peter. “But the main point is that whereas even a small car hitting you at a low speed is likely to do really serious damage, the size of a bike and the physics mean that that is much harder.” The other obvious practical issue: I only know how fast I’m going in a car if I look at the dial in front of me. Will cyclists be compulsorily equipped with speedometers?</p> <p>***</p> <p>Registration plates</p> <p>In his interview with the <a href=\"https://www.mailplus.co.uk/edition/news/transport/212834/cyclists-may-have-to-get-number-plates\">Daily Mail</a>, Shapps mused on how to enforce a stricter regime of licence penalty points or fines: “How are you going to recognise the cyclist – do you need registration plates?” One person who seems unconvinced by that is, er, Grant Shapps, who says in his <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/saddle-cyclists-with-speed-limits-too-says-grant-shapps-2jk8dmw56\">Times interview</a> (£) that he is “not attracted to the bureaucracy of registration plates. That would go too far.”</p> <p>On this point, at least, Peter and Grant – or one of him – are in happy unison. “The main problem is that it’s completely impractical and has no benefits,” Peter said, which seems fairly comprehensive. He pointed to the vast impracticalities of enforcement, and questions over whether a number plate would need to be transferred from bike to bike, or T-shirt to raincoat depending on the weather. In the few places that have tried this approach, it has failed, other than in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/17/north-korea-where-bicycle-licence-plates-are-non-negotiable-grant-shapps\">North Korea</a>, which may not be the <em>dream</em> model for a self-declared libertarian like Shapps.</p> <p>“And at the same time, you would put a lot of people off riding completely because it’s such a fuss,” said Peter. “Any policy expert will tell you that it’s bad news to reduce cycling numbers, whether you’re talking about public health, or pollution, or road congestion.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>New laws on dangerous cycling</p> <p>Look past the more tub-thumping parts of Shapps’ agenda, and one serious ambition remains: the creation of a new offence of death by dangerous cycling, correcting a legal anomaly which means that whereas drivers who cause deaths can be jailed for life, cyclists face a maximum two-year sentence.</p> <p>Correcting that anachronism – the relevant law was written in 1861 – is a reasonable enough proposal in principle. “If you could put that into place, I don’t think it would be a terrible thing,” said Peter. He points to a couple of heinous cases, like that of <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/speeding-cyclist-killed-woman-after-24491624\">a cyclist who knocked a 65-year-old woman down</a> on the pavement and rode off as she lay dying, where the outdated law has had to be used.</p> <p>In practice, though, it’s not clear that the claimed imbalance typically applies. “Pretty much every cyclist who’s ridden egregiously and killed someone has been sent to jail,” Peter said. “It’s extraordinarily difficult to be sent to jail for killing someone while driving a car.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>So why is Shapps doing this?</p> <p>Outside of Shapps’ interviews, there is very little evidence that this is a serious plan. As recently as last November, the department for transport <a href=\"https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2021-11-01/HL3569/\">poured cold water on proposals for a registration scheme</a>; in 2019, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2019-03-18/debates/E7840EBD-E0A1-49DA-BDB1-E5EEB0D331E7/CyclingLicencesAndInsurance\">the government said</a> that “the costs and complexity of introducing such a system would significantly outweigh the benefits”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, DfT sources appeared to play down the prospect of Shapps’ dream becoming a reality after the story broke, briefing that it would be a matter for whoever replaces him as transport secretary next month.</p> <p>If the practicalities appear so utterly doomed, the best arguments for Shapps’ intervention are about optics. “A tiny proportion of the journeys taken in the UK are on bikes,” Peter said. “It’s not a big constituency. So this is quite an easy crowdpleaser.”</p> <p>The inevitable conclusion, then, is that cycling has somehow, like so many other apparently ideology-free subjects, been drawn into a culture war – one which the minister for transport may see benefits in joining as he jockeys for position in the next administration. If you’re a cyclist, you probably don’t have to worry too much about fines for your ferocious speeding any time soon. But you shouldn’t expect anyone to be any nicer about you, either.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/17/people-think-we-are-scumbags-but-celebrities-are-ringing-us-the-changing-world-of-the-paparazzi\">Sirin Kale unpacks</a> the symbiotic relationships between <strong>paparazzi and celebrities</strong> by talking to industry insiders about what’s really going on. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>If you were interested by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/10/friday-briefing-four-day-week-trial\">Nimo’s rundown</a> of the case for a <strong>four-day work week</strong> in June, you’ll definitely be interested in Ammar Kalia’s piece on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/18/four-day-week-trial-uk-workers-joys-challenges\">those taking part in the experiment</a>.

The animals are often kept indoors throughout their lives, though on some farms they are allowed access to outdoor areas at least part of the time. There are also concerns that animals on mega farms may be over-medicated with antibiotics, as if one gets sick the whole herd is generally required to be treated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong> Why do some people believe we need them?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Mega-farms and intensive farms take up much less space than traditional farms, and they allow animals to be kept securely, away from predators and potential carriers of disease. Their conditions are tightly controlled, allowing farmers to monitor the amount of daylight, water and feed for the animals, and if disease develops the livestock can be treated quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The march of these US-style mega-farms in the UK was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/17/uk-has-nearly-800-livestock-mega-farms-investigation-reveals\">revealed</a> in a Guardian investigation in 2017, but up-to-date data has been published this week in a book, <a href=\"https://www.ciwf.org/resources/books/sixty-harvests-left/\">Sixty Harvests Left: How to Reach a Nature-Friendly Future</a>, by Philip Lymbery, chief executive of Compassion in World Farming (CIWF).</p> \n<p>In England alone, the number of mega-farms increased from 818 in 2016 to 944 in 2020. Of these, 745 house poultry and 199 are for pigs. There are four poultry farms in the UK registered for 1 million birds, with the largest holding up to 1.4 million. For pigs, the biggest three farms hold more than 20,000 pigs.</p> \n<p>There are also at least 19 dairies that meet the criteria of a “mega-dairy”. Cows held in intensive dairies are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/03/they-dont-belong-in-concrete-shed-cows-still-happiest-outside\">“zero-grazed”, which means they are not allowed out into fields</a> and are permanently housed inside sheds.

The models show a mix of low and high rise buildings, 4,500 homes, alongside cultural venues and parks, which will rise from the rubble of the now demolished Earls Court exhibition centre. </p> <p>Craig runs Transport for London’s property arm – he was appointed its first commercial director more than a decade ago. TfL’s day job is running the capital’s bus and underground network, but it has held on to its land, and 22 years after its creation it remains the third biggest landowner in the capital, after the emirate of Qatar and the mayor of London. It could soon be one of its biggest housing developers too.</p> <p>Over the next decade, Craig has drawn up plans to build more than 20,000 homes, with 1,650 already under construction.</p> <p>“We hope to be building homes for decades to come,” he says. “I’d be surprised and disappointed if we weren’t the most impactful developer [in the capital].”</p> <p>The largest development is Earl’s Court, where construction is expected to start in 2025 and take 15 years, with plans to create up to 15,000 jobs. The vision of the Earls Court Development Company, set up by TfL and Delancey, is “to bring the wonder back” to a once iconic music and events venue. But it is a vision that has been delayed and revised, and details are scarce at this stage. The developers went back to the drawing board, and Delancey replaced TfL’s original partner Capital &amp; Counties Properties, after protests over plans to demolish two council estates, which have since been handed back to Hammersmith and Fulham council. The new masterplan is expected to be submitted by October 2023.</p> <p>TfL’s property arm owns 2,226 hectares (5,500 acres) of land across London, 1.5% of the area of London. The portfolio is valued at £1.7bn and comprises the land around stations and 800 railway arches.</p> <p>Rather than selling off its lucrative assets, TfL set up a separate property department in 2012 to develop the land and manage the properties. Nearly two-fifths of the current portfolio is shop space, but TfL wants to become a bigger player in offices and housing.</p> <p>“Hybrid working is here to stay. The firms with offices in place in central London are going to work harder,” says Craig.</p> <p>“People will not just come in to send emails. You want it to be somewhere people want to come in to work,” he says. “We’re not thinking about desks in rows where people are staring at screens – people can do that at home; offices are there for things you can’t do at home.”</p> <p>Younger people will have to be coaxed back to the office, he says, and offices will need to have pleasant, open, flexible meeting spaces and other attractions – although TfL’s won’t feature swimming pools and basketball courts, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/01/behold-londons-landscraper-googles-new-uk-hq-as-long-as-the-shard-is-tall\">new Google headquarters at King’s Cross</a>. “It’s possible to have fun at work without playing basketball,” Craig says.</p> <p>The property arm is wholly owned by TfL, which collects all its profits, but otherwise separately run. Other projects include three big office developments that have planning permission at Paddington, Southwark and Bank stations, and it is constructing a series of apartment blocks across London in partnership with build-to-rent specialist Grainger and others. It recently secured £200m from three banks which will give it enough funding for the next three years.</p> <p>TfL hasn’t held on to all its sites. It was <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/business/tfl-sells-family-silver-55-broadway-hq-to-hotels-entrepreneur-for-ps120m-a4237626.html\">criticised for selling off the “family silver”</a> – its former Grade I-listed headquarters at 55 Broadway overlooking St James’s Park – to a hotels entrepreneur for £120m in 2019.

But Craig insists that TfL will only sell assets that do not fit with the portfolio.</p> <p>Half of the 20,000 homes planned will be classified as affordable – a higher proportion than many other developers achieve.

The vast majority of TfL’s 1,500 tenants (93%) are small and medium sized shops and other businesses in the tube stations and arches.</p> <h2>TfL tenants</h2> <p><strong>The distiller<br></strong>Carmen O’Neal, the 36-year-old founder of the Hackney gin distillery 58 and Co in east London, one of the UK’s first female-run distilleries, which opened in July 2019, says: “I built a distillery on my mat[ernity] leave.

TfL granted the garage a six-month grace period and also handed over two arches for an extended period to a local grassroots charity helping the survivors.</p> <p>During the Covid pandemic, TfL granted all tenants in the area a three-month rent-free period and another three months at half the usual rent. “They’ve really helped the local community,” he says.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 18 August 2022.

Tobacco companies need to stop putting single-use plastic filters on the trillions of cigarettes they produce.”</p> \n<p>A ban on cigarette filters is a logical next step after reviews, carried out by bodies that include the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK294309/#ch6.s4\">US surgeon general</a> and the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/109/12/djx075/3836090\">National Cancer Institute,</a> suggested cigarette filters are little more than a marketing tool, said Tom Novotny a professor emeritus of public health at San Diego State University.</p> \n<p>“One might say, well, doesn’t the filter do some good?” Novotny said. “No it doesn’t.” Studies have instead linked filters to the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2789355/\">deeper inhalation of smoke,</a> potentially increasing the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179276/\">risk of an aggressive form</a> of cancer known as lung adenocarcinoma, he adds.</p> \n<p>Novotny’s view is backed by the WHO, who recently said that the plastic filters – added to the cigarettes in the 1950s to assuage fears over the emerging links between cancer and smoking – have done little to protect smokers.</p> \n<p>“As we now know, claims that filtered cigarettes were ‘healthier’ were fraudulent,” <a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/255574/9789241512497-eng.pdf\">the organization noted in 2017.</a> “The only thing filters may have done is make smoking easier and less harsh, increasing both the risk of addiction for smokers and the overall burden of the non-biodegradable and toxic cellulose acetate filters in our environment.”</p> \n<p>The years of mounting evidence against cigarette filters have propelled Novotny to become one of the leading voices in the push to ban single-use cigarette filters in the state of California. “There’s so much more concern about plastics these days,” he said. “And this one particular kind of plastic has no function except to sell cigarettes which kill people and cost our health care system a lot of money. So why do we want to even tolerate it?”</p> \n<p>When contacted by the Guardian, tobacco companies Philip Morris International and Imperial Brands said they were exploring alternatives to plastic filters.</p> \n<p>“We also intend to tackle the issue at the source, continuously working to replace the plastic in filters with better, more sustainable alternatives,” a spokesperson for Philip Morris said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Imperial Brands, previously known as Imperial Tobacco Group, said it was testing paper filter alternatives in Germany and Finland. “Consumer acceptance and emissions regulation have meant that we are yet to find an adequate alternative substitute for the traditional cigarette filter,” it added.</p> \n<p>British American Tobacco said it was working on “a number of initiatives in different parts of the world, including public-awareness raising initiatives, that have been shown to be effective in reducing cigarette butt littering”.</p> \n<p>The statements did not address the Guardian’s question on the health impacts of cigarette filters.</p> \n<p>Despite years of campaigning, three attempts in California to ban the butt have made little progress. Instead, inroads have been carved out at the local level; San Francisco began adding a <a href=\"https://sftreasurer.org/business/taxes-fees/cigarette-litter-abatement-fee-cig#:~:text=Every%20cigarette%20retailer%20in%20the,the%20current%20%241.00%20per%20pack.\">“litter abatement fee”</a> on packs of cigarettes in 2010 while last year Beverly Hills and Manhattan Beach <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/beverly-hills-and-manhattan-beach-california-make-history-for-public-health-301200733.html\">banned the sale</a> of all tobacco products within their city limits.</p> \n<p>Others have followed suit.

It just turned out that way. Perhaps it was after the 1970s oil crisis that politicians began to suspect such appeals were too great an electoral risk. Perhaps it got another push from the financial crisis of 2008. Either way, the mindset still remains strong of not trusting or relying on the public to stay the course when normality is put on hold.</p> <p>No modern British politician would now make the speech that Franklin Roosevelt did when he became US president in 1933. “If I read the temper of our people correctly,” Roosevelt said in his first inaugural, “we now realise as we have never realised before our interdependence on each other; that we cannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective.”</p> <p>Nevertheless, Roosevelt’s underlying sentiment, that it is important for everyone to do their bit in a crisis, remains massively relevant, even after the transformations of the past century. For a nation and a Conservative party whose foundational reference point still remains Winston Churchill’s 1940 statement that he had nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat, the abandonment of this spirit of sacrifice and duty is particularly odd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/tory-peer-hits-out-at-ministers-over-inflation-stuart-rose\">‘Nobody is in charge’: Tory peer hits out at ministers over inflation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is even stranger in view of the often positive lessons of Covid. The pandemic showed that exhortations to sacrifice can still work. People were ready to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/britain-covid-story-boris-johnson-prime-minister\">do their bit</a>, making sacrifices for the common good. In fact, they were more ready to do so than the government was. Boris Johnson spent the pandemic squirming over the disruption and ignoring it. Much of his party has concluded that the lockdown was less a reminder of the enduring place of sacrifice in public policy and more a libertarian outrage.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservative-leadership\">Tory leadership contest</a> has confirmed that calls for sacrifice are no longer part of a 21st-century government’s repertoire. Britain faces daunting and difficult issues, and every household is affected. But in the Potemkin village Britain where the contest between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak is being fought out, it is as though all the answers to all the problems facing the country are somehow easy, faith based, cost free and involve no serious inconvenience. The most obvious example is Ukraine, where Johnson has acted the role of war leader, even though no British forces are involved.</p> <p>The reality gap will narrow after 5 September, when Truss or Sunak steps into 10 Downing Street. But it is striking that complex problems have not been debated at the hustings in ways that recognise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/cost-of-living-crisis\">living costs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis\">climate change</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> carry both costs and benefits that cannot be avoided. Life in the 2020s is increasingly insecure for most people, but you would never know this from the hustings.</p> <p>Take the climate crisis as a primary example, which the leadership contest has conspicuously not done. The broiling summer of 2022 could hardly provide a more potent warning that the planet is in distress and Britain unprepared. A long-term strategy – in which everyone has a part to play – for moderating and reversing the crisis is long overdue. The public is almost certainly on board for the sacrifices that will be involved. Yet there has been almost no hint of that in the Tory debates. It is as though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2021\">Cop26</a> never happened.</p> <p>Instead, focusing only on Tory party members, Truss talks about axing the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jul/27/sorry-but-axing-vat-or-green-levies-on-energy-bills-arent-going-to-cut-it-sunak-truss\">green levies</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/rishi-sunak-vat-energy-bills-screeching-u-turn-kwasi-kwarteng-liz-truss\">Sunak wants VAT to be cut</a> from energy bills for a year. Both are hostile to solar panels and onshore windfarms. Several key Truss backers are net-zero delayers and some are full-on climate sceptics. Above all, there has been no attempt by either Truss or Sunak to use the contest to confront businesses, households and citizens with the need for long-term, irreversible and life-changing sacrifices. It adds up to a massive national failure. No wonder politicians are little trusted.</p> <p>There is a similar missed opportunity over the impact of the Ukraine war on energy supplies and living costs. Neither candidate has tried to make the big argument that gas shortages and high costs are part of the price that Europe and the democracies must pay to stop Russia in Ukraine. Neither has gone on to suggest that something approaching Rooseveltian sacrifices and discipline may even be required across the nation and that spending must be targeted on the most needy while this is so. Instead, Truss proposes tax cuts that will give rich people even more money.</p> <p>The new and more feckless approach is an extraordinary and jaw-dropping contrast with the more collectively responsible past. It is a very strange kind of leadership that says the whole country faces a financial crisis and so I am not going to do anything for you unless you are already well off. Yet it is also a very contemporary leadership trope to elevate a problem while telling people that the solution is not going to hurt.</p> <p>Brexit is a classic example. Although Brexit was extremely difficult and disruptive, neither Theresa May nor Johnson allowed themselves to admit it. May might have succeeded better if she had levelled with the public about the problems while arguing at the same time that the rewards would make Brexit worthwhile. The same may also apply to Nicola Sturgeon over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/scottish-independence\">Scottish independence</a>, if she can bring herself to admit that separation from the UK will also involve major disruptions and sacrifices.</p> <p>British politics has not just lost the ability to talk about necessary sacrifices. It also seems to have lost the will to make them. The United States is similarly uncertain and even more divided against itself. Both societies find it hard to square their liberal individualism with their self-interest as nation states and democracies in hard times. Both appear overly dependent on hedonism and overly casual about existential threats. Putin is relying on this hesitancy. He seems depressingly right about the lack of ambition and leadership among too many of our politicians. But I think and hope he underestimates the public.</p> <p>• Martin Kettle is a Guardian associate editor and columnist</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/18/phil-wang-review-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Phil Wang review – an irresistible set of smart and silly jokes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/18/phil-wang-review-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/18/phil-wang-review-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"Phil Wang review – an irresistible set of smart and silly jokes","trailText":"Part observational, part autobiographical, The Real Hero in All This considers life from ever-surprising angles ","byline":"Brian Logan","body":"<p>Sixteen years in Malaysia, 16 in the UK.

Now his classmates have made a documentary – My Old School – about the astonishing deception","byline":"Libby Brooks","body":"<p>What most people remember about Scotland’s notorious schoolboy impostor Brian MacKinnon is the size of the lie. How did a 30-year-old man, with only a dodgy accent and a worse perm, succeed in passing himself off as a 16-year-old high-school pupil in one of the most salubrious suburbs of Glasgow, hoaxing teachers who had already taught him some years before? Moreover, why would anyone want to?</p> <p>MacKinnon made sky-high headlines in the mid-1990s, but these questions are re-posed three decades later with curiosity, humour and some tenderness in My Old School. Directed by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4892166/\">Jono McLeod</a>, a school contemporary of MacKinnon’s (the second time around), the film pieces together the recollections of former classmates, friends and teachers, finally allowing his peers their say on the subterfuge that defined their coming of age.</p> <p>Should memory require refreshment, the extraordinary deception went so: calling himself Brandon Lee, MacKinnon enrolled at Bearsden Academy in 1993 with the intention of completing his Highers and applying to medical school. But Lee wasn’t 16. He was a man of 30 who had already graduated from the same school a decade earlier, and been thrown off his course at Glasgow University after failing his exams.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDazGVIs9C0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DDazGVIs9C0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>He was eventually exposed but not before dazzling his teachers, hosting house parties for his new teen pals and taking the lead in the school musical South Pacific, delivering an off key and – in hindsight – bravura performance of Younger Than Springtime. Although he secured the necessary grades, he was later expelled from his medical course at Dundee University when his double life was exposed in the media.</p> <p>As a Glasgow teenager myself back then, I vividly recall the photographs of pupils crowded round a lone copy of the Daily Record, on their open faces a combination of awe, thrill and confusion. There was a dubious undercurrent to this tallest of tales even then – a grown man in a room full of teenagers, whose hyper-focused desperation trumped all other propriety – but somehow it was overshadowed by the glorious, bonkers boldness of the episode.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you’re dealing with this many lies, it’s really difficult to get to the truth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Without ever seeking to blame, My Old School untangles some of the questions that back then most tested credulity: how could not one single teacher have noticed another adult in their classroom? Why did nobody question it when the kids in the playground immediately nicknamed the new arrival “thirtysomething”? Did his peers accept he could drive a car because the age limit was 14 in Canada, where MacKinnon claimed to have lived with his opera-singing mother before she died in a tragic accident and his professor father returned to live in the UK?</p> <p>The documentary features Alan Cumming as the young pretender. MacKinnon agreed to be interviewed for the project but not filmed, so McLeod asked the actor, who he knew had a longtime fascination with the story, to lip-sync MacKinnon’s taped words – which he does so seamlessly that he swiftly evaporates into the character. The ordinarily puckish Cumming sits stiffly behind a desk in the classroom dressed in beige and quietly communicating a lifetime of discomfort in his own skin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c1c77a85f6bc5272b3f6a896a545fe042a86c55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c1c77a85f6bc5272b3f6a896a545fe042a86c55/0_68_2114_1269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The real Brian MacKinnon, AKA Brandon Lee, in 1995.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Nicknamed thirtysomething’ … the real Brian MacKinnon, AKA Brandon Lee, in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image Scotland/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It’s shocking how, in plain sight, people can get away with the most incredible things,” Cumming told me when we met in Glasgow. “People pretend to be different things all the time, but as Scots we think of ourselves as canny. ‘You can’t pull the wool over my eyes.’ So for that to happen here … that’s why it was such a huge story and why we’re still talking about it all these years later.”</p> <p>It is hard not to ask Cumming questions as though he gave a straightforward performance, especially when so much of this thoughtful film revolves around the reasons why MacKinnon was performing himself. “It feels slightly disingenuous talking about this ‘character’ when it’s actually a documentary,” admits Cumming. “I feel protective of him. It is a tragedy too. At the centre of it is a very damaged person.”</p> <p>It’s a reflection echoed by McLeod: “It’s hard to talk about Brian MacKinnon because I don’t know him that well. But we all knew Brandon Lee.” McLeod says that MacKinnon, who was the first person he interviewed for the project, “is the ultimate unreliable narrator. My take on it is just that there are some people in life who are wired differently to the rest of us,” he says with a generosity that everyone speaking for the film extends to MacKinnon. “When he’s explaining to you the reasons why he did it, it makes an odd kind of sense.”</p> <p>The film-making process was like trying to piece together a jigsaw, he explains. “When you’re dealing with this many lies, it’s really difficult to get to the truth. So this is just as close as 30 classmates and teachers can get by coming together.”</p> <p>It’s also immediately apparent from watching the film that this is a story that could only be told by McLeod. At one point, a former classmate expresses her amazement that she was so fooled by MacKinnon before she looks directly at McLeod behind the camera and shouts across to him: “So were you, ya mug!” The mutual experience of being duped means the trust between director and subjects is palpable, and his probing is never supercillious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f3a0ad35d778b287529174faa6b58a1ab3fe1b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f3a0ad35d778b287529174faa6b58a1ab3fe1b2/0_31_2576_1545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A school photo with 30-year-old MacKinnon centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Class act … a school photo with 30-year-old MacKinnon, centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, while the now 59-year-old MacKinnon remains a largely unknowable figure, My Old School is far more about the experience of Brandon’s peers. It’s a point that Cumming emphasises: “Imagine being able to go back and discuss something that happened to you at a very formative age, to revisit that together as adults. What I find fascinating is how we can all have experienced the same incident and have very different memories of it.”</p> <p>It’s quite lovely to see how protective the classmates are of one another, and even of MacKinnon (whom they all still call Brandon), perhaps in order to preserve the purity of their own memories. This is especially so around some of the darker threads of the film. Lee is remembered with especial warmth by a black student, Stefan, who says the new boy defended him against racist bullies. On the other hand, his South Pacific co-star Val blanches as she realises what his enthusiastic kiss at the end of the production looks like from the perspective of adulthood.</p> <p>That kiss proved a particular challenge for McLeod. While concerns were raised at the time of MacKinnon’s exposure, there was not the safeguarding outcry that there would be nowadays – a reminder of how significantly responses to potential sexual exploitation have changed in a fairly short space of time. “We all collectively felt that, while the film someone else would make would be that sinister, dark take, we didn’t want that,” says McLeod. “But then, when I came upon the South Pacific tapes, I realised: ‘Well, actually I am going to have to hold this guy to account.’ I took my steer from Val. Her take on what happened is it makes her feel a bit icky, and that was as far as she wanted to go in terms of condemnation.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"46d5cddcc1f49fb14c4c2fd8e389d07b897a2a99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46d5cddcc1f49fb14c4c2fd8e389d07b897a2a99/0_169_3671_2203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MacKinnon in 1995.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MacKinnon in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film also spotlights the brutality of high-school life. As a gay teenager, McLeod’s own memories of Bearsden Academy are “hellish”, he says, and he was determined to place the racism Stefan suffered on the collective record. “It was a surprise for a lot of the classmates who came to the screening, and then told me afterwards they had no idea that was what Stefan’s experience was. I don’t even know if Brandon helped Stefan all that wittingly, but he absolutely changed the guy’s life for the better, so it was only right that I depict that.”</p> <p>For McLeod, one of the overriding themes of My Old School is privilege: “Bearsden is a town of ambition: people want to live there because they want their kids to do well.” In the film, classmates dissect this sharply, differentiating between the posh houses and “spam valley”, the area for less well-off families who moved in with the aspiration to send their children to the local school. One of those families was MacKinnon’s, and the film reveals the hefty inter-generational pressures on him to succeed. Another former classmate reports that MacKinnon can still be seen on the computers in Bearsden library, searching for medical schools around the world that might yet accept him.</p> <p>In a culture in which the imperative is to follow one’s dream no matter what, when does the relentless pursuit of a goal end up damaging yourself or those around you? Cumming picks up this question: “What’s dangerous about that message – and I find it in America particularly – that anything will come to you if you want it enough, if you work hard enough, is that it’s just not true,” he says. “Tell that to a single mum with four kids on a council estate. You can work as hard as you can, but if your circumstances and the political situation you live in are not conducive to helping you then it’s not going to change.”</p> <p>• My Old School is released on 19 August in the UK.

We fully understand and support everyone’s rights to protest and we are always mindful of how we use our powers, especially stop and search.</p> <p>“During protests there is naturally a higher number of people on the streets, and so there is also an increased number of officers deployed to these footprints to manage the protests and ensure disruption is kept to a minimum for those who are living, working and travelling through.</p> <p>“Because of these factors, we would expect to see an increase in policing tactics being used – including stop and search”. </p> <p>Extinction Rebellion said: “Protest is essential to the healthy functioning of democracy, and as we move further into multiple crises of inequality and climate breakdown it is more important than ever that everyone is able to make their voice heard.</p> <p>“Instead, the home secretary is using this moment of increased civil unrest to withdraw our democratic freedoms in a frenzied power grab.

More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/06/thousands-workers-worlds-biggest-trial-four-day-week\">3,300 employees at 70 companies</a> agreed to work one day less, for full pay and a commitment to keep up their usual productivity levels.</p> <p>The pilot, which is being monitored by academics from Oxford and Cambridge universities and Boston College in the US, runs for six months. “It has been almost 100 years since the transition from a six-day week to a five-day week, so we are long overdue a change,” says Joe Ryle, the campaign director with the study’s partner, <a href=\"https://www.4dayweek.co.uk/\">4 Day Week UK</a>. “The UK has an unhealthy culture where it is seen as a badge of honour to be working all the time, yet our productivity levels are low and younger generations increasingly don’t want to be defined by a lifestyle of burnouts.”</p> <p>The latest figures <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/bulletins/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfinalestimates/2020#:~:text=1.,above%20the%20UK%20in%202019.\">from the Office for National Statistics</a> back that up. In 2019, the UK’s output for each hour worked was lower than that of the US and France, while other G7 countries’ output per worker was 13% above the UK’s. But in terms of hours worked, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps00071/default/table?lang=en\">research</a> places the UK more than an hour above the EU average of 40.5 hours a week in 2019.</p> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2femploymentandlabourmarket%2fpeopleinwork%2femploymentandemployeetypes%2fdatasets%2funderemploymentandoveremploymentemp16%2fcurrent/emp16may2022.xls\">10 million people</a> say they would like to work fewer hours, with 3 million willing to accept less pay in return.</p> <p>Studies suggest working one fewer day a week can lead to improvements in workers’ happiness and productivity, as well as increasing access to the labour market and having possible knock-on benefits for the environment thanks to the reduction in commuting. </p> <p>In Iceland between 2015 and 2019, a four-day-week trial among public-sector employees resulted in a “<a href=\"https://autonomy.work/portfolio/icelandsww/\">dramatic increase</a>” in worker wellbeing. Afterwards, more than 80% of the country’s workforce negotiated shorter hours. In <a href=\"https://www.4dayweek.com/four-day-week-trial\">New Zealand</a>, a 2018 pilot led to the company Perpetual Guardian making the changes permanent.</p> <p>Not every four-day-week pilot has resulted in lasting success, though. In 2019, the Wellcome Trust <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/12/wellcome-trust-drops-plans-to-trial-four-day-working-week\">scrapped plans</a> for its 800 head office staff to work one fewer day a week after a three-month study, owing to “operational complexity”. The business organisation the CBI has also expressed opposition to the four-day week, stating that “rigid approaches feel like a step in the wrong direction” at a time when a choice of flexible working is seen as increasingly essential.</p> <p>Research <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/354596/4-day-work-week-good-idea.aspx\">conducted by Gallup</a> also suggests that while employees want more flexibility at work, when it comes to overall wellbeing, other issues such as better management, better pay or more meaningful work can outweigh hours worked.</p> <p>Still, Joan Fielder, the CEO of Helping Hands, which provides support to the elderly and is one of the organisations taking part in the UK trail, says so far she is pleased with the change. “It doesn’t take away from our service or commitment; instead it allows a better work-life balance and keeps us all focused and refreshed.”</p> <p>With the upheavals of the coronavirus pandemic having already led to a <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/what-is-the-great-resignation-and-what-can-we-learn-from-it/\">re-evaluation of priorities</a> – and staff resigning from their jobs in droves – just how much of a difference could an extra day of free time make? We spoke to four employees in various industries as they embarked on the first month of the pilot.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Week 1: ‘Is it expanding my free time or window-dressing it?’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd5e83f1ed82177c17a33c1765bffe24165dffca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd5e83f1ed82177c17a33c1765bffe24165dffca/1996_1385_5054_3033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Fatima Ajia, sitting at her desk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Fatima Ajia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Coventry, 35-year-old Dr Fatima Ajia might start her typical working day as early as 5am. As the campaigns and social research manager for the environmental non-profit Waterwise, her role involves compiling research, leading training courses and attending multiple meetings. Her hours are flexible and she works from home, sitting at her desk until her to-do list is all ticked off.</p> <p>“I’m a creature of habit and work is part of my life’s structure, so I wonder if the four-day week will be about expanding our free time or just window-dressing it,” Ajia says. “Will it be that easy to switch off from the all-consuming aspects of work on Fridays and to engage in life? Or will I feel reduced in some way?”</p> <p>Over in Salford, 49-year-old Digger Mosey is finding the change a welcome respite. “I’ve been at Helping Hands, where we assist elderly people, since April. Before that, I was at an NHS mental health support unit where I would work nights,” he says. “Having a normal working day and an extra day off on Friday is a dream come true.”</p> <p>With most of his friends employed full-time, Mosey spent his first Friday off at home, getting round to DIY tasks. “I live alone so I have to crack on with the jobs eventually,” he says. “I had a few drinks on Thursday and had a very welcome lie-in on Friday. Getting back to work on Monday, I felt so much more refreshed.”</p> <p>Mark Herbert, 52, lives in south London with his wife and two teenage boys. As a manager at Charity Bank, he has concerns about starting the pilot. “It will require a different approach to work, since I can’t just compress my usual five-day workload into four,” he says. “There’s always some faffing involved, so I’ll have to be really focused to get all my tasks done by Thursday evening and probably will have to share the load more, too.</p> <p>“Prior to lockdown, I would be leaving home about 7am and getting back by 6.30pm,” he says. “Since Covid, most of our work has been remote, so it’s much easier to have no set finish time. With the four-day week I really hope I can spend more time with the boys and see if I can get back to working on my own health and fitness.”</p> <p>Opting for a Wednesday off, rather than the typical Friday, creative copywriter Emma Colton, 28, who lives in Northampton, has productive plans for her first month of four-day weeks. “I wanted to be switched on for my day off, to fill it with personal projects,” she says. “I’m in the process of selling my flat and starting to write a novel, so I have quite a bit on.”</p> <p>Her first Wednesday off consisted of a “glorious nap”, journalling, tidying her flat and meeting a friend; she chalks it up as a success. “Being around other people really helps with my creative process, and getting enough sleep helps with productivity,” she says. “I think it was a day well spent.”</p> <p>Back in Coventry, Ajia is equally surprised with her first week’s progress. Despite responding to work emails over the weekend, she also managed a long-overdue visit with her nieces. “Spending time with family this weekend awakened me to the social value that I’m being robbed of,” she says. “I’d like to make more time to nurture this ‘me-outside-of-work’.”</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Week 2: ‘I don’t know why this wasn’t done years ago’<strong> </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd5c494cd60ee4670ebce0f3ee7b2038e27ea5cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd5c494cd60ee4670ebce0f3ee7b2038e27ea5cd/0_356_8192_4915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Digger Mosey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Digger Mosey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I no longer know what day of the week it is,” Colton says from her home in Northampton. “Having a Wednesday off is great for keeping productive all week long, but it also means I don’t get a Friday feeling. Weekends don’t have the same importance as they used to.”</p> <p>Two weeks into the pilot, Colton is still balancing her expectations with the realities afforded by her free time. With plans to crack on with her novel, she ended up spending her Wednesday tidying her flat for viewings that were ultimately cancelled. “That was disappointing,” she says. “But it was useful to realise that my free time might not always go to plan.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ajia is still finding it difficult to implement a work-life balance. “This week has been busier. Every day, I’ve been glued to my desk, unable to take my lunch break or even to stretch,” she says. </p> <p>By contrast, Herbert’s colleagues have been cutting down on unnecessary face-time. “We have fewer meetings booked now and they are shorter, while interactions with other staff are more focused,” he says. “Having four days means you always think about what is the best use of your time, so you carry as little forward to the next week as possible.”</p> <p>Still, he says he couldn’t resist checking his emails over the weekend. But he also fitted in a parkrun – “the first time I’ve managed one since lockdown”, he says.</p> <p>Mosey, for his part, is becoming increasingly productive. “I used to do homeless outreach volunteering on a Saturday, but now I have Fridays off, I’ve moved it to Thursday night,” he says. “It is much better and it means I can switch off properly for the weekend.” He spent Saturday going out to a local bar with friends and planning a trip the next weekend to a music festival.</p> <p>“That extra day means everyone gets back on Monday buzzing,” he says. “There’s a really great team spirit, and everyone can save their annual leave for a proper holiday. I don’t know why this wasn’t done years ago – I’m properly dreading it if we have to go back.”</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Week 3: ‘I should cut myself some slack’<strong> </strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ee41d3f4c0bfcb6f229872349a23576d0b91937\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ee41d3f4c0bfcb6f229872349a23576d0b91937/811_1086_1974_1184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Colton, holding a camera.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Colton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On an away day with her team this week, Ajia found that everyone was waxing lyrical about the pilot. “People have their Friday lists, for the fun things they want to experience on their days off,” she says. “Everyone seems in favour of the pilot, even with its teething problems, and to be honest, I’m at ease with it now, too … This week, I’ve done what’s practical and let go of the impossible – in work and in my personal life. I hope it can carry on that way.”</p> <p>Colton has spent the week coming to a similar realisation, after planned flat viewings on her day off fell through again. “I’ve found I’m putting a lot of pressure on myself to make the most of the day I have been given when I actually have a lot going on and should cut myself some slack,” she says. “I’ve realised that I don’t want to plan personal projects as rigidly, since while the four-day week is allowing me to be flexible in my work, it’s also been teaching me to be flexible in my personal life, too.”</p> <p>On Monday, Mosey is so flexible with his newfound free time that he misses our usual slot to catch up on the week’s activities. “I forgot that I took another day off,” he laughs. “It’s a bit like having a bank holiday every week – you have to keep track of your days. Still, I got all my work done and I had a great time this weekend at the music festival watching Duran Duran. I’m so thankful, since this time last year I was on shifts and the lack of sleep kills you – I’m too old to go back to that now.”</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Week 4: ‘I don’t get that Sunday night fear any more’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca262fc7f2a5264c852bf92071dda523d5314dbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca262fc7f2a5264c852bf92071dda523d5314dbe/551_274_1221_733/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Herbert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Herbert</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the end of the month in sight, Herbert still feels he is learning how to work more effectively in a four-day timeframe. “Sometimes the work week can feel like the mad panic you get before you’re about to go off on holiday – you’re just rushing to get everything done,” he says. “It’s worth it for the extra day off, though, since it sends you into Monday calmer – I don’t get that Sunday night fear any more.”</p> <p>He feels a permanent move to four-day weeks wouldn’t be too far a stretch. “We all want it to carry on after the pilot – my family included – and it will be great having the extra time in the autumn when the kids are back at school. There won’t be any excuse to not be prepared for Christmas this year!”</p> <p>Making up for last week’s fun, Mosey is up extra early this Monday, raring to get back to work. “It sometimes felt like no one got much done on a Monday but now I feel renewed,” he says. “I can’t waste time in the week any more and I feel much more motivated. I honestly can’t think of any downsides, since everyone is getting their work done. My only worry is that we’ll end up doing five days a week again come November.”</p> <p>In Northampton, Colton has finally managed to organise her flat viewings and get started on her novel. “Not a lot of this month has gone according to plan, but I need to remember to give myself breathing space,” she says. “There is no point in taking part in this trial with the hopes of reducing stress if I am going to pile it on myself in my spare time. Life gets in the way, and that’s OK.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just needed to get more comfortable with what I can achieve in a limited time</p> <footer> <cite>Fatima Ajia</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The four-day week could especially benefit the creative sectors, she feels: “My copywriting is improving because I am making more time to write creatively. Creative jobs work better when you have the time to unwind and think more clearly.”</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest shift in mindset has come from Ajia. “I’m surprised I’ve enjoyed this month; I usually never like to be idle. It felt as if I had withdrawal from work initially, as it’s such a large part of giving my life meaning,” she says. “But I just needed to get more comfortable with what I can achieve in a limited time and to say a resounding no when I can’t complete something to the standard I want to.”</p> <p>She feels she has also discovered more of a supportive community at work through the trial, despite initially finding her colleagues’ emails draining. “I don’t need to do everything myself,” she says. “I’m lucky that my colleagues will step in when I need them to.”</p> <p>Ajia is advocating for the trial to become permanent, but with caution. “It’s not a magic bullet for solving all the problems in the workplace,” she says. “If we truly want work to be better, there are many more issues that need to be addressed alongside our work-life balance – things like diversity, gender equality and pay-gap issues.”</p> <p>In the meantime, though, she believes that a continued extra day off could have significant consequences for her own life. “I am starting to realise that the accumulation of this free time could allow me to explore much more than I used to,” she says. “I could enrol for an MBA; perhaps I could even have time for a family. These things I thought weren’t possible for me seem like they might be within reach now.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/18/she-hulk-attorney-at-law-review-female-empowerment-has-never-been-so-much-fun","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T05:00:36Z","webTitle":"She-Hulk: Attorney at Law review – female empowerment has never been so much fun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/18/she-hulk-attorney-at-law-review-female-empowerment-has-never-been-so-much-fun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/18/she-hulk-attorney-at-law-review-female-empowerment-has-never-been-so-much-fun","fields":{"headline":"She-Hulk: Attorney at Law review – female empowerment has never been so much fun","trailText":"This entertaining Marvel joyride about a heroine who ‘hulks out’ in-between being a high-powered lawyer is not subtle. But you’ll enjoy every minute of this hugely funny, superbly paced show","byline":"Lucy Mangan","body":"<p>Are you ready for some fun? I ask, because it’s been a while and we all may need to limber up first. But once you are properly prepared, you can now switch on Marvel’s latest television offering She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (Disney+) and enjoy yourself in exactly the way, I would suspect, that the title She-Hulk: Attorney at Law suggests.</p> <p>It doesn’t have the emotional depth, the subtlety or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/15/wandavision-review-elizabeth-olsen-paul-bettany-marvel-disney\">technical sophistication of WandaVision</a>. It doesn’t have the youthful bounce or a spin as refreshing as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jun/08/ms-marvel-review-a-glorious-debut-for-the-first-muslim-superhero\">the Islamic slant of Ms Marvel</a>. But, oh, you will enjoy yourself thoroughly, for at least 28 minutes straight. And, honestly, who at the moment dare ask for more than that?</p> <p>Thirtysomething deputy district attorney Jennifer Walters (a perfectly cast Tatiana Maslany) is a busy, ambitious woman, happy in her job and eager to progress. When we first meet her, she is about to go into court. Her assistant, Nikki (Ginger Gonzaga in what would be a scene-stealing performance if Maslany wasn’t so incredibly good), recommends that she “hulk out” if things get tricky.</p> <p>In the first of many fourth-wall breaking moments (following the tradition of the comic book series in which she originated), Walters turns to the camera and acknowledges that Nikki’s suggestion is going to need explaining. In flashback, we learn her origin story, which is brief and effective. She and her cousin Bruce Banner (AKA Hulk, AKA Mark Ruffalo) are involved in a car accident and she receives an inadvertent Hulk-blood donation. He immediately spirits her new 6ft 7in form away to his Stark-funded lab to help her begin the laborious journey of learning what it is to be one of the avocado-hued; how to control her anger, fear and her transformations and how to integrate the two personalities that now live inside her.</p> <p>Except Jennifer is already ahead of the game. “Anger and fear – those are just the baseline emotions for any woman just existing,” she notes before going on to point out that she has had a lifetime of suppressing her emotions and making herself palatable to those around her. Unlike Banner, she has no second personality to integrate. So, creator Jessica Gao (one of a female-heavy team of directors, producers and writers) gives us a jolly, boulder-tossing, sonic-boom-clapping training montage as Jennifer tests out her new powers. When she feels she has got a handle on them, she heads back home to take up her job again. As she puts it in the second episode – “I’m not going to be a vigilante. That’s for billionaires and narcissists. And adult orphans, for some reason.”</p> <p>After she does indeed “hulk out” – in order to protect the jury from superpowered influencer Titania (Jameela Jamil) who busts through the wall as she flees court traffic – her firm decides she is a liability and fires her. She is later taken up by the firm who was opposing her in court, who are setting up a superhuman law division and want her to lead it.</p> <p>Only after she has accepted the job do they make it clear that she will need to appear as She-Hulk (a derivative name that she objects to, but which the public and the media are set on) at all times in the office and in court. It is a neat commentary on the aesthetic hoops women have to jump through at work, and the suspicions of her co-workers that she is under-qualified and only got the job because of her other attributes map nicely on to the real world, too.</p> <p>It is not a hugely subtle show (though the “anger and fear” line is the high-water mark for crassness). It isn’t trying to be, it doesn’t want to be. There are stock figures aplenty, including the mother more concerned with her daughter’s waistline and single status than her superpowers, a ratfink colleague at work everyone can love to hate, but they all get their job done with wit and charm. And it has plenty of cameos from beloved MCU characters – foremost among them Dr Strange’s sorcerer Wong (Benedict Wong). Direct-to-camera again, Jennifer notes that his every appearance “is like giving the show Twitter-armour for a week”.</p> <p>The whole thing is enormously funny and has such confidence, style and brio that it is impossible not to love it. It is superbly paced and has a satisfying case-of-the-week story every time. The overarching series plot in which Jennifer must represent Abomination (AKA Emil Blonsky, AKA Tim Roth, having almost as good a time as we are) as he applies for parole after – among other things – trying to kill her cousin Bruce never flags, at least in the first four episodes that were available for review.</p> <p>Watching it is like going on holiday for half an hour. I’m sure there are people who will take issue with various deviations from the comic books, or wish that it was doing something more profound with the differences a female hulk would discover in navigating the world. To the latter, I can only say – most superheroes get more than one incarnation and let’s hope this is the first take of many. In the meantime, I’m going to hulk out with delight.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/new-zealand-floods-hundreds-evacuate-as-atmospheric-river-brings-deluge","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T04:40:21Z","webTitle":"New Zealand floods: hundreds evacuate as ‘atmospheric river’ brings deluge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/new-zealand-floods-hundreds-evacuate-as-atmospheric-river-brings-deluge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/new-zealand-floods-hundreds-evacuate-as-atmospheric-river-brings-deluge","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand floods: hundreds evacuate as ‘atmospheric river’ brings deluge","trailText":"A third straight day of rain has brought flooding, landslips and road closure to both the North and South islands","byline":"Staff and agencies","body":"<p>Torrential rain has slammed the west and north of New Zealand’s South Island for a third straight day, forcing hundreds to evacuate their homes and triggering road and school closures and land slips.</p> \n<p>Coming top of weeks of damp weather, Thursday’s rainstorms are worsening conditions in New Zealand’s already sodden landscape.

This little harbour was busiest in the 19th century, when heavy goods (such as coal, ironwork and timber) and general merchandise were brought from south Wales and Bristol, with returning cargoes of slate, china clay and manganese ore. Incoming vessels were towed in through the tortuous entrance by “hobbler” boats, manned by oarsmen, and disembarked goods hauled inland by teams of horses.</p> <p>Today, visitors stroll on the quays and along the higher paths beside dried-up vegetation enlivened by orange swaths of invasive montbretia. A few daredevils swim out past the breakwater and climb on slippery rocks by the blowhole on Penally Point.

It goes to the heart of our democratic system of responsible government, in which individual ministers are responsible for specific departments, and accountable to the parliament and the Australian people for their actions. Ministerial responsibility is the critical means through which to realise political accountability and transparency, which people clamoured for more of at the recent election. It goes without saying that this fundamental responsibility is simply impossible if we don’t even know who the minister is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/scott-morrison-minister-for-everything-and-nothing-and-there-was-a-lot-going-on\">Scott Morrison – Minister for Everything and Nothing and There Was a Lot Going On | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Let’s be clear on just what the fundamental point at issue is here. It is not, as some have suggested, that Morrison held several ministerial portfolios at the same time – that is neither uncommon nor a problem: Tony Abbott, for example, was both prime minister and minister for women (yes, I know, right). The issue here is quite different: it is that Morrison was sworn in by the governor general to five ministries, <em>each of</em> <em>which was already held by somebody else</em>. And this happened in secret, without any notification of this unprecedented ministerial duplication to the parliament, or even, with the exception of the former health minister Greg Hunt, to the other ministers.</p> <p>This was the creation of a phantom ministry, existing above and beyond the publicly known official ministry, and capable of exercising the full range of ministerial power in relation to those portfolios, in secret. In the prime minister Anthony Albanese’s excoriating assessment, this was “an unprecedented trashing of our democracy”. The failure of Morrison to identify himself as a minister, during every question time for instance, was a gross deception of both the parliament and the Australian people.</p> <p>Various commentators have depicted this as in some way being a shared arrangement or a “back-up” position – a “joint minister”, “sharing” jobs, “co-ministers” – but this is not correct. A shared ministry would, at the very least, have required the knowledge of the other “co-minister” – how could it be otherwise? – and only Hunt knew of this private arrangement. It is difficult to see how these could be in any way shared ministries if the other minister, the public and the parliament were unaware the arrangement even existed.</p> <p>Any shared arrangement would also need to be specified with the division of responsibility between the two ministers and set out in the administrative order creating the second – Morrison’s – position. We are yet to see the administrative order since Hurley did not release it at the time. Morrison was sworn into all five ministries as a fully-fledged duplicate minister, despite the existence of an incumbent, with the full powers of that portfolio available to be used by him, in secret.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is quite possible the Queen knew of Morrison’s duplicate appointments, while the parliament and the people did not.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whether this appointment of a duplicate minister is “<a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-16/morrison-secret-ministerial-appointments-legal-or-not-icac/101318718\">technically legal</a>” is frankly not the point. Politically, it is a nonsense, a political oxymoron that undermines accountability and responsibility by fracturing it. If “responsible government” is to mean anything at all, you cannot have a second “minister” appointed in secret, who can at any point step in and override the decision of the first, and only publicly acknowledged, minister.</p> <p>Morrison was sworn in by Hurley apparently through the device of “<a href=\"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7860626/legal-mess-governor-general-confirms-morrison-took-control-of-ministries-without-swearing-in-ceremony/\">an administrative instrument on the advice of the prime minister</a>”. Hurley has defended the failure to publicise Morrison’s appointments as “a matter for the government of the day”. While the governor general was right to act on the advice of the prime minister, provided the prime minister retained the confidence of the House of Representatives as Morrison did, the secrecy about these appointments raises obvious concerns.</p> <p>Since Hurley had already sworn somebody else into each of these portfolios, we can expect that he asked Morrison about the necessity for them, and the legal basis on which this unprecedented decision to appoint a duplicate minister was made. According to the classic duty of the crown as described by Walter Bagehot, “the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn”, Hurley ought to have discussed these duplicate appointments openly and robustly with the prime minister before acting on his advice.</p> <p>We know from the vice-regal letters of previous governors general, released by the National Archives earlier this year after my successful “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/palace-letters-reveal-the-palaces-fingerprints-on-the-dismissal-of-the-whitlam-government-142476\">palace letters</a>” high court action, that the governor general would also have been expected to inform the Queen of these ministerial appointments. It is quite possible then that the Queen knew of Morrison’s duplicate appointments, while the Australian parliament and the people did not.</p> <p>However, neither Morrison nor Hurley made these ministerial appointments public, and it is here that the role of the governor general ought to be considered further, for the secrecy is troubling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a4a1ff85a3ea9a8890b5660fe3db5d2c60b30c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a4a1ff85a3ea9a8890b5660fe3db5d2c60b30c5/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Governor general David Hurley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘As it stands, the governor general became a party to the deception of the parliament and the people, and he must now consider his position.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter2/The_Ministry\">parliamentary handbook</a> describes the process through which ministers are appointed by the governor general, and their subsequent public announcement: “The approval of the Governor-General to the composition of the Ministry … <em>is notified publicly and announced in the House</em>. The principal areas of departmental responsibility and enactments administered by the respective Ministers <em>are notified publicly by order of the Governor-General</em>.”</p> <p>There was no public or parliamentary announcement of any of Morrison’s additional portfolios, nor any order of the governor general. It is not good enough to claim, as Hurley has, that the decision on the public announcement was a matter for the government – it is not. If the prime minister directed the governor general not to make the usual public announcement of a ministerial appointment, then Hurley should now make this clear. As it stands, the governor general became a party to the deception of the parliament and the people, and he must now consider his position.</p> <p>Last year Morrison vetoed a controversial gas exploration plan, Pep-11, ostensibly as prime minister, with it later emerging that he did it in the capacity as unknown resources minister. We only know of this due to <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/asset-energy-in-push-to-overturn-block-on-pep11-gas-exploration-permit/news-story/b576535fe9912d032a633bc74ed1de00\">legal action</a> taken by Assets Energy earlier this year challenging the ministerial decision, which brought Morrison’s secret role – who knew? – to light. That case has also highlighted precisely the dangerous folly of appointing a second, secret minister to a position already held by an existing minister. It raises the prospect of unauthorised decision-making on the part of the phantom minister, whose role was previously not even known.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/scott-morrisons-secret-ministries-undermine-public-trust-and-we-should-be-deeply-concerned\">Scott Morrison’s secret ministries undermine public trust – and we should be deeply concerned | Anthony Whealy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One intriguing question that remains is whether the heads of department of these five ministries knew of these appointments, as apparently the head of prime minister and cabinet, Phil Gaetjens, did. Did they know of the second minister to whom they were also accountable? Was Hurley advised by Morrison not to make these appointments public, and what other actions did Morrison take as minister across his five newly discovered portfolios?</p> <p>There is a long way still to play out in this strange and troubling case. At least one of Morrison’s own former ministers has been calling for his resignation, and there has been shock about this betrayal of trust, convention, and responsibility.

In March, US District Judge Mark Walker blocked new restrictions on the availability of absentee ballot drop boxes, regulations for third party voter registration groups, and a ban on providing food and water to people standing in line to vote. The US court of appeals for the 11th circuit paused that ruling earlier this year while it considers an appeal from Florida officials.</p> <p>The justice department’s allegation of racial discrimination is significant because the agency carefully chooses when to get involved in voting dispute litigations filed by private plaintiffs, and the department’s voice carries significant credibility in court. After going <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/23/us-justice-department-voting-rights-2020-election\">largely quiet</a> under Donald Trump, the justice department’s voting section has filed challenges to voting laws in Georgia, Texas and Arizona, in addition to filing several briefs in other voting disputes.</p> <p>An argument in support of a finding of racial discrimination offers a significant legal boost to challengers of the case, though the challenge to the law faces an uphill battle at the deeply conservative 11th circuit.</p> <p>The justice department said it agreed with the court’s findings that Florida lawmakers enacted those provisions knowing they would harm Black voters after the 2020 election in which turnout surged. The Florida law, the department said, violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting practices.</p> <p>“The district court’s core factual findings are that, in the face of surging turnout in the 2020 election, the Florida Legislature responded by enacting provisions that impose disparate burdens on Black voters,” DoJ lawyers <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22139463-fl-ca11-amicus-br-as-filed\">wrote in their brief</a>. “Which were chosen precisely because of those burdens to secure a partisan advantage. The court’s findings of discriminatory intent are a permissible view of the record based on the entirety of the evidence.”</p> <p>Florida lawyers dispute that the law is racially discriminatory.</p> <p>“Facially neutral laws regulating drop boxes for vote-by-mail ballots, the return of voter registration forms, and activity at or near a polling place fall squarely within the state’s power to manage “[t]he time, places and manner of holding elections”, lawyers representing the Florida secretary of state and attorney general <a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2022-07-11-SOS-appellants-brief.pdf\">wrote in a brief</a> to the 11th circuit.</p> <p>“In concluding otherwise, the district court focused on the distant past and disparities rooted in evidence that was ‘limited’, ‘unclear’, ‘not necessarily representative’, and ‘not statistically significant’.”</p> <p>In his March ruling, Walker also took the unusual step of saying the risk of racial discrimination was so severe, Florida needed to get approval from a federal court for the next decade moving for changes in its voting law.

He said the foreign secretary would be guilty of “moral failure” if she did not focus on the most vulnerable.</p> <p>He added that steering the country through the winter as energy prices soared was the “most important” short-term issue.</p> <p>“I think millions of people are at risk of a very tough time and I’ve been very clear that my plan is to support them,” he said.</p> <p>But Truss instead insisted “taxes are too high and they are potentially choking off growth”, as she promised an emergency budget to tackle the cost of living emergency. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/18/the-far-right-disinformation-pipeline-that-now-spans-the-globe-goes-straight-from-trumpland-to-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T23:01:44Z","webTitle":"The far-right disinformation pipeline that now spans the globe goes straight from Trumpland to Australia | Van Badham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/the-far-right-disinformation-pipeline-that-now-spans-the-globe-goes-straight-from-trumpland-to-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/the-far-right-disinformation-pipeline-that-now-spans-the-globe-goes-straight-from-trumpland-to-australia","fields":{"headline":"The far-right disinformation pipeline that now spans the globe goes straight from Trumpland to Australia","trailText":"The anti-vaxxers obstructing hospital entries in Melbourne are consuming the same misinformation and subsuming the same moral values as the Americans","byline":"Van Badham","body":"<p>Over the weekend, anti-Covid vaccine protestors in Melbourne decided they’d block entry areas to a succession of city hospitals, including the Royal Children’s hospital.</p> <p>Protestors carried placards with slogans such as: “Vaxxing our kids is child abuse”, “WHO Chief accused of genocide” and “They say it’s covid, it’s just the flu.”</p> <p>Parents and doctors were not shy condemning the demonstrations as imperilling patients.

Whalers of the later medieval period are believed to have been able to catch and land smaller whales but not species of this size, suggesting that at least some of the Launceston bones came from a beached whale.</p> <p>Ian Leins, English Heritage’s curator of collections and interiors, said: “The whale vertebra at Launceston castle was a puzzling discovery, but its existence actually greatly informs our knowledge of the castle’s inhabitants.</p> <p>“We know the bones date to the 13th century and at this time the castle was owned by Richard, Earl of Cornwall, who was King Henry III’s brother and one of the wealthiest men in Europe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9213bb4d2f4494e5c4fc4cf7c4e5b129eba1e45a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9213bb4d2f4494e5c4fc4cf7c4e5b129eba1e45a/0_73_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of the 13th-century die made of deer or cow bone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 13th-century weighted die that was made during the castle’s heyday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emily Whitfield-Wicks/English Heritage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“On his visits to the castle, Richard hosted great feasts attended by high-ranking officials and, while abhorrent to most people today, the serving and eating of whale meat would have been a symbol of his high status and power. There is every possibility that this great but unfortunate whale was the dish of the day.”</p> <p>The whale bone was briefly displayed after it was found but has been in storage for years. “It’s a real thrill to be able to return the whale vertebra to the castle to be viewed by visitors today,” said Leins.</p> <p>Founded soon after the Norman conquest, Launceston castle served as an important fortress and centre of government in Cornwall, enjoying its heyday in the 13th and 14th centuries. Earl Richard’s control of the tin industry of Cornwall and Devon brought him a huge income, making him one of the richest men in England. He rarely visited Launceston or Cornwall in person, preferring to leave his officials in charge, but he is known to have stayed at the castle at least six times, including his 51st birthday.</p> <p>Another object on display is a tiny 13th-century die made of deer or cow bone.

The spending increases would only be partly offset by a £34bn increase in tax revenues as a result of rising inflation.</p> <p>The thinktank said there would be additional pressures, probably running into tens of billions of pounds, to continue to support households struggling with higher energy bills and to compensate public services for the impact of higher than expected inflation.</p> <p>In a new report published today, the IFS said Truss and Sunak needed to recognise the even greater than usual uncertainty in the public finances.

Over two years the risk is no more likely than after other respiratory infections. The findings are published in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(22)00260-7/fulltext\">the Lancet Psychiatry journal</a>.</p> <p>Almost 600m Covid-19 cases have been recorded worldwide since the start of the pandemic, and there has been growing evidence that people who survive the disease face increased risks of neurological and psychiatric conditions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/25/covid-linked-to-risk-of-mental-illness-and-brain-disorder-study-suggests\">Previous studies</a> have found that people face higher risks of several neurological and mental health conditions in the first six months after infection. Until now, however, there has been no large-scale data examining the risks over a longer time period. The new study, by the University of Oxford and the National Institute for Health and Care Research Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, analysed 1.28m Covid-19 cases over two years.</p> <p>Dr Max Taquet, who led the analyses at the University of Oxford, said: “The findings shed new light on the longer-term mental and brain health consequences for people following Covid-19 infection. The results have implications for patients and health services and highlight the need for more research to understand why this happens after Covid-19, and what can be done to prevent these disorders from occurring, or treat them when they do.”</p> <p>The study analysed data on 14 neurological and psychiatric diagnoses from electronic health records mostly from the US. It found that in adults the risk of depression or anxiety increased after Covid-19 but returned to the same as with other respiratory infections within about two months.</p> <p>However, the risk of some other neurological and mental health conditions remained higher after Covid-19 than for other respiratory infections at the end of the two-year follow-up.</p> <p>Adults aged 64 and under who had Covid-19 had a higher risk of brain fog (640 cases per 10,000 people) compared with those who had other respiratory infections (550 cases per 10,000 people).</p> <p>In those aged 65 and over who had Covid-19, there was a higher occurrence of brain fog (1,540 cases per 10,000 people), dementia (450 cases per 10,000 people) and psychotic disorders (85 cases per 10,000 people) compared with those who previously had a different respiratory infection (1,230 cases per 10,000 for brain fog, 330 cases per 10,000 for dementia and 60 cases per 10,000 for psychotic disorder).</p> <p>Results in children showed similarities and differences to adults. The likelihood of most diagnoses after Covid-19 was lower than in adults, and they were not at greater risk of anxiety or depression than children who had other respiratory infections. However, like adults, children recovering from Covid-19 were more likely to be diagnosed with some conditions, including seizures and psychotic disorders.</p> <p>More neurological and psychiatric disorders were seen during the Delta variant wave than with the prior Alpha variant. The Omicron wave was linked with similar neurological and psychiatric risks as Delta.</p> <p>The researchers cautioned that there were some important limitations to consider. The study may underrepresent self-diagnosed and asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 as these are unlikely to be recorded. It also did not look at the severity or length of conditions after Covid-19 and how they compare with other respiratory infections.</p> <p>Prof Paul Harrison, who led the study at the University of Oxford, said: “It is good news that the excess of depression and anxiety diagnoses after Covid-19 is short-lived, and that it is not observed in children. However, it is worrying that some other disorders, such as dementia and seizures, continue to be more likely diagnosed after Covid-19, even two years later.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/17/deontay-wilder-next-fight-robert-helenius-october","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T21:18:23Z","webTitle":"Deontay Wilder announces October fight in first action since Fury trilogy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/deontay-wilder-next-fight-robert-helenius-october","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/17/deontay-wilder-next-fight-robert-helenius-october","fields":{"headline":"Deontay Wilder announces October fight in first action since Fury trilogy","trailText":"Deontay Wilder will square off with Robert Helenius in a 12-round WBC heavyweight title eliminator at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on 15 October","byline":"Guardian sport","body":"<p>Deontay Wilder is fighting on.</p> <p>The Alabama knockout artist will square off with Robert Helenius in a 12-round WBC heavyweight title eliminator at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on 15 October, marking his first fight since the conclusion of his explosive trilogy with Tyson Fury last year.</p> <p>Wilder (42-2-1, 41 KOs) contemplated retirement after suffering an 11th-round knockout loss in a back-and-forth classic against Fury in October 2021.

In just 62 minutes Raducanu eviscerated Victoria Azarenka 6-0, 6-2 to reach the third round on her Cincinnati debut. At the most opportune time, with her US Open title defence one tournament away, Raducanu’s confidence continues to grow.</p> \n<p>While noting the necessity of cherishing these moments against players she had grown up watching win grand slams, Raducanu said that she entered both matches completely backing herself. “I just had to focus on what I could control, and in the points you can’t think about who is on the other end of the court,” she said. “You’ve just got to play the ball.”</p> \n<p>Throughout this week, Raducanu has spoken about her intention to not get “too low or high” after moments over the past year where either her exuberance or negativity have not helped her unlock her best tennis.</p> \n<p>“I think I have tried a lot of things, and this year I think some matches, I have lost a lot of matches from leading situations and probably just played too tense,” she said. “I think that I just need to swing, and I just said that these two tournaments, or this tournament especially, I’m just going to swing freely and take that and see what happens.”</p> \n<p>One of the most difficult tasks in professional tennis is to back up a big win, remaining composed enough to produce tennis of the same quality in the following rounds. It became immediately clear that there would be no hangover as she broke Azarenka’s serve in the opening game and ran with the lead, hugging the baseline and robbing time from the Belarusian with her early ball-striking while offering few errors.</p> \n<p>While Raducanu played extremely well, Azarenka’s performance was appalling. She sprayed unforced errors and moved sluggishly, and finished the first set with just four winners to 16 errors in the first set alone. Beforehand, Raducanu said she intended to be “stingy” with her game, not allowing opponents any free points, and she lived that stinginess to the fullest as she established a 6-0, 4-0 lead, dangerously close to inflicting Azarenka’s first ever double bagel.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a73cbe54-6375-4d7d-b7f4-9bdf1f374ae3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gaTdHTdQEy8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At 33 years old and with her stagnant ranking of 22, Azarenka is even further removed from her days as a top player than Williams, her run to the 2020 US Open final an anomaly in the six years since she was a top–10 player. Raducanu efficiently exposed those frailties, and Azarenka could only fight for her reputation. She held serve twice before Raducanu closed off the win without problem.</p> \n<p>This week marks Raducanu’s second tournament accompanied by coach Dmitry Tursunov, who began their trial period at the Citi Open and it is evidently going well. In their two events together, she has won consecutive matches each time and made clear progress. More broadly, her performances are a reminder that even when players are struggling, momentum can quickly build.</p> \n<p>There are tougher challenges ahead against players competing at the top level in their physical primes, and another barometer awaits. Raducanu will next face the American Jessica Pegula, the much improved seventh seed, who will be just the second top 10 opponent of Raducanu’s career.</p> \n<p>Still, this has been some week. While Williams’ presence has loomed over tennis since Raducanu was born, she noted that she has also watched Azarenka since the start of her career. When Azarenka contested the US Open final in 2020, Raducanu was studying for her exams, dreaming of one day joining her on those stages.</p> \n<p>“I think after the tournament I actually have to, you know, take a step back and be like, ‘Look, like, you just beat two unbelievable champions.’ It’s a pretty good achievement. You know how difficult the wins are to come by,” she said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/17/mike-pence-condemns-republicans-fbi-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T20:45:17Z","webTitle":"Mike Pence condemns Republicans’ attacks on FBI over Trump search","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/mike-pence-condemns-republicans-fbi-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/mike-pence-condemns-republicans-fbi-attacks","fields":{"headline":"Mike Pence condemns Republicans’ attacks on FBI over Trump search","trailText":"Search of Mar-a-Lago came as part of an investigation into Trump’s handling of classified material during his presidency","byline":"Maya Yang","body":"<p>Former vice-president Mike Pence condemned attacks against the FBI by Republicans after federal authorities searched former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property.</p> <p>Republicans have been reacting with outrage over the FBI’s 8 August search of Trump’s Florida home which came as part of an investigation into his handling of classified material during his presidency.</p> <p>“I … want to remind my fellow Republicans we can hold the attorney general accountable for the decision that he made without attacking the rank-and-file law enforcement personnel at the FBI,” Pence said on Wednesday at New Hampshire’s Saint Anselm College.</p> <p>“The Republican party is the party of law and order.

Laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run in 2024, that’s what. Iowa and New Hampshire are both early voting states in the Republican presidential primary, and stops by prospective candidates such as Pence are not out of the ordinary. </p> <p>Where Pence would fit into the 2024 Republican field is unclear. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is seen as champing at the bit to return to the campaign trail, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/25/trump-hang-mike-pence-chant-jan-6\">reportedly has</a> little love for his former number two. If Pence hopes to capture the support of Republicans who have tired of Trump, he may have to vie against Florida governor <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, who could tailor his campaign to the same voters. Then there’s <strong>Liz Cheney</strong>, a conservative Republican who was last night ousted from the House by the Wyoming GOP in favor of a Trump-backed attorney. If Pence opts to run as a defiantly anti-Trump Republican, she would be his chief opponent, assuming she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/liz-cheney-president-2024-trump-republican-primary-defeat\">decides to aim for the presidency</a>.</p> <p>But that’s not all.

In a field with this much potential for crowding, one can see why Pence may want an early start.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T19:45:21.668Z\">at 8.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62fd39198f083ef020e6f8d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/maya-yang\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T19:04:53.710Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Planned Parenthood plans to spend a record $50 million ahead of November’s midterm elections, pouring money into contests where access to abortion will be on the ballot.</strong></p> <p>The effort, which breaks the group’s previous $45 million spending record set in 2020, comes about two months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. It will be waged by the organization’s political and advocacy arms and will focus on governor’s offices, U.S. Senate seats and legislative races in nine states where abortion rights could be restricted or expanded, depending on the outcome at the ballot.</p> <p>The historic proportions of the midterm campaign, when less money is usually spent than in presidential races, were made possible by a torrent of money raised after the decision by the high court’s new conservative majority, touching off a tectonic shift in abortion politics. For the first time, Republicans who have long campaigned against abortion will face voters on an issue that is no longer hypothetical and carries real life consequences.</p> <p>​​As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> move towards an election season rife with internal disagreements and mixed public opinions on exceptions in abortion bans such as instances of rape and incest, many rightwing lawmakers are finding it increasingly difficult to implement cohesive abortion policies.</p> <p>The phenomenon has been starkly illustrated by Kansas’s referendum a few weeks ago, where the usually Republican state voted to keep abortion protections in its constitution, providing an unexpected boost from red state America to the abortion rights movement.</p> <p>Planned Parenthood says its spending will help remind voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin what’s at stake in a bid to drive turnout by Democratic and independent voters.</p> <p>“Who wins in these midterm elections will determine whether a state has access to abortion and potentially determine whether we will face a national abortion ban,” said Jenny Lawson, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes. “We will be clear about who is on which side.”</p> <p>Planned Parenthood says it intends to contact 6 million voters through door knocking, phone calls, digital advertising, mailers and radio ads.</p> <p>It also is launching a website, takecontrol2022.com.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/07/15/key-facts-about-the-abortion-debate-in-america/\">survey</a> conducted between 27 June and 4 July by the Pew Research center, a majority of the American public disapproves of the supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe: 57% of adults disapprove of the court’s decision, including 43% who strongly disapprove, and 41% of American adults approve while 25% strongly approve of the court’s decision.</p> <p>The survey also found that 62% of Americans say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and 36% of Americans say that abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. Only 38% of Republicans say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, marking a 1-point decrease from poll results obtained in 2007.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62fd343a8f0892f840b890f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T18:45:09.753Z\">7.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A poll from Wisconsin is adding credence to the idea that Democrats are gaining strength in congressional races.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2022/08/17/mlsp71-press-release/\">The survey from Marquette University Law School</a> shows the Democratic nominee for Senate, <strong>Mandela Barnes</strong>, up by 51 percent against Republican incumbent <strong>Ron Johnson</strong>’s 44 percent.

There’s not enough red meat for the MAGA crowd, and Kushner has never appealed to them anyway.

Just ask the eight House Republicans who voted for Trump’s impeachment but then were ousted by voters or opted to retire, or the various party fathers and moderates who begged the GOP not to back Trump, only to be bowled over by the will of the electorate.</p> <p>Why is Cheney doing it? As <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/read-liz-cheneys-concession-speech-congresswoman-ousted-wyoming-1734296\">she said in her concession speech</a> last night, “A few years ago, I won this primary with 73 percent of the vote. I could easily have done the same again. The path was clear, but it would have required that I go along with President Trump’s lie about the 2020 election… That was a path I could not and would not take.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2022/08/17/scoop-liz-cheneys-next-move-00052332?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=12069c7e-e346-405c-ad2c-71cb1a62e514&amp;nlid=630318\">Politico’s Playbook has another theory</a>. Cheney won’t have much competition in the Trump-hating space, they write, with the GOP more or less in his grips and Democrats split over how big of a deal to make of him among their voters. “So rather than a kamikaze mission, her primary loss may have been more like parachuting out of a plane that had outlived its usefulness. Her great task now is figuring out where to land,” Playbook says.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62fcdc7d8f083e25be0ec0fb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T12:56:32.108Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">After primary loss, Liz Cheney aims for new job: Trump foe-in-chief</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. Last night, Republican voters rejected <strong>Liz Cheney</strong>’s bid to continue serving as their congresswoman, meaning she has only the remainder of the year left in the House of Representatives. She will continue in the highly public role of vice-chair of the January 6 committee, but this morning, Cheney said she is thinking about a run for presidency in 2024 – putting her in a position to compete directly against <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, a fellow Republican whom she loathes.</p> <p>We’re certain to hear more about that today, but here’s what else is happening:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>In Alaska</strong>, ex-governor <strong>Sarah Palin</strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/alaska-election-sarah-palin-career-donald-trump\"> advanced in the special election</a> to fill the state’s open house seat, giving the one-time vice-presidential nominee a shot at returning to national politics.

This will have a knock-on effect on rail services on Friday morning.</p> <p>Also on Friday, members of the RMT and Unite working on the tube will strike, as well as Unite members on London United bus routes in the capital in a separate dispute over pay.</p> <p>On Saturday rail workers will strike again, along with London United bus drivers, which will also affect Sunday morning train services.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/23/mick-lynch-rail-union-bruiser-whos-more-than-a-match-for-the-media\">RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch</a>, said his union’s members were more determined than ever to protect their pensions and secure a decent pay rise, job security and good working conditions.</p> <p>“Network Rail have not made any improvement on their previous pay offer and the train operating companies have not offered us anything new,” he said. “Tube bosses are having secret negotiations with the government about cutting costs by slashing jobs and undermining working conditions and pensions.</p> <p>“Network Rail is also threatening to impose compulsory redundancies and unsafe 50% cuts to maintenance work if we did not withdraw strike action. The train operating companies have put driver-only operations on the table along with ransacking our members’ terms and conditions.”</p> <p>Rail services on Thursday and Saturday will be substantially reduced, with only about a fifth running and half of the lines closed. Trains will only operate between 7.30am and 6.30pm on both strike days (starting at 7.15am on some routes).</p> <p>TSSA members taking action include staff working in ticket offices, stations, control rooms and engineering, as well as planning, timetabling and other support roles. The union is seeking guarantees that there will be no compulsory redundancies, a pay rise in line with the cost of living, and no unilateral alterations to job terms and conditions.</p> <p>The TSSA general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said: “Our members in the rail industry are going into the third or fourth year of a pay freeze. Meanwhile, food and fuel bills are spiralling, and the Tory cost of living crisis is making working people poorer.”</p> <p>The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “It’s clear, from their coordinated approach, that the unions are hell-bent on causing as much misery as possible to the very same taxpayers who stumped up £600 per household to ensure not a single rail worker lost their job during the pandemic.</p> <p>“Sadly, union chiefs have short memories and will be repaying this act of good faith by ruining millions of hard-working people’s summer plans. Businesses too will suffer, with the capital’s leisure and tourism sectors, which have been banking on that summer trade, set to lose millions – a particularly cruel blow given how hard many worked to stay afloat during successive summers of lockdown.”</p> <p>Steve Montgomery, the chair of the Rail Delivery Group, said people unable to travel on 18 or 20 August could use their tickets either the day before or up to and including 23 August. Alternatively, they can change their ticket or claim a refund.</p> <p>The strike by Arriva North West bus workers has been suspended while GMB union members vote on a new pay offer worth an increase of 11.1%.</p> <p>GMB organiser George Patterson said: “After weeks of unnecessary industrial action, Arriva bosses have finally come back with an offer that meets GMB members’ expectations.</p> <p>“Industrial action will now be suspended while members vote on this new deal. If they accept, the strike will be officially over.”</p> <p>The rail strikes come after data on Tuesday showed Britain’s trains have had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/16/uk-has-least-reliable-year-for-rail-travel-since-records-began\">their least reliable year since records began</a>.

However, the polls have consistently suggested that the foreign secretary is well ahead among party members.</p> <p>The Wales secretary, Sir Robert Buckland, last weekend became the first cabinet minister to publicly switch their endorsement for the Tory leadership from Sunak to Truss, citing her emphasis on the economy as a major reason for his defection.</p> <p>Days later Alun Cairns, who served as Wales secretary for three years under David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson – announced he was no longer backing Sunak as he felt Truss stood the best chance of securing the future of the union.</p> <p>Universities minister Chris Skidmore, who co-authored the controversial Britannia Unchained book with Truss in 2012, has also switched sides.</p> <p>One Truss campaign source said: “Mark has done a lot of this, particularly talking to MPs at a senior level, but others in the campaign have been involved too.”</p> <p>However, they denied suggestions that the politicians may have been offered positions in a new Truss government or any other inducements to defect. “There’s not been any jobs offered. It’s definitely been about the positives of joining Liz’s team. There’s no threats, we’re not Gavin Williamson,” they added.</p> <p>One senior backbencher who is a Sunak supporter told the Guardian they had been contacted by Truss’s team, in an attempt to get them to switch allegiance, but without success.</p> <p>One Tory who was called by Team Truss said: “Any MP who changes sides will have shredded their reputation in parliament in an instant and will find themselves walking past colleagues who would rather stare at their shoes than give them the time of day.”</p> <p>A minister added: “This approach was used early on for high-profile figures and jobs were offered but surely my colleagues must now realise there are more hopeful people than jobs?”</p> <p>Other MPs who are supporting the former chancellor said they had not received any contact from Truss’s campaign. “I assume they just think I’m too pro-Rishi so it’s not even worth the effort,” one said.</p> <p>Another added: “Nobody has tried to call me but then I’m not a senior Tory and probably on a list marked ‘not for turning’.”</p> <p>The suggestion that there could be more defections has gone down badly with Sunak’s campaign team. One insider said: “Those who switch are doing it purely for their own careers and it’s spineless. No one forgets a switcher and it tends to end badly for them.”</p> <p>Tory MPs also told the Guardian that some Sunak-backing backbench colleagues had now endorsed Truss after being threatened with deselection by constituency parties that are supporting the foreign secretary.</p> <p>Fullbrook is an elections consultant who was previously the business partner of veteran Australian strategist Lynton Crosby, but now runs his own business.</p> <p>Renowned for his knowledge of the Tory party and its members, he first worked with the Conservatives in 1992, and helped run Johnson’s 2012 re-election as London mayor.</p> <p>Fullbrook was also closely involved in Zac Goldsmith’s failed bid for London mayoralty in 2016, a campaign that was criticised for using racist tropes against the winner, Labour’s Sadiq Khan.</p> <p>It came as polling expert Sir John Curtice said that neither of the two leadership candidates were likely to give the Tory party the “bounce” it received when Boris Johnson became prime minister.</p> <p>“Frankly, the polling does not suggest that whichever of them makes it is going to make that much difference on its own. The crucial question will be how they do the job,” he told Times Radio.</p> <p>“It’s not clear that either of them is going to deliver the Conservative party across the UK the kind of bounce in fortunes that certainly happened after Mr Johnson became prime minister.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/17/us-ukraine-arms-supply-retired-generals-officials","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T19:20:26Z","webTitle":"19 retired generals and ex-officials urge US to increase arms supplies to Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/us-ukraine-arms-supply-retired-generals-officials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/us-ukraine-arms-supply-retired-generals-officials","fields":{"headline":"19 retired generals and ex-officials urge US to increase arms supplies to Ukraine","trailText":"Group calls on Biden administration to step up pace or run the risk of ‘unintentionally seizing defeat from the jaws of victory’","byline":"Julian Borger in Washington","body":"<p>Nineteen retired US generals and former officials have called on the Biden administration to step up the pace of arms supplies to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> or run the risk of “unintentionally seizing defeat from the jaws of victory”.</p> <p>They said that the US was providing enough weaponry to ensure a stalemate but not sufficient to help Ukraine recapture territory seized by Russia. The former officers, diplomats and other officials argue the administration is inhibited by fear of triggering a Russian escalation, possibly involving nuclear weapons – but they argue that failure to defeat Vladimir Putin in Ukraine increases the danger of a confrontation with Moscow later “on less favourable grounds”.</p> <p>The pace of arms deliveries to Ukraine has been a repeated source of friction between Washington and Kyiv, as well as some eastern European allies. So far, the US has given Ukraine nearly $10bn in military aid under the Biden administration, including rocket launchers, but has stopped short of providing longer-range missiles, fixed-wing aircraft and certain armed drones.</p> <p>“By providing aid sufficient to produce a stalemate, but not enough to roll back Russian territorial gains, the Biden administration may be unintentionally seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,” a commentary published in <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3605064-us-must-arm-ukraine-now-before-its-too-late/\">the Hill</a> said, signed by ​​Gen Philip Breedlove, former supreme commander of Nato forces in Europe, and three former ambassadors to Ukraine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/11/who-is-marie-yovanovitch-diplomat-slated-to-testify-on-ukraine-and-trump\">Marie Yovanovitch</a>, John Herbst and William Taylor, among others.</p> <p>“Out of an over-abundance of caution about provoking Russian escalation (conventional as well as nuclear), we are in effect ceding the initiative to Russian President Vladimir Putin and reducing the pressure on Moscow to halt its aggression and get serious about negotiations,” the commentary said.</p> <p>“We may think that each day we delay providing Ukraine the weapons it needs to win, we are avoiding a confrontation with the Kremlin. To the contrary, we are merely increasing the probability that we will face that danger on less favorable grounds.”</p> <p>Last month, Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said that the pace of arms deliveries was limited by Ukraine’s capacity to absorb them in terms of people trained to use them, and the need to have Nato allies support the deliveries.</p> <p>Talking about the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) which have a 300km range (186 miles) and which Kyiv was repeatedly requested, Sullivan said that fear of escalation played a role in withholding them.</p> <p>“[A] key goal is to ensure that we do not end up in a circumstance where we’re heading down the road towards a third world war,” he said at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0M4vYSPUO4\">Aspen Security Forum</a>.</p> <p>The signatories on the commentary argue that the US is allowing itself to be deterred by the Russian nuclear threat while not taking into account how much the US arsenal deters Russia.</p> <p>“I’ve never seen the United States deterred from doing what’s in its interest, but Russia aggression as we are seeing now,” Herbst, now a senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, said. “I think it is the most important reason for what I call the timidity and the slowness of the administration’s response to legitimate and important requests, even urgent requests.”</p> <p>Alongside ATACMS, the supply of fixed-wing aircraft has been a source of contention between Washington, Kyiv and eastern European capitals. Some European countries have supplied spare parts to Ukraine that has enabled Kyiv to repair some Soviet-era MiG jets, but the US and some allies view the supply of whole aircraft as escalatory.</p> <p>In March, Poland announced it was prepared to hand over its 28 MiG-29 fighters to the US base in Ramstein, Germany, leaving it to the US or Nato as a whole to hand them over to Ukrainian pilots, but the suggestion was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/poland-mig-29-jets-us-ukraine\">rejected by the Pentagon</a>.</p> <p>Slovakia was reported to be prepared to send its MiG-29s, but the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Naď, said over the weekend that they would remain in service until the end of August. </p> <p>“We are negotiating with our allies and partners regarding what to do with them next. No decision has been made yet,” Naď <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JaroNadPublic\">said on Facebook</a> on Sunday.</p> <p>Debra Cagan, a former US deputy assistant secretary for coalition operations and another signatory of the Hill commentary, said she believed Washington had yet to approve the transfer.</p> <p>“There’s no way shipments of aircraft would ever happen to Ukraine without the US giving the go-ahead,” Cagan, now a fellow at the Transatlantic Leadership Network, said.</p> <p>“The Slovaks are not in a position militarily to just say ‘OK, we’re going to do this’ and arrange for Ukrainian pilots and all this … Someone from the White House has to say you need to make this happen. My understanding is that has not occurred.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/17/cameron-norrie-fights-back-to-win-tough-battle-with-andy-murray","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T19:07:35Z","webTitle":"Cameron Norrie fights back to win Cincinnati battle with Andy Murray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/cameron-norrie-fights-back-to-win-tough-battle-with-andy-murray","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/17/cameron-norrie-fights-back-to-win-tough-battle-with-andy-murray","fields":{"headline":"Cameron Norrie fights back to win Cincinnati battle with Andy Murray","trailText":"Cameron Norrie won a battle of the Britons against Andy Murray 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to move into the third round of the Western &amp; Southern Open","byline":"Tumaini Carayol in Cincinnati","body":"<p>Cameron Norrie had every reason to be filled with frustration as his battle with a great British player seemed to be falling away. For all of Andy Murray’s quality in the opening set of their match at the Western &amp; Southern Open, Norrie had made too many unforced errors and given away too much for free – and he knew it. But one of the fundamental qualities that has driven Norrie towards the top of his game is his steadfast composure.</p> <p>His head did not drop, his shoulders did not slouch and he emerged from his bathroom break after the first set still positively searching for a solution. He eventually found it. After three tough, physical sets that left Murray cramping badly by his chair at the end of the match, Norrie reached the third round by outlasting Murray 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to secure his first win against the former world No 1.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/serena-williams-emma-raducanu-cincinatti-first-round\">Serena Williams bows out in Cincinnati as Emma Raducanu shows no mercy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite years of training together on the courts of the National Tennis Centre in which both players gained a granular understanding of the other’s game, Norrie and Murray had faced each other only once in an official match before, in Beijing, which Murray won in three tight sets. But back then Norrie was ranked 69th, merely a solid top-100 player. He is a different player today.</p> <p>They arrived on Centre Court on Wednesday morning and, predictably, tough, attritional rallies followed. Murray was extremely sharp from the beginning, dictating from inside the baseline, moving forward to finish points off at the net and he gave away minimal unforced errors. The constant pressure he inflicted on Norrie eventually told and, at 4-3, he snatched the decisive break with a supreme, angled backhand cross-court passing winner.</p> <p>But Norrie carried on as he always does, maintaining his composure and consistency. After serving well and navigating four consecutive holds, Norrie stepped inside the baseline, searching for forehands in the big moments and unleashing. In the big moments, he served well, ending the second set with an ace.</p> <p>Throughout the final set, Murray generated ample opportunities to snatch an important victory, particularly in a tight, attritional game at 3-3 in which he produced three break points. But with each error on those decisive points, Norrie further locked down his game, forcing Murray to hit through him as he refused to bail out of the long rallies.</p> <p>As those physical exchanges endured, Norrie’s resolve gradually broke Murray down physically. Murray began to cramp and he eventually served a double-fault on break point. As Norrie swept up the final games and secured victory, Murray’s cramping continued after the handshake and he was in visible pain as a trainer treated him on court.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ba05463f69c0396dfab235731a6247e782d6dc6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ba05463f69c0396dfab235731a6247e782d6dc6/0_0_3802_2281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Murray struggles with cramp during his defeat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murray struggles with cramp during his defeat</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Mullane/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Murray had arrived in Cincinnati struggling. He had compiled a record of just two wins and three defeats in North America, with first-round losses in Washington <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/10/three-time-champion-andy-murray-out-of-montreal-open-in-straight-sets-tennis\" title=\"\">and Montreal that were tough to swallow</a>. His performance was an improvement on the past weeks and fighting until the end with a highly ranked player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/05/cameron-norrie-digs-deep-to-sink-david-goffin-and-reach-semi-final\" title=\"\">fresh from a Wimbledon semi-final</a> is a positive performance.</p> <p>But he leaves with lingering questions over his conditioning. This summer, Murray has suffered from cramp in Newport, Washington and now both matches this week. He described cramping as a significant concern but he does not know why it has arisen.</p> <p>“The consistency of it for me is a big concern,” he said. “It’s not something that I have really experienced. I have experienced cramping but not consistently like over a number of tournaments. Big concern for me, because it’s not easy to play, you know, when it gets bad like it was at the end. I feel like it had an impact on the end of the match.”</p> <p>After another showing of his consistency and strength, a 39th victory of the season for Norrie has given him a third-round match against the promising 19-year-old American wildcard Ben Shelton, who defeated fifth seed Casper Ruud 6-3, 6-3.</p> <p>Norrie ended his day playing more than two hours in doubles alongside Alex de Minaur in their 4-6, 6-3, 11-9 defeat to Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies. Even after a tough three-set grind, there were many more miles left in his legs. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/17/saudi-arabia-snitching-app-jailed-leeds-student-salma-al-shehab","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T19:04:46Z","webTitle":"Saudi snitching app appears to have been used against jailed Leeds student","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/17/saudi-arabia-snitching-app-jailed-leeds-student-salma-al-shehab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/17/saudi-arabia-snitching-app-jailed-leeds-student-salma-al-shehab","fields":{"headline":"Saudi snitching app appears to have been used against jailed Leeds student","trailText":"‘Terrifying tool’ under scrutiny as Salma al-Shehab’s tweets suggest widely available phone app was used to report her","byline":"Stephanie Kirchgaessner and Robyn Vinter","body":"<p>The Saudi woman who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/saudi-woman-given-34-year-prison-sentence-for-using-twitter\">sentenced to 34 years in prison for </a>a tweet appears to have been denounced to Saudi authorities through a crime-reporting app that users in the kingdom can download to Apple and Android phones.</p> <p>A review of Leeds PhD student Salma al-Shehab’s tweets and interactions shows she was messaged by a person using a Saudi account on 15 November, 2020 after she posted a mildly critical tweet in response to a Saudi government post about a new public transportation contract.</p> <p>The user told Shehab that he had reported her on the Saudi app, which is called Kollona Amn, or We Are All Security.

Our thoughts remain with Salma, her family, and her friends among our close-knit community of postgraduate researchers.” Shehab’s research focused on improving dental treatment for patients with disabilities.</p> <p>Shehab was still working on completing her PhD in the UK in December 2020 when she returned home to Saudi to visit her family. A few weeks into her visit, she was summoned to report to Saudi authorities who arrested and tried her for her use of Twitter.</p> <p>Her alleged crimes including using a website to “cause public unrest” and “assisting those who seek to cause public unrest and destabilise civil and national security by following their Twitter accounts” and by retweeting their tweets.</p> <p>Shehab had about 2,000 followers. An examination of her account’s activity shows that on 8 October 2019, Shehab responded to a tweet by a verified Saudi account that reports on developments in the kingdom’s infrastructure projects. When the account tweeted about the launch of a new network of buses, she tweeted the word “finally!”.</p> <p>More than a year later, on 15 November 2020, a Saudi account with about 200 followers – which shows a man’s face and uses the name Faisal OTB – responded to her tweet with abuse. The user wrote that he had been intrigued by Shehab’s Twitter account because it displayed both the Saudi and Palestinian flags and denounced her for posting “rubbish”. The account user then said he had taken screenshots of some of Shehab’s Twitter activity and reported it on Kollona Amn – adding that he hoped she would be deported to Palestine.</p> <p>Shehab’s response – which was posted shortly before she left the UK to return to Saudi – was defiant. She said in a short response that it would not be that bad to go to Palestine, where she could visit the Holy Mosque in Jerusalem and that he should do as he wished.</p> <p>On official Saudi websites, Kollona Amn – which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kamnapp?lang=en\">also has a Twitter account</a> – is described as an app that allows citizens and expatriates to submit security and criminal reports related to personal life attacks, threats, impersonation, extortion, penetration of social media accounts, defamation, fraud and other criminal offences and security reports.</p> <p>Noura Aljizawi, a researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which identifies digital threats against civil society, said the use of such applications – which can be downloaded via app stores for iPhone and Android users – represented a “new phase of digital authoritarianism”.</p> <p>“It used to be that this kind of censorship was conducted by security intelligence forces, but now having these applications and encouraging citizens to report on each other, is opening the door to massive censorship,” she said.</p> <p>“It is very concerning because people who post something cannot predict the risk or who is going to report them, and who is going to go back and search their feed for posts that don’t align with government propaganda,” Aljizawi said. Recalling her own experience in Syria, Aljizawi described the phenomenon of citizens being unable to trust their own neighbours.</p> <p>“Sometimes people find themselves in trouble. They need a promotion or need to prove their loyalty to the state, so they do something like this. It’s enough to just take a screenshot and report it,” she said.</p> <p>Apple and Google did not immediately respond to questions by the Guardian about whether they would review allowing Kollona Amn to be downloaded in light of Shehab’s sentence.</p> <p>Bethany Al-Haidari, the Saudi case manager at the Freedom Initiative, a US-based human rights group, said Saudi Arabia had used technology to violate human rights and track targets of the government for decades.</p> <p>“Now we see Kollona Amn may be connected to the detention of a women’s rights defender. Technology has a wonderful power to transform and develop a society. However, in the hands of a dictatorship targeting human rights defenders, technology transforms into a terrifying tool which fast tracks repression, and the consequences are grave,” she said.</p> <p>A friend of Shehab’s in the UK said they were worried that she had been targeted by the government because she was a PhD student.</p> <p>The friend, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted themselves, said Shehab would regularly tweet to support the rights of others but believed it went unnoticed because she did not have many Twitter followers.</p> <p>“She [would] always stand with all human rights in Saudi or outside of Saudi. She has a very kind personality and you cannot see her without a lovely smile on her face.”</p> <p>The person said Shehab, who has been studying in the UK since 2017, was not especially critical of the government and was a supporter of Vision 2030, Prince Mohammed’s plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil and towards services such as health and tourism.</p> <p>The person said: “She was happy with small steps towards women’s rights, like driving.”</p> <p>The Leeds Central MP Hilary Benn said he was “shocked” to read about Shehab’s case and he would be raising the issue of her sentence with the government.</p> <p>“She should be freed to return to her small children and husband, and to her studies in Leeds,” he said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/17/this-is-memorial-device-review-wee-red-bar-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T19:00:25Z","webTitle":"This Is Memorial Device review – memories of fictional indie heroes burn brightly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/17/this-is-memorial-device-review-wee-red-bar-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/17/this-is-memorial-device-review-wee-red-bar-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"This Is Memorial Device review – memories of fictional indie heroes burn brightly","trailText":"An adaptation of David Keenan’s novel about a Scottish band who nearly supported Sonic Youth is lovingly detailed","byline":"Mark Fisher","body":"<p>A few years ago, the director Stewart Laing invented a character called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jun/20/paul-brights-confessions-sinner-review\">Paul Bright</a>.

As the players walked briskly from the pitch, and the spectators popped their umbrellas or started to scurry for cover, a huge orange banner dropped down from the top tier of the Edrich Stand. “JP Morgan,” it read. “Stop bankrolling new oil and gas”. The font “JP Morgan” was written in matched the one used on the sponsored hoardings either side. The firm, which is the world’s leading investor in the exploration of new fossil fuels, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/cricket-dangerous-dependence-fossil-fuel-companies-climate-crisis-spin\" title=\"\">MCC’s main corporate partner</a> for the past decade and its branding is plastered all over the ground.</p> <p>It wasn’t the first time there’s been a protest at Lord’s, but it was the first in a long while when anyone has managed to smuggle a banner in past the stewards or, perhaps, been willing to pay for tickets to do it. Protesters here in recent years have tended to stay outside the gates, or in one case, in 2008, chained themselves to them.</p> <p>It was all very polite. The man and woman behind it, Chris Newman and Alice Clack, who are both members of Doctors for Extinction Rebellion, explained that they had timed it so it wouldn’t interrupt play, because they didn’t want to ruin everyone’s day. Which meant they were less of a nuisance than the portly MCC member sitting in front of the pavilion, who held up the game when his garish egg-and-bacon blazer distracted Ben Stokes from his batting. The stewards told him to take it off. They took the banner down too, then escorted Newman and Clack out of the ground. “They were,” Newman said, “very kind about it.”</p> <p>So, the banner wasn’t up long, but it didn’t need to be to embarrass MCC, who make great play of their green credentials. They released this statement later in the day: “MCC puts sustainability at the forefront of its running of the club, as conveyed within our environmental, social and governance strategy, and which has seen Lord’s operate on 100% renewable energy since 2016, amongst many other initiatives. JP Morgan is a principal partner and longstanding supporter of MCC and cricket at Lord’s and we are working with them, as we do with all of our partners, on aligning with the club’s own environmental values.”</p> <p>JP Morgan’s press office was on, too. Oddly, their statement didn’t mention the $81bn they invested in fossil fuels in 2020-21, or that they had increased their financing of coal production from $1.28bn to $3.8bn in that same period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e9b38ef01554ed99ff0697426301ad921445924\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e9b38ef01554ed99ff0697426301ad921445924/466_909_4397_2638/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The banner at Lord’s \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The protest against JP Morgan and the MCC’s sponsorship deals was bold and bright.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“In 2021, we facilitated more than $100bn for green activities like renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transportation, doubled our green investment banking activity and were the largest underwriter of green bonds,” JP Morgan’s spokesman said. “These efforts help put us well on our way to our target of $1tn for green initiatives over 10 years, including for technology that will tackle climate change but does not even exist yet. We are also taking pragmatic steps to meet our 2030 …” etc and so on.</p> <p>So that’s probably enough of that, let’s get back to Newman and Clack. They said the people around them in the stands applauded their banner when they unfurled it, then cheered again when Clack pulled it back from the stewards after they had hauled it in.</p> <p>“We’re not radicals. We’re just trying to do what’s appropriate,” said Clack.</p> <p>“JP Morgan uses these sponsorships [and Lord’s isn’t the only one, there’s also the Commonwealth Games and the National Portrait Gallery] to sanitise their image when the reality is that they’re the world’s leading financier of the expansion of fossil fuels.”</p> <p>Clack compares it to the advertising money spent by the tobacco industry, and cricket, of course, has history there too, with the John Player League and the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and all the rest. “This is blood money, and we need to start calling it that.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/17/balance-of-power-goes-south-africas-way-as-pace-out-bazballs-england\">Balance of power goes South Africa’s way as pace out-Bazballs England | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“How do you push back against that?” Clack asked. “JP Morgan pays insane amounts of money to plaster their logo all over this ground. We don’t have hundreds of thousands of pounds to run a counter-advertising campaign. We’ve barely got the £150 to buy a ticket to come here to hang our banner up for five minutes.”</p> <p>They’d heard all those PR lines already. “We know they’re doing a lot of green investment,” Newman said. “Well, great, but it’s like giving someone poison and then being proud you’ve also provided a small amount of the antidote.”</p> <p>The same goes for MCC.

Across the UK’s 27m retail energy customers a £400 annual bills increase could cost households more than £10bn.</p> <p>Ofgem is under pressure after being blamed by some critics for not preventing the collapse of <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/energy-advice-households/what-happens-if-your-energy-supplier-goes-bust\">29 energy suppliers</a> since mid-2021. The crisis is expected to worsen with rising global energy prices pushing the energy price cap to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/09/uk-energy-bills-forecast-to-hit-4266-from-january\">more than £4,200 in January</a>, according to estimates, more than double its current level. The bill increase is expected to add to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis-recession-looms\">inflation, which reached 10.1% </a>, and deepen the cost of living crisis facing the UK.</p> <p>The regulator has faced repeated criticism that it is putting business interests ahead of consumers, in particular with plans to increase the updates to the price cap from twice to four times a year. Consumer rights expert Martin Lewis has previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/energy-price-cap-ofgem-price-falls\">accused it of “selling consumers down the river”</a>.</p> <p>There has been no public announcement of Farnish’s departure, although Ofgem has removed her profile from its website. Farnish was previously on the boards of water regulator Ofwat, the Association of British Travel Agents, and has been a managing director at Barclays.</p> <p>It is understood she objected to a change to the methodology used to calculate the price cap, which determines the average annual cost paid by households. Under the change, energy suppliers will be able to charge customers for extra “backwardation” costs they incur when securing supplies in advance.</p> <p>An internal announcement from Ofgem on Farnish’s resignation said: “Most of the board felt that the trade-off should be made in favour of a faster recovery [by businesses]. But Christine believed this gave too much benefit to companies at the expense of consumers.</p> <p>“In light of this principled difference of opinion, she has offered her resignation to the secretary of state, who has accepted it.”</p> <p>Ofgem told her that all but two UK energy suppliers would collapse this winter if the £400 charge was not brought in, according to a government source. Ofgem has previously argued that not allowing energy companies to charge more would cause “further and significant financial pressure on an already strained supply market”.</p> <p>The row is only the latest issue facing the Ofgem chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, who has led the regulator since February 2020. He has previously acknowledged that the UK’s retail energy industry, overseen by Ofgem, was “not resilient enough”, and this month he said the energy price cap is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/04/ofgem-confirms-energy-price-cap-to-be-updated-every-three-months\">“clearly not fit for purpose for the market today”</a>.</p> <p>There is also discontent within Ofgem, with staff telling the Guardian that morale is low following a slew of the negative news stories about the organisation. Brearley is thought to have recently fielded questions on all-staff calls on whether the regulator is supporting consumers or suppliers.</p> <p>A government source said any decisions on fiscal support related to energy bills would be for the new chancellor under a new Conservative party leader on 5 September.</p> <p>Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said Farnish’s resignation was “further proof that the government is asleep at the wheel when it comes to the energy bills crisis”.</p> <p>“For 12 years the Conservatives have totally failed to regulate the energy market. In no other country have 32 energy suppliers gone bust,” he said. “Labour’s fully funded plan would fix the problems immediately and for the future. It would mean people not paying a penny more on their energy bills this winter, saving the typical household £1,000.”</p> <p>The government’s business department was approached for comment.</p> <p>Farnish did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>An Ofgem spokesperson said: “Christine stepped down as a non-executive director at Ofgem after six years of service on 1 August. This followed a decision the board agreed on, but she felt she couldn’t support. She was due to stand down in January.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/17/angry-minion-with-no-anus-not-related-to-humans-after-all-scientists-conclude","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T18:25:14Z","webTitle":"‘Angry minion’ with no anus not related to humans after all, scientists conclude","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/17/angry-minion-with-no-anus-not-related-to-humans-after-all-scientists-conclude","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/17/angry-minion-with-no-anus-not-related-to-humans-after-all-scientists-conclude","fields":{"headline":"‘Angry minion’ with no anus not related to humans after all, scientists conclude","trailText":"New research rules out theory that 535m-year-old <em>Saccorhytus coronarius </em>fossil is our earliest known ancestor","byline":"Sascha Pare","body":"<p>One less relative to be embarrassed about – scientists have ruled out the possibility that a 535m-year-old microscopic fossil that looks like an “angry minion” is our earliest known ancestor.</p> <p>Previous research had suggested that<em> Saccorhytus coronarius,</em> a tiny <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/30/huge-mouth-and-no-anus-earliest-known-ancestor-saccorhytus-coronarious-evolution\">sack-like creature</a>, was an early member of a large group of animals called the deuterostomes, which vertebrates – including humans – belong to.</p> <p>Now researchers say they are confident that <em>Saccorhytus</em> is not a deuterostome, but part of the same evolutionary group as arthropods, which includes insects and crustaceans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/30/huge-mouth-and-no-anus-earliest-known-ancestor-saccorhytus-coronarious-evolution\">A huge mouth and no anus – this could be our earliest known ancestor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The paper suggested that <em>Saccorhytus</em> was an early member of our own evolutionary lineage, a group of animals known as the deuterostomes.

But we now know that these holes are simply where teeth have broken away,” said Donoghue. “Our analysis suggests that <em>Saccorhytus</em> is actually a member of the group that arthropods and their relatives are part of, called the ecdysozoans, although we can’t say for sure exactly where it fits in.” </p> <p>Whereas deuterostome embryos develop an anus followed by a second hole that becomes the mouth, <em>Saccorhytus</em> only has one opening, which serves as both.</p> <p>“<em>Saccorhytus </em>does not have an anus, only a mouth-like structure where it would have happily let anything it had eaten back out again,” said Donoghue.</p> <p>The search for our earliest ancestor continues, Donoghue said. “Our understanding of the deuterostome lineage is in an absolute mess. We are working our way through early fossils to gain a better understanding of our evolution,” he added.</p> <p>Dr Imran Rahman, a principal researcher at the Natural History Museum, said: “This is a really nice study that convincingly overturns the original deuterostome interpretation of <em>Saccorhytus coronarius</em>.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/17/florida-pregnant-teenager-abortion-court","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T18:20:04Z","webTitle":"Florida court rules teenager ‘not mature enough’ to have abortion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/florida-pregnant-teenager-abortion-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/florida-pregnant-teenager-abortion-court","fields":{"headline":"Florida court rules teenager ‘not mature enough’ to have abortion","trailText":"The 16-year-old cited being a student and unemployed as reasons she is unprepared to have a baby","byline":"Erum Salam","body":"<p>A pregnant teenager will be blocked from getting an abortion, a Florida court ruled on Monday.</p> <p>The 16-year-old initially petitioned to terminate her pregnancy, citing being a student and unemployed as reasons she is unprepared to have a baby.</p> <p>A court ruled she was not mature enough to make the decision to have an abortion, blocking her from getting one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/09/nebraska-teen-charged-aborting-fetus\">Nebraska teen and her mother charged for aborting and burying fetus </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The trial court found, based on the non adversarial presentation below, that Appellant had not established by clear and convincing evidence that she was sufficiently mature to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy,” the decision read.</p> <p>Though the teen appealed the decision, the appellate court upheld the lower court’s decision.</p> <p>In order for a minor to get an abortion in Florida, they must provide a physician with written consent from a parent or legal guardian, or request a waiver.

The ruling that the majority of the extracts should be disclosed is likely to be a blow to the government.</p> <p>The judge ruled the passages must be disclosed to claimants before a high court hearing on 5 September to determine whether or not the policy of sending some asylum seekers who arrive in the UK to Rwanda was lawful. </p> <p>During the application hearing, the court heard that a Foreign Office official raised concerns about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/13/priti-patel-finalises-plan-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda\">plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda</a>, citing state surveillance, arbitrary detention, torture and killings by the country’s government.</p> <p>The Guardian, the BBC and the Times made submissions to the court urging disclosure of these 10 passages, arguing that this was in the public interest.</p> <p>Groups challenging the lawfulness of the Rwanda policy – the PCS union, Care4Calais, Detention Action and some asylum seekers – say the passages should be made public.</p> <p>Christopher Knight, representing some of the claimants, cited one document from a Foreign Office official that stated: “There are state control, security, surveillance structures from the national level down to [households]. Political opposition is not tolerated and arbitrary detention, torture and even killings are accepted methods of enforcing control too.”</p> <p>The 10 passages the government asked the court to allow it not to disclose were contained in a draft country policy and information note about the asylum system and related human rights issues in Rwanda, and in an accompanying email – five comments in each document.</p> <p>The judge ruled that there was “public interest” in the court having access to some of the material. He added that some of it was already in the public domain.</p> <p>His judgment states: “I recognise strong public interest in not undermining international relations with a friendly state (Rwanda). Nonetheless that consideration is outweighed by the public interest in ensuring access to relevant information in this litigation.”</p> <p>The decision means the six passages, barring a few words, will not be kept secret during the high court hearing on 5 September. The other four passages will not be disclosed.</p> <p>Bella Sankey, the director of the charity Detention Action, which is one of the claimants in the case, said: “The development of Priti Patel’s UK-Rwanda deal is deeply controversial and of huge public interest. We welcome the court’s decision to refuse the majority of requests for public interest immunity made by the Foreign Office. Especially with such a divisive, costly, and potentially dangerous policy, it’s essential that the media and public can know the facts about the Rwanda policy before they cast judgment on it.”</p> <p>Clare Moseley, the founder of the charity Care4Calais, another of the claimants in the Rwanda case, welcomed the fact that most of the passages the government did not want to disclose, could now be disclosed to the claimants: “This is essential information that the public has a right to know. If we are to go down the path of this shockingly brutal policy – a policy that could make the public compliant in human rights violations – then the public have a right to scrutiny of the decisions made.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “Rwanda is a safe and secure country with a track record of supporting asylum seekers. We have a strong relationship with the Rwandan government and are proud to be working together to deliver on this world-leading migration and economic development partnership with them – we remain committed to implementing the policy, which will help break the business model of criminal gangs and save lives.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/17/liz-cheney-biden-trump-2024-election","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T18:16:07Z","webTitle":"What will it mean for Trump – and Biden – if Liz Cheney runs in 2024?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/liz-cheney-biden-trump-2024-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/liz-cheney-biden-trump-2024-election","fields":{"headline":"What will it mean for Trump – and Biden – if Liz Cheney runs in 2024?","trailText":"Trump Republican adversary makes clear that while Trump won the primary battle, the war for the soul of the party rages on","byline":"David Smith in Jackson, Wyoming","body":"<p>When Liz Cheney left the podium at a Wyoming ranch on Tuesday night, clapped and cheered by supporters, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlTJrNJ5lA\">a Tom Petty song</a> boomed out beneath the Teton mountains: “Well, I won’t back down / No, I won’t back down / You could stand me up at the gates of hell / But I won’t back down.”</p> \n<p>The woman who has emerged as Donald Trump’s most implacable Republican adversary had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/wyoming-republican-primary-liz-cheney-donald-trump-harriet-hageman\">suffered a landslide defeat</a> in a primary election to decide Wyoming’s only seat in the US House of Representatives.</p> \n<p>But unlike the former president, who loves to play victim, Cheney refused to dwell in political martyrdom after her act of self-sacrifice. In <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/teamcheney/cheney-now-the-real-work-begins?e=a8ebb5daf2\">a 15-minute speech</a> beside a dozen hay bales, a red vintage Chevrolet truck and four US national flags, she made clear that, while Trump had won the battle, the war for the soul of the party rages on.</p> \n<p>“This primary election is over,” Cheney acknowledged to a crowd that, with aching symbolism, included her father, former vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/05/dick-cheney-trump-liz-cheney-threat-republic\">Dick Cheney</a>. “But now the real work begins.”</p> \n<p>She invoked Abraham Lincoln, who lost congressional elections before ascending to the presidency and preserving the union. The vice-chair of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jan-6-hearings\">congressional January 6 committee</a> warned that Trump and his enablers pose an existential threat to democracy and urged Americans of all stripes to unite.</p> \n<p>To many in the crowd – who had wined and dined in a hospitality tent with a country and western band for entertainment – it sounded awfully like the launch of a presidential campaign.</p> \n<p>Heath Mayo, 32, a lawyer, said: “On the question about the future of the party, there are few people making an argument counter to the prevailing Trumpism argument. She’s the only one that can make it. I hope she runs for president in 2024. She needs to be on that stage making that argument again, even if she loses. Keep making the argument.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hudson.org/experts/2-carol-adelman\">Carol Adelman</a>, 76, who hired a 22-year-old Cheney for the US Agency for International Development, said that “of course” she would like see Cheney run for the White House in 2024. Alan Reid, 60, who works in finance, agreed: “Who else? Who’s better? I don’t see anybody from any party that shows the leadership that Liz shows.”</p> \n<p>Cheney’s political future became a little clearer on Wednesday when she launched a leadership political action committee with the name “The Great Task”. Her spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2022/08/17/scoop-liz-cheneys-next-move-00052332\">told the Politico website</a>: “In coming weeks, Liz will be launching an organization to educate the American people about the ongoing threat to our Republic.”</p> \n<p>In a TV interview, Cheney confirmed that she is “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/liz-cheney-president-2024-trump-republican-primary-defeat\">thinking about</a>” a run for president in 2024 and will make decision “in the coming months”.</p> \n<p>As the fall of the Cheney dynasty in Wyoming demonstrated, she would stand almost no chance of winning a Republican primary. But if the field is crowded and divided, for example between Trump, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and former vice-president Mike Pence, she could make a symbolic impact in the “moderate” lane.</p> \n<p>And as the January 6 hearings have shown, Cheney would relish nothing more than standing on a debate stage with Trump and prosecuting the case against him directly in prime time.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, the three-time congresswoman could run as an independent candidate in the general election. This could peel crucial moderate votes away from Trump in battleground states, helping his Democratic opponent, presumably President Joe Biden.</p> \n<p>But there might also be a danger that she would take votes from Biden, in particular those crossover Republicans who supported him in 2020 because of their hostility to Trump. Democrats would be anxious to avoid a repeat of 2000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/justin-amash-libertarian-2020-election-trump-win-critics\">when the third party “spoiler”</a> Ralph Nader was blamed for costing Al Gore the election.</p> \n<p>Cheney, who has vowed to do whatever it takes to keep Trump out of the Oval Office, would be equally wary of such a scenario unless, as some critics suspect, ambition and ego are competing with her nobler impulses.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://as.vanderbilt.edu/philosophy/bio/robertb-talisse\">Robert Talisse</a>, an expert in contemporary political philosophy at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, wrote in an email: “If Cheney seeks the GOP nomination against Trump, she’ll be crushed. If Trump’s not seeking the nomination, he’ll still get to select the nominee.</p> \n<p>“If she runs as an independent against Trump, she’ll probably siphon off a significant number of conservative voters who won’t be able to bring themselves to vote for a Democrat, but also can’t bring themselves to vote for Trump.”</p> \n<p>The calculation would take place in the context that reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/03/donald-trump-ron-desantis-republicans-maga-presidential-candidate\">Trump’s weakening grip </a>on the Republican party have been greatly exaggerated. She is one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him: eight have lost their primary or retired, while only two stand a chance of surviving to the next Congress.<br><br>Indeed, as Cheney exits the stage, at least for now, Sarah Palin, who paved the way for Trump, is making a comeback.

The journeys of these two fiftysomething women neatly sum up where the Republican party is at.</p> \n<p>But as Cheney noted in her remarks, pro-Trump election deniers are rising all over the country. It has proved a winning formula in primaries that reward the loudest voices but could yet backfire on the party in the midterm elections, where centrist voters are put off by extremism.

At the last count at the end of 2021, the debt figure was $4.8bn (£4bn), ignoring lease liabilities, which is one hell of a sum when revenues for the year were only $1.8bn.</p> <p>One can, though, grumble about the narration from the boardroom. As recently as March, Greidinger was whistling cheerfully about how prospects were improving after all the temporary Covid closures. He was “encouraged” by recent trading and the business was “well positioned” to benefit from a “highly anticipated” schedule of new releases, such as Top Gun: Maverick.</p> <p>And now? Admissions are below expectations and that bountiful slate of new releases is deemed “limited” until November. Thus the talks with lenders that could deliver “very significant dilution” for current shareholders. Yes, that’s what happens with debt-for-equity swaps, as seen at rival Vue recently, or similar financial shake-ups. Cineworld’s shares plunged 60%, making the equity in the world’s second-largest cinema chain worth just £115m.</p> <p>In one sense, one can admire Greidinger’s ability to maintain suspense this long. Last year he secured various covenant waivers on debt, negotiated with landlords and raised $213m by issuing convertible bonds. It was done even as Cineworld disputed with Cineplex, the Canadian chain it backed out of buying after Covid struck, an affair that has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/dec/15/uk-inflation-soars-cost-of-living-squeeze-energy-housing-clothing-footwear-federal-reserve-business-live?page=with:block-61ba02ad8f0848fb65d95f8c#block-61ba02ad8f0848fb65d95f8c\">led to a near-$1bn award</a> (being appealed) against the UK-listed company.</p> <p>With hindsight, though, Cineworld should have bitten the bullet on a financial restructuring far earlier. Last summer, the shares were still 60p and shareholders had more negotiating clout. Instead, Greidinger took the high-risk route of betting on recovery, persuading other investors to back a bonus scheme that would pay him and his brother £33m apiece if the shares could return to 190p within three years. Top marks for optimism, but the price is now 8p. The maverick approach doesn’t always work.</p> <h2>Raise the stakes</h2> <p>Signs of intent from the Gambling Commission: it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/17/entain-settlement-failing-rules-make-gambling-safer-crime-free\">hit Entain, owner of Ladbrokes and Coral, with a record £17m penalty</a> even though the company’s multiple failures to act responsibly and conduct proper anti-money laundering checks, gruesome as they were, were probably not the worst we’ve seen in the UK’s betting industry.</p> <p>But, as Andrew Rhodes, the commission’s chief executive, pointed out, Entain is not a first-time offender. The company, then called GVC, had to pay £5.9m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/31/ladbrokes-coral-hit-by-59m-penalty-over-vulnerable-gamblers\">as recently as 2019</a>, which should have served as a sharp prod to get its act together pronto. Note, too, that the failures referenced in Wednesday’s settlement happened in 2019 and 2020, when the industry knew the gambling review was happening.</p> <p>Then came the commission’s interesting bit. “Further serious breaches will make the removal of their [Entain’s] licence to operate a very real possibility,” said Rhodes.</p> <p>Does he mean that literally? The commission has the power to remove a licence but, for a company of Entain’s size, the sanction would imply thousands of job losses and, presumably, a mighty legal battle. One suspects the possibility is remote in reality. It is hard for a regulator to jump from a £17m fine – equivalent to a day and half’s global takings for Entain – to full-on yanking of the operating licence.</p> <p>But the regulatory direction of travel seems correct. If a household-name gambling giant continues to fall short, the regulator must get heavier, regardless of what happens with legal reforms, currently stalled by the Tory leadership show. As a next step, how about a ban on it taking bets in the UK for a week? The financial impact and the public shaming would be more severe. Raise the stakes for persistent non-compliance – and keep raising them.</p> <h2>The man for United?</h2> <p>Elon Musk’s latest unfunny gag was one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/17/elon-musk-manchester-united-tweet-charges-debate-over-struggling-clubs-future\">about buying Manchester United</a>. It wasn’t obvious how this “joke” was supposed to be hilarious but, as a serious commercial idea, a takeover has a lot going for it.</p> <p>Man Utd is worth $2.2bn on New York Stock Exchange; the club will almost certainly exist 100 years from now; and a new owner surely couldn’t run it any worse than the Glazer family has managed. Versus Twitter, which Musk wanted to buy for $44bn until he didn’t, it’s a bargain.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/17/mine-hunting-dolphins-filmed-hunting-and-eating-venomous-sea-snakes","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T18:00:23Z","webTitle":"Mine-hunting dolphins filmed hunting and eating venomous sea snakes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/mine-hunting-dolphins-filmed-hunting-and-eating-venomous-sea-snakes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/17/mine-hunting-dolphins-filmed-hunting-and-eating-venomous-sea-snakes","fields":{"headline":"Mine-hunting dolphins filmed hunting and eating venomous sea snakes","trailText":"Unique footage from US Navy sea mammals captures bursts of sonar clicks and victory squeals after grabbing meal","byline":"Damian Carrington Environment editor","body":"<p>Video cameras attached to mine-hunting US Navy dolphins have filmed them hunting and eating fish and, to the scientists’ surprise, swallowing venomous yellow-bellied sea snakes.</p> \n<p>It is the first time video and sound has captured bottlenose dolphins feeding on live fish, from the bursts of sonar clicks used to pinpoint the prey to the victory squeals after grabbing a meal.</p> \n<p>The footage showed that dolphins use suction to gulp down their prey, produced by expanding their throats and flaring their lips.

On approaching prey, click intervals shortened into a terminal buzz and then a squeal. On contact with fish, buzzing and squealing was almost constant until after the fish was swallowed.”</p> \n<p>The fish chases were strenuous and the dolphin’s heartbeat could be heard on the films, she said. The scientists were also able to see how the dolphins used their eyes to home in on the fish when they got close.</p> \n<p>The most unexpected finding was the eating of yellow-bellied sea snakes. Dolphins had been seen playing “cat and mouse” games with snakes before, but never eating them. One dolphin was seen to consume eight.</p> \n<p>“The dolphin clicked as it approached the snake and then sucked it in with a bit more head jerking as the flopping snake tail disappeared and the dolphin made a long squeal,” the scientists reported.</p> \n<p>“This snake does have the potential to cause neurotoxicity after ingestion and its venom is considered fairly dangerous,” said Barb Linnehan, director of medicine at the NMMF. “Perhaps because the snakes ingested were thought to be juveniles they had a lower amount of venom present.”</p> \n<p>The dolphin, which had been born in captivity, appeared unaffected by its serpent meal. “Perhaps the dolphin’s lack of experience in feeding with dolphin groups in the wild led to the consumption of this outlier prey,” the scientists said. Linnehan said leopard seals had been reported eating the snakes, but then regurgitating them.</p> \n<p>The study, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265382\">published in the journal PLOS One</a>, observed the dolphins in the open Pacific Ocean during mine detection training, and in San Diego Bay and a sea water pool. Their prey included sand bass, top smelt, yellowfin croaker, California halibut and pipefish. The smelt would often jump out of the water when being pursued, leading to the dolphins swimming upside down to track the prey and snap it up as it landed back in the water.</p> \n<p>Dr Brittany Jones, a scientist at the NMMF said: <em>“</em>These findings are an incredible addition to the literature providing detailed analyses during prey capture in the open ocean, which would be very difficult to achieve with wild dolphins.”</p> \n<p>The lead author of the study, Dr Sam Ridgway, died recently at the age of 86. “His creative approach to partnering with Navy dolphins to better understand the specie’s behaviour, anatomy, health, sonar, and communication will continue to educate and inspire future scientists for generations,” said Jones.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2022/aug/17/balance-of-power-goes-south-africas-way-as-pace-out-bazballs-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T17:41:38Z","webTitle":"Balance of power goes South Africa’s way as pace out-Bazballs England | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/17/balance-of-power-goes-south-africas-way-as-pace-out-bazballs-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/17/balance-of-power-goes-south-africas-way-as-pace-out-bazballs-england","fields":{"headline":"Balance of power goes South Africa’s way as pace out-Bazballs England","trailText":"Ben Stokes was not alone in his inability to withstand 90mph in-duckers as South Africa made an impressive start to the first Test","byline":"Barney Ronay at Lord's","body":"<p>The Lord’s clock had already ticked past 1pm by the time Anrich Nortje turned to bowl the final ball of the morning, scowling his game-face scowl as he glanced up at Ben Stokes: a genuinely terrifying expression, the face of a man with a deep and irresolvable sense of injustice, who can also – did we mention this? – bowl 97mph chest-thudding in-duckers.</p> <p>Nortje really is a wonderful fast bowler. Here, his morning was split between two short spells, one from each end. He isn’t tall, but has a fearsome whippy strength, skips off his back foot into a thrilling catapult motion, chest on but still smooth and easy in his movements.</p> <p>It has been a steady journey to this point, a career that has gone multi-franchise, all-format supernova as he approaches his prime. He made his debut for Eastern Province against Namibia eight years ago. His first two wickets in professional cricket both belonged to an opener called Wayne Raw, who himself sounds like the main character in a Martin Amis novel about Afrikaner fast bowlers of the 1980s. Anrich Nortje to Wayne Raw at Windhoek. Imagine how hot it was. Imagine how much meat they ate for lunch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/anrich-nortje-leads-way-as-south-africas-pace-puts-england-in-trouble\">Anrich Nortje leads way as South Africa’s pace puts England in trouble</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nortje, now 28, played through university, was always quick, and has matured now into a hugely skilful bowler. Forty minutes earlier he had produced a beautiful little miniature, clanking Jonny Bairstow’s middle stump out of the ground with a 93mph in-ducker, the perfect execution of the perfect delivery, perfectly tailored to his opponent’s weakness, with the perfect cinematic endpoint. Nortje even produced the perfect celebration, falling to his knees and pumping his right arm like a man very carefully puncturing a water bed with a bread knife.</p> <p>And now he had Stokes in his sights; and not just Stokes, but the day, the mood, the vibe around this thing. England were 100 for four at that point and rollicking along at almost four an over, poised at one of those crossroad moments. Was this good? Was it good in the new way of being good, good energy, good vibes, good forward motion? Which way would this thing go?</p> <p>Stokes had been batting as he has all summer, like a man in shoes three sizes too small, leaping out of his crease, pirouetting on his heels, belting the ball at the fielders. Kagiso Rabada had bowled beautifully with the new ball. He came back 20 minutes before lunch and you felt this was the game right here, the moment to defend with aggression, to defend as a form of attack, basically, to defend. Ben. Please.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6b7b860e9897863ccfea985555d66bb188c6bf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6b7b860e9897863ccfea985555d66bb188c6bf1/0_175_5273_3165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Stokes walks back to the pavilion after being out for 20, as players break for lunch on the opening day of the first Test.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Stokes walks back to the pavilion after being out for 20, as players break for lunch on the opening day of the first Test.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just a thought. At the other end Ollie Pope had just gone to a brisk, fluent, agreeable 50 off 69 balls. Stokes drove Marco Jansen though mid-on for four twice, a memory of how he has batted at his best, a shot that rests on being still, letting the ball come into the arc of his wrists and simply leaning into it with an easy, brutal elegance.</p> <p>Would he have left this ball, or played it more softly, more carefully if he hadn’t also slashed one through point earlier in the over, if he wasn’t panting away on 20 off 29 balls? Probably not. And it was a lovely piece of bowling from Nortje, straightening up, turning Stokes around and taking a thick-ish edge to third slip.</p> <p>With that the balance of power, of risk and reward, seemed to settle decisively one way. In the buildup to this game there had been some amusingly convoluted badinage about exactly who, hosts or tourists, was most obsessed with England’s new “brave” approach. They keep talking about it. Well, they keep talking about us talking about it. Who, exactly, is mind-gaming who here? Who gets to live rent free in who’s head? Is it a kind of summer house swap?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/collingwood-praises-ollie-pope-and-backs-england-bowlers-to-take-wickets\">Collingwood praises Ollie Pope and backs England bowlers to take wickets </a> </p> </aside>  <p>With this in mind there will be an urge to conclude that with that last ball before lunch, by reducing England to 116 for six on a rain-ruined first day, South Africa have blown a massive hole in that rather callow new era, the sloganeering, the brilliant run chases.</p> <p>And yet, of course, nobody ever pretended this would work every time. Stokes has, by many orthodox measures, batted horribly this summer. England have won every game. He averages 40. Plus, the other point here is England were essentially out-Bazzed on this first morning, met with a greater force, a greater controlled aggression.</p> <p>Three of Nortje’s first six balls went to the boundary. By lunch he had figures of 6-37-2. His first ball of the afternoon was up at 93mph. Soon after he bowled Ben Foakes to finish with three for 43 and Stuart Broad already at the wicket peering out from under his helmet like a man being asked to fight off a cloud of pterodactyls with a baguette. This was not a victory for steadiness or playing the percentages.</p> <p>Perhaps the only real lesson on day one at Lord’s was that South Africa have a breathtakingly, almost pointlessly fine pace attack. Lungi Ngidi and Marco Jansen take their wickets at 20, Rabada at 22. This is generational stuff, all fine lines, menace and variation: a perfect Test pace quartet for a nation that really isn’t going to play too many Tests from here.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/17/hostages-gave-vital-help-to-identify-british-is-gang-members-in-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T17:35:21Z","webTitle":"Hostages gave vital help to identify British IS gang members in Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/17/hostages-gave-vital-help-to-identify-british-is-gang-members-in-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/17/hostages-gave-vital-help-to-identify-british-is-gang-members-in-syria","fields":{"headline":"Hostages gave vital help to identify British IS gang members in Syria","trailText":"Advanced analysis of fragments of information enabled Scotland Yard to identify three of jihadis who held and tortured captives","byline":"Duncan Gardham","body":"<p>Freed hostages were able to give British police vital information that identified three of the Islamic State kidnap gang that had held and tortured them in Syria, it has been revealed.</p> <p>Scotland Yard has disclosed the breakthroughs that allowed it to identify three of the jihadis known as “the Beatles” and bring two of them to trial in the US. The hostages’ information helped police identify the men on a march with a group linked to the radical group al-Muhajiroun, together with the use of voice recognition software.</p> <p>Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, first featured in a video released by IS in 2014 showing a masked man with a British accent shooting a prisoner.</p> <p>Police were able to locate tapes of police interviews with Emwazi in 2012, when he was questioned about a series of bicycle thefts, and compare that with his voice in the hostage videos.</p> <p>An expert forensic voice analyst concluded there was a “very strong likelihood” the person in the video was Emwazi.</p> <p>Officers then started to narrow down the pool of other potential members of the group, ultimately leading them to identify Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, both from west London.</p> <p>Richard Smith, the head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command (SO15), said police followed a “trail of very small breadcrumbs” and building the case was “like putting together very small pieces of a jigsaw”.</p> <p>One piece of information emerged from the hostages they spoke to, which was “fairly unremarkable” to the hostage but proved very significant to police.</p> <p>It was the recollection of a conversation where one of the captors mentioned that he had been arrested at an English Defence League march in London.</p> <p>Based on that snippet of conversation, the investigation team was able to go back and identify a particular EDL march that took place in London on 11 September 2011.</p> <p>The march was a counter-demonstration against a march by Muslims Against Crusades to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, which began at the US embassy in Grosvenor Square.</p> <p>There were a number of flashpoints around central London and at about 6pm police were called to the Tyburn pub in Marble Arch, where a stabbing had taken place and a number of men were arrested on suspicion of involvement.</p> <p>Records showed that two of those arrested were Kotey and Elsheikh.</p> <p>“Both of the men ultimately were released without charge for that offence, but the information was invaluable in helping us to zero in on them as being the men the hostages had described to us,” Smith said.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police’s SO15 team took the opportunity to review data from Kotey and Elsheikh’s phones, which had been seized at the time of the arrest, and they showed various messages between them.</p> <p>They also found Elsheikh’s number saved on Emwazi’s phone, which had been downloaded when he was questioned over bike thefts.</p> <p>Another crucial piece of evidence linking Elsheikh directly to terrorist activity in Syria came as a result of officers taking a fresh look at evidence in an unrelated case.</p> <p>In 2014, Elsheikh’s brother, Khalid, was arrested by Operation Trident, the Met’s anti-gangs unit, and a handgun found at his address.</p> <p>His mobile phone was seized and found to contain disturbing images. That prompted the unit to contact SO15, which undertook a fuller examination.</p> <p>Police discovered a number of Telegram messages between Elsheikh and his brother, showing that Elsheikh was in Syria.</p> <p>One of the messages showed Elsheikh in combat clothing and holding a firearm. Another showed a graphic picture of decapitated heads with commentary from Elsheikh.</p> <p>After Kotey and Elsheikh’s detention in Syria, officers re-analysed the data using digital interrogation software – which had improved in the intervening years – and further material was discovered.</p> <p>A voice message was also identified from someone they believed was Elsheikh, which had been sent to his brother.</p> <p>After finding that voice message, they located a police interview tape with Elsheikh from 2009 and voice experts were able to compare the two recordings and conclude there was a “very strong likelihood” that Elsheikh was the person in the voice note.</p> <p>Last year, British police received authorisation from the attorney general for 139 charges against Kotey and Elsheikh, including kidnap and murder, but they were already in the US.</p> <p>The pair were stripped of their British citizenship after their capture by the western-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in 2018 and sent to the US for prosecution.</p> <p>Elsheikh, 33, from White City, faces sentencing on Friday. Kotey, 38, from Shepherd’s Bush, west London, was jailed for life in Virginia in April, after admitting kidnap, conspiracy to murder and providing material support for terrorism.</p> <p>The IS group, nicknamed the Beatles by their hostages because of their British accents, were responsible for the kidnap and holding of more than 20 westerners, and the killing of at least seven of them, including Britons David Haines<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/brother-murdered-briton-is-cell-conviction-david-haines\"> </a>and Alan Henning.</p> <p>Emwazi from Queen’s Park, west London, was known as “John”. He was killed at the age of 27 in a US drone attack on 12 November 2015.

So, to me, also, a part of this phenomenon is the charisma of the creator – people just like spending time with them.”</p> <p>Chang cites, as an example, Mike’s Mic: an Australian creator who unpacks the TV show Pretty Little Liars across a series of three movie-length videos.</p> <p>Mike’s Mic – real name Michael Messineo – said he decided to go long-form when he began to burn out posting 10-20 minute videos each week.</p> <p>“It was getting to the point where, for me, it started to feel a little bit repetitive,” he says.</p> <p>“But Pretty Little Liars is one of the things that I’m hyper-fixated on.

Arriving in the wet season of 2019, “we scrambled our phones, our computers.

Every 14 minutes, the environment jumps forward in time by one year – heading towards a speculative 2090.</p> <p>Four years in the making, Gondwana is a jaw-dropping feat. The forest covers 350 square metres, a huge chunk of space for VR (some have said it feels limitless). Rather than one specific slice of the map, “it’s a smoosh of the Daintree,” says Andrews. Essentially, they have built an ecosystem from the ground up, with 50,000 plants and 40 hours of audio poured into the mix.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H7MsJJhSYk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4H7MsJJhSYk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The Gondwana trailer.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The canopy grows and recedes as viewers glide along rivers, across mountains, and along the rippling sands of Cape Tribulation.

Reconnecting people back to that is, literally and figuratively, perspective shifting,” says Roberts, the film’s producer.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s weekend culture and lifestyle email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/saved-for-later\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Saved for Later\" data-form-description=\"Weekly lifestyle and culture picks from Guardian Australia\" data-form-campaign-code=\"UK_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Get a week’s worth of must-reads, trends and pop-culture in your inbox\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s weekend culture and lifestyle email</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2019 they left Melbourne with a plan to immerse themselves in the Daintree and what they thought was a fairly informed understanding of the climate crisis.

There were multiple cyclones and fires in the wet tropics area that had never been burned before.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1437e6f5be6d8c153c511e575b7d55b60613133\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1437e6f5be6d8c153c511e575b7d55b60613133/148_0_1609_966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Strangler Fig in Gondwana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The environment has these moments that are super precious and rare’ … A strangler fig inside Gondwana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They also found a forest that was out of sync. 2019 was the year that the Wet Tropics Management Authority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/04/climate-change-now-the-most-significant-threat-to-australias-wet-tropics\">released a desperate report flagging the climate crisis</a> as “the most significant threat” to the Daintree, named the second-most irreplaceable World Heritage area on the planet by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p> <p>The two worked closely with both scientists and Kuku Yalanji elders, whose people have cohabited with the forest for millennia. “Their seasonal calendars were no longer matching up with their traditional understanding and knowledge – tens of thousands of years of knowledge,” says Andrews. “This idea of falling out of sync was like an important artistic metaphor that we had to grapple with.”</p> <p>Gondwana portrays the decline both sonically and visually. The Daintree is essentially going through the “equivalent of the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, the much better known nextdoor neighbour,” says Roberts. “But the destruction is much harder to spot if you don’t know the difference between your ancient Gondwanan species and your modern Sumatran jungle species. You can’t see the change that’s happening. So we took that metaphor of bleaching into the experience.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3a37cd45872806a7f98175aeaed843edc7df49e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3a37cd45872806a7f98175aeaed843edc7df49e/0_102_2651_1590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mangroves in Gondwana.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mangroves in Gondwana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the viewer is moved through time, certain plants and animals begin to turn white.

We went through this very dark night of the soul,” says Roberts. “To take that experience of living there and then to learn about what we stand to lose … it was like learning about the painful death of a close relative.”</p> <p>“It was almost as if we had to go through the grief before we realised ourselves that we needed to shift how we were approaching the work,” says Andrews.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/12/petrol-review-a-cold-cerebral-and-unusual-melbourne-drama\">Petrol review – a cold, cerebral and unusual Melbourne drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Every single time Gondwana runs, it produces a different speculative future, as it based on not only the datasets that it chooses that particular cycle, but also, crucially, audience participation. The film-makers themselves don’t know which way the journey will go each time: you’re not guaranteed to see a Cassowary, for instance. “We’re not curating the perfect experience,” says Andrews. “Nature, chance, and rarity is important. The environment has these moments that are super precious and rare – and you are never going to witness the entire thing, you’re not central to it.”</p> <p>And the more time users spend in Gondwana, the more resilient the rainforest becomes. Notes of hope flare throughout the film, like the flicker of the Daintree’s fireflies.</p> <p>“We wanted to propose that no one individual can save the whole forest, but collectively we can prevent it from degrading,” says Roberts. “We wanted it to be open to possibilities like protection and resilience.

British workers, it asserted, are among the “worst idlers in the world”. Not her words, parried Ms Truss, correctly judging that this kind of slander might not be helpful in fostering good relations between a potential prime minister and the country she wishes to lead. “Dominic Raab wrote that chapter.”</p> <p>Mr Raab has pointed out that the authors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a>, published in 2012, took collective responsibility for its contents. But we do not now need to rely on his testimony. A leaked recording of Ms Truss in illuminating conversation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/16/leaked-audio-reveals-liz-truss-said-british-workers-needed-more-graft\" title=\"\">published</a> by the Guardian this week, confirms that “idle” is precisely what she believes British workers to be. And more. Speaking privately when chief secretary to the Treasury – a post she held between 2017 and 2019 – Ms Truss deplores the “mindset and attitude” of workers outside London. The country is being held back, she says, because too many employees have little appetite for “graft”. The Brexit referendum allowed such backsliders to blame migrants for their own shortcomings and laziness, as productivity flatlined. They should put their back into it, like the Chinese. “If you go to China, it’s quite different, I can assure you,” Ms Truss sighs with a hollow laugh.</p> <p>If these views belonged to a marginal ideologue on the Tory backbenches, or Sir Bufton Tufton at the golf club bar, there might be a certain black comedy to be enjoyed from their exposure. That they are the opinions of the clear <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tory-leadership-poll-liz-truss-32-points-ahead-of-rishi-sunak-2l2w7b3bb\" title=\"\">frontrunner</a> to become prime minister, as an economic crisis to rival the fallout from Covid looms, is deeply alarming.</p> <p>The only thing that Ms Truss gets right in her diatribe against working people is the assertion that Britain’s productivity crisis goes back decades. But the cause is not a lack of appetite for hard work. British employees work longer hours than their German counterparts, for example. But as a result of a perennial lack of proper investment in skills and technology, their labour is less <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/economy/productivity-germany/\" title=\"\">productive</a>. It is true that London is, to an unhealthy degree, more productive than the rest of the country. But that is due to governments since the 1980s placing all bets on a financialised, service-based economy, with the City of London at its heart. The rest of Britain, outside major cities, has become a disproportionately low-wage, low-skill environment.</p> <p>“Levelling up” – the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-levelling-up-is-our-mission-and-were-getting-on-with-the-job-of-delivering-it\" title=\"\">flagship</a> policy for Boris Johnson’s administration – was intended, at least notionally, to address this disparity through state intervention. As with Ms Truss’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/liz-truss-u-turns-plan-cut-public-sector-pay-outside-london-tory-leadership\" title=\"\">aborted plan</a> for regional pay boards to “level down” wages in the north and elsewhere, this tape reveals her consummate lack of interest in that approach.</p> <p>Instead, as exemplified in hustings after hustings, Tory members are regaled with laissez-faire economic liberalism of the old school – tax cuts for the better off, a smaller state and a faith-based conviction that the market will provide. For anyone who harboured hopes that once in Downing Street, Ms Truss would tone it down a bit, the tape will come as a wake-up call. This was Liz unplugged, speaking at a time when she was the second most powerful person in the Treasury. It is the “mindset” of Ms Truss, not the British worker, that the country truly needs to be worried about.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/first-diocese-of-australias-breakaway-anglican-church-officially-launched","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T17:30:23Z","webTitle":"First diocese of Australia’s breakaway Anglican church officially launched","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/first-diocese-of-australias-breakaway-anglican-church-officially-launched","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/first-diocese-of-australias-breakaway-anglican-church-officially-launched","fields":{"headline":"First diocese of Australia’s breakaway Anglican church officially launched","trailText":"New conservative Diocese of the Southern Cross – which explicitly forbids same-sex marriage – is headed by bishop Glenn Davies","byline":"Nino Bucci","body":"<p>The first congregation of Australia’s breakaway Anglican church was about to meet in a suburban RSL, and the man who was supposed to be leading the service was worried.</p> <p>Ten minutes before the Rev Peter Palmer was due to start, there were less than a dozen people at the Beenleigh RSL and golf club in south-east Queensland.</p> <p>“Then all of a sudden all these people walked in … and we started to worship God together, in a whole new style of Anglican worship,” Palmer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgA8n3eNFhw\">said at a conference</a> on Monday.</p> <p>The stakes were high: Palmer had previously given notice as the parish priest of St George’s Anglican Church Beenleigh, telling an “envoy” of the archbishop of Brisbane he was leaving to join Gafcon, a breakaway group that is dividing the Anglican church across the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/justin-welby-says-it-is-very-difficult-to-hold-church-together-over-sexuality\">Justin Welby says it is ‘very difficult’ to hold church together over sexuality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gafcon, the Global Anglican Future Conference, says it’s fighting back against a “revisionist” interpretation of the Bible by the leadership of the Anglican church which has allowed the ordination of women, the blessing of same-sex marriages and more relaxed views regarding divorce.</p> <p>Palmer said when he was asked by the envoy why he was leaving to join Gafcon, he responded: “I cannot go along with same-sex blessings, I will not allow that to happen, and I’ve got to stand up to this”.</p> <p>Rather than serving his customary three months leave, Palmer said he was told that his service the following Sunday would be his last with the Anglican church.</p> <p>He said he negotiated to get an extra week of service – to allow his parishioners to “grieve” – given he had been at the church for more than six years.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Palmer then told his parishioners he was leaving to join a diocese that explicitly forbids same-sex marriage.</p> <p>“Many of them were shocked … and they actually asked me ‘What do we do?’</p> <p>“So I thought about it, and I prayed about it, and I decided that there was only one way to do it, which was to stand up against it, and call it out for what it is: God says that it’s a sin.”</p> <p>Palmer’s service last weekend was the first held by the Diocese of the Southern Cross, the only Australian affiliate of Gafcon.</p> <p>The diocese was officially launched this week at a Gafcon conference in Canberra by its new bishop, Glenn Davies, the Anglican church’s former archbishop of Sydney.</p> <p>“This is a sad day, in many ways,” he told the Guardian.</p> <p>“If the leadership would repent and turn back to the teachings of the bible, we wouldn’t need the Diocese of Southern Cross.

You need not be an economist to know how much prices have been going up this year, from the petrol pump to the supermarket checkout to direct debits. And while inflation at 10% is a remarkable figure, it is set to go even higher. Unless the government acts on energy bills, when the cap rises by a predicted 80% on 1 October, inflation will soar again. Analysts expect prices for gas and electricity to keep on increasing well into the new year. And where energy prices go, so go the costs for everything else, from food to clothes to transport.</p> <p>The UK is not the only country in this mess, but its position is the most precarious of any in the rich world.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/22/the-guardian-view-on-privatisation-the-god-that-failed\" title=\"\"> Privatisation</a> means that the British government has little control over the prices set by its utilities (unlike, say, Emmanuel Macron with EDF), while workers in the UK have far less bargaining power than their counterparts in France and Germany. Then there is Brexit, plus the long-held assumption by politicians and economists that the UK need neither own nor manufacture much of what it consumes – it can just buy it all in. The result is that inflation in the UK far outstrips that in the US, Japan, Germany or France – and financial markets expect that to remain so next year.</p> <p>Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 2022 was set to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/05/cost-of-living-crisis-british-politics-2022-energy-bills-tax-rises-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">shaped by the cost of living</a>. Ahead of this autumn, three things can be said with reasonable confidence. First, the Bank of England will keep raising rates – and most likely induce a recession that will harm firms and workers. Threadneedle Street will treat this week’s signs of prices rising in the service sector as proof that inflation is no longer being imported, but is now settling into our economy. Second, the next prime minister will not have the war chest they hoped for. This March, the Office for Budget Responsibility calculated that the Conservative government had <a href=\"https://obr.uk/spring-statement-uses-fiscal-windfall-to-cushion-historic-hit-to-living-standards/\" title=\"\">£30bn of “fiscal headroom</a>” to cut taxes and raise spending. Most of that will now go on pensions, social security and interest on public debt. Throughout this Tory leadership campaign, economics has been discussed as if in some strange blue-rinse bubble: giveaways today, or tomorrow? That bubble is heading towards a painfully sharp pin.</p> <p>Finally, the Conservatives are engineering an almighty clash with trade unions. Public sector workers are the ones seeing their pay fall furthest behind their bills, after more than a decade of real-terms cuts to wages, and are also most likely to be unionised. The government is well aware of this, yet has done little to alleviate the real suffering being felt by nurses and teachers and other vital workers. The obvious conclusion to be drawn is ministers want a fight. If so, they won’t be disappointed. Given the battle readiness of union leaders such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/17/profiteering-bosses-workers-inflation-unite-sharon-graham-labour\" title=\"\">Sharon Graham</a>, this will most probably be a winter dominated by industrial strife.</p> <p>It is worth recalling how much of Margaret Thatcher’s project focused on suppressing prices by hammering down on workers. In that, if not much else, she was strikingly successful. And over the intervening decades Westminster has been filleted of a sense of class conflict. Politics became, as David Hare titled one of his best plays, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jan/30/david-hare-labour-party-the-absence-of-war-play\" title=\"\">the absence of war</a>.

The letter also said the SoA and Harris have “been captured by gender ideologues who brook no debate and who are not prepared to support authors who fall foul of online bullies”.</p> <p>Hundreds of writers and industry professionals have signed <a href=\"https://melindasalisbury.wordpress.com/2022/08/16/an-open-letter-to-the-society-of-authors-regardining-joanne-harris/\">a separate open letter</a>, written by author Melinda Salisbury, in support of Harris. The signatories of this letter said she had “been a stalwart, fair, dedicated, and passionate chair”, and that they were “concerned by the seemingly coordinated attacks against her by a small, but vocal, minority, who have become known to many of us who use Twitter as persons who regularly use their own platforms to intimidate and bully those who do not agree with their ideologies regarding trans and non-binary people”.</p> <p>Harris has since said in a tweet that she believes this criticism of her has nothing to do with the SoA and “everything to do with [her] support of the trans community”. She added: “I continue to support the trans community, as well as standing up for free speech for everyone. There’s no conflict.”</p> <p>The novelist has been the chair of the SoA’s management committee since January 2020, and was re-elected in March this year to serve a second two-year term.

England, aggressors these days under the captaincy of Ben Stokes, stumbled to 116 for six with Ollie Pope, 61 not out, the only batter to resist a fine bowling display from Dean Elgar’s tourists.</p> <p>Amid a bombardment of questions during the build-up regarding England’s so-called “Bazball” approach, one of Elgar’s stock replies has been along the lines of “Let’s see how this caper fares against my bowlers”. Most captains talk up their attacks but the South African has a particularly potent one through a blend of class, pace and variety.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/collingwood-praises-ollie-pope-and-backs-england-bowlers-to-take-wickets\">Collingwood praises Ollie Pope and backs England bowlers to take wickets </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elgar was just as certain upon winning the toss, citing the moody cloud cover overhead for his decision to bowl rather than a deliberate attempt to throw England off kilter after their four successive Test wins batting second. Even with Kagiso Rabada slightly undercooked after an ankle ligament injury on tour, it looked to be the obvious call.</p> <p>And so while England hustled along at 3.6 runs per over and struck 13 fours, there was a case to say that team orders could be blamed for only one of the six wickets to fall. Alex Lees was the culprit here, the first of Rabada’s two early new-ball strikes when, shortly after slashing his first boundary over the slip cordon, the opener looked to force a rising ball through the covers without footwork and nicked off for five.</p> <p>Otherwise, it was a case of high-class seam bowling and the Dukes ball – seemingly hardier after its early season issues with softness – offering Elgar’s quartet of seamers swing through the air and movement off a green-tinged pitch.</p> <p>Rabada, one of three South Africans to have played at Lord’s previously, showed little sign of his recent lay-off too, his speeds in the high 80s and his line ever probing. To that end, Zak Crawley may well have taken a philosophical view of the off-stump delivery that demanded a shot but flew to slip off the edge. That said, his numbers this summer — 151 runs at 16 — are stretching England’s desire to be loyal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c5edd07f9a35942b229b71fd5231ab1a055ab659\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5edd07f9a35942b229b71fd5231ab1a055ab659/134_106_2002_2954/678.jpg\" alt=\"South Africa’s Anrich Nortje celebrates taking the wicket of England’s Jonathan Bairstow at Lord’s on the rain shortened first day of the first Test.\" width=\"678\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa’s Anrich Nortje, seen here celebrating taking the wicket of England’s Jonathan Bairstow, built up a serious head of steam and took three wickets on day one</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as well as Rabada bowled first-up — Lungi Ngidi, his new ball partner, was less threatening but still frugal — it was South Africa’s two change bowlers who pointed to the significant challenge England face over the next four weeks. The wiry Marco Jansen is a unique prospect as a 6ft 7in left-armer who swings the ball, while Anrich Nortje, a bowler they know well from their last meeting in 2019-20, remains fast and nasty.</p> <p>Jansen replaced Ngidi after five overs at the Pavilion End and took an instant liking to the slope. Joe Root was newly arrived with the score an all-too familiar 25 for two, unleashed one brutal cut for four, but he was soon on his way lbw for eight when Jansen brought a full ball back into his pads. It looked plumb live — the umpire Nitin Menon thought so —even if Hawkeye suggested the ball would merely graze leg stump.</p> <p>Thereafter, it was Nortje who dominated en route to figures of three for 43 from nine overs, following a slightly rusty start by bowling the in-form Jonny Bairstow for a duck. Some may point to the mode of dismissal being all-too familiar for the Yorkshireman but the 93mph inswinger that uprooted his middle stump would have done for many others.</p> <p>Out strode Stokes at 55 for four and one wondered whether his frenetic approach from earlier in the season would follow. Bar a couple of early sashays down the pitch, the England captain looked to be building an innings and two on-driven fours suggested a game in good order. But he fell for 20 off the last ball of the morning to make it 100 for five, squared up by one that nipped down the slope and took the edge.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/17/england-set-up-jonny-bairstow-cricket-south-africa-test-series\">Relaxed England setup won’t suit all, but it’s perfect for Jonny Bairstow | Mark Ramprakash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the other end, Pope had played nicely for a 10th score of 50 or more in Test cricket. A reviewed lbw from Ngidi on nine was shown to be sliding down leg and the right-hander’s occasional flirtations outside off kept Elgar and his fellow slips interested. But overall he was busy at the crease, took on Nortje when he erred, and offered the latest piece of evidence that the promotion to No 3 this summer could work out.</p> <p>Nortje was the standout from this truncated initial skirmish, however, and during the six overs of play after lunch the right-armer sent Ben Foakes packing for six to spark the latest of his full-throated celebrations. It was a slightly meek waft from Foakes that saw the ball cannon on to the stumps but pace — an asset England do not possess because of injuries — can induce such indecision.</p> <p>This final breakthrough came just moments before an afternoon watching lakes form on the outfield while thunder rumbled overhead and means Pope will resume on the second day with Stuart Broad for company. England’s No 8 used all of his nous to slow things down ahead of the rain but he would surely have rather been bowling.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/17/worcesters-premiership-future-under-threat-after-winding-up-petition","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T17:11:18Z","webTitle":"Worcester’s Premiership future under threat after winding-up petition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/worcesters-premiership-future-under-threat-after-winding-up-petition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/17/worcesters-premiership-future-under-threat-after-winding-up-petition","fields":{"headline":"Worcester’s Premiership future under threat after winding-up petition","trailText":"The Gallagher Premiership has been thrown into turmoil after Worcester Warriors were issued with a winding-up petition over an unpaid tax bill","byline":"Mark Dobson","body":"<p>The Gallagher Premiership has been thrown into turmoil after Worcester Warriors were issued with a winding‑up petition.</p> <p>Warriors are due to play London Irish on 10 September but they will first have to settle an unpaid tax bill or face potential liquidation.</p> <p>The club remain hopeful that a solution can be found before the start of the season but the news comes two months after Worcester were late paying their players’ May salaries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/ian-foster-endorsed-as-all-blacks-coach-through-to-2023-rugby-world-cup\">Ian Foster endorsed as All Blacks coach through to 2023 Rugby World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the time the club put those issues down to a “short-term cashflow issue” with pleas for patience to suppliers regarding the outstanding bills.

Carlin was confronting the taboo of universally applied expletives; the P-word is no such thing.</p> <p>Second, venues are perfectly entitled to request to review the content of a performance before agreeing to host it. If, in this instance, given Sadowitz’s reputation, the Pleasance theatre neglected to do so, then surely it forfeits the right to censure thereafter (without compensating the performer and his disappointed audience for its own negligence)? No venue is – nor should be – compelled to host an act that contradicts its values, but it had every opportunity to make such conditions explicit in its contract. While it’s ostensibly admirable that the Pleasance has chosen to act in defence of its principles, it’s implausible to claim that his controversial material might come as a surprise.</p> <p>I should caveat the above by confirming that I’ve not seen Sadowitz’s show and, as Logan points out, context is important. I often wince at, say, individual lines from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/12/doug-stanhope-review-brixton-academy\" title=\"\">Doug Stanhope’s</a> stuff while at the same time appreciating that his provocative statements are crucial to the subsequent points he makes so brilliantly.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Matthew O’Connor</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>London</em></p> <p>• Brian Logan says that he’d defend “a space for comics like Sadowitz, performing one of humour’s age-old functions, as a safety valve for our darkest, most transgressive impulses”. There is a deep irony in using the word “safety” in this context. Many women, black, Asian and minority ethnic people, and LGBTQ+ people, including me, believe safety is compromised and eroded by the legitimisation of sexism, misogyny, racism and homophobia through comedy.</p> <p>As Logan says, what is considered acceptable or offensive is not fixed, and changes according to trends. However, when audience members who were already aware that they were attending a performance that pushed the boundaries feel forced to leave, it seems clear that a line has been crossed.</p> <p>Hate speech is prohibited by law, and it is a widely held belief that it can lead directly or indirectly to acts of violence. In the interests of everyone’s wellbeing, especially those whose safety is most fragile, we should be moving away from expressions of hatred as entertainment, not embracing them in the guise of “comedy”.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• As readers nod approvingly at Margaret Atwood’s case for Salman Rushdie’s defence of “freedom of artistic expression against all comers” (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/salman-rushdie-free-speech-tyranny-satanic-verses\" title=\"\">If we don’t defend free speech, we live in tyranny: Salman Rushdie shows us that, 15 August</a>), they will doubtless see a parallel with the government’s ongoing campaign to keep the culture war well stoked.</p> <p>The same spirit of freedom that celebrates Rushdie’s right to cause offence must also embrace Jerry Sadowitz’s right to cause offence to venue owners and middle-class audiences at the Edinburgh fringe.</p> <p>As we defend the right of writers, artists and performers to offend others, we must equally defend their right to write, make and perform material that we ourselves find offensive, otherwise the very notion of artistic freedom is rendered meaningless. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Eddie Duggan</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Ipswich, Suffolk</em></p> <p><strong>• <em>Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We found that Bangladeshi men recruited to work in construction typically took on debts equivalent to a year’s earnings (including maximum overtime), and normally took about 18 months to pay them off.</p> <p>Even Filipina domestic workers, who under Philippine law may not be charged recruitment fees, often ended up paying five or six months of their earnings to free themselves of recruitment debts, and they were the most favourably placed of the workers classified as semi-skilled.</p> <p>Recruitment fees are not only a heavy burden on workers who had hoped to support their families by working abroad, but they also increase their vulnerability to the worst forms of exploitation.

He said: “Confused and scared because now it looks like a situation where what happened was completely different and I was scared.”</p> <p>Giggs’s barrister, Chris Daw QC, asked him: “Did you at any stage put your hands on Kate’s shoulders and forcefully and deliberately head-butt her in the face?”</p> <p>“No, I didn’t,” Giggs replied. “Would you ever do such a thing?” Daw asked. “No,” Giggs said.</p> <p>Giggs said there was “no excuse whatsoever” for an email he sent to Greville with the subject line “CUNT!!!” after she told him she did not want him to join her on a trip to Scotland in June 2020.</p> <p>Jurors had heard that the email read: “Only an evil horrible cunt does that. Absolutely astonishing. Now I look an utter twat after telling three of my friends I’m going to Scotland at the weekend … I’m so fucking mad now I’m scaring myself because I could do anything.”</p> <p>Under cross-examination from Wright, Giggs admitted that this was meant as a “threat”. </p> <p>Asked earlier by Daw whether there was any excuse for using that “truly appalling” language, Giggs said: “No excuse whatsoever.” He added: “I can’t believe I used that sort of language to someone I was supposedly in love with.”</p> <p>The trial at Manchester crown court continues.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/17/mamoun-hassan-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T16:49:49Z","webTitle":"Mamoun Hassan obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/17/mamoun-hassan-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/17/mamoun-hassan-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Mamoun Hassan obituary","trailText":"Director and producer who supported the making of classic British films including Gregory’s Girl, Babylon and When the Wind Blows","byline":"Kevin Brownlow","body":"<p>The producer Mamoun Hassan, who has died aged 84, was a significant figure in British cinema of the 1970s and 80s, whose remarkable career, if not entirely satisfying his artistic gifts, was unusual in that it enabled so many other film-makers’ careers, and gave rise to numerous courageously non-commercial projects. What was notable was how commercial some of them turned out to be.</p> <p>Although he was a talented director and screenwriter, it was in his roles as the first head of production of the British Film Institute (1971-74) and managing director of the National Film Finance Corporation (NFFC, 1979-84) that Mamoun was most influential, being instrumental in the making of such classic British films as Bill Forsyth’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/03/how-we-made-gregorys-girl-john-gordon-sinclair-clare-grogan-bill-forsyth-movie\" title=\"\">Gregory’s Girl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/02/franco-rosso-obituary\" title=\"\">Franco Rosso</a>’s Babylon (both 1980) and the animated adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/10/raymond-briggs-obituary\" title=\"\">Raymond Briggs</a>’s When the Wind Blows, directed by Jimmy Murakami (1986).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/20/filmandmusic1.filmandmusic6\">His pain was our pain: working with director Bill Douglas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the most important figure he brought to prominence was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/20/filmandmusic1.filmandmusic6\" title=\"\">Bill Douglas</a>, the Scottish film-maker responsible for the exceptional My Childhood trilogy (1972-78) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/18/comrades-tolpuddle-martyrs-bill-douglas\" title=\"\">Comrades</a> (1986), an important political film about the Tolpuddle Martyrs of the 1830s.</p> <p>In 1976 Mamoun had backed and supported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/terence-davies\" title=\"\">Terence Davies</a>’s first production, the short film Children, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/21/banned-knighted-horace-ove-godfather-black-british-film-making-pressure-police-brutality-reggae\" title=\"\">Horace Ové’s Pressure</a>, the first serious feature film to reflect the black experience in Britain.

This continued a pattern of breaking the rules and putting his job on the line by committing more money than he was supposed to.

His family came to London in 1949, settling in Hampstead, north London, where Mamoun went to King Alfred’s school.</p> <p>In 1958, he began studying electrical engineering at University College London. I first met him during this time, in the early 60s, when I was working as an editor for a documentary film company and he came to work for me as an assistant. Eventually, Mamoun made the decision to work in film rather than in engineering, and he left university before graduation. </p> <p>When I was asked to make a short documentary for the BFI on the last tram in Britain, 9, Dalmuir West (1962), Mamoun was indispensable as second cameraman. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e58931d3a785a1905ad11a0d14caf4fb2dd2ea59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e58931d3a785a1905ad11a0d14caf4fb2dd2ea59/227_0_4130_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Babylon, 1980, by Franco Rosso, which Mamoun Hassan backed at the NFFC after it had been rejected elsewhere.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Babylon, 1980, by Franco Rosso, which Mamoun Hassan backed at the NFFC after it had been rejected elsewhere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The films that Mamoun made at the beginning of his career – documentaries and shorts – proved his talent. The Meeting (1964) won the best short film award at the 1965 Oberhausen international film festival. A feature film that he was due to direct for the producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/24/stanley-donen-obituary\" title=\"\">Stanley Donen</a> lost its studio backers just before shooting; shortly afterwards came the BFI offer, in 1971.</p> <p>Douglas’s script for Childhood, which was then called Jamie, was one of the first that Mamoun read. It was his idea to make it the first of a trilogy, to ensure that Douglas would get the rest of his films made, and after it won the Silver Lion at Venice in 1972, its success helped the BFI move into feature production.</p> <p>In 1974, Mamoun left to lead the film section for the <a href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/\" title=\"\">United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East</a> (UNRWA), based in Lebanon. As soon as he landed, civil war broke out and he found himself avoiding gunfire while directing the film <a href=\"https://moviemasterclass.com/some-of-the-palestinians-restored\" title=\"\">Some of the Palestinians (1976)</a>,. It went on to win an outstanding film award at the London film festival.</p> <p>On returning to the UK in 1976, Mamoun was invited to form and head the directing department of the National Film and Television School. The following year he became a member of the Cinematograph Films Council, advising the government, while also being a founder member of the Association of Independent Producers, critiquing said government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b6b1376a54b0d854b2cd641b6a28c7eb7cce27b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b6b1376a54b0d854b2cd641b6a28c7eb7cce27b/0_240_3240_1944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Winstanley, 1975; Mamoun Hassan granted the finance to Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo to make the film.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Winstanley, 1975; Mamoun Hassan granted the finance to Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo to make the film.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BFI/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As managing director of the NFFC, Mamoun, unlike his illustrious predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-john-terry-1616572.html\" title=\"\">Sir John Terry</a>, never asked for an executive producer credit on the feature films he backed and nurtured. Many years later, he confessed this had probably been a bad idea.</p> <p>Despite its renewed creativity under Mamoun, the NFFC was abolished in 1985, a year after his departure. That year he produced Alan Bleasdale’s No Surrender, directed by his friend and collaborator Peter Smith. Mamoun had backed Smith’s 1974 feature, A Private Enterprise, set in the growing Asian community in Britain, while at the BFI.</p> <p>In 1988 Mamoun devised the<a href=\"https://moviemasterclass.com/\" title=\"\"> Movie Masterclass </a>series for Channel 4, based on his work with students at the NFTS. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/06/the-guardian-view-on-satyajit-ray-a-genius-of-cinema\" title=\"\">Satyajit Ray</a> said of the masterclass on his film The World of Apu that “it was a lesson for me, too”. </p> <p>In 1997 Mamoun was appointed dean of editing at Escuela Internacional de Cine y TV (EICTV), in Cuba. He went on to co-produce, co-write and co-edit the award-winning Chilean film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1478890,00.html\" title=\"\">Machuca</a> (2004), directed by Andrés Wood. </p> <p> With Wood, Mamoun also wrote the screenplay for La Buena Vida (The Good Life, 2008), which won a slew of awards including a Spanish Goya.</p> <p>Mamoun was one of the most intelligent men I have met. His opinions were often startling and always stimulating. </p> <p>In 1966 he married Moya Gillespie, a publishing editor. She survives him, as do their two sons, Sherief and Anies, two granddaughters, Sabrina and Jasmine, and a brother, Talaat.</p> <p>• Mamoun Hassan, film producer, screenwriter and director, born 12 December 1937; died 29 July 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/17/they-turned-us-into-savages-russian-soldier-describes-start-of-ukraine-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T16:37:16Z","webTitle":"‘They turned us into savages’: Russian soldier describes start of Ukraine invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/17/they-turned-us-into-savages-russian-soldier-describes-start-of-ukraine-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/17/they-turned-us-into-savages-russian-soldier-describes-start-of-ukraine-invasion","fields":{"headline":"‘They turned us into savages’: Russian soldier describes start of Ukraine invasion","trailText":"In this extract from former paratrooper Pavel Filatyev’s memoir, he recalls wild looting after soldiers entered Kherson","byline":"Pavel Filatyev","body":"<p><em>These are extracts </em><em>from Pavel Filatyev’s memoir, ZOV, which he published on his Vkontakte social media page on 1 August. ZOV, </em><em>named after the tactical markings painted on Russian army vehicles that have been adopted as a pro-war symbol</em><em>, is the most detailed</em><em> voluntary account from a Russian soldier participating in the invasion of Ukraine.</em></p> <p><em>In the first translated extract, Filatyev describes, hours after the Russian troops entered the city, how his unit ransacked the port of Kherson</em><em>.</em></p> <h2><strong>1 March</strong><strong> 2022</strong></h2> <p>Half an hour later, we arrived at the port of Kherson. It was dark. The units that were marching ahead of us had already occupied the port. The soldiers were looking for a place to sleep and clean themselves. The territory consisted of a checkpoint, an office, and a building resembling a dormitory with warehouses, changing rooms, and shower points. The ships were at the pier. The mortar division took over a large office on the ground floor. Other divisions such as the 247th Guards Air Assault Regiment and the Stavropol Spetsnaz (the former Russian military intelligence) began entering the port. I decided to explore the area.</p> <p>Have you ever seen the paintings of the Sack of Rome by the barbarians? This is the best way to describe what was going on around me. Everyone looked worn-out and feral, and we all began to scour the buildings in search of food, water, a shower and a place for the night; some started grabbing computers and whatever valuable goods they could find. I was no exception: I found a hat in a smashed-up truck onsite and took it. My balaclava was too cold. I became disgusted with all the looting, despite my wild state.</p> <p>In an office with televisions, a few people were sitting watching the news; they’d found a bottle of champagne there.</p> <p>Coming out of the building, I saw a battalion commander and greeted him as was customary in our military rules. He greeted me, shook my hand and I bummed a cigarette from him, Marlboro Red. While smoking, I asked him how everything was going. He told me that everything was fine, that it will all be over soon … With these thoughts in mind and hoping deep down inside that this all will end soon, I returned to the offices occupied by the mortar division to get some sleep.</p> <p>In the offices, there was a cafeteria with a kitchen and fridges. Like savages, we ate everything there: oats, porridge, jam, honey, coffee. We didn’t give a damn about anything, we’d already been pushed to the limit. Most had spent a month in the fields with no hint of comfort, a shower or normal food.</p> <p>What a wild state you can drive people to by not giving any thought to the fact that they need to sleep, eat and wash.</p> <p>Everything around gave us a vile feeling; like wretches, we were just trying to survive.</p> <p>Everyone was in a rush, looking for a place to sleep, and people were fighting for a place in the shower queue. I was disgusted by all this yet realised that I was part of it all. The command must not have cared about its people who were giving everything to carry out their plans, which were not so clear to us. They turned people into absolute savages, ignoring the fact that they need to sleep, eat, and take a shower.</p> <p>Even though I have a lot of nerve, I decided to keep it low in the shower queue. I was positive that now we would hold Kherson for some time, and I could still get an opportunity to take a shower.</p> <p>It was getting close to midnight. For the first time in a week, I took off my bulletproof vest and thermal underwear, placed my belongings along with the weapons at the large, 2-metre-long table, and laid down on it. I was in a state of great bliss, my whole body was buzzing in a desperate need of sleep</p> <p>The office was nice. Lying on my back on this table, with my head covered with a uniform, I was reminiscing about my past work in a similar office. I was a different person then and I felt like it happened in another life. Now, I’m lying like a savage on the office table with everything turned upside down all around, feeling like sleeping in a five-star hotel if one ignores the occasional shooting sounds coming from the outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6522df49e12a028e977b8c8a91da311f307fa52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6522df49e12a028e977b8c8a91da311f307fa52/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian soldier Pavel Filatev.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pavel Filatyev.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>In the second extract, Filatyev expresses his anger over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</strong></h2> <p>I fought in Ukraine, and if I don’t have the right to say “No to war” why does someone else have the right to start the war?

Where is the breadth of the Russian soul? Where did our nobility and spirituality disappear? … Our ancestors shed so much of their own blood for the sake of freedom.

But I need to feel justice, to understand that what I’m doing is right. And I believe that this is all failing not only because the government has stolen everything, but because we, Russians, don’t feel that what we are doing is right.”</p> <p>Two weeks ago, Filatyev went on to his VKontakte social media page and published a 141-page bombshell: a day-by-day description of how his paratrooper unit was sent to mainland Ukraine from Crimea, entered Kherson and captured the seaport, and dug in under heavy artillery fire for more than a month near Mykolaiv – and then how he eventually was wounded and evacuated from the conflict with an eye infection.</p> <p>By then, he was convinced he had to expose the rot at the core of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We were sitting under artillery fire by Mykolaiv,” he said. “At that point I already thought that we’re just out here doing bullshit, what the fuck do we need this war for? And I really had this thought: ‘God, if I survive, then I’ll do everything that I can to stop this.’”</p> <p>He spent 45 days writing his memoirs from the conflict, breaking an omerta under which even the word war has been banished in public. “I simply can’t stay quiet any longer, even though I know that I probably won’t change anything, and maybe I’ve acted foolishly to get myself in so much trouble,” says Filatyev, his fingers shaking from stress as he lit another cigarette.</p> <p>His memoir, ZOV, is named for the tactical markings painted on Russian army vehicles that have been adopted as a pro-war symbol in Russia. Until now, there has been no more detailed, voluntary account from a Russian soldier participating in the invasion of Ukraine.

That also made Filatyev the first soldier known to have fled Russia due to opposition to the war. “And it’s opening a Pandora’s box.”</p> <p>This week the Russian investigative site iStories, which Russia has banned from the country, has published a confession from another Russian soldier admitting on camera to shooting and killing a civilian resident in the Ukrainian city of Andriivka.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most people in the army are unhappy about what’s going on there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Filatyev, who served in the 56th Guards air assault regiment based in Crimea, described how his exhausted and poorly equipped unit stormed into mainland Ukraine behind a hail of rocket fire in late February, with little in terms of concrete logistics or objectives, and no idea why the war was taking place at all. “It took me weeks to understand there was no war on Russian territory at all, and that we had just attacked Ukraine,” he said.</p> <p>At one point, Filatyev describes how the ravenous paratroopers, the elite of the Russian army, captured the Kherson seaport and immediately began grabbing “computers and whatever valuable goods we could find”.

And who knows if he’ll be alive tomorrow anyway. So he takes it. I’m not trying to justify what he’s done. But I think it’s important to say why people act like this, to understand how to stop them … What a person will do in these kinds of extreme situations.”</p> <p>He railed at length against what he called the “degradation” of the army, including the use of dated kit and vehicles that left Russian soldiers exposed to Ukrainian counterattacks. The rifle he was given before the war was rusted and had a broken strap, he said.</p> <p>“We were just an ideal target,” he wrote, describing travelling to Kherson on obsolete and unarmoured UAZ trucks that sometimes stood in place for 20 minutes. “It was unclear what the plan was – as always no one knew anything.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"324938ab4baa64e0de4657cb4598eb06db9a89df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/324938ab4baa64e0de4657cb4598eb06db9a89df/0_247_5805_3483/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian soldiers guard an area as a group of foreign journalists visit in Kherson, 20 May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian soldiers guard an area as a group of foreign journalists visit in Kherson on 20 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Filatyev describes his unit, as the war dragged on, being pinned down in trenches for nearly a month near Mykolaiv under Ukrainian artillery fire. It was there that a shell blasted mud into his eye, leading to an infection that nearly blinded him.</p> <p>As frustrations grew on the front, he wrote about reports of soldiers deliberately shooting themselves in order to escape the front and collect 3 million roubles (£40,542) in compensation, as well as rumours of acts of mutilation against captured soldiers and corpses.</p> <p>In the interview, he said he had not personally seen the acts of abuse carried out during the war. But he described a culture of anger and resentment in the army that tears down the facade of total support for the war portrayed in Russian propaganda.</p> <p>“Most people in the army are unhappy about what’s going on there, they’re unhappy about the government and their commanders, they’re unhappy with Putin and his politics, they’re unhappy with the minister of defence, who has never served in the army,” he wrote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84b455eb3bf27726bac54861ae7876c3edd42112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84b455eb3bf27726bac54861ae7876c3edd42112/0_0_1200_1019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pavel Filatyev\" width=\"1000\" height=\"849\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pavel Filatyev.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yegor Slizyak</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since going public, he said, his entire unit has cut contact with him. But he believed that 20% of them supported his protest outright. And many others, in quiet conversations, had told him about a grudging sense of respect for the patriotism of Ukrainians fighting to defend their own territory. Or had complained about mistreatment by Russia of its own soldiers.</p> <p>“No one is treating veterans here,” he said at one point. In military hospitals, he described meeting disgruntled soldiers, including wounded sailors from the Moskva cruiser, sunk by Ukrainian missiles in April, shouting a senior officer out of the room. And, in ZOV, he claimed that “there are heaps of dead, whose relatives have not been paid compensation”, corroborating <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/some-wounded-russian-soldiers-find-compensation-elusive-despite-putins-pledge-2022-07-29/\">media reports</a> of wounded soldiers waiting months for payouts.</p> <p>Filatyev’s original plan was to publish his memoir and immediately turn himself in to the police. But Osechkin, the activist, told him to reconsider while urging him repeatedly to flee the country. Until this week, he had refused to do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e29b00093d6e1fa94cbcc9645f38067bc0772f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e29b00093d6e1fa94cbcc9645f38067bc0772f1/0_0_1440_810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian cruiser Moskva, damaged by Ukrainian anti-ship missiles prior to its sinking\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Russian cruiser Moskva, damaged by Ukrainian anti-ship missiles, prior to its sinking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“So I leave, I go to America, and who am I there?

Even then, he admits, he should not have been hard to find.</p> <p>The Guardian has not been able to independently verify all the details of Filatyev’s story, but he has supplied documents and photographs showing he was a paratrooper with the 56th airborne regiment stationed in Crimea, that he was hospitalised with an eye injury sustained while “performing special tasks in Ukraine” in April and that he had written directly to the Kremlin with his complaints about the war before going public.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e82f3a40aecf9817ea2508e5e524e90490e8da07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e82f3a40aecf9817ea2508e5e524e90490e8da07/0_0_628_1011/621.jpg\" alt=\"Filtayev posing with a rifle\" width=\"621\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filatyev posing with a rifle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yegor Slizyak</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Old photographs show Filatyev as a teenager in a blue-and-white <em>telnyashka</em> (the traditional blue and white undershirt worn by military personnel) among his fellow soldiers, then hanging from a carousel during paratrooper training, then, already older, clean-shaven in tan camouflage posing with a rifle in Crimea before the war began.</p> <p>Born into a military family in the southern city of Volgodonsk, Filatyev, 34, spent much of his early 20s in the army. After serving in Chechnya in the late 2000s, he spent nearly a decade as a horse trainer, working for the Russian meat-producing company Miratorg and wealthy clients before reenlisting in 2021 for financial reasons, he said.</p> <p>Now he is a changed man. He remains powerfully built and articulate, but war and stress have taken their toll. His scarred cheeks are covered by a two-week old stubble. He still can’t see properly out of his right eye. And he laughs bitterly at having to complain about the Russian army to a foreign journalist and “coming to talk to you like a priest over beers”.</p> <p>“They say that the heroism of some is the fault of others,” he said. “It’s the 21st century, we started this idiotic war, and once again we’re calling on soldiers to carry out heroic deeds, to sacrifice themselves. What’s the problem – are we not dying out at it is?”</p> <p>Most of all, he wondered why he was still free. He had heard that his unit was preparing to charge him with desertion, an accusation that could land him in prison for many years. And yet nothing happened.</p> <p>“I don’t understand why they still haven’t snatched me up,” he says upon meeting at a train station in Moscow. “I’ve said more than anyone has for the last six months. Maybe they don’t know what to do with me.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am just terrified of what happens next</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is a mystery he may never solve. Filatyev fled the country via an undisclosed route sometime after Saturday evening, when he headed off to find a hostel to spend the night. Two days later, Osechkin announced Filatyev had managed to escape Russia “before his arrest”. It is still unclear whether or not he has been charged formally with any crime in Russia.</p> <p>“Why should I have to flee my country just for telling the truth about what these bastards have turned our army into,” Filatyev wrote in a Telegram message. “I am overwhelmed by emotions that I have had to leave my country.”</p> <p>He remains one of just a handful of Russian soldiers to have spoken out publicly about the war, albeit after months of agonising about how to do so without violating his service. “People ask me why I didn’t throw down my weapon,” he said. “Well I’m against this war, but I’m not a general, I’m not the defence minister, I’m not Putin – I don’t know how to stop this. I wouldn’t have changed anything to become a coward, and throw down my weapon and abandon my comrades.”</p> <p>Sitting along the busy streets of Moscow for possibly the last time, he said he hoped this would all come to an end after popular protests like during the Vietnam war. But for now, he said, that seemed far off.</p> <p>“I am just terrified of what happens next,” he said, imagining Russia fighting for total victory despite the terrible cost. “What will we pay for that? Who will be left in our country? ... For myself I said that this is a personal tragedy. Because what have we become? And how can it get any worse?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/17/darius-campbell-danesh-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T16:36:16Z","webTitle":"Darius Campbell Danesh obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/17/darius-campbell-danesh-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/17/darius-campbell-danesh-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Darius Campbell Danesh obituary","trailText":"Star of TV’s Pop Idol who went on to have a successful stage career","byline":"Anthony Hayward","body":"<p>The Scottish singer Darius Campbell Danesh, who has died suddenly aged 41, burst into the early world of reality television when he appeared on the talent show Popstars, the first of its kind, in 2001.</p> <p>As Darius Danesh he sported a ponytail, radiated self-confidence and looked a potential winner, at his most dramatic performing an over-the-top, falsetto version of the Britney Spears hit … Baby One More Time – before the judges, Nigel Lythgoe, Nicki Chapman and Paul Adam, sent him packing halfway through the series. He admitted that: “I wouldn’t have voted for me.”</p> <p>Nevertheless, the 20-year-old – in the middle of studying English and philosophy at Edinburgh University – told “Nasty Nigel” that he would record a platinum-winning album by the time he was 30.</p> <p>He went straight into Popstars’ successor, Pop Idol, later that year, allaying any ideas that presentation overshadowed substance. He came third, behind Gareth Gates and the winner, Will Young, but turned down a recording contract offered to him by Simon Cowell, who was making his name as a judge and TV personality after years working as a record company executive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"11a66d109aa57182e55a363ade1eabb92b79c18a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11a66d109aa57182e55a363ade1eabb92b79c18a/0_0_1244_1546/805.jpg\" alt=\"The Popl Idol finalists of 2002.

Instead, Darius – as he would be credited on disc – signed to Mercury Records to make his first album, Dive In (2002), with Steve Lillywhite, who launched the career of U2, as executive producer. Darius wrote all the songs and it became a Top 10 hit that quickly fulfilled his vow to go platinum.</p> <p>He also went straight to No 1 that year with his debut single, Colourblind. In its video, Darius is seen being thrown out of a car in the middle of Spain’s Sierra Nevada, dressed in a black suit and holding his guitar, before changing into jeans – signifying that he was leaving his Pop Idol image behind.</p> <p>He followed Colourblind with another four Top 10 singles, then carved out a new career in musical theatre. He played the defence lawyer Billy Flynn for two runs in the West End revival of Chicago at the Adelphi theatre in 2005 and 2006. Although there had been some scepticism about this casting, Darius proved an adept stage star and made a brief return to the part in 2011, as well as touring with the show in 2017. Following his first stint in Chicago, he was taken seriously enough to be given the starring role of Sky Masterson in the director Michael Grandage’s Olivier award-winning production of Guys and Dolls (Piccadilly theatre, 2007).</p> <p>The following year, directed by Trevor Nunn, he starred as Rhett Butler in the original production of Gone With the Wind (New London theatre, 2008), Margaret Martin’s musical adaptation of Margaret Mitchell’s epic novel. The sprawling three-hour show received a critical battering and ended after eight weeks, although there was some praise for him. Paul Taylor wrote in the Independent: “The diabolically dashing Darius Danesh (of Pop Idol fame) brings a seductively insolent charm, a dark velvet voice and a genuine, fugitive pathos to the cynical blockade runner.”</p> <p>Later, he was back in the West End starring as First Sergeant Milt Warden in the world premiere of From Here to Eternity (Shaftesbury theatre, 2013-14), a musical written by Tim Rice with Stuart Brayson and Bill Oakes, based on James Jones’s novel. It opened to mixed reviews and ran for six months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbbdd26c52960fd53535711906973f6b8d79347d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbbdd26c52960fd53535711906973f6b8d79347d/0_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darius Campbell Danesh as Rhett Butler with Jill Paice as Scarlett O’Hara in a musical adaptationof Gone With the Wind at the New London theatre in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darius Campbell Danesh as Rhett Butler with Jill Paice as Scarlett O’Hara in a musical adaptation<br>of Gone With the Wind at the New London theatre in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Critics were more enthusiastic about the West End revival (2015-16) of Funny Girl, in which Darius played the gambler Nick Arnstein, opposite Sheridan Smith’s Fanny Brice. It opened at the Menier Chocolate Factory, with one reviewer noting the “caddish charm” he brought to the role, before moving to the Savoy theatre.</p> <p>Born in Glasgow, Darius was the eldest of three sons of a Scottish mother, Avril (nee Campbell), a GP, and an Iranian father, Booth Danesh, a gastroenterologist, and was brought up in Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire.</p> <p>He was just 12 when he took to the stage with Scottish Opera in the non-singing role of a Trojan boy in an avant-garde production of The Trojans. Then he toured with the company in Carmen, which included a performance at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.</p> <p>On leaving Glasgow academy, he yearned to train as an actor at Rada, but his parents wanted him to become a doctor or lawyer. He said going to university was a compromise.</p> <p>Failing to make it into the final 10 of Popstars meant Darius would not be part of Hear’Say, the band formed by the five winning contestants, or Liberty X, comprising the runners-up.</p> <p>But Pop Idol set him on his way and he followed Colourblind in the singles chart with Rushes (2002) and Incredible (What I Meant to Say), the following year. A second album, Live Twice (2004), proved to be his final LP, hovering outside the Top 30, although it did produce two Top 10 singles, Kinda Love (2004) and the title track (2005). His 2003 memoir, Sink or Swim: My Story, was a bestseller.</p> <p>He returned to reality television to win the first series of Popstar to Operastar (2010) and even managed to break into feature film-making, as a producer credited as Darius Campbell, on Imperium (2016), and Tomorrow (2018).</p> <p>In 2011, Darius married the Canadian actor and model Natasha Henstridge; they divorced in 2018.

Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dems’ spokesperson on transport, condemned what she called a “strange and pointless idea [that] would pile extra costs on to people who are trying to be more active”.</p> <p>The DfT did not dispute that this was what Shapps meant, but said there was no plan in place and it would be a matter for whoever was transport secretary under the new prime minister.</p> <p>Somewhat confusingly, in a separate interview with <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/saddle-cyclists-with-speed-limits-too-says-grant-shapps-2jk8dmw56\">the Times</a>, Shapps said he was “not attracted to the bureaucracy of registration plates”, adding: “That would go too far.”</p> <p>Mandatory registration for cyclists is almost unknown in any country, and is widely seen as difficult to enforce and bringing no net benefit given the relatively little danger that cyclists pose to others, and the probable impact of such bureaucracy on levels of cycling.</p> <p>The official DfT line, as explained by the junior transport minister Charlotte Vere in a <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2021-11-01.HL3569.h&amp;s=registration+of+cyclists#gHL3569.r0\">parliamentary answer last year</a>, is that the costs of registration “would outweigh the benefits, and this would deter many people from cycling”.</p> <p>Edmund King, the AA president, said: “It is in the interests of all road users, and indeed our environment, that as a society we encourage more use of active travel, such as walking and cycling, and also the transition to zero emission vehicles.</p> <p>“Introducing more barriers to slow the take-up of safe cycling would be a retrograde step. What we really need is better infrastructure for cycling so that some of the present-day issues on the roads are removed.” </p> <p>Labour’s shadow transport minister, Gill Furniss said: “This absurd and unworkable plan would create a mountain of bureaucracy for cyclists, and force people away from active travel. Buses are in crisis, rail services are being slashed, fares and fuel are soaring – and the transport secretary’s big idea is to slap number plates on tens of million of bicycles.”</p> <p>Hobhouse said: “This would be another blow to those struggling to afford transport costs, especially with fuel prices spiralling and rail fares set to rise by a record amount. Registration plates also risk more bureaucracy for people who simply want to teach their child to ride a bike, or frankly just get to work.”</p> <p>Matt Edwards, the Greens’ transport spokesperson, said registration would be “an expensive folly that would be impossible to administer”. He said: “Most road traffic accidents in the UK, especially those with fatalities, are caused by reckless car drivers, not cyclists. The anti-cycling narrative this government is pushing is actually making things far more dangerous for cyclists.”</p> <p>Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns for Cycling UK, said the plans were “impractical and unworkable, and have been repeatedly dismissed by successive governments. They’re also a complete U-turn on current government policy. “Every country which has tried to implement such ideas have soon realised their costly mistake.”</p> <p>Simon Munk, the campaigns manager for the London Cycling Campaign, said many experts, including those in the DfT, had rejected the idea of registration.</p> <p>He said: “Shapps seems to be playing to a tabloid audience in attacking cyclists as scofflaws, but it is cars, not cycles, that present the greatest road danger. Being hit by a motor vehicle is the principal cause of death and serious injury to all road users, and survey after survey shows that drivers are more likely to break road rules.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/17/who-is-harriet-hageman-liz-cheney-wyoming-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T16:26:39Z","webTitle":"Harriet Hageman: who is the Republican who beat Liz Cheney?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/who-is-harriet-hageman-liz-cheney-wyoming-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/who-is-harriet-hageman-liz-cheney-wyoming-trump","fields":{"headline":"Harriet Hageman: who is the Republican who beat Liz Cheney?","trailText":"The lawyer appears to be the ideal candidate to carry Trump’s rightwing banner into the midterms – but she hasn’t always been aboard his train","byline":"Richard Luscombe","body":"<p>A conservative lawyer with a passion for thwarting environmentalists, Harriet Hageman would appear to be an ideal candidate to carry Donald Trump’s rightwing banner into November’s midterm elections.</p> <p>On Tuesday night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/wyoming-republican-primary-liz-cheney-donald-trump-harriet-hageman\">she beat</a> the incumbent and member of Wyoming’s political royalty, Liz Cheney, for the thinly populated western state’s solitary seat in the US House of Representatives.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/liz-cheney-president-2024-trump-republican-primary-defeat\">Liz Cheney considers run for president after Republican primary defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After trouncing Cheney, Trump’s most vocal critic within the Republican party, Hageman, 59, has a clear run at election success.

England 116-6 (Pope 61, Broad 0)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The umpires have called it a day, which is both disappointing and completely understandable. That photogenic rain is not about to relent. “It is still absolutely lashing down,” says Ian Ward on Sky.</p> <p>We only got just over a third of a full day’s play, but it was enough for South Africa’s four horsemen of the apocalypse to ride roughshod over England’s top order. Kagiso Rabada was superb as ever, Anrich Nortje expensive but effective, and Marco Jansen grabbed the big one, the wicket of Joe Root.</p> <p>For England, Ollie Pope shone like a beacon in the gloom with a fluent 61 not out. His team need him to turn that into a hundred, along with a few biffs from Stuart Broad – who owes England both runs and wickets – and some sturdy resistance from Messrs Leach, Pope and Anderson. This could be a pitch on which 180 is a decent score. Or Dean Elgar could do a Graeme Smith and make England’s efforts look puny.</p> <p>That’s it from me. Thanks for your company, your views on England’s aggression – not so pronounced today, but still too much for some – and your pairings of players in the same team whose cap numbers were miles apart. Play is going to start half an hour early for the rest of the match, so I’ll see you at 10.30 tomorrow (when the forecast is fine).

Pete “Maverick” Mitchell in a scene from “Top Gun: Maverick.” Paramount Pictures on Wednesday postponed the release of the film, sending another of the fall’s top movies out of 2021 due to the rise in coronavirus cases and the delta variant. Instead of opening Nov. 19, the “Top Gun” sequel, starring Tom Cruise, will instead debut Memorial Day weekend next year, on May 27. (Scott Garfield/Paramount Pictures via AP) film still\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There was understandable caution surrounding the belated release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/12/top-gun-maverick-review-tom-cruise-is-still-needy-less-speedy-in-a-rocknroll-sequel\">Top Gun: Maverick</a>, an expensive, much-delayed sequel (announced in 2010, filmed in 2018) to an 80s film that wasn’t exactly calling out for one. Tom Cruise’s box office appeal outside of the Mission: Impossible films has been so spotty that he barely makes anything <em>but</em> Mission: Impossible films now and while the original holds a firm place in Hollywood history, it’s not received a noticeable second life with the advent of streaming. So there were dropped jaws all around when back in May, it not only opened big but opened bigger than anything Cruise has ever starred in before, flying high for the rest of the summer, making $1.3bn globally and counting (it recently surpassed Titanic to become the seventh biggest film of all time in the US).</p> <p>Rightwingers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/03/no-top-gun-mavericks-success-isnt-down-to-being-pro-america-and-anti-woke\">laughably claimed</a> such success was down to the film being pro-America and “anti-woke” (a dumb assertion that fails to correlate with other monster hits that have embraced more diversity) but its popularity can be more easily traced to two things. First, unlike other follow-ups to dusted off classics, the entry point for Maverick was far easier for younger, less familiar audiences. It’s a film about planes and flying planes and people who fly planes and like the recent retconned Halloween hits, doesn’t rely on a convoluted backstory, such as the doomed Terminator franchise did (one could enjoy it as a standalone film without having seen the original). Then secondly, and most importantly, it showed the re-energised star power of Cruise, a reminder that audiences still gravitate en masse toward the 60-year-old when he’s in familiar territory, playing to type (charming, rule-breaking, complexity-free), something that also saw fellow 90s A-lister Sandra Bullock score a $190m global hit with adventure comedy The Lost City this Spring. It’s an added relief for Paramount, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/09/mission-impossible-7-tom-cruise\">with two exorbitantly priced Mission: Impossibles on the way</a>, the first of which arrives next summer, a hope that he might be their billion-dollar man two years in a row.</p> <h2><strong>Universal rules the world</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e43b4362f68626476d85ffa0210a06fe7183e37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e43b4362f68626476d85ffa0210a06fe7183e37/146_0_3584_2151/1000.jpg\" alt=\"USA.

This week saw the company cross $3bn for the year so far, the first time a studio has done that since the before-times of 2019. Leading the pack despite mostly, unfairly atrocious reviews is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/08/jurassic-world-dominion-review-time-to-drop-the-dead-dino\">Jurassic World: Dominion</a>, the second highest-grossing film of the year with just under $1bn worldwide, a legacy sequel that like Maverick showed the nostalgic power of playing the long game (the “final” film of the franchise will surely not be so final now) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/22/minions-the-rise-of-gru-review-feeble-origin-story-hopefully-lays-franchise-to-rest\">the Minions prequel</a> not far behind with almost $800m. The studio also saw strong results over the summer for the animated adventure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/30/the-bad-guys-review-tarantino-style-kids-caper-is-amiable-animated-fun\">The Bad Guys</a> ($246m), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/22/the-black-phone-review-ethan-hawke-is-eerily-good-in-scary-clown-kidnap-horror\">The Black Phone</a> ($150m) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/20/nope-review-jordan-peele-daniel-kaluuya\">Nope</a> ($114m and counting). During the pandemic, Universal was one of the first studios to shrink a theatrical film’s release window, first for a premium $20 rental and then for its burgeoning streaming platform Peacock. Since then, and this is part of the reason for their bumper season, there’s more discernment over which film goes where and when. So while The Bad Guys and The Black Phone were free at home on Peacock in seven weeks, bigger films like the Jurassic World and Minions installments are yet to materialise as they still make money at the box office. Outside of Disney, Universal is also the studio with the most successful ongoing franchises, with their winning streak likely to continue until next summer with sequels Halloween Ends, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and Fast &amp; Furious 10 on the way.</p> <h2><strong>Breakouts struggled to break out</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbd445587a6911781e57274c8876b789610eb261\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbd445587a6911781e57274c8876b789610eb261/0_0_5405_3244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This image released by A24 shows Jessie Buckley in a scene from “Men.” (Kevin Baker/A24 via AP)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>While summer season is traditionally a time for superheroes and their super stunts, it’s also a time for many of us to get utterly exhausted with superheroes and their super stunts and so with each year there’s increasingly more and more smaller films to act as much-needed counter-programming in the US. In recent years, Midsommar ($27.7m from 2,707 screens), Won’t You Be My Neighbor? ($22.8m from 868 screens), Eighth Grade ($13.5m from 1,084 screens) and Sorry to Bother You ($17.4m from 1,050 screens) all successfully broke out of the outskirts and this year, a long line of low-budget non-franchise films all hoped to provide respite from product placement and post-credits cameos. But it wasn’t to be and instead, it was something of a bloodbath. The period romcom Mr Malcolm’s List ($1.8m from 1,384 screens), stalker thriller Watcher ($1.9m from 764 screens), metaphorical horror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/09/men-review-alex-garland-unleashes-multiple-rory-kinnears-in-wacky-folk-horror\">Men</a> ($7.5m from 2,212 screens), Cronenberg’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/23/crimes-of-the-future-review-cronenbergs-post-pain-post-sex-body-horror-sensation\">Crimes of the Future</a> ($2.4m from 773 screens), BJ Novak’s satire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/29/vengeance-review-bj-novak-ambitious-but-overstuffed-satire\">Vengeance</a> ($3.8m from 998 screens), well-reviewed fantasy Marcel the Shell with the Shoes on ($5.3m from 821 screens) and Diane Keaton body swap comedy Mack &amp; Rita ($1m from 1,930 screens) all struggled to get noticed.</p> <p>The only genuine indie hit was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/11/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-review-nothing-nowhere-over-a-long-period-of-time\">Everything Everywhere All at Once</a> ($69.6m from 2,213 screens) which technically came from before the summer back in March but played well for the warmer months and part of its success can be traced to it being marketed and structured like a Marvel blockbuster, toying with issues of superpowers and the multiverse, jam-packed with VFX, cleverly competing with the big boys. The overriding message of the summer might have been that cinema is well and truly back but audiences were still mostly craving Imax-level spectacle above all else, not surprising when so many of the season’s streaming premieres (from Hustle to Spiderhead to Father of the Bride to Prey to The Grey Man) looked like big-screen movies, making a trip to the multiplex harder to justify.

The first, and biggest, was Baz Lurhmann’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/25/elvis-review-baz-luhrmann-cannes-presley\">Elvis</a>. The director is no stranger to turning prestige awardsy dramas into summer events (The Great Gatsby and Moulin Rouge were also both mid-year hits) but pundits were still surprised at just how many people were all shook up by a 159-minute Elvis Presley biopic. The film has made over $260m worldwide to date, a robust number given key caveats, and the second highest-grossing music biopic of all time after Bohemian Rhapsody. Again, smartly, under the new management of Discovery, the film wasn’t made available on HBO Max 45 days after release like previous Warner titles and instead continues to play in cinemas while being available to rent for a premium price. While not on the same scale, the Reese Witherspoon-produced adaptation of hit novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/12/where-the-crawdads-sing-review-daisy-edgar-jones\">Where the Crawdads Sing</a> also proved a popular summer diversion, making $86m worldwide and counting. Negative reviews and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/07/where-the-crawdads-sing-delia-mark-owens-zambia-murder/670479/\">uneasy controversy over the author Delia Owens</a> didn’t stop the overwhelmingly female fanbase coming out (opening weekend was 74% women). Both turned known property into glossy must-see-on-the-big-screen events (something highlighted in the marketing of the two) and while neither could be defined as particularly challenging or cerebral, the success of both was a reassuring sign that audiences will still head to the cinema en masse for non-franchise titles.</p> <h2><strong>Animation Exhaustion</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea1e0b5444d57a3841e1ad46b730a782706d920c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea1e0b5444d57a3841e1ad46b730a782706d920c/362_0_1429_858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This image released by Warner Bros Pictures shows characters, from left, Chip, a squirrel voiced by Diego Luna, PB, potbellied pig voiced by Vanessa Bayer, Krypto, voiced by Dwayne Johnson, Ace, voiced by Kevin Hart and Merton, a turtle voiced by Natasha Lyonne in a scene from “DC League of Super Pets.” (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The continued success of the Despicable Me franchise with Minions: The Rise of Gru edging close to $800m worldwide (a release this week in China will probably push it closer to $1bn), and The Bad Guys cracking $254m show that families were more than enthused to return to the cinema, reflected also by two other notable kids hits in the last year, sequels to Sing and Sonic the Hedgehog ($407m and $402m globally). Yet the last year has also been plagued by family films that failed to engage (there were underwhelming returns for Ron’s Gone Wrong and Spirit: Untamed along with seemingly sure things like The Boss Baby 2 and Peter Rabbit 2) and the summer also saw enough disappointments to cause more concern about the current state of big-screen animation. After an original release was skipped in 2017, cursed caper Paws of Fury finally landed in cinemas with a prime July slot but tanked with $20m worldwide (in the UK it went straight to streaming). Things were slightly better for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/28/dc-league-of-super-pets-review-the-rock-kevin-hart\">DC League of Super-Pets</a> with $110m globally but a $90m budget and a weak $58m in the US meant that it will probably be a big loser for Warners (in comparison, Universal’s two Secret Life of Pets films have made over $1.3bn combined). Even the adult-skewed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/25/bobs-burgers-movie-comedy-review\">Bob’s Burgers Movie</a> couldn’t make back its $38m budget (it fell short at $34m worldwide).</p> <p>But the most-reported under-performer of the season was Pixar’s Toy Story spin-off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/13/lightyear-review-toy-story-spinoff-boldly-going-beyond-with-a-treat-from-pixar\">Lightyear</a> which made, for a Disney franchise film, a modest $118m in the US and $225m globally (in comparison, the average domestic gross for a Toy Story film is around $320m). Disney’s aggressive Covid-expedited push to get more Disney+ subscribers has impacted Pixar films the most with the last three films all going straight to streaming. While, again, rightwingers ebulliently blamed the weak box office on the inclusion of a same-sex couple, the numbers more likely reflect two things. First, the strange sideways step for the franchise (Lightyear was a film that a Toy Story character once saw before the first film took place) was arguably confusing for many, especially kids, and second, with Disney+ subscribers topping 87m worldwide and with a streaming-first strategy for even its biggest movies, others probably chose to stay home and wait it out. Lightyear was made available on Disney+ in just 47 days, making an expensive family day out at the cinema seem that much less desirable (it started well upon digital release with over 1.7m households tuning in within the first three days). The easy streaming availability of kids’ films might further explain why other animated films also stumbled this summer, the pull to rush out to the multiplex needing to be that much more persuasive.</p> <h2><strong>The death of Marvel has been greatly exaggerated</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4a84a6e40afa5afbc02bd030bd23d65e8b8ca99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4a84a6e40afa5afbc02bd030bd23d65e8b8ca99/0_397_6048_3627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"THOR: LOVE AND THUNDERChris Hemsworth as Thor in Marvel Studios’ THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER.

It was tempting to see this as the beginning of the end for the the industry’s most reliable hit-maker but with the former occupying the third place on 2022’s worldwide box office chart with a mammoth $954m and the second at six with $721m and counting, it’s worth holding off on any rash diagnoses just yet. A key reason why both came short of the magic $1bn number is down to China, where both films didn’t nab one of the coveted international release slots. Doctor Strange 2 was <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/04/doctor-strange-multiverse-madness-china-backlash-marvel-1235013738/\">rumoured</a> to have angered authorities with a reference to the Epoch Times, a paper that opposed the Chinese Communist party while there were <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/thor-love-and-thunder-china-lgbtq-censorship-1235177951/\">reports</a> that LGBT content in Thor 4 were said to have caused that particular ban (although the last six MCU films have all been denied a Chinese release also). Because within the US, both films bested the films that preceded them and provided a boost after the underwhelming performance of Eternals last year. Quality control <em>is</em> an increasing issue though and one that will hopefully be redressed with Ryan Coogler’s feverishly anticipated Black Panther sequel releasing later this year. The director, who has already given us the most acclaimed MCU film yet, could well help steer the franchise into a more heroic future.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/17/transfer-round-up-west-ham-pull-out-of-emerson-deal-willian-trains-with-fulham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T16:04:04Z","webTitle":"Transfer news: West Ham drop Emerson interest, Willian trains with Fulham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/17/transfer-round-up-west-ham-pull-out-of-emerson-deal-willian-trains-with-fulham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/17/transfer-round-up-west-ham-pull-out-of-emerson-deal-willian-trains-with-fulham","fields":{"headline":"Transfer news: West Ham drop Emerson interest, Willian trains with Fulham","trailText":"West Ham have pulled out of a deal to sign Chelsea’s Emerson Palmieri due to his wage demands","byline":"Jacob Steinberg","body":"<p>West Ham have walked away from a deal to sign Emerson Palmieri after baulking at the Chelsea left-back’s wage demands.</p> <p>Advanced negotiations with Chelsea had been conducted over a fee for Emerson, who is not in Thomas Tuchel’s plans this season, and West Ham were optimistic about their chances of completing the deal.</p> <p>However, West Ham have cooled their interest in the Italy left-back after speaking to him about personal terms.

They’re quite frankly abhorrent. It shows how disconnected from the real lives of working people she is.</p> <p>“Families are often working two and three jobs, visiting food banks and working under the most restrictive labour laws in Europe. Our political class once again shows they are a million miles away from reality.”</p> <p>Gary Smith, leader of the GMB union, said: “Liz Truss thinking UK workers need ‘more graft’ shows just how out of touch she is. It’s worrying, but not surprising, that the person who is likely to be prime minster has so little respect for the people who are the backbone of our country.</p> <p>“Instead of spouting this ill-informed nonsense and undermining those who actually do the hard work across the country, she should have some pride in the people she may soon lead.”</p> <p>London had the highest productivity level of any UK region in 2020, with output per hour more than 50% higher than the median, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>However, this is widely believed to be the result of large multinationals being based in the capital, higher engagement with research and development, the size of firms, the level of exports and the transport infrastructure.</p> <p>Truss’s remarks about the productivity of workers outside London could be particularly damaging as earlier this month she was forced to make a U-turn on plans to cut civil service pay outside the capital after a furious outcry from Conservative MPs.</p> <p>Henri Murison, chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, tweeted: “Suffice to say if the bookies’ favourite to be the next PM genuinely believed that mindset [and] attitude can explain the north south divide then she was very much mistaken.”</p> <p>Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, said: “It is worrying that a potential future prime minister thinks that productivity issues are simply a question of graft. There are longstanding issues with productivity in this country because of decades of underfunding and inequality between regions.</p> <p>“Coming hot on the heels of her shelved announcement on paying northerners less than those down south, it is difficult to see how Liz Truss could possibly be a prime minister for the whole country. This time she is not only telling the north that we aren’t good enough, but everyone in Britain.”</p> <p>Many Britons also put in extra hours but don’t get rewarded, with TUC analysis showing that employers claimed £27bn of free labour last year because of workers doing unpaid overtime.</p> <p>However, the Cabinet Office minister Kit Malthouse supported Truss’s remarks, telling Nick Ferrari on LBC that workers needed to be encouraged to work harder. He said: “I think there are lots of people in the British economy work[ing] extremely hard. But I have to tell you, every single school report I ever had, Nick, said, ‘could try harder’.

The figure was last higher in February 1982.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Unions are warning that the cost-of-living crisis has become a “living nightmare” for workers as the soaring rate of inflation is set to fuel more strikes. </strong>The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said inflation had reached “new perilous levels” for workers and their families.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The veteran retailer Stuart Rose has urged the government to do more to shield the poorest from double-digit inflation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/tory-peer-hits-out-at-ministers-over-inflation-stuart-rose\">describing the lack of action as “horrifying”</a>, with a prime minister “on shore leave” leaving a situation where “nobody is in charge”.</strong> Responding to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis-recession-looms\">July’s 10.1% headline rate</a>, the Conservative peer and Asda chair said: “We have been very, very slow in recognising this train coming down the tunnel and it’s run quite a lot of people over and we now have to deal with the aftermath of that.”</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Liz Truss has refused to recognise the importance of animal welfare in post-Brexit trade deals, the environment secretary has said.</strong> George Eustice was speaking at the Conservative Environment Network Tory leadership hustings on behalf of Rishi Sunak, and said he faced “challenges” in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/liz-truss-animal-welfare-trade-deals-george-eustice\">trying to get Truss to enshrine animal welfare in trade deals</a>.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>London’s mayor has warned of a rise in shootings and stabbings amid concerns that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/london-mayor-warns-of-rise-in-violence-as-cost-of-living-crisis-deepens\">increasing cost of living could lead to more violence</a> and make it easier for gangs to lure vulnerable young people. </strong>Sadiq Khan said millions of pounds more were being put into schemes to turn people away from violence. The Labour mayor has been criticised by some for his record on crime.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Labour lost more than 91,000 members last year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/17/labour-48m-in-deficit-after-losing-91000-members\">recorded a £4.8m deficit</a>, caused by staff redundancies, a drop in membership subscriptions and ongoing legal battles with former staff members.</strong> But the party also raised significantly more than the Conservatives over the course of last year, bringing in more £45m compared with about £31m by the Tories.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Politicians from across the divide have expressed support for senior Conservative MP William Wragg after he said he would be taking a break to deal with depression and anxiety. </strong>He said both conditions are currently “severe” but he looks forward to “returning refreshed, better able to represent my constituents, loving life and myself a little bit more”.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/17/nicola-sturgeon-abuse-journalists-tory-hustings-perth\">condemned the abuse of journalists</a> by pro-independence supporters outside Tuesday’s Tory leadership hustings in Perth as “disgraceful”, as other Scottish Nationalist politicians called for any members involved to be thrown out of the party immediately.</strong> But Scottish Tories accused the first minister of being “selective” in who she supported, amid reports of demonstrators spitting and screaming at older party members as they walked into Tuesday evening’s event.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That’s it for today.

It’s the number one challenge other than energy costs. It’s getting access to workers and getting people to actually work and I strongly believe that part of the answer to this problem is being much tougher on our welfare system to get people off benefits and into work.</p> \n   <p>I’ll tell you this right now, there are more people claiming unemployment benefit than there are jobs vacancies in the economy. I mean, just think about that for a second and that’s happening under a Conservative government. That’s clearly not right. Something’s gone wrong. Now, I think there are one or two very specific things we can do to change. If you’re on unemployment benefit and you work just nine hours on the national living wage, at that point, you don’t have to check in as much with your job coach at the jobcentre, you don’t have to take the extra hours that may be on offer or an extra job, and you can keep your benefits and nothing happens. I don’t think that’s right. Because ultimately, it’s your taxes and someone who’s working very hard’s taxes that are paid for that.</p> \n   <p>If there are hours to do, if there’s a job going, people should have to be posted just being able to stay on benefits. That’s the change that I want to bring. Because I do think that is the right thing. It’s the conservative thing. Those are our values. We believe in working hard, right?

Because if we’re not if we’re not prepared to do things differently, the NHS will continue to swallow up every pound that every one of you here and everyone else has.

That’s not right and doesn’t value our doctors and nurses, and worse it deprives people of the care that they desperately need urgently need. So my plan is to get tough on people who are missing appointments. If we do that, it’s not about making money from them. It’s about changing behaviour in this country so that it is not acceptable [to miss appointments]. Because if people cancel those appointments in advance, we will free up an enormous amount of extra health care, which means people can get seen quicker they won’t be waiting the backlogs down faster without a single one of you, or anyone else having to pay a penny more in taxes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T13:18:04.070Z\">at 2.18pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62fce35a8f08595b289dfd13\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-17T12:49:28.057Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rishi Sunak vows to make sure Keir Starmer “never walks through the doors of number 10 Downing Street” at the hustings in Belfast.</p> \n  <p>He continues:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In conclusion, I’ll just say this, you saw me as chancellor at the beginning of the pandemic acting boldly radically to successfully safeguard our economy through the biggest storm it had experienced in 300 years.</p> \n   <p>As prime minister, I promise you that I will apply that same sense of urgency and grip to everything else that government does, as we create a better Britain.

A court challenge by a woman was <a href=\"https://www.shine.cn/news/in-focus/2208119059/\">recently struck down</a>.</p> <p>The commission said it would guide local governments and health institutions to make the changes, including the provision of “targeted services to the masses through health education, psychological counselling, traditional Chinese medicine services, drug treatment, surgical treatment, assisted reproductive technology and other means to improve the level of infertility prevention and treatment”.</p> <p>Reproductive health education campaigns would also be carried out to enhance public awareness while “preventing unintended pregnancy and reducing abortions that are not medically necessary”.</p> <p>The measures were described as crucial for promoting the long-term balanced development of the population.</p> <p>The guidelines mark the most comprehensive effort at a national level, including the attempt to reduce abortions, which have been generally readily accessible for many years. At least 9.5m abortions were carried out between 2015 to 2019, according to a report published by the commission at the end of 2021, but some experts believe the number to be far higher.</p> <p>The government had previously publicly stated its intention to discourage “non-medical abortions” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/27/china-to-limit-abortions-for-non-medical-purposes\">in September 2021</a> but has not yet defined what constitutes a “non-medical” abortion, or how it would discourage them, which has alarmed women’s rights groups.</p> <p>China has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, and government efforts to encourage people to have more children <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/10/china-birthrate-slumps-experts-blame-changing-attitudes\">have not yet been successful</a>.

Japan’s fertility rate increased from 1.26 in 2005 to 1.45 in 2015 but fell to 1.30 again in 2021.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/17/public-let-in-to-help-furnish-bristol-martian-house","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T15:41:45Z","webTitle":"‘There’s no final answer’: public let in to help furnish Bristol’s Martian house","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/public-let-in-to-help-furnish-bristol-martian-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/public-let-in-to-help-furnish-bristol-martian-house","fields":{"headline":"‘There’s no final answer’: public let in to help furnish Bristol’s Martian house","trailText":"Five-year-old astronaut and his mum among first visitors to project that combines art and science","byline":"Steven Morris","body":"<p>Five-year-old Rowan Bailey-Davies and his mum, Gillian Davies, had come well prepared.

I spent 50 years working in industry before retiring. I gave it my all, working very hard every day. I seldom had enough money to get by. Struggling with any bills that came in. Now retired with a state pension of £7,000 and a work pension of £7,000 the struggle continues and I am still despised by our government and their ilk. Truss or Sunak will never be the leader of this country in my eyes and will never have my respect.” <strong>George, 71, a retired factory worker, Clydebank, Scotland</strong></p> <h2>‘I would agree that French workers are more productive’</h2> <p>“These comments are absolutely offensive and show a lack of knowledge about the G7 countries. Having lived in France for the last five years and recently returned to the UK, I believe that British workers are highly skilled, and work longer hours than their European counterparts. I live in the north, and workers here have a can-do attitude, though they would welcome more funding for better transport and training. But British society doesn’t really value people with non-academic skills.</p> <p>“I would agree that French workers are more productive, but that’s because they work shorter hours, have more bank holidays and annual leave, have better health care and generally more freedom. It’s not because UK workers need to graft more or have bad attitudes, suggesting that is simplistic and naive. If anything, it’s about the attitude of people like Liz Truss, who perhaps needs to become more skilled and graft harder to gain more insight into how the majority of people in this country live.” <strong>Sharon Agar, 61, academic in sociology Shipley</strong></p> <h2>‘My social care colleagues work double our contracted hours to keep services running’</h2> <p><strong>“</strong>Myself and many of my social care colleagues work double our contracted hours just to keep services running and people supported. Liz Truss typifies the unpleasant state of mind of the Tory party today. Her suggestion that we imagine disparities is totally insulting and in stark denial of an obvious truth. I’ve lived in the south and <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/news-and-media/press-releases/revealed-north-set-to-receive-2-389-less-per-person-than-london-on-transport\">infrastructure</a> and services are far superior to what we have in <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1134495/transport-spending-per-head-in-the-uk/\">Yorkshire</a>. And let’s not forget that Sunak boasted about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/05/video-emerges-of-rishi-sunak-admitting-to-taking-money-from-deprived-areas\">stripping funds from deprived areas</a> and diverting them to wealthy ones.” <strong>Billy King, 58, social care worker, Maltby, South Yorkshire</strong></p> <h2>‘London attracts individuals who are willing to apply “graft”’</h2> <p>“London, with its promise of wealth, professional fulfilment and socio-cultural glamour does attract, from across the UK and beyond, the kind of individuals who are capable and willing to apply ‘graft’ and ‘skill and application’ at a higher level than the average person. It should be noted that this ‘London mindset’ can also be partly attributed to social desperation, including extortionate rents, as well as personal drive.”</p> <p>“Where I feel my agreement with Truss ends is her apparent belief that such mindsets/attitudes should be propagated or even mandated across the entirety of British society. Everyone should be able to pursue happiness, but that’s not the same as pursuing jobs in the City.” <strong>Ciaran Kovach, 26, teacher, London</strong></p> <h2>‘We work incredibly hard for a living’</h2> <p>“I live and work in the north-east, and the vast majority of people I know have a fantastic attitude and mindset. Productivity is seen as higher in London due to circumstances like more international firms … the way [Truss] said it, was like people outside London don’t work as hard or aren’t as dedicated, which is completely untrue.</p> <p>“I find it deeply offensive to say we need more graft, especially at a time of high inflation, low wage increases and a general cost of living crisis. I’m a civil servant, and I can say that despite comments like this or previous comments focusing on the civil service, we work incredibly hard for a living. The Conservatives are also constantly saying how great the economy is – how can that be true if workers are all really lazy?”<strong> Daniel, 27, civil servant, </strong><strong>north</strong><strong>-east</strong></p> <h2>‘These remarks show Truss has no idea what the realities of working here are like’</h2> <p>“This kind of broad brush comment is made by someone with a very superficial grasp on the whole experience of employment in the UK. The disparity that needs addressing is between her myopic view of what constitutes ‘work’, which is shaped by vacuous capitalist rhetoric, and reality.</p> <p>“How does Truss think it’s possible to motivate a workforce if they feel disrespected, undervalued and underpaid? Many people are working multiple jobs and extended hours just to pay their bills. The Tory party has consistently sought to undermine employment rights and deny pay rises that are in line with the cost of living. I think Truss would intend to continue naively with that trend.” <strong>Catherine Dornan, 68, an artist and voluntary worker, Llandrindod Wells, Wales</strong></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/17/manchester-united-elon-musk-cristiano-ronaldo","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T15:28:17Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Manchester United, Elon Musk and the bored squillionaires club","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/17/manchester-united-elon-musk-cristiano-ronaldo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/17/manchester-united-elon-musk-cristiano-ronaldo","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United, Elon Musk and the bored squillionaires club","trailText":"<strong>In today’s Fiver: </strong>Various Social Media Disgraces, Marc Cucurella’s hair and Stop Football latest","byline":"Scott Murray","body":"<h2><strong>MARS 1-0 MANCHESTER</strong></h2> <p>Late last night, Elon Musk, the bored squillionaire with deeper pockets than a Gulf state and an ego to match, rolled up to Old Trafford in his electric jalopy and started performing donuts in the car park. Look at me, everyone, his actions seemed to be saying. Look at me, look at me, look at meeeeeeee. But nobody looked at him. They were all staring at the current Premier League table with glazed [Glazered? – Fiver Ed] looks on their faces. So poor Elon had to go home and get their attention some other way. He did this by announcing on Popular Social Media Disgrace Twitter: “I’m buying Manchester United ur welcome.” There, that snapped them out of it! Everybody looking now. Clever Elon, who did it all by himself from scratch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/17/elon-musk-manchester-united-tweet-charges-debate-over-struggling-clubs-future\">‘I’m buying Manchester United’: Elon Musk ‘joke’ tweet charges debate over struggling club’s future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tweet piqued everyone’s interest, all right. The singular business genius saw his last big deal – to buy PSMDT itself – go spectacularly south, and still harbours a dream of colonising Mars. Quite frankly, though, we’ve reached the point where a consortium headed up by Walter Mitty, Donald Trump and the former board of Debenhams would be considered an improvement on the Glazers, so plenty of exasperated United fans were receptive to the idea. Sadly, a few hours of excited tweeting later, those poor supporters had their hopes dashed when Musk admitted it was merely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1559760618537848832\">one of his zany comic gambits</a>, some sort of long-running internet riff, though he did explain that United were his “fav team as a kid”, for what that’s worth. Final score: Mars one, Manchester eff-all.</p> <p>Musk wasn’t the only bored squillionaire spending his evening cavorting along the information super highway. Cristiano Ronaldo was also glued to his phone, liking an Instagram post linking him to Atlético Madrid, then sticking up one of his own, in which he promised to soon reveal “the truth” about his future. “The media is telling lies,” he said, with reference to a notebook he apparently uses to record news stories about him. “In the last few months of the 100 … only five were right. Imagine how it is. Stick with that tip.” And so once again, Manchester United’s increasingly put-upon fanbase wait on developments with bated breath. Although given how United are desperately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/17/manchester-united-weigh-up-loan-move-for-chelsea-christian-pulisic\">trying to sign Christian Pulisic</a> on loan from Chelsea, everyone already knows deep down how things are going to pan out.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“It’s a shame from a sporting point of view as both players would have had a role in the match.

href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.1c05081\">study</a> conducted by the Yale School of Public Health finds.</p> <p>The alarming report, published on Wednesday in the Environmental Health Perspectives journal, looked at over 400 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia out of a sample of about 2,500 Pennsylvania children ages two to seven. The form of leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and though the survival rate is high, it frequently leads to other health problems later in life, like cognitive disabilities and heart disease.</p> <p>Hydraulic fracking is the process by which oil and gas are extracted from deep beneath the Earth’s surface, and the number of wells proliferated in the 2000s in Pennsylvania and across the country as the industry boomed. More than 10,000 fracking wells were drilled in Pennsylvania between 2002 and 2017, and about one-third are located within 2km (a little over a mile) of a residential groundwater well, the study states.</p> <p>The study found the risk is highest for those living within 2km of a fracking site, and who were exposed in utero. The data accounted for other factors that could influence cancer risk.</p> <p>“[Fracking] can both use and release chemicals that have been linked to cancer, so the potential for children living near [fracking wells] to be exposed to these chemical carcinogens is a major public health concern,” said Nicole Deziel, the study’s senior author and an associate professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health.</p> <p>Though mounting evidence suggests a connection between exposure to fracking pollution and health problems, few studies have examined the connection between exposure and childhood cancer. The Yale study is the largest to examine health impacts on children, and the first to use a novel metric that measures exposure to contaminated drinking water and distance to a well. It fills a significant data gap, the authors say.</p> <p>The fracking process requires the injection of high amounts of chemical-laden water and sand into the ground, which forces oil and gas into a collection well. Hundreds of chemicals linked to cancer and other health issues may be used in the process, including heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, benzene and radioactive material.</p> <p>Local ground and surface water is frequently contaminated through spills or releases of fracturing fluids or wastewaters that percolate into groundwater: Pennsylvania recorded about 1,000 spills and 5,000 state environmental violations between 2005 and 2014, the study states.</p> <p>About half the residents in the predominantly rural study counties use wells to draw from groundwater, and residential wells are not subject to federal regulations or monitoring, leaving it up to the user to ensure they are not drinking contaminated water.</p> <p>Nearby residents also face exposure to chemicals via air pollution from the fracking process, heavy vehicle traffic and construction.</p> <p>The study found children’s risk markedly increases the closer they live to a well. While those within two kilometers face the highest risk, levels were elevated as much as 10km from a well.</p> <p>The data comes amid a debate over how far wells should be set from residences. Two kilometers is about 6,500ft, but Pennsylvania only requires a 500ft setback, while some states’ requirement is as low as 150ft. Colorado, one of the largest fracking producers, several years ago enacted a 2,000ft buffer in most cases. But the study’s authors say that’s not enough.</p> <p>“Our findings of increased risk of leukemia at distances of 2km or more from [fracking] operations, in conjunction with evidence from numerous other studies, suggest that existing setback distances, which may be as little as 150ft, are insufficiently protective of children’s health,” said Cassie Clark, a study co-author and post-doctoral associate at the Yale Cancer Center.</p> <p>“We hope that studies like ours are taken into account in the ongoing policy discussion around [fracking well] setback distances.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/17/inflation-10-percent-class-war-brexit-cost-of-living-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T15:16:08Z","webTitle":"Inflation at 10%?

This is class war – and it was years in the making","trailText":"Austerity, Brexit and the cost of living crisis have been built on nonsensical misinformation, says Guardian columnist Zoe Williams","byline":"Zoe Williams","body":"<p>“If there is a class war – and there is – it is important that it should be handled with subtlety and skill,” wrote Maurice Cowling, the influential rightwing historian, in the late 1970s. “It is not freedom that Conservatives want; what they want is the sort of freedom that will maintain existing inequalities or restore lost ones.” The nature of Conservatism has altered very little since, but the class on whose behalf the Tory party fights has changed dramatically: where once it was doctors and lawyers, businessmen, “respectable people”, it is now hedge fund managers and property developers, the filthy, the super, the Croesus rich. If you’re less wealthy than Jacob Rees-Mogg, the party has fought a 12-year war against you, and – newsflash – it won.</p> <p>Some statistics need animating, and some animate themselves. We do not need a human-interest case study to understand what a 40-year high of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis-recession-looms\">10.1% inflation</a> feels like. We don’t need a pessimistic temperament to be terrified of what October will look like, when it’s slated to reach 13% and the choice between heating and eating kicks in for so many people. We don’t need an infographic to get to grips with the official figures that show a <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/thismorning/articles/workers-face-record-pay-slump-against-surging-inflation\">4.1% drop</a> in regular pay. But news that the Dogs Trust, for the first time in its history, has a waiting list for taking in people’s pets still takes your breath away. I’m emphatically not saying that dogs are more important than people – I’m merely pointing out that this government has brought us to a point where we can’t afford to feed our best friends. This isn’t a belt-tightening moment; this is a wake-up moment.</p> <p>In fact, the class war wasn’t fought with subtlety and skill, it was fought in a more modern fashion, with misinformation. The argument for austerity was built on complementary, nonsensical narratives: most disabled people were faking it; most people on benefits were too lazy to work; most waste in the benefits system was lost to fraud; a class of the workshy had been created by benefits; the “big society” was good, because it was much nicer to get your neighbour’s help than to have properly funded public services; parents know more about education than local authorities; and so on.</p> <p>Opponents of this Cameron-era inanity dignified it by arguing against these propositions as though he actually meant them. What if libraries <em>were</em> mainly used by middle-class children? What if nurses did have to take a pay cut, or we’d soon become Greece? It was just one diversionary talking point after another, as the first offensive wave proceeded completely without mishap, and the destruction of the social safety net was achieved.</p> <p>With Brexit, at least we were arguing about something real: what happened in relation to Europe mattered, for our prosperity, for our intellectual life, for our rights, for the union, for the climate. But again, we were arguing from a completely false start, as if the two competing sides were legitimately different visions for Britain, one which wanted to take back control, one which didn’t. In fact, the escapade was there to deliver only one outcome: the destruction of regulation by which workers and citizens protect and assert themselves against the interests of capital. It was just the second wave of the war. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/16/britain-has-been-avoiding-its-biggest-problems-for-decades-now-were-paying-the-price\">Britain has been avoiding its biggest problems for decades. Now we’re paying the price | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, prime ministerial hopefuls, approach the coming crisis with another patchwork of absolute nonsense. The cost of living crisis is all down to the war in Ukraine. We head into recession because we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/16/leaked-audio-reveals-liz-truss-said-british-workers-needed-more-graft\">don’t work hard enough</a>. It’s all the fault of the unions, or the woke, who are coming for our growth and “our women” (respectively). Britain can go from strength to strength if the person in charge is enthusiastic enough (according to Truss). This time it’s different – these lines are so incredibly weak and thin, it’s like reaching the end of the road in a Russian misinformation campaign, where they can no longer afford any tech whizzes and they’re leaving meme creation to bots and Google translate.</p> <p>But it’s different for a more important reason: they’re not trying to divert us from some smart new move – they have no moves. If you look at the level of public debt, the high inflation, the low growth and the tax burden, we’re already in a postwar economy. It was just a different kind of war, a class war masquerading as a <em>kulturkampf</em>, and we lost. Sorry to labour the point, but until we acknowledge the extent of the devastation and its cause we cannot hope to recover our bearings.</p> <p>You cannot rebuild anything on fictional foundations. There is no meaningful way out of this if we pretend it’s all about global headwinds and we’re a nice nation that can pull together. You cannot organise if you don’t know what side you’re on, and so many of the narratives of the past 12 years have been tailored to mask exactly that. Are you a striver or a shirker? A net contributor or a net recipient? A patriot or a migrant? Metropolitan elite or left behind? Latte sipper or bitter drinker? Woke or anti-woke? Leaver or remainer?

I don’t mean big public pools, the benefits of which are clear. I mean the small private ones in gardens, which you see in particular abundance as you descend over various home counties coming in to land at Gatwick, or at hotels, or some rental properties. Particularly cooed over are the ones known as infinity pools, where one side isn’t a proper side, so to speak. No, thrillingly, the water flows right over the edge. So what? I mean, really, so what?</p> <p>If you do an internet search for the number of houses with pools in the UK, the first number that comes up is a staggering 210,000. The best part of a quarter of a million? Surely not.</p> <p>Further investigation suggests the average size of a domestic pool is <a href=\"https://www.azurepools.co.uk/pool-size-guide/\">roughly 9 metres by 4.5 metres</a>. Plunging deeper into these shallow waters, I learn that a pool of this size tends to contains about <a href=\"https://www.poolpro.com.au/pool-and-spa-tips/19-how-do-i-calculate-how-much-water-is-in-my-pool\">50,000 litres of water</a>. This, multiplied by 210,000, gives a total number of litres that’s too big for my calculator, which reads 1.05e10. No, me neither. I find a bigger calculator, which expresses that as 10,500,000,000. That’s 10.5bn litres of water in pools that have one thing in common: they are decidedly unsuitable for swimming in.</p> <p>If you are any kind of swimmer, a 9-metre length might take you all of three strokes. With meaningful swimming impossible, what are you left with? I simply don’t know what to do in these oversize bathtubs. Unlike in our baths at home, you can’t lie there and read.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Particularly cooed over are infinity pools, where one side isn’t a proper side. So what? I mean, really, so what?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I got in a hotel pool in Croatia last week, then stood there wondering how to busy myself. I dunked my head in and it felt quite nice, I suppose. I floated on my back a while and then wallowed for a minute or two. Hmm, what now? I swam three pointless strokes to the other end and then ran out of ideas. As this was – be still, my beating heart – an infinity pool, I went over to the “infinity” side and tried in vain to understand what so many people find beguiling about them. Then I got out and got on with trying to address my grumpiness.</p> <p>Is it my age? Is it like snowfall, delight at which is inversely proportional to your years? As a kid, we had family friends who had a pool. The excitement I felt before visiting them was beyond compare. I suspect that was because we went only once or twice a year; if I had had a pool in my back garden, I would have been bored within days.</p> <p>I can think of only one person I’ve met who owned a domestic pool and couldn’t do without it. She had what’s known as an endless pool – similar in name to the wretchedly pointless infinity pool, but very different. In endless pools, you swim against a current, so proper swimming is possible. Her name is Julie Bradshaw. She holds the record for swimming the Channel butterfly and was the first person to swim butterfly around Manhattan Island. When I interviewed her, nearly 20 years ago, she was a part-time PE teacher at Leicester prison. She would rise at 4am every morning, get in the tiny pool out the back of her modest house in Loughborough and swim butterfly for four hours. Then she would go to work. Respect.</p> <p>I called her yesterday and was delighted to find that she is now an MBE, for her services to swimming and charity. She is working as a psychotherapist and life and mindset coach – and still swimming ferociously. Her endless pool is on the blink, but no matter: she has a swimming tether, with which she attaches herself to a handrail, using that to swim on the spot. Who knew? I, for one, will never again go on holiday without one.</p> <p>• Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/aug/17/myr-muratet-a-refugee-in-a-parisian-underpass-best-shot","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T15:01:11Z","webTitle":"A refugee in a Parisian underpass: Myr Muratet’s best photograph","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/17/myr-muratet-a-refugee-in-a-parisian-underpass-best-shot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/17/myr-muratet-a-refugee-in-a-parisian-underpass-best-shot","fields":{"headline":"A refugee in a Parisian underpass: Myr Muratet’s best photograph","trailText":"‘He had arrived from Eritrea via Libya and Italy, and hoped to get to England. I thought he looked incredibly classy in his turquoise coat and pink scarf’","byline":"Interview by Diane Smyth","body":"<p>I took this eight years ago in an underpass beneath the metro line that runs through the north of Paris. The place used to be a haven for hundreds of refugees, mostly from Africa. It’s near La Chapelle station, between Gare du Nord and the intersection of very popular Indian, Arab and African neighbourhoods; it’s wind-beaten and extremely noisy because of the constant movement of the trains.</p> <p>I’ve been a photographer for 40 years, and started taking photographs in La Chapelle 20 years ago because it’s my neighbourhood and it seemed necessary, politically, to develop my work locally. I hung out in this square and came to know many people from Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea, but I had never seen this young man before. We didn’t talk much and I know almost nothing about him. He spoke a little English and a little Arabic, he was from Eritrea and had just arrived in Paris. Like many refugees, he had travelled here across Libya, the Mediterranean and then Italy. He was planning to leave for Calais the next day to try to get to England.</p> <p>I think he had found his clothes at a local charity. I thought he looked incredibly classy in his turquoise coat and pink scarf, tied in the Tuareg way. He was tying his scarf when I met him – it was a winter evening and this spot under the bridge is especially windy and cold. Everyone had covered themselves as best they could with whatever they had.</p> <p>It matters that the people I shoot are aware they are being photographed, and I was happy he agreed I could take his picture. I took two, one horizontal, one vertical, but I wasn’t able to show him the result because I never saw him again. The underpass was later evacuated by the police and has since been secured by fences and is guarded by dogs. Many of the refugees have settled around the Porte de la Chapelle, on the northern periphery of Paris.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With the approach of the Olympic Games, the mayor of Paris has undertaken to clear the city of its destitute</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This image is part of a larger project about young refugees in Paris, and follows on from another about a group of homeless people who lived in the Gare du Nord but have since died or disappeared. Another ongoing series, Wasteland, follows a Roma community in otherwise abandoned areas in the north of the city. I photograph the people but I also try to show their homes, and the way they survive economically. I don’t look for distress in the people I shoot, I study their ability to survive.</p> <p>I’m driven by curiosity; by how, in a city like Paris which is watched and policed, life settles illegally in all its interstices. By how people organise themselves, pool their efforts and means, and resist. I also try to document the devices that the French government and the city of Paris have put in place to constrain or chase them away. These devices can be physical, such as benches you can’t lie down on or the boulders and fences placed at the entrances of vacant lots, but they also include dog handlers and the police. With the approach of the Olympic Games [to be hosted by Paris in 2024], the state and the mayor of Paris have undertaken to clear the city of its destitute. There are no more large refugee camps or slums in the city or its surroundings. The poor and the homeless have been pushed out of the visual field of the future tourists.</p> <p>My photographs show nothing Parisians don’t already know. Over the years there were kilometres of tents on the pavements and canal banks housing hundreds of refugees at all times of year. We couldn’t miss them, though they were regularly chased away and pushed further and further outside the city limits.</p> <p>I grew up in the east of Paris in the <em>ceinture rouge</em> [the “red belt”, the traditionally socialist working-class areas around the capital]. I was brought up by a militant mother who spent her evenings in meetings and never missed a demonstration. It put me off activism but gave me a strong political awareness. Of course I am conscious of the differences between me and the people I photograph. I am white and I have a roof over my head. My country is still colonialist – consciously and factually racist. With this background it is hard to establish a relationship of equality with African refugees at first sight. I don’t think my images necessarily help the people I photograph but they help me and others to see them better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c18cae8fa9db3e448229a965c23752671f7a2018\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c18cae8fa9db3e448229a965c23752671f7a2018/0_25_1535_1918/800.jpg\" alt=\"Myr Muratet.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Myr Muratet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephan Zaubitzer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Myr Muratet CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Paris, 1959<br><strong>Trained:</strong> “A photographic studio in Hamburg, Germany.”<br><strong>Influences:</strong> “Karl Marx and the poet and friend Manuel Joseph.”<br><strong>High point:</strong> “When the Roma I had been photographing for years started referring to me as the ‘manuch’ (the guy) instead of the ‘gadjo’ (the foreigner).”<br><strong>Low point:</strong> “Getting caught up in details.”<br><strong>Top tip:</strong> “Don’t bite the hand that feeds you … eat it.”</p> <p>• Paris Nord by <a href=\"https://www.myrmuratet.com/\">Myr Muratet</a> is published by <a href=\"http://www.buildingbooks.fr/\">Building Books </a></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/17/lots-and-not-lots-review-visually-striking-physical-music-theatre-greg-sinclair-summerhall-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T14:46:47Z","webTitle":"Lots and Not Lots review – explorers of the intimate unknown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/17/lots-and-not-lots-review-visually-striking-physical-music-theatre-greg-sinclair-summerhall-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/17/lots-and-not-lots-review-visually-striking-physical-music-theatre-greg-sinclair-summerhall-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"Lots and Not Lots review – explorers of the intimate unknown","trailText":"Composer Greg Sinclair’s ingenious musical palette provides variety and charm in this performance by a young local cast","byline":"David Jays","body":"<p>The most striking visual image in this show is created by small torches, their beams edging through darkness.

It will initially be used in the US and Canada, and will continue to operate in Australia.</p> <p>“The primary objective is attempting to reduce the ability of bad actors to throw unauthorised parties which negatively impact our hosts, neighbours, and the communities we serve,” Airbnb said in a statement. “It’s integral to our commitment to our host community – who respect their neighbours and want no part of the property damage and other issues that may come with unauthorised or disruptive parties.”</p> <p>Until the Covid pandemic, Airbnb allowed hosts voluntarily to let their properties out for the purpose of throwing house parties, although the company has always banned guests from throwing parties against the wishes of the property owner. “Historically, we allowed hosts to use their best judgment and authorise parties when appropriate for their home and neighbourhood,” the company said earlier this year.</p> <p>In 2019, a new rule banned “open-invite” parties – those advertised on social media – and allowed hosts to be ejected from the platform for letting “chronic party houses” that became nuisances in their wider neighbourhoods. In 2020, however, the company saw a rise in house party bookings as bars and clubs closed and implemented other restrictions, and in August that year it instituted a “temporary” ban on all parties and events, which became permanent in June 2022.</p> <p>Since October 2021, Airbnb has been trialling its “anti-party technology” in Australia. “We have seen a 35% drop in incidents of unauthorised parties in the areas of Australia where this pilot has been in effect,” the company says.

A news report showed that one particularly alarming one from the early 1600s reads: if you can see me, weep</p> <p>“Right now Europe’s drought is so bad you can walk across some rivers, which isn’t just bad for the environment or the economy, it also puts people like Moses out of a job,” he said.</p> <p>Noah also said the hunger stone “freaked” him out. “That’s dramatic,” he continued. “I didn’t even know they had emo in the 1600s.”</p> <p>He added: “At the same time though, you’ve got to wonder about the type of person who decided to make these stones” as “the whole population was starving” someone said: “Gimme a hammer and a chisel, I’m gonna write a warning for people 500 years from now.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/17/oldham-mill-fire-human-remains-confirmed-as-four-separate-victims","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T14:16:21Z","webTitle":"Human remains confirmed as four separate victims in Oldham mill fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/oldham-mill-fire-human-remains-confirmed-as-four-separate-victims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/17/oldham-mill-fire-human-remains-confirmed-as-four-separate-victims","fields":{"headline":"Oldham mill fire: human remains confirmed as four separate victims","trailText":"Police confirmed four Vietnamese nationals were missing after remains discovered, one of whom has been formally identified","byline":"Amelia Hill","body":"<p>Human remains discovered by workers demolishing a mill in Oldham have been confirmed as four separate victims, including one identified as a Vietnamese national, police have said.</p> <p>It was not believed anyone was inside at the time of the fire at Bismark House Mill on Bower Street in May.
