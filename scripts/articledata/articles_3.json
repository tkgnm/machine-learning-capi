Those songs form the soundtrack of US choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kyle-abraham\">Kyle Abraham</a>’s An Untitled Love, a piece that’s like eavesdropping on a house party, full of convivial warmth, glowing light, oozing music and the tactility of friends and nascent relationships. On stage, a sofa, rug and plant – a domestic setup where people gather and part, confess, conspire, laugh and flirt. A slice of African American life that’s both specific and universal.</p> <p>There’s a clear romcom influence (Abraham has cited the films of actor Sanaa Lathan) and we hear their chat as well as see them dance: a gossip about a couple from church, a debate about what outfit to wear, a caddish charmer trying to woo a girl out of his league. The dancing is delicious: honeyed limbs and snaking muscularity and hips finding the funk. A dancer might sashay into a pirouette; retiré before a soft shoe shuffle, in Abraham’s inimitable way of merging styles, classical, modern, social, street, into what feels like a naturalistic language on his dancers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc766e3c7a6369611b9f7405a801a2978ebfac81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc766e3c7a6369611b9f7405a801a2978ebfac81/0_320_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Untitled Love.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pleasure in movement … An Untitled Love.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those dancers have individual charm: Catherine Kirk’s elegant authority; Dymon Samara joyfully squeezing the juice out of every rhythm.

It is the time when bookings open for the following four weeks at Evelyn’s Table. Punters time their midday calls with all the desperation of theatregoers trying to secure a ticket for <em>Jerusalem</em>, or hypochondriacs hoping to bag a GP appointment. The restaurant accommodates just 12 people at two sittings, Tuesday to Saturday evening. All slots – eight couples, two groups of four per night – are invariably gone by 12.05.</p> <p>The experience rewards that fastest-finger competitiveness. <a href=\"https://www.theblueposts.co.uk/evelyns-table/\" title=\"\">Evelyn’s Table</a> is in the former beer cellar of a storied Soho boozer, the Blue Posts, in a side street near Chinatown. At your appointed time – our sitting was at 6pm – you pass through a velvet curtain at the back of the old snug and descend a steep staircase into a narrow room with a steel-topped bar. Seated on high stools you are then within touching distance of a performance that seems part theatre, part magic show. Three intense young brothers, black-haired, bearded, all chefs, are already at dexterous work in a spotless and spotlit galley kitchen; on the night we took our seats the trio were noiselessly conjuring a dish of freshly opened, hand-dived scallops, tweezering on garnish, pipetting drops of tomato essence. Watching them perform, you are reminded a little of those families of circus acrobats, each outdoing the next in their tumbles. Here come the high-flying Selbys, Luke and Nathaniel and Theo! Roll up! Roll up! And be amazed!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e7a300a3aa8573aa2b1df22fc859eea8503fdd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e7a300a3aa8573aa2b1df22fc859eea8503fdd5/0_0_2048_1362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The counter at Evelyn’s Table.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The counter at Evelyn’s Table.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keith Collie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their tasting menu consists of five courses – with a couple of extra surprises thrown in. One seasonal high-wire act follows the next. The freshest Cornish mackerel comes with horseradish ice-cream and a tangy gooseberry puree; a rack of lamb is roasted before your eyes on a mini-barbecue of fragrant hay. There are no waiting staff: dishes are passed over the counter and placed before you, and described precisely by the sibling responsible. More expansive biodynamic storytelling is offered by maître d’ Aidan Monk, who spins seductive fables about wine pairings drawn from obsessive small vineyards in Georgia and Mendocino and Stellenbosch. The two-hour meal is about as expensive as box seats at the National Theatre or Wembley, but still, it defies you not to believe it is one-off worth it.</p> <p>The day after I’ve watched the Selbys in action, I meet them at three in the afternoon on the upper floor of the Blue Posts at the wine bar, the Mulwray (it is named, like the basement restaurant, after Evelyn Mulwray, Faye Dunaway’s mysterious socialite in Roman Polanski’s <em>Chinatown</em>, famed for finding secret corners of her city where she can be fully herself). Having finished the previous night at midnight, the brothers have been prepping for four hours already and, though patient with my questions, are clearly slightly anxious to get back to it (if they don’t do it, as Theo, the youngest points out, no one else will).</p> <p>They operate without juniors (one of the fascinations of the previous evening had been watching the choreography of them scrubbing the steel of the hob and surfaces back to stainless between courses and at the end of the service). They talk, like all close brothers, in a private mix of self-deprecation and banter, finishing each other’s sentences, quick to seize on any affectation. Luke, 31, the star of the previous night’s show, is very much the leader (“I’m sort of the Pied Piper,” he says, with a grin; Nat, 29, and Theo, 27, seem more than happy to follow his tunes).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We had seven apple trees in the garden and every apple would be picked and cored and juiced. Nothing was ever wasted</p> <footer> <cite>Luke Selby</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In many ways, it becomes clear, as they describe to me their respective journeys to here, that they were fated to the almost monastic discipline and joyful creativity of Evelyn’s Table. All three boys were born in Saudi Arabia, where their parents had met while working in a hospital in Jeddah. Their dad, who worked in HR, was from the UK. Their mum, a biomedical scientist, was from the Philippines.</p> <p>After a few years, the family moved to the UK and settled in a village near Brighton. The four boys – they also have a younger brother, Reuben, who is a fashion designer and photographer – were very tight, always looking out for each other, a built-in gang. Their early adventures were all about foraging. “Our mum comes from a family of nine in the Philippines,” Luke says. “Her mother had a rice farm, still has a rice farm – quite a few hectares – and a sugar plantation. So Mum has always had green fingers. She has three different allotments, many greenhouses. She is constantly sending us things to use in the restaurant, gooseberries, whatever. She was always excited about what was in season.”</p> <p>That excitement had a big effect on them as kids. They’d go down to the beach at Shoreham or West Wittering and collect seaweed to cook, or bulging bags of mussels, or catch crabs. They’d walk the lanes blackberrying. “We had seven apple trees in the garden,” Luke says, “and every apple would be picked and cored and juiced. Nothing was ever wasted. There was always a crumble on the table.”</p> <p>Theo laughs. “Mum was quite strict with us. We became a kind of production line. We were never allowed to go out until everything was prepped and processed and frozen and stored.”</p> <p>The boys rebelled all the time, of course, but they learned a lot too. “Respect for produce, respect for nature,” Nat says. “We didn’t go out to eat much, maybe the Harvester on a Sunday.”</p> <p>Their mother hasn’t lost her passion for discovery. “I moved back home over lockdown,” Luke says, “and showed her where she could pick caperberries. She just sent us about 10 kilos of them …”</p> <p>The other formative ingredient in that childhood was their dad’s love of mealtimes. “He gets such joy from food,” Luke says, “so when I started cooking for the family – as a kid I was forever reading cookery books, watching food shows, taking notes – it gave us this real connection.”</p> <p>Luke was always the driven one. If he hadn’t become a chef, he says, he may have had a career as a violinist. It was, ironically, his violin teacher, Andrew Bernardi, strings tutor at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire in south London, who prompted his first big kitchen opportunity. “We were always talking about food at lessons,” he says, “and he suggested I go in for this Rotary young chef competition, that Raymond Blanc was judging.” Luke was 14. He still remembers his menu for the final – open smoked haddock ravioli, roasted duck with blackberries and a raspberry souffle. “I came second,” he says. “But I wrote to Raymond afterwards and got some work experience in his kitchen at Le Manoir aux Quat’ Saisons. They held a job open until I finished my A-levels.”</p> <p>Luke worked at the Manoir for six years. First Theo and then Nat gravitated to him, sleeping on his floor. Nat took the more circuitous route. He did a degree in illustration and only started cooking after graduation. Theo went to catering college and worked in restaurants in Sussex. Luke got them both trials at the Manoir, and for the first time they all worked together in the kitchen there; Luke as Blanc’s sous chef, Nat and Theo as commis.</p> <p>They went separate ways for a while. While he was head chef at Ollie Dabbous’ eponymous restaurant in 2017, Luke won the title of national young chef of the year and a Roux scholarship that earned him time at the three-Michelin-starred Nihonryori Ryugin in Tokyo, adding a mastery of Japanese cooking to his French training. The band of brothers then reunited at Dabbous’ new London project Hide, the vast and buzzy oligarch-chic restaurant opposite the Ritz, before setting up here just over two years ago.</p> <p>The contrast with Hide, with its limousine elevator, could hardly be greater. “I always loved working with Ollie,” Luke says, “but I’d got to the point where I wanted to do my own thing.” He drew up plans for the intimate kind of space he had in mind. Coincidentally, Zoë and Layo Paskin, owners of London restaurant hotspots <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/18/ofm-awards-2015-best-restaurant-the-palomar-london\" title=\"\">the Palomar</a> and the Barbary, got in touch about their ideas for Evelyn’s Table and the Blue Posts. After a couple of meetings and a look at the space downstairs, he signed a partnership agreement with them. His brothers, naturally, were a key part of the deal. Their restaurant was due to open in March 2020, but was scuppered by lockdown. Though it has been frustratingly stop-start ever since, there have been high moments: notably the award of a Michelin star at the beginning of this year (and Michelin’s young chef of the year for the three of them). The brothers gave themselves a big day out to celebrate: a six-hour lunch at Alain Roux’s Waterside Inn at Bray, followed by a couple of bottles of champagne with Raymond Blanc, who has become a kind of second father to them.</p> <p>That kind of downtime is quite rare though. They have recently employed one sous chef to fill in so one of them can take the occasional night off, but otherwise they are all in. “I think we always knew we could work well together,” Theo says. “We can preempt what is going to happen, each other’s needs.” The rough demarcation, he says, is that “Luke makes the sauces and handles the protein. Nathaniel does the pastry and I deal with garnish and fill in the gaps. But we are all able to do every sort of part of the kitchen, so if one of us has a night off, we can still maintain the standard.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"379b5bb990c0da1b77fac6cd335ea51b75447e0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/379b5bb990c0da1b77fac6cd335ea51b75447e0c/148_2335_5797_5796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nat, Luke and Theo Selby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Not surprisingly on free days they try to escape each other and have their own circles of friends, though Luke and Theo spend a lot of time fishing together. “We’ve just started spear fishing and freediving,” Theo says. “We are often in Cornwall, across in Anglesey recently.” They bring home spider crabs and lobsters and sea bass and pollack – though, Luke admits, their spearfishing skills still leave something to be desired.</p> <p>They are inevitably a little competitive about such off-duty challenges, but one thing they are adamant about is that the open kitchen arrangement leaves no room for sibling tension. They have worked in shouty restaurants but are happy to have replaced that with a kind of hush and a funky background playlist (they all chip in with favourite tracks). Otherwise, Luke insists, there is no place for simmering rivalry. “If something was off, the diners are so close they would feel it straight away,” he says. “And anyway we all enjoy the process. We all know every element that gets put on the plate.” And with that, two hours before curtain up, they get back to it. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theblueposts.co.uk/evelyns-table/\" title=\"\">Evelyn’s Table</a>, The Blue Posts Cellar, 28 Rupert St, London W1D 6DJ</em></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/21/william-macaskill-what-we-owe-the-future-philosopher-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T12:00:08Z","webTitle":"William MacAskill: ‘There are 80 trillion people yet to come.

We might invoke grandchildren, at a push great-grandchildren, but after that, it all becomes a bit vague and, well, unimaginable.</p> <p>And while we look with awe and fascination at the Egyptian pyramids, built 5,000 years ago, we seem incapable of thinking, or even contemplating, 5,000 years in the future. That lies in the realm of science fiction, which is tantamount to fantasy. But the chances are, barring a global catastrophe, humanity will still be very much around in 5,000 years, and going by the average existence of mammal species, should still be thriving in 500,000 years. If we play our cards right, we could even be here in 5m or 500m years, which means that there may be thousands or even millions times more human beings to come than have already existed.</p> <p>All those numbers seem incalculably abstract but, according to the moral philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/william-macaskill\">William MacAskill</a>, they should command our attention. He is a proponent of what’s known as longtermism – the view that the deep future is something we have to address now. How long we last as a species and what kind of state of wellbeing we achieve, says MacAskill, may have a lot to do with what decisions we make and actions we take at the moment and in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>That, in a nutshell, is the thesis of his new book, <em>What We Owe the Future: A Million-Year View</em>. The Dutch historian and writer Rutger Bregman calls the book’s publication “a monumental event”, while the US neuroscientist Sam Harris says that “no living philosopher has had a greater impact” upon his ethics.</p> <p>We tend to think of moral philosophers as whiskery sages, but MacAskill is a youthful 35 and a disarmingly informal character in person, or rather on a Zoom call from San Francisco, where he is promoting the book.</p> <p>Associate professor at Lincoln College, Oxford, he is president of the <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>, a body he co-founded to bring data-based analysis to the business of charity, thus making donations as effective as possible. He also co-founded with fellow moral philosopher Toby Ord <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>, an organisation whose members pledge to give at least 10% of their earnings to effective charities (MacAskill himself gives the majority of his earnings), and is also president of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a>, a non-profit group that advises on what careers have the most positive social impact.</p> <p>“It was in the course of reasoning on the basis of Effective Altruism,” he says, “that led me to think about issues that impact not just on the present generation but also the longterm future too.”</p> <p>MacAskill grew up in a comfortable middle-class Glasgow family and attended private school. He’d always had an altruistic side. As a 15-year-old, prompted by the knowledge of how many people were dying in the Aids crisis, he decided he wanted to become wealthy and give half his money away. He did voluntary work for a disabled scout group, but it wasn’t until he got to Cambridge, where he studied philosophy and played saxophone in a funk band, that his moral outlook took on a more intellectual form. Reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/15/peter-singer-profile\">Peter Singer’s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/15/peter-singer-profile\">Famine, Affluence, and Morality</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/15/peter-singer-profile\"> </a>propelled him into a lifetime of not just philosophical but practical commitment.</p> <p>So it’s clear that MacAskill is not one of those armchair thinkers who talks the talk but doesn’t follow up on his ideas. Although he wouldn’t describe himself as a utilitarian, he is concerned with the maximum good, and firmly believes in minimising human suffering and maximising human wellbeing. He also believes in minimising the suffering of animals, something humanity almost certainly increased. But for humans to flourish they first have to be alive, and his argument is that the more humans there are who live, and the happier lives they lead, the better.</p> <p>No one can say with great accuracy how many humans have lived, but one recent estimate by the US <a href=\"https://www.prb.org/\">Population Reference Bureau</a> says that about 120 billion Homo sapiens have so far been born. MacAskill says that if we assume that our population continues at its current size and we last as long as typical mammals, that would mean “there would be 80 trillion people yet to come; future people would outnumber us 10,000 to one”.</p> <p>The moral argument is that, by sheer weight of numbers, our descendants’ needs should loom large in our deliberations. With alarming signs that the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis\"> climate crisis </a>is already upon us, MacAskill states the obvious and urgent need for decarbonisation. This problem, however, is not the main focus of his book. Rather he employs the climate crisis as a proof of longtermism: “We all contribute to a problem that literally has effects for hundreds of thousands of years,” he says.</p> <p>Second, he explains: “Climate change is much less neglected than other concerns like pandemic prevention, nuclear war and AI safety: it is already widely agreed to be among the world’s most important problems and there are large social movements dedicated to solving climate change.”</p> <p>The debate around the issue also provides a model of how to deal with uncertainty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He argues that humanity could soon enter a phase in which values, good or bad, will become ‘locked-in’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Climate change sceptics often point to our uncertainty as a reason for inaction… ,” he writes. “But this is a terrible argument… Crucially, the uncertainty around climate change is not symmetric: greater uncertainty should prompt more concern about worst-case outcomes and this shift is not offset by a higher chance of best-case outcomes, because the worst-case outcomes are worse than the best-case outcomes are good.”</p> <p>To deal with the uncertainty that is inherent in longterm thinking, MacAskill believes we can make greater use of a method of probability assessment called “expected value theory”. It’s a means of prioritising or assigning values to outcomes in situations with multiple possibilities. Professional gamblers use it but MacAskill says its application could help guide us through the complex contingencies ahead.</p> <p>He gives the example of how the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that in a medium-low-emissions scenario there will be 2.5C (36.5F) of warming by the end of the century. “But this is uncertain,” he writes. “There is a one in 10 chance that we get 2 degrees or less. But that should not reassure us, because there is also a one in 10 chance that we get more than 3.5 degrees. Less than 2 degrees would be something of a relief compared with the best-guess estimate, but more than 3.5 degrees would be much worse. The uncertainty gives us <em>more </em>reason to worry, not less.”</p> <p>The good news is that with the threat of an engineered pandemic, which he says is rapidly increasing, he believes there are specific steps that can be taken to avoid a breakout.</p> <p>“One partial solution I’m excited about is called far ultraviolet C radiation,” he says. “We know that ultraviolet light sterilises the surfaces it hits, but most ultraviolet light harms humans as well. However, there’s a narrow-spectrum far UVC specific type that seems to be safe for humans while still having sterilising properties.”</p> <p>The cost for a far UVC lightbulb at the moment is about $1,000 (£820) per bulb. But he suggests that with research and development and philanthropic funding, it could come down to $10 or even $1 and could then be made part of building codes. He runs through the scenario with a breezy kind of optimism, but one founded on science-based pragmatism.</p> <p>Less tractable is the threat that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) may lead to a dystopian outcome. He argues that humanity is currently in a phase of history in which our values are plastic – they can still be shaped and changed – but that we could soon enter a phase in which values, good or bad, will become “locked-in”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6881fec3468cf5128f2bc12fd737bb1c7ad347bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6881fec3468cf5128f2bc12fd737bb1c7ad347bc/0_0_3393_2507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lehel Kovács\" width=\"1000\" height=\"739\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Lehel Kovács.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Lehel Kovács/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Imagine,” he says, “if the Nazis had won the second world war, held on to power for a few hundred years, established a world government and then got to the point of developing AGI [artificial general intelligence], then you could have a future that would be guided and controlled by Nazi ideology for ever.”</p> <p>The critical point in this analogy is not so much the Nazis, who represent humanity’s potential for doing ill, but AGI. Put simply, AGI is the technological state in which an intelligent machine can learn and enact any intellectual task that a human being can do. From that point, the potential to control ideas and social development is almost limitless, which brings into focus the possibility of an unending dystopia.</p> <p>For MacAskill, the time to address that possibility is now, because later may well prove too late. No one can be certain that AGI is achievable and, if it is, when it will be achieved, but most scientists working in the field think that it will happen. A significant minority believe that it’s probable within the next 50 years and some think it may take only 20. MacAskill himself estimates a 10% chance of AGI in the next 50 years. Short of stopping research across the planet – and how could that be enforced? – what can be done?</p> <p>“This is tough,” he acknowledges. “It’s not nearly as clearcut as preventing pandemics. But I think there are some things we can do. For example, the idea of slowing down some areas of AI research. AI will be hugely beneficial, but you can get a lot of the gains without going all the way. Do we need to have AI systems that are engaged in longterm planning? Do we need to have AI systems that are enormously multimodal and able to do very many different things rather than just narrow tasks?”</p> <p>While these choices are not yet directly upon us, he says that there are steps to be taken immediately. One area that demands more support is the field of interpretability research in AI. “At the moment,” he explains, “we’ve got these black boxes with input data, this enormously complex model, and then these outputs and we don’t really know what’s going on under the hood. There are enormous challenges but I can see a tractable path towards making progress on this.”</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>At the outset of his book, MacAskill presents a metaphor of a risky expedition into uncharted terrain. Just like early explorers, we don’t know exactly what threats await us, but “we can scout out the landscape ahead of us, ensure the expedition is well resourced and well coordinated, and, despite uncertainty, guard against those threats we are aware of”.</p> <p>In making his case for the journey ahead, MacAskill dismisses some of the ideas that are held dear by many who are concerned about the future, particularly those looking at things from an environmental perspective. It’s not uncommon in green circles to hear arguments against economic growth, against consumption and, indeed, even against bringing further children into the world.</p> <p>MacAskill disagrees with all these positions. In the longterm the kind of growth we’ve seen in the past century or so – above 2% – is unsustainable. If it continued at a rate of 2% for the next 10,000 years, he writes, “we would produce 100tn trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion times as much output as we do now”.</p> <p>That means there would have to be 10m tn times as much output as our current world produces for every atom that we could in principle access. “Though of course we can’t be certain,” he writes with wry understatement, “this just doesn’t seem possible.”</p> <p>However, he doesn’t believe now is the time to slow growth because, he argues, we are not yet at a technological stage where that’s possible without potentially calamitous effects. To illustrate the point, he uses the example of where we were 100 years ago. If we stopped growth then, we would have been left with two possibilities: either to return to the grinding privations of agricultural life or to burn through fossil fuels, leading to a climate catastrophe.</p> <p>He believes both technological development and economic growth are needed to avoid threats of climate crisis, bioterrorism and much else besides. The other point he makes is that stopping growth would in any case be pointless unless all 193 countries signed up to it.</p> <p>“Suppose that you managed to persuade 192 to stop growth, but one country continues to grow. Compound growth means that before too long that one country is the entire world economy and in the long run you’ve really not done anything.”</p> <p>Similarly, rather than cut back on consumption, he argues, it’s much more effective to donate to causes that are dealing with the problems created by consumption.</p> <p>“We need to get more fine-grained,” he says. “OK, some technologies have net bad effects, some have net good effects. And we can really push on the ones that are more beneficial.”</p> <p>At the core of the book is the question of human values. These are obviously not set in stone, because we need only look at history to see how they have radically changed over time. A key example that MacAskill returns to is slavery and its abolition. At various periods and across most cultures slavery has existed and been deemed natural, or at least acceptable.</p> <p>Arguments were made against it, but none so compelling that it ceased to be. What changed things was the Atlantic slave trade and the Enlightenment. The contradictions between the principles of universalism and owning and mistreating fellow humans became increasingly untenable, at least in a moral and intellectual sense.</p> <p>But despite the claims that have been made, says MacAskill, there was no economic imperative to end slavery. Sugar plantations were not mechanised for many years after the end of slavery and sugar consumption continued to grow when slavery stopped. Rather than think of abolition as inevitable, he argues, we should acknowledge the part played by those who made the moral case. It seems so obvious to us now that it’s hard to imagine anyone could have opposed it. But powerful forces did. Moral progress is contingent, MacAskill emphasises, not inexorable. It just seems like that once progress has been achieved.</p> <p>Going against that moral step forward, however, is the argument that rejects humanism, post-Enlightenment values and the whole liberal discourse as merely being the soft power of colonialism, a western imposition that runs roughshod over other cultures and values. MacAskill has little time for such relativist arguments.</p> <p>“I think to conflate colonialism and [these aspects of liberalism] is a huge mistake,” he says. “Colonialism was absolutely horrific, one of the great abominations of history. But if you have this idea that all moral perspectives command equal respect, then are slave-owning societies and extreme patriarchal societies – the most common societies throughout history – OK, it’s just their way of being and we shouldn’t tell them they’re wrong? No.”</p> <p>That said, MacAskill believes the west has a great deal to learn from other cultures. In the first instance, by appreciating just how well off most people are in developed countries by comparison with those who are not. He says he currently gives away everything he earns above post-tax £26,000 per year, which still places him in the top 5% in terms of wealth across the globe. Although he doesn’t have yet children, if he did, he would allow an extra £5,000 for each one, were he sharing the financial burden with another parent, and £10,000 if a single parent.</p> <p>“I honestly think people in rich countries could be giving radically more than they’re currently giving at very little cost to their own wellbeing, while at the same time doing an enormous amount of good.”</p> <p>There are also philosophical wisdoms to be gained from Indigenous populations.</p> <p>“The Iroquois in their oral constitution advocated concern for future generations,” he says. “It seems like this was true for many Indigenous philosophies in Africa as well.”</p> <p>He speculates that there are logical cultural reasons why this was the case. In hunter-gatherer societies technological change took place very slowly. So learning something from your ancestors 1,000 years ago or handing down those wisdoms to your descendants 1,000 years hence was viable, because it was likely to still be relevant.</p> <p>But in societies undergoing rapid change, we feel more disconnected from the distant future because we struggle to conceive what it will be like.</p> <p>“We’ve gone too far in that direction,” he says, suggesting that we have developed the conceptual tools to navigate our way through the great unknown to come and should make use of them. “We can now use expected value theory to hedge against uncertainty.”</p> <p>One problem is that often when a society, or more specifically a regime, speaks of the longterm future, it’s to establish an epic stage to bolster their claims on governance. It’s what the Nazis attempted to do with the “thousand-year Reich”, just as the first Qin emperor spoke of an empire lasting 10,000 generations. In fact the Qin empire lasted for 15 years, three years longer than the Nazis.</p> <p>What MacAskill is arguing for, though, is humility in the face of the astonishing expanse of time that humanity could fill. But that shouldn’t lead to complacency or paralysis. Standard economic forecasts for the next 100 years predict more of the same, with growth of approximately 2% a year. MacAskill says that we should take into account the possibility of a catastrophe that wipes out 50% of the population, or that there might a significant increase in growth.</p> <p>We don’t know what’s going to happen, but we should put a lot more time and effort into preparing for different outcomes. We owe that to ourselves, says MacAskill, but we also owe it to the teeming billions yet to come.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>What We Owe the Future: A Million-Year View</em> by William MacAskill is published by Oneworld (£20).

Fresh-faced, with a cheeky grin, Armstrong gave voice to teen innuendoes while toting the gold chains of success.</p> <p>His debut album<em> </em>has been much anticipated. Boasting features from Ed Sheeran and AJ Tracey, these 16 tracks are Armstrong staking his claim to the mainstream. The results are largely predictable: singles <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GWw2p_X6Lg\">1989</a> and Baby interpolate samples from Ashanti’s 2003 hit Rock Wit U and Stone Roses anthem Fools Gold, with Armstrong’s verses as embellishment.

That’s what scientists call the way we humans often fail to notice the staggering diversity and complexity of plant life around us. The philosopher Paco Calvo seems to be mercifully free from this affliction – he runs a laboratory in Spain studying plant behaviour, trying to figure out if that half-dead fern that you forgot to water on the windowsill ought to be classified as “intelligent”.</p> <p>Some flowers turn towards the sun as it tracks across the sky, and some plants close their leaves when touched, but traits like these are generally assumed to be automatic reflexes, no different to the way your leg jerks out when you get tapped on the knee.</p> <p>In <em>Planta Sapiens</em>, Calvo tries to show us that our green friends do far more than just blindly react. He believes they “plan ahead to achieve goals” and “proactively engage with their surroundings”, as they grapple with gradual changes in the soil or the sudden appearance of a predator.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some plants seem to ‘remember’ previous droughts, conserving water more effectively than plants that have never encountered long dry spells</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a way, that shouldn’t be a surprise. After all, plants evolved in the same unpredictable world as we did and, like us, need to be able to respond to changing circumstances to survive.</p> <p>Scientists have known for a long time that plants can communicate with one another using chemical compounds and it’s also been long understood that they use electrical signals (much like animals) to coordinate their internal response to the world around them.</p> <p>Calvo describes more sophisticated examples of plant behaviour; how some plants seem to “remember” previous droughts, for example, conserving water more effectively than plants that have never encountered long dry spells. Or how some behave differently when competing for resources against other species, rather than their own kind.</p> <p>However, proving that these behaviours are evidence of cognition, rather than being automatic reflex responses, albeit impressive ones, is a tough hurdle to clear and Calvo doesn’t quite make it over.</p> <p>But merely posing the question makes this book part of a wider movement, beginning with Peter Singer’s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/animal-liberation-9781847923844\">Animal Liberation</a></em> (1975) and including Frans de Waal’s pioneering <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/are-we-smart-enough-to-know-how-smart-animals-are-9781783783069\">Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?</a></em> (2016) and Peter Godfrey-Smith’s masterly <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/other-minds-9780008226299\">Other Minds</a></em> (2016), which challenges anthropocentric ideas about intelligence, suggesting it’s not a uniquely human trait.</p> <p>This is perhaps the most significant intellectual shift happening today, opening up the possibility that we can radically realign our relationship to the natural world. Instead of blithely thinking that we’re somehow superior to – and separate from – the animals and plants around us, we might start to appreciate that we’re deeply and irrevocably connected to these fragile ecosystems.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd5daf19fc055f2f220efb6222765662ca246f75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd5daf19fc055f2f220efb6222765662ca246f75/0_693_4847_2909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The smell of freshly cut grass ‘comes from the chemicals released by the wounded plant to warn nearby grasses to mobilise their defences’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The smell of freshly cut grass ‘comes from the chemicals released by the wounded plant to warn nearby grasses to mobilise their defences’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dazeley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simply by being part of this philosophical sea change, <em>Planta Sapiens</em> is an important book, if not especially compelling. It does contain some interesting vignettes. I had no idea, for instance, that the smell of freshly cut grass comes from the chemicals released by the wounded plant to warn nearby grasses to mobilise their defences. At least now I have an excuse for not mowing the lawn: I don’t want to hurt its feelings.</p> <p>The most intriguing nugget is about mimosa plants, which close their leaves when they’re touched so as to protect themselves from predators. It turns out that some mimosas are quick to close up, while others are slower, which suggests, claims Calvo (without being all that convincing), that individual plants have different “personalities”.</p> <p>But as fascinating as these titbits are, you have to cut through reams of deadwood about the author’s career to reach them. It’s a shame. This subject deserves writing that fills the reader with a sense of wonder, encouraging us to think of ourselves as part of an intricate, intelligent biosphere that encompasses flora and fauna alike.</p> <p>This isn’t that book. But the good news is that anyone who wants to be enthralled by plant behaviour can tune into the BBC’s sublime recent series <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0013cl7/the-green-planet\">The</a></em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0013cl7/the-green-planet\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0013cl7/the-green-planet\">Green Planet</a></em>. Sir David Attenborough’s closing monologue deserves to be heard far and wide: “Our relationship with plants has changed throughout history and now it must change again. If we do this, our future will be healthier, safer and happier. Plants are our most ancient allies and together we can make this an even greener planet.”</p> <p>You don’t have to be as smart as a houseplant to see the wisdom in those words.</p> <p>• <em>Planta Sapiens: Unmasking Plant Intelligence</em> by Paco Calvo with Natalie Lawrence is published by Little, Brown (£22).

Almost nothing was written about his wild and beautiful paintings – ancient yet modern, mythological yet supremely contemporary – and they have only gradually started to emerge. Brighton Centre for Contemporary Arts has somehow managed to lay hands on 15 of his elusive works on wood from scattered locations to mount this mesmerising show, the first in a public gallery in the UK. The result is <a href=\"https://brightoncca.art/exhibition/bill-lynch/\">a coup</a>.</p> <p>Lynch was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the heartlands of <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and studied art at the <a href=\"https://cooper.edu/about/history\">Cooper Union</a> in New York. He lived in California for a time but ended up in Raleigh, North Carolina, to be close to his family. He seems to have worked intermittently, sometimes as a carpenter, though it is surprisingly hard to discover very much about him.</p> <p><a href=\"https://scontent.flhr4-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.18172-8/13403963_1087783574629569_3918374084194848650_o.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_fr_q65&amp;_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e007fa&amp;_nc_ohc=10vChH03wCQAX82yEHw&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.flhr4-3.fna&amp;oh=00_AT9r0d7g41e6l39-FaF9NfgMdAI-bs0Ex71xKZ0QMy9lIQ&amp;oe=631FDBEB\">A portrait exists</a>, by his friend and fellow painter <a href=\"https://www.victoria-miro.com/artists/10-verne-dawson/\">Verne Dawson</a>, which shows a man in a sweater with blue eyes and red hair, but Lynch is otherwise an artist without a public face (at least to me).

But the medium becomes crucial to the art. Old plywood, used planks, the top of a table pocked with woodworm: he found a way of painting on this hard and resistant substrate as if it were as light as parchment. And his brushwork, moreover, is rightly described as calligraphic. Owls, hawks, tangled blossoms, the pale discs of honesty seeds hanging like silver moons from skeletal black boughs: his art has all the delicacy of nature, combined with a swirling, stuttering, sometimes wayward abruptness.</p> <p>Over the tawny warmth of old wood, he paints a rough blush of crimson to hold a stem of white blossoms. They materialise like a vision on the moire grain of the wood. Lynch pays attention to every nuance of the natural surface. His brush follows the flow or scumbles over the unfinished wood to let its grain show through as part of the image. Circles where a knot has fallen out are filled in with pigment, like twinkling planets.</p> <p>On a stretch of blond board he paints two classical gods locked in mortal combat beneath a sequence of almost abstract swirls, dark with thunder, that repeat the rings of the wood while implying ancient skies. A green frog watches from halfway up one side, scuppering your sense of what is above, below and beyond. The wood has the disorientating dimensions, for him, of both heaven and earth, of outer space and Grecian sand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7f0b11b3ca65afb0236b25157cd74549fceca13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7f0b11b3ca65afb0236b25157cd74549fceca13/245_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled by Bill Lynch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled by Bill Lynch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Harris/ Brighton CCA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A deer moves through white light, a morse code of fine dots and dashes, the red of both a roebuck and its blood. Only at a distance does it become apparent that this creature is turning its own head to throw back a glance. The skittering marks and the bristling foliage give a firework rush to this enormous image; the creature leaps, about to be gone.</p> <p>A willow pattern cup lies, blue and white and bizarrely coarse, among the bracken and ferns on a forest floor. There is a brilliant painting of a mirror, just a disc of white, but exactly the right white, glimmering against the hardboard in another painting, characteristically without date or title. These still lifes, small and discreet, seem to come out of nowhere and yet to make a kind of poetic sense.</p> <p>An image of a pomegranate, sliced in two, its ruby seeds painted an alizarin crimson that gathers on the surface like drops of blood, appears against a hazy, smoky darkness. Water lilies hover beside it, for no apparent reason; and above it hangs a wooden dish, decorated in gold on terracotta, almost wilfully scruffy in appearance and yet so expressive of the object itself as to be instantly recognisable. We are in ancient Greece, or Monet’s Giverny, or right here and now, somewhere in America. For this picture, unusually, does have a title and it throws all the emphasis on a ball of soft pale fluff at the bottom, the seeds of a native plant. It is called <em>Still Life With Milkw</em><em>eed Seed</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df6cd3303eefef441f4bb3a33cb30113296309df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6cd3303eefef441f4bb3a33cb30113296309df/714_583_6722_4457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still Life With Milkweed Seed, undated, by Bill Lynch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Still Life With Milkweed Seed, undated, by Bill Lynch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Harris/ Brighton CCA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The willow pattern cup is telling. Lynch loved and studied the art of Chinese watercolour, especially the flower-and-bird compositions that thread their way through this show. But other cultures are always there in the wings. One work in Brighton includes an image of a Chinese painting of a horse that in turn somehow doubles as its own ancestor from the prehistoric caves of Lascaux; three different epochs in one.</p> <p>There is a quotation, taken from a letter to a friend in the 1990s. “I realised that the art of the 20th century is the fruit of personal revelation,” Lynch wrote, “while ancient art is the product of mystery initiation.” That goes some way to illuminating the strangeness of his work, with its peculiar combination of primitive joy and high sophistication. A huge painting of a sunset rolls across the hardboard in brilliantly controlled swirls, suave as any pop art riff, yet with a glory of gold, pink and blue that might have come from another painter standing under a different sky thousands of years ago.</p> <p>The most beautiful work here is painted on five bare planks joined together to make something around the size and shape of a door. It is almost entirely composed in black and white against the hazy gold of the wood; like the colours of a Japanese scroll. Snow descends in soft, circling dabs. Birds, or at least dark avian shapes, appear among the silent flakes. Everything is descending down these long vertical planks like winter in some towering American landscape. It is a dream of a forest, painted on wood from such a forest: humble, organic, gentle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac954b9cbfa2787431a02b2d817b7e72f40b11d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac954b9cbfa2787431a02b2d817b7e72f40b11d1/784_371_3810_7574/503.jpg\" alt=\"An untitled work by Bill Lynch painted on five planks.\" width=\"503\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Snow descends in soft, circling dabs’: an untitled work by Bill Lynch painted on five planks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Harris/ Brighton CCA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://brightoncca.art/exhibition/bill-lynch/\">Bill Lynch: The Exile of Dionysus</a> is at Brighton CCA until 15 October</p></li> </ul> <p>• This article was amended on 23 August 2022 to correct a reference to Raleigh, “North California”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/21/how-to-enjoy-great-restaurant-wines-at-affordable-prices-without-leaving-home","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T12:00:07Z","webTitle":"How to enjoy great restaurant wines at affordable prices without leaving home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/21/how-to-enjoy-great-restaurant-wines-at-affordable-prices-without-leaving-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/21/how-to-enjoy-great-restaurant-wines-at-affordable-prices-without-leaving-home","fields":{"headline":"How to enjoy great restaurant wines at affordable prices without leaving home","trailText":"When we’re all having to make our money go further, the at-home service provided by restaurant suppliers is worth checking out","byline":"David Williams","body":"<p>Few documents offer a better, more acute insight into the lives and means of the very rich than a top-end wine list. The hefty tome that is perhaps the world’s most extraordinary example of this, from Vienna’s five-star hotel <a href=\"https://palais-coburg.com/en/wine/wine-archive/wine-list/\">Palais Coburg</a>, sprawls across some 100 tightly spaced pages, with many prices running to the high three figures, and many more advertised with one of two pithy German euphemisms for “you almost certainly cannot afford this”: <em>preis vor ort </em>and <em>raritat</em>.</p> <p>As out-of-this-world decadent as this kind of list undoubtedly is, I do understand the once in a lifetime appeal that leads some well-heeled wine lovers to save up for a night at the Palais Coburg or other blockbusting wine-led restaurants around the world, such as New York City’s Eleven Madison Park or London’s Sketch. Increasingly, however, you don’t have to be a plutocrat – or even, for one night only, pretend to be a plutocrat – to enjoy some of the best restaurant wines around.</p> <p>OK, I’m not talking about the exceedingly rare and expensive likes of 1929 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti or 1893 Château d’Yquem on offer at the Palais Coburg. Those will always be out of reach to most of us. All the same, over the past couple of years, it’s become much easier to find, buy and drink at home the sort of bottles that only ever used to turn up on the best wine lists – and at prices that are a fraction of those you’d find if you were nervously turning the pages of the leather-bound book at a restaurant table.</p> <p>It’s a trend that has been accelerated by the pandemic, a period when the prolonged closure of their main source of custom forced many restaurant wine suppliers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/sep/19/where-to-find-top-restaurant-wines-to-drink-at-home\">to look at other ways of shifting their wares</a>. One was to focus on selling more to independent wine merchants, the sort of upmarket shops where restaurateurs are comfortable seeing their wines, or at least happier than they would be if they saw them in a supermarket.</p> <p>Another option was to become a retailer, cutting out the indisposed middleman, and selling directly to the general public. Many of these ad-hoc online businesses didn’t last beyond the first lockdown but others have endured. With insolvencies in the restaurant sector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/25/uk-restaurant-insolvencies-closures-rise-data\">up by 60% in the past year </a>according to accountancy firm UHY Hacker, the appeal of this new stream of income for wine suppliers is obvious.</p> <p>It’s obvious for punters like me, too. There is nothing quite like the experience of coming across a new, interesting or just straightforwardly delicious wine at a restaurant with similarly stimulating food and company. But, at an inflationary time when our lives seem to be all about ways of making more of our increasingly slender means, the at-home service provided by restaurant suppliers such as Jascots at Home, Indigo Wine spin-off the Sourcing Table or the Modest Merchant, among others, is very much the next best thing.</p> <h2>Six restaurant wines to drink at home</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9def196417cb5f162650efb77ea9799b6b17fb2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9def196417cb5f162650efb77ea9799b6b17fb2a/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Six restaurant wines to drink at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Metic Cabernet Sauvignon</strong><br><em>Colchagua Valley, Chile 2019</em> (from £10.20, <a href=\"https://thesourcingtable.com/products/metic-cabernet-sauvignon-2019\">thesourcingtable.com</a>; <a href=\"https://shop.lescaves.co.uk/lescaves-product/19WMACSF\">lescaves.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.hopburnsblack.co.uk/collections/all/products/metic-cabernet-sauvignon-2019-750ml\">hopburnsblack.co.uk</a>)<br>A considerable cut above house-wine level, this brilliant Chilean cabernet sauvignon imported by one of the UK’s biggest restaurant wine suppliers, the natural wine-minded Les Caves de Pyrene, is an effortless squeeze of ripe blackcurrant succulence.</p> <p><strong>Tiefenbrunner Merus Vernatsch Schiava</strong><br><em>Alto-Adige, Italy 2021</em> (£15.66, <a href=\"https://www.jascots.co.uk/p4203/merus-vernatsch-schiava-tiefenbrunner-alto-adige-italy/\">jascots.co.uk</a>)<br>Restaurant supplier Jascots asks for a £20 fee, all of which goes to hospitality sector charity Hospitality Action, before you can order from them.

In part, it’s an affirmation of Smyth’s return to Anglicanism (it didn’t last), though it was also strongly influenced by her relationship with the Catholic Pauline Trevelyan, with whom she was in love. Yet it nevertheless rebels, iconoclastically, against liturgical tradition by wrenching the Gloria out of context and placing it last for purely musical reasons.

The choral singing was similarly splendid in its weight, attack and careful dynamic shading. Though Smyth’s writing for the soloists is at times ungrateful, the emotional kernel comes with the Sanctus, Benedictus and Agnus Dei, cast as consecutive arias for mezzo (Bethan Langford, lovely), soprano (Nardus Williams) and tenor (Robert Murray, occasionally effortful).

Throw in song and dance routines based on a story of murderous teen rivalry with nods to the 1950 Hollywood classic All About Eve and you have this tricky solo production.</p> <p>However much of an outre idea it may be, Luke Bayer meets the feat and flies with it. He plays Desmond Channing, the diva-ish and devilish heir of Bette Davis’s Margo Channing, who is president of a school drama society in Florida. We meet post-death, from the inner circles of hell, as he re-enacts his enmity with Evan Harris – the new drama society kid he once mentored – which led to his death.</p> <p>Bayer’s performance brings out every last black laugh and his voice weaves its own dark magic in its ability to change in tenor and texture with every character he plays. It is clear, strong and androgynous at times, soaring and glittering through Alexander Sage Oyen’s excellent, infectious songs, such as Live from Hell! and His Best Friend.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He makes a captivating villain, sneering, sulking and plotting his way though the show</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He slips in an out of his jeans and dons feathered sleeves or tap shoes and makes a captivating villain – a handsome devil cum high school brat – sneering, sulking and plotting his way though the show.</p> <p>Under the deft direction of Joe McNeice, this 2017 musical, which now makes its UK debut, also alludes to other classic film fare alongside All About Eve, as well as sending up the genre of the high school movie. Channing’s popular-guy persona, together with his bitchy asides, are amusingly reminiscent of Mean Girls and Heathers, with high school lockers lining the back of the set (also designed by McNeice).</p> <p>It is very much a musical in love with musical theatre: Patti LuPone and Kevin Kline are numerously name-checked while stagey references and in-jokes are amply dropped, though these remain within the grasp of non-aficionados and bring added humour.</p> <p>The clever, snide and witty book by Nora Brigid Monahan grapples with teen insecurity, envy and the struggle for success of a wannabe actor. It is about sexuality, too, but with the lightest of touches (arguably too light) as the flagrantly camp Desmond talks emphatically about his heterosexuality.</p> <p>But, for such a camp show, it has surprising darkness, as Desmond sings in the seedy depths of the Seventh Circle. Bayer embodies this difficult role without any sense of strain, and even a technical issue that brings a temporary halt to the performance on press night does not impede our enjoyment.

For the next four decades it was home to more than 100 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftd91oXrcSA\" title=\"\">antique keyboard instruments</a> and their music, realised by established performers – or by anyone who turned up. This was previously unheard of. Other museums disapproved, though some eventually copied the idea, and Melvyn Tan was among the pianists who drew direct inspiration for the course of their careers from Dick’s pioneering philosophy.</p> <p>He and his wife, the writer Katrina Hendrey, had bought Finchcocks, an early Georgian manor house with 13 acres, in 1970 and ran it together. It was then in a shocking state, but provided workshops for Adlam Burnett, the firm that Dick ran with Derek Adlam, building replicas and restoring instruments with a gifted team of craftsmen until 1980.<strong> </strong></p> <p>When the house was opened as a museum, it provided an ideal setting for instruments to sound in the sort of ambience for which they were intended. There was always a full programme of events throughout the open season, culminating each September in formal concerts involving well-known artists who loved going there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7acabbdbd800b84126ea9f6d16c57eb552a88716\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7acabbdbd800b84126ea9f6d16c57eb552a88716/18_126_4806_2883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A room at the Finchcocks Living Museum of Music in Goudhurst, Kent, in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A room at the Finchcocks Living Museum of Music in Goudhurst, Kent, in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antony Souter/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it was the open afternoons that originally surprised and delighted visitors, at their peak numbering 20,000 a year, for whom the instruments were a novelty, and the hosts’ informality provided an unparalleled experience. Visitors were captivated by Dick’s enthusiasm and humorous way of imparting information. They were also taken aback by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quUyNNWMcz0\" title=\"\">the quality of his performances</a>: he got early pianos, and not just his own, to be sparkling in the treble, nobly thundering in the bass, with every shimmering variation in between and witty usage of pedal and knee-lever devices.</p> <p>His economy of movement was pronounced: his arms and hands barely moved and there was something fascinating in the way his fingers connected with the keys with dexterous, un-apparent vigour. When demonstrating instruments Dick liked to tell the story of Muzio Clementi, “father of the modern pianoforte”, passed on by Clementi’s grandson, of being shown into his grandfather’s study and finding the great man dramatically playing something of his own composition, on a piano of his own manufacture, while reading from a volume, not of music, but Thucydides. As a performer, Dick was the opposite, holding an audience enraptured, but with a lack of drama that made him seem almost absent from the proceedings. Once I asked him afterwards what he had been thinking of: “jokes” he replied, and indeed his could be very funny and well-crafted.</p> <p>He tried to match each composer with the right instrument and was careful not to get between the listener and the music. Notable among his many recordings on the Amon Ra label are The Romantic Fortepiano – works by Hummel, Czerny, Schubert, Chopin and Schumann on his 1826 Viennese instrument by Conrad Graf – and pieces by the American Louis Moreau Gottschalk, on pianos by Broadwood and Erard as well as the Graf. With his great friend the violinist Ralph Holmes he recorded Beethoven sonatas, and with another, Alan Hacker, a Clarinet Collection.</p> <p>An Evening With Queen Victoria was devised by Katrina from letters and diaries for Prunella Scales, who excelled in fleshing out Victoria’s character in a comical way, facing the magnitude of her position as a girl, gathering confidence and eventually reaching problematic old age. Dick’s selection of music for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMspGj37M-g\" title=\"\">the tenor Ian Partridge</a> and himself included works by Mendelssohn; the queen’s consort, Prince Albert; Gilbert and Sullivan’s account of a republican monarchy from The Gondoliers; and a Fugue in E by JS Bach.</p> <p>Over three decades, it ran for 400 performances. The show’s original piano was a marquetry Collard &amp; Collard from around 1840, whose scaly aspect gave it an unpromising resemblance to a giant lizard. Typically un-resonant of its period, it blossomed under Dick’s considered coaxing, as Irving Wardle noted in his review of the first performance at the Old Vic in London in 1980, which led to performances all round the world and was shown on BBC TV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"812f54927ad692f72c484dbd0ccd8c83ca761246\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/812f54927ad692f72c484dbd0ccd8c83ca761246/0_435_5335_3201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A further room at Finchcocks.

Dick was a true collector and loved to buy things he thought the public would like. </p> <p>Born at Stratton, an early Georgian farmhouse in Godstone, Surrey, he was the fifth child of Joan (nee Humphery) and Sir Leslie Burnett. His parents were wealthy by virtue of being two of the proprietors of <a href=\"https://lookup.london/hays-wharf/\" title=\"\">Hay’s Wharf</a>, a warehouse on the Thames in London. Nonetheless, the family home had one bathroom and no central heating, because Dick’s father had it removed.</p> <p>At Cheam school, Hampshire, the matron taught Dick to juggle, a skill later supplanted by tightrope walking and unicycling. From Eton he went to the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music in London (1951-52), and then to take a degree (1957) in economics and modern languages – Danish, Swedish and Norwegian – at King’s College, Cambridge. There, before an expectant audience, having been given the wrong sort of rope, he fell theatrically into the Cam. Later he studied German, Dutch and Japanese.</p> <p>By nature, Dick was contradictory: kind, energetic, generous and brilliant, but sometimes baffled. He needed space in which to experiment, and cared very much for his home and what could go into it. In 2008 he was appointed MBE. </p> <p>He married Katrina in 1969, and in 1984 they formed the <a href=\"https://www.finchcocks.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Finchcocks Charity</a> for musical education. They maintained their long-term commitment to Finchcocks until the flow of visitors diminished and the repairs needed to the collection and the house were too great. In 2016 I helped organise the sale by auction of most of its contents, and and 14 historic instruments, covering the whole repertoire, have found a home at <a href=\"https://seearoundbritain.com/venues/finchcocks-musical-museum-goudhurst-kent-tn17-1hh\" title=\"\">a new centre in Tunbridge Wells</a>.</p> <p>Katrina survives him.</p> <p>• Richard Leslie Burnett, fortepianist and collector, born 23 June 1932; died 8 July 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/21/actors-endure-litany-misery-auditions-former-rsc-director-adrian-noble","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T11:07:01Z","webTitle":"Actors endure ‘litany of misery’ in auditions, says former RSC director","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/21/actors-endure-litany-misery-auditions-former-rsc-director-adrian-noble","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/21/actors-endure-litany-misery-auditions-former-rsc-director-adrian-noble","fields":{"headline":"Actors endure ‘litany of misery’ in auditions, says former RSC director","trailText":"Exclusive: Adrian Noble offers advice for directors who are often ‘rude, look at iPhones, run late and don’t apologise’","byline":"Dalya Alberge","body":"<p>Actors must endure a “litany of misery” when auditioning for roles and the process must be improved, according to a former artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p> <p>Adrian Noble, whose casts have included Judi Dench and Derek Jacobi, said “every actor in the world” has their own “horror stories”.</p> <p>“These usually involve lack of respect, waste of time, humiliation and discourtesy,” he added. “Directors are rude, look at their iPhones during the audition, run late and don’t apologise, they chat away to their casting director as if the actor didn’t exist, they laugh at private review copy jokes. A litany of misery! Each of these tales is underpinned by the fact that the actor is a supplicant.”</p> <p>His criticisms appear in a forthcoming book on directing Shakespeare in which he offers advice to directors, on even the most basic politeness, which is too often absent from auditions.</p> <p>“Do thank them for coming in. Do try to give immediate, clear, positive feedback on what they have done. Do study their CV <em>before</em> they come in and don’t read while they are performing,” he said. “Do have water available and throwaway cups … Do offer them the opportunity to try again if they wish and you have the time. You can judge how they take direction.”</p> <p>He suggests asking actors about their take on the play and making it clear to them or their representative what the director is “looking to explore”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d0149cd8ac2e9673bc6391e94aa610909a2c1bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d0149cd8ac2e9673bc6391e94aa610909a2c1bf/0_0_1630_2551/639.jpg\" alt=\"Noble’s criticisms appear in his new book How to Direct Shakespeare\" width=\"639\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noble’s criticisms appear in his new book How to Direct Shakespeare.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c/o The Arden</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said: “It needs to be made clear to the actor <em>before </em>the audition what is expected. You will certainly want to find out more about the actor, so leave time for a conversation.</p> <p>“Whether this is before or after the audition is up to you. Some actors prefer to come in, do their stuff and then talk; they can thus maintain their focus. Some prefer an ‘ice-breaking’ chat first.”</p> <p>Noble headed the RSC between 1991 and 2003. His productions included King Lear with Robert Stephens as Lear. He has drawn on those experiences in writing his book, <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/how-to-direct-shakespeare-9781350231245/\">How to Direct Shakespeare</a>, which will be published on 8 September by the Arden Shakespeare, a Bloomsbury imprint.</p> <p>He offers advice on what to do if actors become inhibited or stuck: “Ask the actors to run around the room two or three times as fast (and safely) as possible. Then run into the space and <em>immediately </em>play the scene, forgetting about blocking and verse and concept … Ask the actors to play the scene as clearly and as seriously as possible, using the structure of the original, but talking gibberish or a made-up language. This will reveal how well they understand the shape of a scene.”</p> <p>John Barclay, an assistant general secretary of Equity, the actors’ union, said Noble was raising a serious issue as actors are too often “disrespected” at auditions – from being made to wait hours before they are even seen to not hearing again from producers or casting directors afterwards.</p> <p>Equity is particularly outraged that actors are increasingly being pressured to sign “bullying and overreaching” non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) before they can audition, which means they do not even know what kind of character they are being considered for, let alone anything about the production. Actors need time to prepare for particular roles.</p> <p>The union believes such NDAs are “inappropriate and excessive” and infringe UK law, but Barclay said “desperate performers will sign anything”, adding: “There is this whole level of ‘uncomfortableness’ around auditions.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/21/fish-tagine-spinach-pine-nuts-chocolate-cake-recipes-moro-cookbook","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T11:00:08Z","webTitle":"Fish tagine, spinach and pine nuts, chocolate almond cake – recipes from the new Moro cookbook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/21/fish-tagine-spinach-pine-nuts-chocolate-cake-recipes-moro-cookbook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/21/fish-tagine-spinach-pine-nuts-chocolate-cake-recipes-moro-cookbook","fields":{"headline":"Fish tagine, spinach and pine nuts, chocolate almond cake – recipes from the new Moro cookbook","trailText":"More than 20 years after their first collection of recipes, chefs Sam and Sam Clark prove their brand of simple north African and Spanish cooking is – like them – here to stay","byline":"Interview by Rachel Cooke, recipes by Sam and Sam Clark","body":"<p>Everyone loves toast. But there is toast and… toast. In <em>Moro Easy</em>, a new cookbook by Sam and Sam Clark, there are no fewer than 10 recipes for things on toast. Some are straightforward, almost austere: I can’t imagine the person who wouldn’t be able to rustle up a few slices of their tomato and jamon toast (the secret lies with a grater and just the right amount of garlic). Others are luxuriant: imagine a crisp oval of sourdough topped with a thin tortilla and aioli – a breakfast treat they first ate in Barcelona’s Boqueria market – or with crab warmed in butter and Oloroso sherry and lightly seasoned with fresh chilli and thyme.</p> <p><em>Moro Easy</em> is the Clarks’ first book since 2014 and it is, at least in part, a result of the pandemic: their London restaurants – Moro in Clerkenwell and Morito in Hackney – suddenly shuttered, the pair found themselves unexpectedly at home with their three children (running a delivery service, they decided, was not for them). “It was extraordinary,” says the first Sam (to avoid confusion, I will hereafter refer to her husband as Samuel), “cooking three meals a day for five, rather than however many covers in the restaurant.” Some of the ideas that eventually went into <em>Moro Easy</em> were old ones, reworked for the home cook. But others were born of this period, when they were cooking off the cuff. “We felt a bit smug,” says Samuel. “At the supermarkets, there were long queues. But our local shops had no queues, and they sell everything you could want. I loved having the time to shop. We’ve lived here for 15 years, and I’d never really used the high street before.”</p> <p>At their kitchen table, half of it these days dotted with pots of geraniums, we turn the pages of <em>Moro Easy</em>. Samuel alights on a recipe for spiced labneh with sun-dried tomatoes, coriander and fennel seeds, about which, it turns out, they both have a couple of things to say. First, they tell me, making your own labneh – a strained yoghurt with the consistency of soft cheese, used in Middle Eastern cooking – is both easy and a “revelation” (using Greek yoghurt and cream cheese avoids the need for straining). Second, sun-dried tomatoes are due for a comeback. “The backlash was unnecessarily harsh,” says Samuel with a smile. There follows – more page turning – some talk of rice (the Clarks are self-confessed rice snobs), pistachios (the best come from Turkey), chicken livers (why do they make people nervous?) and ice-cream (<em>Moro Easy </em>includes a recipe for one flavoured with coffee and cardamom that, involving no churning, takes mere seconds to whizz up).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6b4975d4610958cba624c811f049855efee43cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b4975d4610958cba624c811f049855efee43cd4/972_1024_7197_4320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samuel and Sam Clark, chef-owners of the Moro and Morito restaurants, in their garden in north London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samuel and Sam Clark, chef-owners of the Moro and Morito restaurants, in their garden in north London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pål Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Clarks’ first book – <em>Moro, the Cookbook</em> – came out in 2001, four years after their influential restaurant, its menu inspired by their travels in north Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, opened in 1997; instantly hailed as a classic by Nigella Lawson and Claudia Roden, it remains much loved (though they’ve since published several more). Is it hard to write in its shadow? “It’s good having a bit of distance between the books,” says Sam. “But, though we’re proud of the first one, we’ve never quite been able to understand its success. The other books have recipes that are just as good. It kind of became part of the culture for a while, didn’t it?”</p> <p>In the end, they measure themselves only by their own standards, in the restaurant as well as when it comes to writing: “Within the first two years of Moro opening, we were approached to sell the brand. We just said: no, no, no, we’re here to stay. We’re the cooks, and we like doing that, and it’s what we’re here for – and we’ve stayed true to it. We’re still in the kitchen now. We’re in it for the long haul.”</p> <p>Post-pandemic, it was difficult to get things fully up and running again; restaurants are about momentum. “But then we’d have customers coming up to the pass and literally crying, they were so happy we were open again,” says Sam. “That’s what all the hard work is for.” But what about their relationship? If running a celebrated restaurant for 25 years is a huge achievement – restaurants in London change more often than the weather – it is surely a miracle that they’ve done so without winding up in the divorce courts (they met when they were both working at the Eagle, just down the road from Moro, in Clerkenwell). “Well, I got told off the other day, didn’t I?” says Sam. Samuel takes up the story. “She was late, and I had a new chef to settle in, and I was doing a hot section myself, and we had a lot of people booked.”</p> <p>What happened? Was there an explosive row? Apparently not. “I just worked twice as hard,” says Sam. For the team, some of whom have been at Moro for a long time, this kind of thing usually passes – according to Samuel – as light entertainment: “There can be a slightly comical hissing at one another.” In the end, though, they tend not to let things simmer. Marital stew, it seems, is one dish best removed from the heat as soon as possible. </p> <h2>Fish tagine with potatoes, peas and coriander (pictured above)</h2> <p>The subtle use of mixed spices and preserved lemon gives a distinctive flavour to this Moroccan fish stew.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4</strong></em><br><strong>olive oil</strong> 3 tbsp, plus a little extra for drizzling<br><strong>banana shallots</strong> 2, or 1 small red onion, peeled<br><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves, peeled<br><strong>preserved lemon rind</strong> 1 heaped tbsp, finely chopped (optional)<br><strong>ground cumin</strong> 1½ heaped tsp <br><strong>paprika</strong> ½ tsp <br><strong>fresh coriander</strong> 2 tbsp, finely chopped, plus a few leaves for garnish<br><strong>cherry tomatoes</strong> 200g <br><strong>small waxy new potatoes</strong> 200g, such as charlotte, jersey or ratte, sliced into ½cm rounds <br><strong>frozen petit pois or garden peas</strong> 200g <br><strong>firm white fish</strong> 4 fillets, such as sea bass, monkfish or cod <br><strong>lemon</strong> 1 slice, to serve</p> <p>Using a hand blender or food processor, blitz everything except the potatoes, peas and fish.

She sits on its remuneration and safety committees, earning €123,000 (£115,000) last year.</p> <p>Yorkshire Water said this weekend that Shaw’s second boardroom role did not affect her commitment to improving water services.</p> <p>Susan Davy, boss of Pennon Group, owner of South West Water, which was spilling sewage and stormwater into seas around Devon and Cornwall last week, is on the board of data management firm Restore plc. She was paid £53,000 by the firm last year, sitting on a remuneration committee.</p> <p>An analysis by the Liberal Democrats revealed last week that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/19/bonuses-for-water-bosses-in-england-up-20-last-year-despite-sewage-failures\" title=\"\">average water company boss’s total pay rose by 20%</a> in 2021, despite most firms failing to meet sewage pollution targets. The party said the pay packages were a “national scandal”.</p> <p>Andy Prendergast, national secretary of the GMB union, which has criticised the level of pay and bonuses given to water bosses, said: “This country is facing a water crisis and the fact that those paid fortunes to deal with it have enough time to moonlight in second jobs beggars belief.</p> <p>“At a time of hosepipe bans and sewage discharges, we deserve that those paid high salaries devote their time to putting it right. The fact their second roles largely involve green-lighting massive salary increases for other bosses is scandalous.”</p> <p>The performance of water companies is under mounting scrutiny as drought has been declared across large swaths of the country. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/13/water-industry-england-raw-sewage-pollution-environment-agency\" title=\"\">Environment Agency reported in July</a> that “the environmental performance of England’s nine water and sewerage companies was the worst we have seen for years”.</p> <p>Swimmers were warned of sewage and stormwater flowing on to beaches last week, mainly on the south coast. A Labour party analysis has found that water companies have spent more than 9 million hours discharging raw sewage and stormwater into the country’s rivers and seas since 2016.</p> <p>Other water bosses with non-executive roles include Sarah Bentley, boss of Thames Water, who was paid more than £2m last year. She is a non-executive director of Lloyds Bank, sitting on the remuneration committee. Thames Water and Lloyds Bank declined a request from the <em>Observer </em>last week to disclose any fees paid to her.</p> <p>Heidi Mottram, who earns £648,000 a year as boss of Northumbrian Water, is a non-executive director of the energy firm Centrica, where she was paid £93,000 last year. She sits on three committees, including the remuneration committee.</p> <p>Steve Mogford, who was paid £3.2m last year as boss of north-west water firm United Utilities, started as non-executive director of the defence firm Qinetiq this month. Mogford, a former senior executive at the defence giant BAE Systems, sits on four committees, including the remuneration committee.</p> <p>Luke Hildyard, executive director of the High Pay Centre, a thinktank that researches on issues around the pay of senior executives and corporate governance, said: “Most people would be astounded if they realised that pay levels for chief executives are set by committees made up of other chief executives and people in similar roles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8188ccf75c330f90df81313a7b3ca58d98e90f3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8188ccf75c330f90df81313a7b3ca58d98e90f3a/0_235_8033_4821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beachgoers in Swanage, named on Wessex Water’s website as one of the beaches where sewage was discharged on 17 August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beachgoers in Swanage, named on Wessex Water’s website as one of the beaches where sewage was discharged on 17 August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The justification for paying such large salary packages to company chief executives is that they are doing such important and demanding work.

How? By duping employees into thinking they’re dealing with real people.</p> <p>That’s what happened to a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/10/14/huge-bank-fraud-uses-deep-fake-voice-tech-to-steal-millions/?sh=1f0d6b5b7559\">bank manager in Hong Kong</a>, who received deep-faked calls from a bank director requesting a transfer.

And considering how much video and audio exists of us online thanks to social media and YouTube it’s not hard for a scammer using readily available tools to make people believe we are saying and doing things that we aren’t – or talking to people that don’t actually exist. Big tech companies like <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53984114\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/09/25/132884/google-has-released-a-giant-database-of-deepfakes-to-help-fight-deepfakes/\">Google</a> have been developing tools to detect these threats and federal <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3230#:\">legislation</a> is also in the works in an attempt to limit damage. But these steps can only go so far. So how do we protect our businesses from this growing danger?</p> <p>Training. And controls.</p> <p>The most common reason for security breaches – deepfakes or otherwise – remains human error. The bank manager, the CEO, the HR person that was duped by the fake remote employee all could have avoided these mistakes if they were better versed in recognizing deepfake scams.</p> <p>Many of my clients today invest extra in training tools like <a href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/\">KnowBe4</a> or <a href=\"https://www.phishingbox.com/\">Phishingbox</a> to continuously test their employees’ awareness of potential danger. Others pay IT professionals to keep their staff current with quarterly update sessions. Training is the best first line of defense against these threats.</p> <p>But training won’t completely protect us against deepfake technologies. That’s why having strong internal controls are now more important than ever. Ensuring that there are multiple layers of approvals required for significant transactions must be a requirement for any business, regardless of size. Owners and senior managers must not be tempted to override these policies as doing so will open the door to potentially unauthorized transactions by mistake.</p> <p>Like all security threats – spam, viruses, malware and now deepfakes – there will be new technologies to help minimize their impact. But, as ever, we can’t rely on these technologies to fully protect us. As business owners and managers we have to take responsibility for the actions of ourselves, and our employees by making the effort to better understand and recognizing these threats. This isn’t a movie. It’s real life.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/21/met-police-takes-ex-officer-parm-sandhu-to-court-black-and-blue","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T11:00:07Z","webTitle":"Met police take ex-officer who made claims of sexism and racism to court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/met-police-takes-ex-officer-parm-sandhu-to-court-black-and-blue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/met-police-takes-ex-officer-parm-sandhu-to-court-black-and-blue","fields":{"headline":"Met police take ex-officer who made claims of sexism and racism to court","trailText":"Case claims breach of gagging order relating to book by Parm Sandhu, which alleges she faced discrimination while an officer","byline":"Vikram Dodd Police and crime correspondent","body":"<p>The Metropolitan police is taking a former senior officer to court, claiming her allegations of racism and sexism broke an agreement meant to gag her from speaking out, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The Met says former chief superintendent Parm Sandhu must pay £60,000 plus interest after breaking a confidentiality agreement, also known as a non-disclosure agreement.</p> <p>The legal action by Britain’s biggest police force led to claims from one former Met chief that it is abusing taxpayers’ money and its power to bury uncomfortable allegations of discrimination. A Met solicitor has revealed the use of gagging or non-disclosure agreements in a sworn statement to the court, seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>The legal document is a particulars of claim issued on behalf of the commissioner of the Met, Sir Stephen House. He took temporary charge after Cressida Dick resigned in February amid scandals about her alleged failure to tackle misogyny and racism among her officers.</p> <p>Sandhu left the Met after 30 years, alleging discrimination. The force settled her employment tribunal claim in 2020 and paid her £120,000 in total.</p> <p>Sandhu wrote a book about her experiences in the police and spoke out in media interviews after the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving Met officer in March 2021. The Met, in the documents lodged with the Central London county court, alleges that the book breaches the agreement.</p> <p>The legal claim before the court is made by Nicholas Heavey, from the Met’s directorate of legal services. In the signed document, he says he is entitled to represent the Met and its commissioner, who is named as the claimant. The Met is seeking £60,000 plus 8% interest.</p> <p>The gagging clause forbade Sandhu from making “disparaging” or “derogatory” comments about the Met commissioner, or about the force itself. It also forbade Sandhu from discussing the discrimination she alleged she suffered during her service in the Met.</p> <p>The Met, in the court document, said Sandhu consulted a lawyer and agreed to the confidentiality clause. Then, when she was writing the book, she agreed to repay £60,000 of the total settlement to avoid the Met seeking to injunct publication with a court order.</p> <p>The Met goes on to say because that money has not been repaid, Britain’s biggest force will sue.</p> <p>In the sworn particulars of the claim, the Met highlights advertising used to sell the book from Amazon.</p> <p>It says Sandhu’s book reveals “incidents of racial and gender discrimination” and describes how she took a stand when she was falsely accused of wrongdoing.</p> <p>The Amazon blurb, cited by the Met to the court, reads: “Parm’s time on the force was chequered throughout with incidents of racial and gender discrimination … After deciding to make a stand, she found herself facing a spurious charge of gross misconduct. Black and Blue tells her shocking story and of her quest for justice in her police work and for herself.”</p> <p>In their court document, the Met lawyers say: “Publication of such material would have amounted to a breach of the confidentiality agreement owed by the defendant under the settlement agreement.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Met declined to comment or answer questions.</p> <p>The Guardian has been tracking the row between the Met and Sandhu for months. Earlier this year the Met was asked about use of NDAs. In an email response, it said: “No officer, when they leave the Met, whether they are dismissed or not, is asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement.”</p> <p>The same response was given by a spokesperson for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, earlier this year. He also has oversight for the force as the police and crime commissioner for London.</p> <p>After the new revelations were put to the mayor, a spokesperson said:<strong> </strong>“It is vital that Met staff and officers have the confidence to come forward and report any discrimination or harassment they suffer or are witness to.</p> <p>“The Mayor’s office for policing and crime is seeking information from the Metropolitan Police Service regarding their future use of settlement agreements, or confidentiality clauses, to ensure that officers are not unfairly silenced.”</p> <p>Employment lawyer Makbool Javaid said: “A confidentiality clause is an NDA. The purpose is that you are bound, by whatever is stated in the agreement, not to disclose certain things.”</p> <p>Former Met chief Brian Paddick, who now sits in the House of Lords for the Liberal Democrats, said: “It is clearly in the public interest and in the interest of the Met that evidence of racism and sexism is put into the public domain, so that lessons can be learned. The last thing the Met should be doing is trying to gag whistleblowers.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/21/she-disappears-or-goes-blank-like-garbo-the-enigma-of-tilda-swinton","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T11:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘She disappears or goes blank like Garbo’: the enigma of Tilda Swinton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/21/she-disappears-or-goes-blank-like-garbo-the-enigma-of-tilda-swinton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/21/she-disappears-or-goes-blank-like-garbo-the-enigma-of-tilda-swinton","fields":{"headline":"‘She disappears or goes blank like Garbo’: the enigma of Tilda Swinton","trailText":"The British actor’s new films show the full spectrum of her capabilities as the most unconventional of Hollywood A-listers","byline":"Guy Lodge","body":"<p>Oh noooooo,” said Tilda Swinton in a low, dolorous tone, eyes cast to the ground, as she was handed the Oscar for best supporting actress in February 2008.</p> <p>Those aren’t the words with which stars typically begin an acceptance speech on Tinseltown’s shiniest night – and sure enough, hers rallied from that muted beginning, via quirky, crowd-pleasing quips about George Clooney’s Batman and her agent’s arse, and closed with an exhilarated, “Thank you, thank you, thank you!”</p> <p>But for a brief second, the then 47-year-old British actor seemed almost apologetic, as if she’d crashed a party and hadn’t expected to be caught out.

Tall and physically startling, she had long held a reputation as one of the most gifted and fearless actors of her generation, but predominantly via projects that didn’t seem in any danger of breaking into the mainstream: entering the industry as a suitably avant-garde inspiration for Derek Jarman, she won best actress at Venice in 1991 for her rampantly sexualised interpretation of Isabella of France in his <em>Edward II, </em>and a year later turned further heads as Virginia Woolf’s gender-switching title character in Sally Potter’s film of <em>Orlando</em>. It wasn’t the first time she’d played with gender in performance: in 1987, her stage turn as a second world war widow assuming her husband’s identity in Manfred Karge’s <em>Man to Man</em> made enough of an impact to be filmed for the BBC’s ScreenPlay series a few years later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From the start, she knew film acting is a visual rather than literary job</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Cousins, film-maker and critic</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Swinton had no formal acting training, having read political science at Cambridge while dabbling in student drama and joining the Royal Shakespeare Company a year after graduating. But it was with Jarman, with whom she made nine films in eight years, that she found both her craft and her outsider identity.</p> <p>In a direct address to Jarman at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/aug/17/books.featuresreviews\" title=\"\">2002 Edinburgh Film Festival</a>, eight years after his death from Aids, she likened joining his company to joining the circus: “You were the first person I met who could gossip about St Thomas Aquinas and hold a steady camera at the same time, as you did at our first meeting.</p> <p>“Our outfit was an internationalist brigade. Decidedly pre-industrial. A little loud, a lot louche. Not always in the best possible taste. And not quite fit, though it saddened and maddened us to recognise it, for wholesome family entertainment.”</p> <p>Her first film role in 1986 was as the eponymous artist’s doomed lover in Jarman’s <em>Caravaggio</em>, the sensual intensity of her presence eclipsing the size of the part. Film-maker and critic Mark Cousins, later to be her close friend and collaborator, remembers the immediate impact of that first appearance: “Right from the start,” he told the <em>Observer</em>, “she knew that film acting is a visual rather than literary job.”</p> <p>When she entered US cinema in 1996, it wasn’t through Hollywood or even awards-baiting prestige cinema, but in Susan Streitfeld’s audacious, psychoanalysis-based erotic drama <em>Female Perversions</em>. These were not the choices of someone out to be the next Meryl Streep.</p> <p>In the earlier years of her career, either Swinton or casting directors (or perhaps both) were loath ever to see her as an everywoman. Critical descriptions of her work tend to hinge heavily on her extraordinary appearance, with her imposing height, pale, glass-cut features and (often as much on screen as in person) unusual, space-taking fashion sense often making viewers ascribe a certain cool, impermeable mystique to her work. If Swinton ever reads her publicity, she’s probably sick to death of words like “otherworldly,” “ethereal” or even “statuesque” – often a byword for women looking like supermodels. In Swinton’s case it casts her as walking sculpture, living art.</p> <p><em>New York Times</em> critic Vincent Canby was one of the few not to exoticise (or even alien-ise) Swinton like this. His review of<em> Orlando</em> – in which he forecast “a major international career” for her – noted that “she has a sweetness, gravity and intelligence about her that make the more bizarre events appear to be completely normal”.</p> <p>For Cousins, it is “because she leapfrogs over the conventional way of doing things” that the perceived enigma of Swinton has been created. “She’s like the Road Runner in Chuck Jones’s cartoons: ahead, outrunning Wile E Coyote, the obvious or middlebrow,” he says. “In real life she’s practical – she stacked my dishwasher well – but even chatting over breakfast her brain is speeding.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f50c19ca8288e32af37f0f68d38b367c143248c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f50c19ca8288e32af37f0f68d38b367c143248c/201_0_2859_1716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swinton with Idris Elba in the forthcoming Three Thousand Years of Longing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swinton with Idris Elba in the forthcoming Three Thousand Years of Longing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: United Artists/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, a screen presence that is consistently arresting is going to be noticed by bigger industry players. At the turn of the century, after a decade and a half of dazzling and flummoxing fringe audiences, she appeared as a charismatic cult leader in Danny Boyle’s much-ballyhooed <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/feb/11/culture.reviews\" title=\"\">The Beach</a></em>, a muddled adaptation of Alex Garland’s Gen-X bestseller that nonetheless felt stranger and more dangerous whenever she was on screen, commanding her minions with priestly assurance, and firmly coercing Leonardo DiCaprio’s character into having sex with her. </p> <p>For all its oddities, it was a hit, and suddenly Swinton was in Hollywood demand as a creepy supporting cypher, whether as a cold techno-dystopian functionary opposite Tom Cruise in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jan/25/culture.reviews\" title=\"\">Vanilla Sky</a> </em>(2001) or, a year later, as a brisk, soulless studio executive in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/28/artsfeatures3\" title=\"\">Spike Jonze’s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/28/artsfeatures3\" title=\"\">Adaptation</a></em> or, absurdly, as the vengeful Archangel Gabriel in the lavish Keanu Reeves nonsense<em> Constantine </em>(2005)<em>.</em> That same year, an appropriately icy turn as the White Witch in the blockbuster franchise-starter <em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em> made her a fixture in children’s nightmares for years to come – so much for being not quite fit for family entertainment. Still, she might have been even more frightening as a ruthlessly venal general counsel in the George Clooney legal thriller <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/28/georgeclooney.thriller\" title=\"\">Michael Clayton</a></em>, for which she won that once-improbable Oscar.</p> <p>Swinton’s ascent to the A-list, however, has come at no expense to her creative curiosity. For every <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em> instalment or Marvel product or big-name collaboration with David Fincher or the Coen Brothers on her latter-day CV, there’s been an unpredictable risk: playing high melodrama in perfect Italian for Luca Guadagnino’s 2010 in<em> </em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/08/i-am-love-review\" title=\"\">I Am Love</a></em>, collaborating with old schoolfriend Hogg on her reflexively autobiographical <em>Souvenir</em> films, finding an actorly state of being to match Weerasethakul’s experimental wavelength in <em>Memoria</em>.</p> <p>Now often saving her most stylised, playful work for the big genre films, she’s grown more human, more knowable, as a performer in the smaller projects. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/05/review-julia-tilda-swinton\" title=\"\">Erick Zonca’s 2008 </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/05/review-julia-tilda-swinton\" title=\"\">Julia</a></em>, she channels Gena Rowlands and gives what might be her best performance as an alcoholic trainwreck on a hopeless kidnap mission; in Lynne Ramsay’s 2011 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/20/we-need-to-talk-about-kevin-review\" title=\"\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></em>, she essays every parent’s worst nightmare as a mother who never finds a way to bond with her son. Her onscreen identity remains mutable but vividly eccentric – enough so that her own unconventional personal life has never dominated conversations about her. Even suggestions she at one point shared a home and a menage a trois with her former partner, playwright John Byrne (who has denied this was ever the case), and her present one, artist Sandro Kopp, did not become a subject of tabloid fixation. For Swinton, it’s merely part of a complex picture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/16/all-tilda-swintons-performances-ranked\">Tilda Swinton’s performances – ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This year, she’ll give us the full spectrum of her capabilities: she’s dreamily heightened, her emotions writ large, in <em>Three Thousand Years of Longing</em><em>; The Eternal Daughter</em>, set to be unveiled at Venice next month, promises quiet contemplation; you need only hear her name in connection with <em>Pinocchio</em> to guess that she’s voicing the Blue Fairy. Beyond that, her to-do list includes new films with Fincher and documentarian Joshua Oppenheimer in his first fiction outing: she remains the auteur’s choice, though her career never feels authored by them.</p> <p>I ask Cousins if he believes in the concept as actor as auteur, and if Swinton is one. He’s not sure. “You could say that all Marlon Brando films are Brando films, because of his presence and atmosphere, but I think Tilda is different,” he says. “People of course build films around her because of the scale of her talent, but she also likes to disappear in a film, or to go blank like Garbo goes blank at the end of<em> Queen </em><em>Christina</em>. With Tilda you often don’t get big crescendos of acting: you get a dissolution, a void.”</p> <p>For one of the most recognisable faces in the medium, shape-shifting has become a signature.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/21/the-rise-of-the-side-hustle-gen-z-entrepreneurs-are-turning-their-backs-on-9-to-5s","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T11:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘I’m gonna have to make my own money’: the rise of the side hustle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/21/the-rise-of-the-side-hustle-gen-z-entrepreneurs-are-turning-their-backs-on-9-to-5s","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/21/the-rise-of-the-side-hustle-gen-z-entrepreneurs-are-turning-their-backs-on-9-to-5s","fields":{"headline":"‘I’m gonna have to make my own money’: the rise of the side hustle","trailText":"Gen Z entrepreneurs are turning their backs on office 9-5s and promoting their personal passions into full-time jobs. By Sam Parker","byline":"Sam Parker","body":"<p>In 2010, not long into my first job on a magazine now in the great magazine graveyard in the sky, a fellow junior and I were appraising the performance of a new intern. Fresh out of university, this person had arrived late and then suggested they conduct the celebrity interview for the next issue. “That’s the thing with these young ones coming through now,” my colleague said with a solemn shake of their head, “they just don’t want to put the graft in.”</p> <p>Twelve years later and society is in a moment of transformation when it comes to work and our attitudes towards it. The Great Resignation – or at least the Great Thinking About Resignation – is upon us. The Covid pandemic smashed through many of the grand narratives we have passed down for generations about having a job: the need to be present in an office, the idea we are somehow indispensable to the wider machine we are operating in.</p> <p>For older people already in charge, this meant scrambling to adjust the modern workplace to be more flexible and inclusive in the hope this would keep the young people in their organisations happy. But Generation Z already had other ideas. It’s not just that many of them entered the workplace in the era of Covid. It’s that they had already watched my generation – the pitiful Millennials – get sucked into a broken social contract, the one that promised if you found a good job and worked hard, you’d get ahead. They saw us stifled and infantilised by two recessions, mired in existential despair about the housing crisis and now vulnerable again as the cost of living crisis asserts its grip.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can wake up tomorrow and say: ‘You know what, I’m really not feeling great, I can take this day off and chill’</p> <footer> <cite>Adwoa Owusu-Darko</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gen Z stand up to their employers in a way no previous generation has, something usually dismissed as a spoiled sense of entitlement. But in record numbers, they are also mobilising to establish incomes that don’t rely on their elders. They’re drop shipping, Amazon reselling, flipping designer sneakers, spread betting, investing in crypto and NFTs. They’re inventing their own cosmetic lines for TikTok, or selling homemade teeth grills on Instagram. They want to be famous on social media not just because it feels good but because they can monetise it in shrewd ways.</p> <p>Some people call it a new golden age of entrepreneurialism, others the rise of the side hustle. But at the core of Gen Z’s attitude to work is a desire as old as capitalism itself – to be financially independent, to opt out of old-fashioned ideas, like having a boss, altogether. All of which begs the question: is the problem that they have unrealistic expectations and don’t want to put the graft in? Or do they – gulp – know something we don’t?</p> <p>In 2014, when Adwoa Owusu-Darko was 15 and working in a greetings card shop, she’d buy new outfits rather than waste her wages on alcohol. “I wanted to look cool on non-uniform days,” she says, “but it wasn’t very practical. I was buying things I’d wear once, or that were ill-fitting and not really me.”</p> <p>Then, in 2016, a friend mentioned she’d sold a pair of dungarees on an app called <a href=\"https://www.depop.com/\" title=\"\">Depop</a>, a social e-commerce platform where people were offloading unwanted clothes. Inspired to clear some space, Adwoa got out a camera.</p> <p>“I decided to model, but I was uncomfortable showing my face,” she says. The solution she came up with – taking shots with the camera held in front of her face – became her signature aesthetic, different from the crumpled flatlays or limp coat-hanger shots elsewhere on the app. Soon Adwoa was being featured on Depop’s hallowed Explore page and, at 18, her store, Mini’s World, was born.</p> <p>Depop is a proudly young space, with 90% of its active users under 26. It taps into many of the values cherished by Gen Z: sustainability, authenticity and the chance to buy from influencers rather than faceless corporations. Adwoa was able to support herself through university without needing a conventional job. An appearance on Channel 4’s <em>Supershoppers</em> saw Mini’s World take off and now she has a second business as a consultant helping other Depop sellers get started.</p> <p>In May this year, <em>Elite Business</em> magazine published a report claiming that Gen Z entrepreneurs are leading the post-Covid recovery in the UK. It found that among the country’s sole traders, those from Gen Z are the only age group to have experienced annual increases in revenue during the pandemic. Despite this, one crucial distinction between Gen Z and previous generations may be how they measure success. After growing her business over lockdown, Adwoa – now 24 – took the decision to press pause.</p> <p>“Towards the end of 2021, my mental health really suffered,” she says. “Even though I was doing well financially, I decided to downscale. I think Gen Z put a lot of emphasis on wellbeing and mental health, and being in an environment that really serves them. It is important to be mentally and financially stable, and one should not cost the other.</p> <p>“I can wake up tomorrow and say: ‘You know what, I’m really not feeling great, I can take this day off and chill.’ Then the next day I can scale up and work from midnight to 5am if I want to. That is what gives me quality of life. That’s something to aspire to.”</p> <p>Even prior to Covid, a 2018 report from Reading Business School had declared this the “age of the side hustle”, claiming it generates £72bn for the UK, or about 3.6% of GDP. And 16 to 24-year-olds are leading the charge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aee9910dd592ada6b036a22b0c00d5b677e89e05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aee9910dd592ada6b036a22b0c00d5b677e89e05/0_563_8368_5021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I’ve always been kind of obsessed with money’: Jack Calvert, 20, from Middlesbrough, who posts advice online about affiliate marketing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’ve always been kind of obsessed with money’: Jack Calvert, 20, from Middlesbrough, who posts advice online about affiliate marketing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Scrolling through the</strong></em> TikTok hashtags of #hustle and #sidehustle, where countless creators – mostly young men – post updates about their quest for financial freedom, I came across Jack Calvert from Middlesbrough. He was discussing something called the <a href=\"https://hustlers-university.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hustler’s University</a>, an online course currently at the centre of controversy and feverish debate: does it truly unlock the secrets to getting rich from your laptop, or is it best avoided?</p> <p>“I’ve always been kind of obsessed with money,” Jack, 20, tells me. “When I was a kid I used to sell raffle tickets to my family and pick a random toy from my bedroom as the prize.” He also tried – unsuccessfully – to make money online from streaming his Fifa sessions on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\" title=\"\">Twitch</a> and YouTube</p> <p>Then, over lockdown, Jack – a year into an accountancy degree – got interested in the murky world of affiliate marketing. He says the method he used involved building a mailing list of email addresses via social media, then spamming them with other offers for various deals around the internet which, in turn, gave him a small referral fee should they make a purchase. Basically, the next time you get an email from an unfamiliar account promising “AMAZING IPAD DEALS”, it may well be a teenager in Teesside trying to launch their business empire.</p> <p>Jack’s TikTok posts about passive income and affiliate marketing and various other digital buzzwords were averaging 400-500 views. In that time, he says, he made a total of £700 profit. But when he started posting about Hustler’s University, his views shot up, with some reaching hundreds of thousands. Since then he has started regularly going on TikTok live streams fielding questions from other would-be hustlers curious to know whether they should pay £39 a month to unlock Hustler’s University secrets.</p> <p>So what are these secrets? Hustler’s University is an online academy that offers a series of lessons on things such as crypto investing, drop shipping and copywriting. Information on these topics is not hard to track down for free online, but what you get with Hustler’s University is an incentive to convince others to follow you: Jack, like all members, gets a 48% cut.</p> <p>“The referrals were never the original goal, they’re kind of a happy bonus,” Jack insists, and so far he says he is sticking to his word by giving people an honest account of the programme’s merits. “I try to give a fair reflection. I always say: ‘It’s working fine for me, but it may not be worth it for you.’ Obviously you do get a lot of people falsely promoting it and claiming it’s going to be better than it is, which is quite scummy,” says Jack. “Though the course itself tells you not to do that.”</p> <p>It may well, but one of the reasons Hustler’s University is so popular is that it is owned by Andrew Tate, a 35-year-old former British-American kickboxer, subject of an <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/06/andrew-tate-violent-misogynistic-world-of-tiktok-new-star\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/06/andrew-tate-violent-misogynistic-world-of-tiktok-new-star\" title=\"\"> investigation</a> recently. Tate was ejected from <em>Big Brother</em> in 2016 after a video of him beating a woman came to light, although they both denied any abuse occurred and claimed it was harmless consensual roleplay. He now uses his Instagram feed to post pictures of himself with supercars and piles of money while promising followers they can achieve the same lifestyle. Tate is currently TikTok catnip where he posts a seemingly endless line of controversial soundbites ranging from why depression doesn’t exist to the various reasons women should be subservient to men. Whether he is truly the epitome of toxic masculinity or just putting it on for views is a subject for debate, but for many of the people giving him £39 a month in the hope it’ll make their wildest dreams come true, it’s beside the point.</p> <p>When we spoke, after two months of spending an hour or two a day following the secrets of Hustler’s University, Jack says he has made only £2,000. But he insists he is learning useful skills and will focus on video game design and fashion next.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4569b767088efdf8b02285c0398e18ce7aea3dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4569b767088efdf8b02285c0398e18ce7aea3dd/0_201_4724_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I’m gonna have to make my own money’: Ben Towers, who started his business aged 11, and sold it in 2017 in a merger that made him a millionaire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It’s a fight or flight idea: I’m gonna have to fight’: Ben Towers, who started his business aged 11, and sold it in 2017 in a merger that made him a millionaire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Cresswell/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>If the tools Gen Z</strong></em> are using feel alien, the qualities that make a truly successful entrepreneur perhaps haven’t changed all that much. Ben Towers started his business aged 11 helping one of his mum’s friends make a website.</p> <p>It was 2010 and Ben was given £50 for his efforts. Thrilled, he took his new skillset and tapped into the-then burgeoning online freelance world, helping more hapless boomers who wanted to keep pace with the digital age. He was so successful that his mother became nervous about the money he was making and insisted he hire a lawyer and an accountant.</p> <p>“Eventually, I started moving more into marketing, because once these businesses had their website, they then wanted to know how to get people to visit them.” By the time he was 14, he was subcontracting other remote freelancers to help him manage the workload alongside his school work. At 17, he quit school early, employing himself as an apprentice to meet the criteria for doing so. By 18, he had scaled his business, Towers Design, to a team of 26. In 2017 he sold it in a merger that made him a millionaire.</p> <p>Articulate, modest and polite, Ben, now 24, is often used as a poster boy for Gen Z entrepreneurialism in the UK. Ironically, for someone who never had much interest in joining a traditional workplace, his new venture Tahora, which he co-founded, helps big businesses such as Google, Natwest and the RSPCA make their workplaces more inclusive and appealing for younger workers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My generation has been exposed to a level of information that society has never seen before</p> <footer> <cite>Ben Towers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a sense, Ben is repeating the same trick that got him started at 11 by exploiting a knowledge gap between him and an older generation. In 2010, it was every business owner wanting a Facebook page; today, it’s that they want help satisfying a generation of employees who demand more than a salary and paid holiday. Get your workplace culture wrong – as a <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/business/gen-z-workplace-culture.html\" title=\"\">New York Times</a></em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/business/gen-z-workplace-culture.html\" title=\"\"> article from 2021</a> with the chilling title “The 37-Year-Olds Are Afraid of the 23-Year-Olds Who Work for Them” pointed out – and Gen Z will say: “Actually, we can leave and do whatever we want.”</p> <p>Interestingly, Ben attributes this appetite for independence among his generation not to their aptitude for the internet as much as the sense of panic it has helped instil in them. “My generation has been exposed to a level of information that society has never seen before,” he says. “It used to be that you’d read a paper or sit down and watch the news once in the evening; now we open our phones 60 times a day. I think our experience of fake news has led us to just go: ‘I don’t trust the world, I’m not gonna get any opportunities coming my way.’ It’s a fight or flight idea: I’m gonna have to fight, I’m gonna have to make my own money.”</p> <p>Adwoa, Jack and Ben all say they have benefited from relatively comfortable and supportive upbringings and that hustle culture can be dangerous for those who are less fortunate, or just naive. “The average entrepreneur earns less than the minimum wage,” Ben warns. “The vast majority do it because they love the challenge. For me, that’s very different to people who are just desperate to have the entrepreneur lifestyle.”</p> <p>Talking to young people who are finding their own ways through the traditional career path – or just ignoring it altogether – is inspiring, but you also can’t help but feel angry on their behalf. I graduated during the 2007 recession, but spent my childhood cocooned in the 90s; Gen Z grew up witnessing the harsh realities of austerity, the housing crisis and spiralling personal debt – and had to be the first to navigate social media as children.</p> <p>Rather than be broken by all of this, many have found creative ways to turn their digital nativism to their advantage and have embraced a concept we only pay lip service to – work-life balance – as a true ambition.</p> <p>The more you see the world from Gen Z’s perspective, the more you realise how ridiculous it is to expect them to tackle the challenges we left behind by working tirelessly and without complaint for one corporation or another, hoping it’ll all be OK. They’re far too shrewd, too determined, too hopeful for that. Maybe we should be taking notes.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/21/vivek-singh-secret-ingredient-sattu-roasted-chickpea-flour","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T11:00:06Z","webTitle":"Vivek Singh’s secret ingredient: sattu","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/21/vivek-singh-secret-ingredient-sattu-roasted-chickpea-flour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/21/vivek-singh-secret-ingredient-sattu-roasted-chickpea-flour","fields":{"headline":"Vivek Singh’s secret ingredient: sattu","trailText":"The Indian chef and owner of the Cinnamon Club restaurant on the one ingredient his father couldn’t do without","byline":"Interview by Molly Tait-Hyland","body":"<p>When my father lived away from home, he would often completely live on sattu (roasted chickpea flour), partly because it travels well and is versatile - and because he didn’t have much else. He would have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In the morning, he made lassi or smoothies with it, just adding water or yoghurt. In the afternoon, he kneaded it into a dough.</p> <p>There was more cooking involved in the evening; the sattu was seasoned with onion, chillies and the oil from the pickle – this makes a very nice spicy filling that goes inside a dough ball called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/22/indian-city-cow-dung-ban-leaves-bitter-taste-for-street-food-vendors-bihar\">litti chokha</a></em>.

Scottish playwright David Greig follows the example of some of the mythographers, historians, archaeologists, poets and musicians cited by the book’s author, Charlotte Higgins: he plugs wide gaps between facts with imaginative projections.</p> <p>In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/24/under-another-sky-charlotte-higgins-review\">Under Another Sky: Journeys in Roman Britain</a></em>, Higgins mentions in passing that on her research trips to sites around the UK, she was sometimes driven by her boyfriend, Matthew, in his battered VW camper van. Greig makes this scant piece of information the basis for a road trip romcom featuring highly fictionalised versions of the real people – as Higgins makes clear in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/09/my-life-was-turned-into-a-romcom-how-our-arts-writer-became-the-lead-character-in-a-new-play\">an article about the play</a> written for our sister paper the <em>Guardian</em>, of which she is chief culture critic.</p> <p>The initial effect is charming. Pitlochry’s outdoor amphitheatre, surrounded by trees, is appropriately atmospheric. Director and designer Elizabeth Newman’s staging is playful: the actors transform bed and bookcase into the rickety van that also doubles as Boudicca’s chariot (“I’ll just nip to Halfords to get swords for the wheels,” says Matthew). Amelia Donkor’s Charlotte and Keith Macpherson’s Matthew are both engaging as they mimic gladiators, encounter a contemporary Roman soldier who teaches today’s children ancient battle techniques, learn from a builder how he recreated an ancient mosaic and so on.</p> <p>As the action progresses, though, no drama develops; nothing is at stake. We know from the start that Charlotte’s book will be finished and published; the relationship between her and Matthew is almost always amiable. True, a disagreement over Dido’s Lament from Purcell’s opera <em>Dido and Aeneas</em> is followed by a parting of the ways, but the separation is geographical rather than emotional, as classicist Matthew takes up his new professorial post at the University of Glasgow. Like Matthew’s VW van, the two-hander, if not entirely fit for purpose, does move. </p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://pitlochryfestivaltheatre.com/whats-on/under-another-sky/\">At the Pitlochy Festival theatre until 23 September</a></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/21/my-old-school-review-deft-documentary-on-a-notorious-schoolboy-imposter-brandon-lee-alan-cumming","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T10:30:06Z","webTitle":"My Old School review – deft documentary on a notorious schoolboy imposter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/21/my-old-school-review-deft-documentary-on-a-notorious-schoolboy-imposter-brandon-lee-alan-cumming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/21/my-old-school-review-deft-documentary-on-a-notorious-schoolboy-imposter-brandon-lee-alan-cumming","fields":{"headline":"My Old School review – deft documentary on a notorious schoolboy imposter","trailText":"Animation, interviews and a lip-syncing Alan Cumming tell the true tale of a grown man who passed himself off as a pupil at a Glasgow high school","byline":"Wendy Ide","body":"<p>One of those improbable tales that seem almost too weird to be true, the story of Brandon Lee, the unusually mature 16-year-old student transferred to Bearsden Academy in Glasgow in 1993, holds an enduring fascination for his fellow students.

It also illustrates the nation’s shift away from <em>regulating </em>businesses to <em>subsidizing </em>businesses.</p> <p>From 1932 through the late 1970s, the government mainly regulated businesses. This was the era of the alphabet soup of regulatory agencies begun under Franklin D Roosevelt (the SEC, ICC, FCC, CAB, and so on) culminating in the EPA of 1970.</p> <p>The government still regulates businesses, of course, but the biggest thing the federal government now does with businesses is subsidize them.</p> <p>Consider Joe Biden’s biggest first-term accomplishments:</p> <ul> <li><p>the Chips and Science Act (with $52bn of subsidies to semiconductor firms, plus another $24bn in manufacturing tax credits);</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ($550bn of new spending on railroads, broadband and the electric grid, among other things);</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>and now the Inflation Reduction Act (including the subsidies I noted).</p></li> </ul> <p>This shift from regulation to subsidy has characterized every recent administration.</p> <p>Trump’s Operation Warp Speed delivered $10bn of subsidies to Covid vaccine manufacturers.</p> <p>Obama’s Affordable Care Act subsidized the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries (indirectly, through massive subsidies to the buyers of healthcare and pharmaceuticals).</p> <p>And Obama spent about <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/heres-how-much-2008-bailouts-really-cost\">$489bn</a> bailing out the financial industry (and, notably, never fully restored financial regulations that previous administrations had repealed), as well as GM and Chrysler.</p> <p>Before the 1980s, the US would have done all this differently. Instead of <em>subsidizing </em>broadband, semiconductors, energy companies, vaccine manufacturers, health care and pharmaceutical businesses, and the financial sector, we would have <em>regulated</em> them – requiring them to act in various ways.</p> <p>If this regulatory alternative seems far-fetched today, that’s because of how far we’ve come from the regulatory state of the 1930s to the 1970s, to the subsidy state beginning in the 1980s.</p> <p>Why the big shift? Because of the change in the balance of power between large corporations and the government.</p> <p>Today it’s politically difficult, if not impossible, for government to demand that corporations (and their shareholders) bear the costs of public goods. Government must bribe them instead.</p> <p>I saw this first-hand. Bill Clinton’s healthcare plan was blocked by the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, which would have had to sacrifice some profits.</p> <p>By contrast, Obama got the Affordable Care Act by paying off these industries – all but guaranteeing them larger profits from a massive inflow of newly subsidized customers.</p> <p>Spending by corporations on lobbying increased from $1.44bn in 1999 to $3.77bn in 2021 and is on track to exceed $4bn this year.</p> <p>This tidal wave of corporate money has occurred at the same time large American corporations have globalized, to the point where many are able to play off the United States against other nations – demanding government subsidies in return for creating jobs and doing their cutting-edge research in America.</p> <p>The new Chips Act shows how powerful and highly profitable semiconductor manufacturers, such as US-based Intel, can extract billions of dollars in a global shakedown for where they’ll make semiconductor chips.</p> <p>In the 1980s, yours truly was involved in a national debate over “industrial policy”. The question, put simply, was whether the government should subsidize certain industries that generate large social benefits in the form of new technologies.</p> <p>I argued that the government was already engaged in a hidden industrial policy, disguised, for example, as grants to the aerospace and telecom industries by the Department of Defense and to the pharmaceutical industry by the National Institutes of Health. It would be far better to do industrial policy in the open, so that the public could assess what it was paying for and what it was getting in return.</p> <p>Opponents, which included just about every Republican, were indignant at the very idea that government ought to be “intruding” on their blessed free market.</p> <p>Today’s subsidies are far larger, and even supported by Republicans.</p> <p>Republican senator John Cornyn, arguing for the Chips Act, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/08/01/industrial-policy-comeback-00048799\">said</a>, “What we are doing is industrial policy unlike people of my free-market background have done before.”</p> <p>In truth, the three decades-long shift in power to big corporations has transformed industrial policy into a system for bribing them to do the sorts of things government once demanded they do as the price for being part of the American system.</p> <ul> <li><p>Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley and the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/saving-capitalism-for-the-many-not-the-few/9780345806222\">Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-common-good-9780525436379/9780525436379\">The Common Good</a>.

It was so dark and caramelly and the spicing was euphoric, while the fragrant and gentle moju washed the heat away. There is space now for Sri Lankan stories to be told – you may not have found that as commonly in the past. And Paradise is unapologetically Sri Lankan. It tells a unique immigrant story and eating there is a real education. You feel enriched by the experience. I’ve been dreaming of it ever since.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.chishuru.com/\" title=\"\">Chishuru</a>, London SW9</h2> <p><em>Chosen by Shuko Oda, co-founder and executive chef, Koya, London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f1335a93f4cfd2482caf7a2ea49aa7f5c3d36d8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1335a93f4cfd2482caf7a2ea49aa7f5c3d36d8f/0_818_8941_5366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adejoké Bakare, chef-owner of the West African restaurant Chishuru, in Brixton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adejoké Bakare, chef-owner of the West African restaurant Chishuru, in Brixton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amit Lennon/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chishuru in Brixton Market serves West African cuisine and is run by a female chef, Adejoké Bakare. I don’t know too much about West African food, but whenever I go, it reminds me of Japanese food. Last time, the set lunch started with a savoury bean cake served with pumpkin-seed tapenade and a scotch bonnet sauce. It’s quite a kick to start your meal, but wasabi has a similar effect. The main dish was grilled mackerel with a pickle and rice on the side – again so familiar and comforting to me. I’ve been back many times. A casual and delicious way of eating is really what I appreciate now, rather than menus with lots of courses, and Chishuru does that so well.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.cafececilia.com/\" title=\"\">Cafe Cecilia</a>, London E8</h2> <p><em>Chosen by Erchen Chang, creative director</em><em> and co-founder, Bao, London</em></p> <p>Cafe Cecilia, off Broadway Market, is about simple, no-fuss cooking. The chef, Max Rocha, worked at St John and the River Cafe, and those influences are in his food and in the elegance of the room, but you can feel his Irish heritage coming through too. It’s casual but you feel properly looked after. Last time I went, I had monkfish with monk’s beard and clams – simple, beautifully cooked. Another time, I had the onglet with chips, which feels like a holiday classic on a hot day, sitting outside overlooking the canal with an icy cocktail. The Guinness bread ice-cream is one of my favourites. Comforting food is what’s needed right now, and Cafe Cecilia does it really well.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/18/grace-dent-the-plimsoll-london-n4-nostalgia-simplicity-and-brazen-oddness-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">The Plimsoll</a>, London N4</h2> <p><em>Chosen by James Cochran, head chef, 12:51, London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b76ad4aeb9d13eebe9722dcac48a9f949a5549b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b76ad4aeb9d13eebe9722dcac48a9f949a5549b5/1116_31_3516_3516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ricotta cheesecake at the Plimsoll, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ricotta cheesecake at the Plimsoll, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think the British pub has lost its identity. Everywhere is trying to be a gastropub, and too much money is spent on decor. The Plimsoll is a local tucked away down the back streets of Finsbury Park, with the smoky feel of an old-style pub. There are informal barstools, the decor has a 1960s/70s vibe. Originally, the chefs, Jamie Allan and Ed McIlroy [AKA Four Legs], were at the Compton Arms in Highbury. The burgers there were absolutely banging, and they’ve kept them on the menu here. It’s classic British pub food – they might have a lasagne, or fish and chips, or a prawn cocktail. It brings back a lot of memories of when I was a child meeting my grandparents down the pub. It’s hearty food executed really well in this little hidden gem.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.wtlgi.co/yellowhammer\" title=\"\">Yellowhammer</a>, Stockport, Greater Manchester</h2> <p><em>Chosen by Mary-Ellen McTague, chef</em><em>-patron, The Creameries, Manchester</em></p> <p>Yellowhammer is a new bakery, deli and pottery studio in Stockport. It’s co-run by Sam Buckley, whose restaurant Where the Light Gets In is upstairs. Everything about Where the Light Gets In is done to such a high level, with a huge amount of thought and care, and the same applies at Yellowhammer. It serves bread, buns and coffee during the day, and wine and small bites at night. The produce is everything: really beautiful vegetables from its nearby growing project, The Landing, regeneratively farmed meat, fish from day boats. And the bread is stunning. Stockport feels like it’s having a bit of a revival, but really it’s not a particularly well-off area, so to open a restaurant there – and now this bakery and deli – was quite bold.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.hernrestaurant.com/\" title=\"\">Hern</a>, Chapel Allerton, Leeds</h2> <p><em>Chosen by </em><em>Alisdair Brooke-Taylor</em><em>, chef, The Moorcock Inn, Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02e49d9b486ffc7b89c2c9480cdef1a9689372a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02e49d9b486ffc7b89c2c9480cdef1a9689372a9/0_271_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chef Rab Adams in his restaurant Hern in Chapel Allerton in Leeds,west Yorkshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rab Adams, chef-owner of Hern in Leeds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This tiny neighbourhood restaurant on the outskirts of Leeds is a humble place but the skill level is really high. There’s just one person cooking and one person at the front, with a four-course set menu at £40. The cooking is modern but often takes inspiration from old recipes, like tomatoes cooked in cream, served with herbs and croutons. Goddamn, it’s delicious. I go all the time and I’ve never had a bad plate, and some of the dishes are pinch-yourself good. You just think: “Why aren’t there more places like this?”</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.upstairs.restaurant/\" title=\"\">Upstairs by Tom Shepherd</a>, Lichfield, Staffordshire</h2> <p><em>Chosen by Gareth Ward, chef-patron, Ynyshir, </em><em>Wales</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"433f405a7c1fabfe680362dfd5232d10ad8c9a45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/433f405a7c1fabfe680362dfd5232d10ad8c9a45/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The kitchen at Upstairs by Tom Shepherd, in Lichfield, Staffordshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The kitchen at Upstairs by Tom Shepherd, in Lichfield, Staffordshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Video Box Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tom Shepherd’s dad has a jewellers in Lichfield. There was an empty space upstairs so he gave it to his son to turn into a restaurant. It really stands out in the town – it feels like you’re entering a different world. Shepherd is classically trained (he used to work for Sat Bains and Michael Wignall). He’s very much his own chef, cooking what he wants rather than trying to cater for local tastes. One of my favourite courses was the red cabbage gazpacho. And he’s got a really nice Thai green curry dessert, which I loved. It’s a good sign that places like this are opening in towns like Lichfield – it probably wouldn’t have happened so easily five or 10 years ago.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.cafe-deco.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cafe Deco</a>, London WC1</h2> <p><em>Chosen by </em><em>Stosie Madi,</em><em> chef and co-owner, The Parker’s Arms, Newton-in-Bowland, Lancashire</em></p> <p>Anna Tobias (<em>see interview, p37</em>) opened Cafe Deco just after the first lockdown and I went as soon as I could. There’s a familiarity to her cooking that really attracts me. It’s very seasonal. It’s very underdressed, but it’s perfectly dressed. Anna does the classics in a modern way, but does not overfuss. One of my favourite dishes of hers is an egg with mayonnaise piped on top in the very classic French way. She does that in different guises throughout the seasons. I also love when she does cold sliced meats with very autumnal salads – a delicious northern European lunch. Her desserts are not very blousy, but actually the simplicity is beautiful. And she makes delicious pies, and I love anybody who makes a pie.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.apricityrestaurant.com/\" title=\"\">Apricity</a>, London W1</h2> <p><em>Chosen by Asma Khan, founder, Darjeeling Express, London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"24361f3ced9a9aebe97cc90b35df7b16d0237225\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24361f3ced9a9aebe97cc90b35df7b16d0237225/182_768_3197_3194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miso roasted cabbage, smoked hemp cream, molasses at Apricity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miso roasted cabbage, smoked hemp cream, molasses at Apricity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chantelle Nicholson’snew restaurant, Apricity, is female-owned and 75% of the kitchen staff is female. The emphasis is on regionality, on sustainability, on zero waste, but without all the shrill tones and preachiness. The menu prioritises plant-based food, but there is also meat and fish on the menu. We started with something called the wasted dip, made with leftover vegetables. It was both sweet and savoury, every bite was different. I just thought it was so clever, and great value at £2. The asparagus with slow-cooked egg was wonderful and very seasonal, and the beef ribs were fabulous. I usually can’t stand lettuce, but the butterhead lettuce salad with miso and crispy kale was really nice. The time has come for chefs to talk about the politics of food, and at Apricity there are discussions of environment and justice and equality, <em>and</em> there’s great food and a beautiful, laid-back atmosphere.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.slowburn.london/\" title=\"\">SlowBurn</a>, London E17</h2> <p><em>Chosen by </em><em>Akwasi Brenya-Mensa</em><em>, chef-patron, Tatale, London</em></p> <p>SlowBurn started as a pop-up when everybody was pivoting in lockdown and doing something different to keep the lights on. It’s in a denim factory. When you walk in, you’re kind of confused at first because there are mannequins and sewing machines everywhere, but then you go through and the restaurant’s at the back. That gives it a real wow factor. It’s a vegetable-focused restaurant with meat on the side. I really liked the black bean gyoza taco, and the aubergine chermoula with spiced chickpeas and sheep’s ricotta. I spoke very briefly to the chef, Chavdar Todorov. He seems to be drawing influences from various places and from his travels, much in the way that I do. It is doing great food, but in terms of the location, I don’t think there are many experiences like that in the whole of London. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/21/jennette-mccurdy-icarly-trauma-memoir-mum-child-stars","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T10:00:06Z","webTitle":"Trauma memoir puts spotlight on mums turning daughters into child stars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/21/jennette-mccurdy-icarly-trauma-memoir-mum-child-stars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/21/jennette-mccurdy-icarly-trauma-memoir-mum-child-stars","fields":{"headline":"Trauma memoir puts spotlight on mums turning daughters into child stars","trailText":"In a new book, ‘iCarly’ star Jennette McCurdy reveals how being pushed into acting by her mother at six led to anxiety and self-loathing","byline":"Edward Helmore","body":"<p>Childhood stardom and the spectre of the “stage mom” are the focus of a US summer publishing sensation that – in short, punchy sentences delivered with a high level of self-perception – could transform the trauma memoir business.</p> <p>Jennette McCurdy’s <em>I’m Glad My Mom Died</em> has sold around 200,000 copies since its release less than two weeks ago, according to publisher Simon &amp; Schuster.

The pair bonded over shared eating disorders. But when the child star told her mother that she didn’t want to act any more, Debra became hysterical and burst into tears. “You can’t quit! This was our chance! This was ouuuuur chaaaaance!” her mother yelled.</p> <p>In 2013, Debra died from cancer. “I don’t know who I am without her because I was living for her, and now she’s dead,” McCurdy told <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/jennette-mccurdy-memoir-1.6551754\" title=\"\">Canada’s CBC this week</a>.</p> <p>“I couldn’t face this at the time, but there was some relief there.”</p> <p>But the book, and the reception it has received, could return the focus of the trauma narratives to the mother and create new demand for mother-daughter accounts.</p> <p>“The public zeitgeist may have turned,” says Michael Kinsey at Black Cat Books on New York’s Shelter Island. “From a publisher’s point of view, this will now become its own subgenre. Trust me, when there’s one hit, another publisher has another version of the same story ready to go.”</p> <p>Black Cat sales assistant Tatum Kosow, 19, an <em>iCarly</em> and <em>Sam and Cat</em> fan a decade ago, said: “It’s harder to read about a mother and daughter because mums are supposed to be maternal. The abuse feels psychological.”</p> <p>According to psychoanalyst Dr Jamieson Webster the return to a focus on the mother may correspond to a waning of the patriarchy. “It throws you back on the question of the maternal and it’s not necessarily a nice place either,” she said.</p> <p>“It’s not like you go from worse to something better; it’s like you go from worse to even worse, or that’s the way Lacan put it,” she said, referring to Jacques Lacan, the French psychoanalyst who wrote <em>The Father Or Worse</em>. “The mother who uses her daughter for money and fame. How can a child really say what they want? So we’re back to blaming the mum, but that’s not going to get us anywhere.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/21/games-of-thrones-effect-fires-up-reissues-of-lost-fantasy-fiction-classics","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T10:00:06Z","webTitle":"Game of Thrones effect fires up reissues of ‘lost’ fantasy fiction classics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/21/games-of-thrones-effect-fires-up-reissues-of-lost-fantasy-fiction-classics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/21/games-of-thrones-effect-fires-up-reissues-of-lost-fantasy-fiction-classics","fields":{"headline":"Game of Thrones effect fires up reissues of ‘lost’ fantasy fiction classics","trailText":"With big-budget TV series about to hit streaming services, publishers hope a string of cult novels will find a new audience","byline":"David Barnett","body":"<p>It is a lyrical, beautiful fantasy story about a mythical beast who sets out on a quest into a world that no longer believes in her to find out if she is truly the last of her kind.</p> <p>Published in 1968, <em>The Last Unicorn</em> by Peter S Beagle spawned an animated movie 40 years ago and is a cherished novel that appeals to children and adults alike.

This “cursed earth” theme is a central idea in numerous creepy movies, but one that has gained traction with the rise of folk horror: it’s central to the wigged-out witchery of Ben Wheatley’s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/20/in-the-earth-review-ben-wheatley\">In the Earth</a></em>, and to the pastoral menace of a host of new Irish horror pictures. But with his bracingly gory Welsh-language feature debut, Lee Haven Jones presents another angle. Sure, there is something uncommonly unpleasant that rests beneath “the Rise”, the wild land that the superstitious local farmers refuse to cultivate. But the real monsters, arguably, are the affluent family whose opulent modernist new-build is the film’s location, and the smirking, ferret-faced business adviser who has helped them pillage the land for short-term gain.</p> <p><em>The Feast</em> requires a degree of commitment; it avoids jump scares in favour of a long, slow build of tension – so slow that at times the characters appear to be in the grip of a kind of paralysis – that pays off with an explosively grisly final act. Glenda (Nia Roberts) and her local MP husband, Gwyn (Julian Lewis Jones), are hosting a dinner party. The guests include the couple’s two dysfunctional sons and a neighbouring farmer’s wife. First to arrive, however, is the hired help. Cadi (Annes Elwy) is wild-eyed and traumatised, with sodden hair and a tendency to tread mud across the pristine poured concrete floor. The family might be too self-absorbed to spot the writing on the wall, but the emphatic plotting and pointed shots of axes leave few surprises for the audience.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPOTraOsGLY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jPOTraOsGLY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPOTraOsGLY\">Watch a trailer for The Feast.</a></figcaption> </figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/21/seven-big-books-autumn-2022-maggie-ofarrell-cormac-mccarthy","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"Seven big-hitter books for autumn 2022, from Maggie O’Farrell to Cormac McCarthy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/21/seven-big-books-autumn-2022-maggie-ofarrell-cormac-mccarthy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/21/seven-big-books-autumn-2022-maggie-ofarrell-cormac-mccarthy","fields":{"headline":"Seven big-hitter books for autumn 2022, from Maggie O’Farrell to Cormac McCarthy","trailText":"It’s going to be a vintage autumn for fiction, with new novels from some of our finest writers.

The book’s heart, though, lies in Italy, where Ross falls in with the Romantic poets, and finds love. Picaresque, big-hearted and moving, this is Boyd at the top of his game. Published 6 October (Viking).</p> <p><strong>Campaign<br></strong>Preorder activity is well under way and a huge publication campaign will continue through to Christmas.

Think Alfred and the cakes or Robert the Bruce and his study of spiders. For Russia, it has long been Grand Prince Vladimir, who had 800 concubines and wives before choosing Christ over Muhammad at the end of the first millennium for the very Russian reason that Islam did not permit alcohol. In truth, Vladimir (or Volodymyr to the Ukrainians) is a classic founding figure, now a saint, about whom almost nothing is known. Yet according to President Putin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/04/vladimir-great-statue-unveiled-putin-moscow\">unveiling a monstrous statue to him in 2016</a>, he “gathered and defended Russia’s lands… by founding a strong, united and centralised state”.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/orlando-figes\">Orlando Figes</a>’s new history methodically lays bare, this is both myth-making of the first order and of profound importance to understanding Russia today. From Ivan to Peter, Catherine to Nicholas, Russia’s rulers have reforged these myths to suit their own purposes, sometimes as a defensive standard for the people to rally round, sometimes as a badge of celestial honour to cement Moscow’s place as the saviour of the west. Often both at once.</p> <p>In July 2021, Vladimir Putin published his own story of Russia, a 5,000-word essay <a href=\"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181\">On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians</a>, which can now be read as his justification for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-has-invaded-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far\">invasion he launched</a> seven months later to bring his brother “little Russians” back into the arms of big brother Rus. Reaching back into the mists of myth, he sees the idea of Ukraine as a Trojan horse, an “anti-Russian project” since the 17th century and that the present state is on “historically Russian lands”. As Figes makes clear, anyone with the most elementary grasp of the shape of Europe, from Berlin to the Urals, would know that borders are determined by raw power, not some mystical racial bond. Flip through any historical atlas of the past 1,000 years and states appear, disappear and move around with astonishing but telling regularity. Empress Catherine, a German, may have founded Odessa (Figes interestingly uses Russian spellings for Ukrainian cities) to capture the world’s grain trade in 1794. But just years before that, the Black Sea coast had been part of the Polish Lithuanian commonwealth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Ukrainian horror is the post-imperial catastrophe of a Russia struggling to accept what happened with the collapse of the Soviet Union</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This historical primer has only traces of the original thinking that Figes’s other important works on Russia have displayed, but it does effectively lay out with important clarity the “structural continuities” of power, how the state and the ruler, be that a tsar or Stalin, “are united in the body of a single being... the sacralisation of the tsar’s authority”. He takes us on a chronological journey, in the process highlighting the way Putin and his propagandists have filled the vacuum left by the collapse of the Soviet Union with what Figes calls “the debris of Russian history”. Pride, fear and resentment, aggression and defensiveness have coalesced into the toxic present, which offers a retreat into a conservative celebration of communal sacrifice, with little vision of any constructive future.</p> <p>In his brief post-invasion update, Figes points out the significance of the speech given by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/03/the-guardian-view-on-the-russian-orthodox-church-betrayed-by-putins-patriarch\">Patriarch Kirill</a> on the “day of forgiveness”, in which he labelled the war in the Ukraine a crusade for “human salvation”, reminding the people that Moscow and the Orthodox church are the saviours of Christianity, the last bastions of true morality. Russia’s soldiers, it emerged, are giving their lives to hold back the onslaught of “gay pride parades”, a Kremlin obsession of the past 20 years. The church yet again has nailed its colours to the authoritarian mast, turning away from European concepts of government and thought and undermining any serious development of a civil society able to challenge central government.</p> <p>Figes notes the irony that it was the choice of Christianity that opened the gateway to Europe for Muscovy in the first place, which makes Putin’s pivot from all things western so ultimately destructive. For while geopolitics make an alliance with Beijing an immediate strategic imperative, page after page of the Russian story has been defined by continuous, often highly creative friction between western ideas and Russian Slav exceptionalism. The term Eurasian is bandied around as if the balance of cultural influences were equal, but in truth, after the Mongols had helped establish Muscovy as the primary statelet in the 15th and 16th centuries, what is striking is how marginal the influence of Asia and its culture has been on Russia. However abhorrent the word empire is to “Soviets” and Russians, Moscow became and remains an imperial power, driving at different times into Europe, into Siberia and later into central Asia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bcceb9fcfc9471e99c2cbd65035a328ad897068f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcceb9fcfc9471e99c2cbd65035a328ad897068f/0_0_3535_5315/665.jpg\" alt=\"Russian icon Grand Prince Vladimir\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian icon Grand Prince Vladimir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The present Ukrainian horror is the post-imperial catastrophe of a Russia that is struggling to accept what happened with the collapse of the Soviet Union and that empire in 1991. As always with Russia, the costs on all sides will be huge. 1812. 1917. 1945. These dates point to the astonishing impact Russia always has, twice claiming the role of saviour of civilisation after being invaded itself, as well as being the lodestar of world revolution for over a generation. Add 2022 to that list, as I suspect we will have to, and the long-term reverberations of Putin’s present destruction of Ukrainian cities and confrontation with the west become clear. Is it any wonder that Russians, both leaders and the people, have struggled to accept a humbler status in the world?</p> <p>Figes quotes the “extraordinary” findings of the respected Levada Centre, whose polling suggested that <em>Homo Sovieticus</em><em> </em>has not died<em>, </em>with his “low material expectations, social conformism, intolerance of ethnic and sexual minorities, acceptance of authority”. Indeed, reading the catalogue of oppression Russians have put up with, head lowered before their rulers, <em>Homo Rus</em> is not that different from <em>Homo </em><em>Sovieticus</em>, both before and after the Soviet era. Despite knowing that between 10 and 30 million of their own people were repressed unjustly under Stalin, more than three-quarters polled believe that his policies were “a terrible necessity”. Figes records how in 2021 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/28/russian-court-memorial-human-rights-group-closure\">Putin directly attacked history by closing Memorial</a>, an organisation deliberately set up to collect information about the past. Who knows now what the people truly feel about their new tsar’s attempt to re-establish the empire at such cost not just to Ukrainians but to themselves? Reading <em>The Story of Russia</em> you would be betting against history to suggest that Putin and his present boyars are not reflecting something deep in the Russian story. Yet in Kyiv, Putin is now creating another myth that will not easily be forgotten, for a country he does not believe exists: Ukraine.</p> <p><em>Film-maker Angus Macqueen has helped create a platform of award-winning documentaries, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user176351329\">Russia on Film</a></em></p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Story of Russia </em>by Orlando Figes is published by Bloomsbury (£25).

The centre of Dawn King’s new play is a debate about the climate crisis: when a window is opened on to Georgia Lowe’s sweatily crammed set, gusts of sepia smoke belch in; the world outside is bilious. Yet it goes beyond this to look at intergenerational acrimony and at what counts as justice. As important, Natalie Abrahami’s production aims to open up the idea of who appears on stage and, so, of who owns the default gaze in a theatre. More than half the cast are teenagers making their professional debuts.</p> <p>In an unspecified time – a future now – the youth are gathered to decide whether particular members of their parents’ generation are climate crisis criminals. The arraigned – played by Lucy Cohu, Nigel Lindsay and Sharon Small – have worked for an oil company, had several non-vegan children, flown around the world. Can guilt be graded? Is remorse a mitigating factor? When does justice become revenge, and suspicion of a “dinosaur” generation begin to interfere with making out the facts? The penalties, delivered to a fizz of red fluorescence, are severe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e17a462ae35e082b9b6b1ad91f324dc3b3376714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e17a462ae35e082b9b6b1ad91f324dc3b3376714/0_165_6000_3835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Trials at the Donmar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Trials at the Donmar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Murray</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The questions are bluntly tackled, but the play has intricacies. Stage trials are always as much investigations of jurors and judges as of the people in the dock. There are nicely nailed swift portraits here. The merciless, utterly letter-of-the-law girl; the adolescent who scrutinises their lime-green nails with more interest than the defendants; the diligent truth-seeker; the boy who really wants to argue about the best ice-cream flavour; and the child who wonders what it would be like to see snow.</p> <p>On the whole, the less measured the character, the surer the actor’s landing. Joe Locke, of Netflix hit <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/18/no-drugs-booze-sex-or-swearing-will-heartstopper-rewrite-the-young-love-rulebook\">Heartstopper</a></em>, has wonderful ease, Jowana El-Daouk unyielding scorn, Charlie Reid an outstanding sardonic loll.

The story of the golden age of bath toys is a real soap opera","byline":"Amelia Tait","body":"<p>There is a tall black cabinet in London filled with 150 bottles and 300 unblinking eyes. It’s always strange seeing part of your childhood in a museum, but I never expected to be reminded of my mortality by a yellow plastic bottle moulded into the spikes of Bart Simpson’s head. “I had that! On the edge of my bathtub 20 years ago!” I thought earlier this year as I stared into the display of character-shaped bubble bath bottles at the <a href=\"https://museumofbrands.com/\" title=\"\">Museum of Brands</a> in Notting Hill. The display is just one part of the museum’s journey through time, a pitstop between 80s magazines and 00s snacks. Soaking in the rotundity of Super Mario’s belly, the bloom of Aladdin’s plastic pants and the shiny red point of Pingu’s beak, I couldn’t remember which of the bottles I’d had and which I simply coveted – but I realised they were once everywhere, and now they’re nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>At the turn of the millennium we were (unknowingly) in the middle of the bubble bath boom. Characters in every show, film and video game were brought to life as hollow novelty figurines that were decapitated to reveal a foaming mixture within. It’s impossible to overstate the scale of the thing: there was the Mask, Quasimodo, Barbie, the Little Mermaid, Fred Flintstone and Raymond Briggs’s Snowman (as well as every other man possible – Bat, Action, Spider, He). Who was behind this moment in pop culture history? Why was it the golden age of the bath toy? What made the bubble burst? It all starts with Robert Beecham.</p> <p>When he was 21 and employed by a hosiery company in London, Beecham, now 71, worked something out: “I really liked women. I love children. I love smells.” After studying philosophy in America, but failing to obtain a degree, Beecham spent two years in hosiery before he had a realisation: “You know what? You’re not gonna make a fortune here.” He quit and combined his love of women, children and smells into a new business, Château de Bubble, a bath mixture sold in wine carafes.</p> <p>During his first year of business in 1975, Beecham sold 12,000 bottles for around £39,000, but as his company grew he stayed in contact with friends in the US. “I started getting letters from my pals in America and they said, ‘Robert, have you heard of War Star or Star Rolls or Star World or whatever?’ I said, ‘what are you talking about?’” Beecham recalls. The very first<em> Star Wars</em> film was released in May 1977 in America, but it hadn’t yet reached the UK. Beecham smelled an opportunity.</p> <p>Here’s the story as he tells it, and it’s too good to tell it another way. Almost exactly 45 years ago, Beecham sneaked into the offices of Peter Beale, manager of 20th Century Fox in London. He told him he knew about the upcoming <em>Star Wars</em> film; said he wanted to put his bubble bath inside the film’s characters. Beecham had come up with the idea in Boots in Piccadilly Circus, when he realised there weren’t many toiletries for kids (Beecham’s father, incidentally, was in the toy business).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0830fa925b7c7ffc697f0d0f7fefa9ef5524ae9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0830fa925b7c7ffc697f0d0f7fefa9ef5524ae9e/0_230_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beverley Heyworth with her collection of 800 bubble bath bottles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Squeaky clean: Beverley Heyworth with her collection of 800 bubble bath bottles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Tragen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Beecham tells it, Beale’s “eyes lit up” when he heard the idea; he said the bubble bath businessman could premiere <em>Star Wars </em>in London. Beecham invited representatives from major shops and the press, but when he introduced himself and his Darth Vader and R2D2-shaped bottles before the film: “I was met with complete and utter silence.”</p> <p>Thankfully, the movie did Beecham’s job for him. Enamoured sales reps clamoured to get Beecham’s product – his range was released in time for Christmas. Writing in the <em>Daily Mirror</em> on 22 December 1977, columnist Keith Waterhouse recommended swapping bog-standard giftsets for Beecham’s stuff: “I suggest for once that you get on the ball and invest in <em>Star Wars</em> bath salts,” he joked. “The bubble bath market didn’t know what happened to it,” says Beecham.</p> <p><em><strong>Beecham wasn’t the</strong></em> first person to create character bubble baths – in the 1960s, “Soakys” shaped like Bugs Bunny were popular in America, and even the Beatles were bottled. Matey, the far less intricately shaped sailor soap line that’s still going strong today, was also on the shelves in the UK when Beecham had his idea. But Beecham’s company, Grosvenor of London, came at the exact right time: the dawn of licencing as we know it, when everything began to be slapped on everything else.</p> <p>“I was brought in because I’m a bit of a maverick and I’ll just try things that have never been done before,” says Gary Little, who became creative director of Grosvenor in 1994. Little helped Beecham secure a Disney licence, and before long, “we had all the major licences” – Beatrix Potter, Popeye, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Pokémon, Harry Potter. “Barbie, as far as I was concerned, was my queen,” Beecham says – she could be reinvented annually in a different outfit. Hulk Hogan, in contrast, was a flop. “One minute he was top of the pops and the next minute, he was busted for steroids.”</p> <p>Little says that he “had a free rein to do and create anything I wanted” – he once got a letter from <em>Simpsons</em> creator Matt Groening saying he had some of the range in his own bath. Before long, Grosvenor was releasing 300 products every year.</p> <p>It was, at times, challenging work. When designing a Pocahontas bottle, Little got “carried away” with sculpting the intricate figurine and forgot about how much bubble bath he needed to fit inside. Pocahontas was designed to be diving off a rock, “so the rock started getting bigger” to hold the liquid. “It was more like a mountain when we finished,” jokes Little’s wife, Helen, who worked on production at Grosvenor. (The couple are now based in Berkshire and don’t reveal their ages; he says he’s “past retirement” and she says, “I’m younger than him.”)</p> <p>At one point, the hyper-realistic sculptor Ron Mueck helped craft Grosvenor designs – as did Timothy John Staffell, a modelmaker who put together the band that would go on to become Queen. “There was loads and loads and loads of clay,” says Yve Hooson, 59, who designed bottles for Grosvenor in the 90s. Hooson would draw her designs and a sculptor brought the prototypes to life with clay in a back room. “Obviously, everything is now 3D sculpted on a computer,” she says.</p> <p>The production process was complicated and ever-changing. Beecham first worked with a company in Wales before swapping to factories in China. Originally, the bottles were hand-finished, later they were injection-moulded with different coloured plastics. “Some of our models required eight to 10 different tools just to make one bubble bath,” says Little.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Barbie was my queen, but Hulk Hogan, in contrast, was a flop</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hertfordshire-based designer Elena Jackson, 49, who worked at Grosvenor in the early 2000s, recalls the challenges of designing with production limitations in mind. “She has her arm like that because in any other way, it would be too fragile,” Jackson says, showing off a Snow White bottle with her hands chastely clutched under her chin. Because licensors had strict rules about designs being scale accurate, Jackson couldn’t make an arm wider or a leg thicker to fit more product in a bottle. Another problem was ensuring that the bottles stood up. Princesses were OK – they had big skirts – but for superheroes, Jackson had another trick. “You had to use the cape,” she says.</p> <p>Someone who appreciated the hard work was Beverley Heyworth, 55, an NHS worker from Manchester, who began collecting character bubble bath 30 years ago. Today, she has more than 800 in storage. In the 90s, Heyworth took advantage of Boots’ 3-for-2 deals to stock up on bottles – she would use the product and ship empty containers to buyers around the world. “I was squeaky clean,” she laughs.</p> <p>Heyworth placed adverts in newspapers and magazines to connect with other collectors and negotiate trades. “I made friends with people in Australia, America, Canada, Japan and Europe,” she says. “It’s nice to have been at the centre of it.” Once, Heyworth travelled to Holland with her husband to meet another collector couple and trade for a German Batman bottle. “The first time we met, we went to their house and sat there with dictionaries, having a laugh and talking to each other,” Heyworth says, “and the only thing that connected us was our toys.”</p> <p>Heyworth liked collecting bottles because they were “colourful and lively.” She also enjoyed hunting down rarer models, such as a Roger Moore bottle from the 70s. Her obsession culminated in her writing and printing 150 copies of a book: <em>Collectabubbles: Guide to Bubble Bath Characters</em>. The Littles keep their copy to hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4305b4f58cec3fd38a08045558902a94b12b7e91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4305b4f58cec3fd38a08045558902a94b12b7e91/500_116_2172_1303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Beecham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toy story: Robert Beecham, the man behind character bubble baths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Pugh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heyworth’s late husband fell ill in the 2000s and her interest waned. She didn’t notice when characters started disappearing from the shelves. In 2002, toy company Hasbro purchased Grosvenor; Beecham was officially the world’s first bubble bath multimillionaire (in 2015, he caused a stir with plans to build London’s biggest domestic basement at his home). The Littles worked for Hasbro, but claim it struggled to understand the market, so they started their own toiletries business, Kokomo, in 2010.</p> <p>The trouble was, times had changed. Four things explain the disappearance of character bottles: the recession, rising eco-consciousness, an explosion in popular culture and toothbrushes. “Retail changed and it’s never changed back,” Little says of the 2007 recession – the prices of character bottles increased, so they were no longer the cheaper option for parents compared to toys. Plus, there was that whole plastic thing.</p> <p>“Back in the day, you never used to think about the landfill,” Helen says, but in more recent years, “at a dinner party, I would have felt less embarrassed if I’d said I was a heroin pusher.” A burgeoning entertainment industry meant the Littles struggled to choose from the 100 new character licences they were offered annually. Meanwhile, in the UK, a 2019 survey found the majority of Brits prefer showers to baths. By the time the Littles sold Kokomo in a management buyout earlier this year, licensed toothbrushes accounted for 40% of turnover – after all, everyone needs to brush their teeth.</p> <p><em><strong>Maybe it’s no bad thing</strong></em> that I can no longer get a bubble bath Bart, that today’s children make do with a normal-shaped bottle with an Elsa sticker slapped on it. But those involved in the boom mourn the loss of a creative era. “In the 90s everybody was very keen on being as different as possible,” artist Hooson says. “Now people don’t want to take risks, every shop wants to have exactly what every other shop has, and there is no design any more.” Beecham fondly recalls the time-consuming processes of creating a Game Boy bottle – he “sat in the factory for God knows how long” designing “rubber nipples” that shot little jets of air to make a real, playable game.</p> <p>The Museum of Brands does not hold London’s only shrine to bubble bath bottles. In Beecham’s garage, there is shelf after shelf lined with his products. “The bare bones of what I struggled to produce have been demolished inside a corporation, unfortunately,” he says of the Hasbro takeover, but his company lives on in his mini-museum. “I had a fabulous time and a fabulous life,” Beecham says of being a bubble bath tycoon. “It was absolutely wonderful.” </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/21/spain-wonders-what-to-do-with-unused-bullrings","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T09:04:08Z","webTitle":"Quiet corridas: Spain wonders what to do with unused bullrings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/spain-wonders-what-to-do-with-unused-bullrings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/21/spain-wonders-what-to-do-with-unused-bullrings","fields":{"headline":"Quiet corridas: Spain wonders what to do with unused bullrings","trailText":"With number of events in decline, many of the 1,700 venues often in city centres stand abandoned","byline":"Stephen Burgen in Barcelona","body":"<p>In October 1940, Francisco Franco invited Heinrich Himmler to a bullfight at Las Ventas bullring in Madrid.

For the far-right Vox party, a love of bullfighting is synonymous with being Spanish.</p> <p>“Here in Catalonia, being opposed to bullfights is a way of being anti-Spanish,” Royuela says.</p> <p>While many bullrings have fallen into disuse and disrepair, some are being repurposed. The bullring in Benidorm, which opened in 1962, is getting a €8.6m (£7.3m) makeover as a cultural complex with a library, rehearsal studios, youth centre and a meeting point for community associations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"800010cc02c5a643624f39cc470e9a653f62a703\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/800010cc02c5a643624f39cc470e9a653f62a703/0_0_3769_2263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heinrich Himmler (left) visiting the bullfight in Madrid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heinrich Himmler (left) visiting the bullfight in Madrid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein bild Dtl./Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bullfighting has been banned in the Canaries since 1991 and, after years of wrangling, the ring in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is to have a new life, housing nightclubs, apartments and a public square.</p> <p>One of the great success stories is the Las Arenas bullring in Barcelona that opened in 1900 but was abandoned after its last bullfight in 1977.</p> <p>After failed attempts by the local council to resuscitate the arena, it was sold and reopened in 2011 as a shopping and leisure centre designed by the British architect Richard Rogers, along with his Catalan partner Alonso Balaguer architects.</p> <p>As the mudejar-style building is listed, the entire facade had to be preserved and, in a feat of engineering, was raised on to pillars to improve access.</p> <p>It took six years to complete, during which time the budget doubled to €200m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ef209035810db3b50b1a711f056bc2bd3dff2e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ef209035810db3b50b1a711f056bc2bd3dff2e7/0_209_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Arenas de Barcelona shopping mall, which was formerly a bullring\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Arenas de Barcelona shopping mall, which was formerly a bullring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barcelona’s other bullring, La Monumental, another mudejar treasure, is privately owned and is up for sale but there have been no takers as yet.

It was banned in Muslim Spain and thus became a symbol of Christian resistance.</p> <p>Later it was prohibited under various Christian kings who viewed it as unsuitable for aristocrats, with the result that it became increasingly popular among the working-class.</p> <p>Today, bullfighting is prohibited in Catalonia as well as the Canary Islands and last year the mayor of Gijón in Asturias was so incensed after a breeder introduced bulls named Feminist and Nigerian into the ring that she banned it, effectively ending bullfighting in the region.</p> <p>Although the constitutional court overturned the bans, bullfighting has not returned to those regions and the traditional corrida – as opposed to festivals such as the running of the bulls in Pamplona – may soon become a thing of the past.</p> <p>Most bullrings occupy prime, city-centre real estate and the logical thing would be to demolish them and build something more useful. However, even those that are not listed as being of architectural interest remain just as much an essential feature of the urban fabric of Spain’s cities and towns as the town hall and the cathedral.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/21/anthony-joshua-boxing-reaction-oleksandr-usyk","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T09:00:12Z","webTitle":"Anthony Joshua’s tears and tirade show the burden of boxing’s spotlight | Sachin Nakrani","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/21/anthony-joshua-boxing-reaction-oleksandr-usyk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/21/anthony-joshua-boxing-reaction-oleksandr-usyk","fields":{"headline":"Anthony Joshua’s tears and tirade show the burden of boxing’s spotlight","trailText":"The beaten heavyweight looked a broken man after losing to Oleksandr Usyk as 10 years of pressure finally told","byline":"Sachin Nakrani in Jeddah","body":"<p>It was shortly before 4am local time that Anthony Joshua met the crowd that had been waiting for him. Alongside his promoter, Eddie Hearn, the 32-year-old strode into the press conference room located at the back of the King Abdullah Sports City media centre and took a seat behind the podium. He and Hearn then started taking questions and everything was proceeding as normal, until someone asked Joshua if he was proud of the performance he had delivered in defeat to Oleksandr Usyk.</p> \n<p>“Am I proud of myself?” Joshua said. “It’s hard to say if I’m proud of myself. I’m upset. Really, deep down in my heart …” Everyone waited for him to finish his answer, but he had no more words. Only emotion. Joshua leant forward, covered his eyes and, quite clearly, was in tears.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/21/oleksandr-usyk-beats-anthony-joshua-by-split-decision-to-retain-world-titles\">Oleksandr Usyk beats Anthony Joshua by split decision to retain world titles</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It had been that sort of night, one of intense sporting action but also one in which the athlete gave away to something more human. A rawness that was as engrossing as it was difficult to watch.</p> \n<p>It was surprising because it came from a man who for so long has been the epitome of restraint. Joshua may punch people for a living but he also comes across as a nice guy. Charming, sweet, the type of boy a father would happily allow his daughter to have dinner with. But here, on a hot night in Jeddah, the Saudi Arabian city by the Red Sea, that all burned away.</p> \n<p>Having lost to Usyk for a second time and consequently failed in his bid to regain his status as a world heavyweight champion, Joshua lost it all over again. He threw two of the victor’s title belts out of the ring before storming out of it himself. Having returned, he then exchanged angry words with Usyk before taking hold of a microphone. In front of the 10,000-strong crowd, he delivered a curious, foul-mouthed monologue.</p> \n<p>“If you knew my story, you would understand the passion. I ain’t no fucking amateur boxer from five years old,” he declared. “I was going to jail ... I got bail and I started training my ass off. It’s because of the fucking passion we put into this shit, man.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I’m a hustler, I work hard – but it comes at a cost.

I’m the new breed of heavyweight ... ‘Oh, you don’t throw combinations like Rocky Marciano’. That’s cause I ain’t fucking 14 stone. I’m 18 stone and I’m heavy. It’s hard work.”</p> \n<p>Joshua eventually got around to congratulating Usyk, but even that was done with a coarseness that made it sound insincere. In keeping with the rest of the speech, it was also a bit weird.</p> \n<p>All in all, it was hard to know what to make of Joshua’s behaviour. Initially there was confusion, shock, even disgust. But ultimately it was difficult not to feel sorry for him. This, clearly, was not just a defeated man, but a broken one.</p> \n<p>The overriding sense was of someone exhausted by the life he has been leading ever since being propelled into the limelight by dint of winning Olympic gold a decade ago. Joshua turned professional the following year and ever since it’s been relentless: fight after fight, most of them either in pursuit or in defence of a world title, with the majority staged in front of huge, expectant crowds.</p> \n<p>With that comes vast riches but it is also draining, both mentally and physically, and while Joshua was probably able to cope with that during the good times, it has clearly proved too much during the bad – specifically in the period between his loss to Usyk in Tottenham last September and Saturday’s rematch. As Joshua admitted, he felt the pressure of needing to recover his WBA, WBO and IBF titles, and having not done so it is perhaps no surprise he buckled.</p> \n<p>“I’m a hustler, I work hard and make sure my team is good, but it comes at a cost,” he said. “It will never break me, but it takes a lot of strength and tonight you saw a crack in the armour.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"671adf0a48d1c40fbbc0178ab99af459f760eee6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/671adf0a48d1c40fbbc0178ab99af459f760eee6/0_77_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Joshua exchanges words with Oleksandr Usyk after the result was announced\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Joshua exchanges words with Oleksandr Usyk after the result was announced.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hearn also admitted Joshua came into this fight with the weight of the world on his shoulders and stressed that was what lay behind his erratic behaviour. “What you saw was raw emotion,” he said. “People don’t understand the pressure that’s on his shoulders, and he’s never ducked that pressure. He’s an amazing ambassador. Someone I want my kids to look up to.”</p> \n<p>Hearn also praised Joshua for “putting up a fight against one of the best fighters to ever lace up a pair of gloves”. It was fair of him to do so given Joshua’s display on his return to Saudi Arabia three years after beating Andy Ruiz Jr in Diriyah.</p> \n<p>Joshua had vowed to be more aggressive than he had been when facing Usyk in north London and lived up to his word. Charging forward in the first round, Joshua secured the centre of the ring in the second and consistently stung his opponent with thudding shots, no more so than in the ninth round when the challenger had the champion scrambling, having unleashed hell.</p> \n<p>But after returning fire in the 10th round, Usyk took control of the contest through a combination of typically sublime technique and ferocity. Having largely dominated proceedings it came as no shock when he was declared the winner, the only surprise being it was via a split decision. Two of the judges delivered scores of 115-113 and 116-112 in the Ukrainian’s favour while the other, incredibly, deemed Joshua to be the winner via a score of 115-113.</p> \n<p>For Usyk it was a 20th straight win across two divisions, in turn fuelling talk of a mouthwatering unification fight with Tyson Fury – something both men appear to want – as well as delivering much-needed pride and joy to his war-torn nation. For Joshua it was a third defeat in 27 fights and one that leaves him with few paths back to the top of his division. That is likely to lead to an increase in speculation, inside and outside boxing, that he could call it a day, something the man himself was keen to stress would not be happening anytime soon.</p> \n<p>“I’m a fighter for life, the hunger never dies,” he said.</p> \n<p>Hearn went further by outlining his desire to see Joshua have “three or four fights next year and get back up to winning championship belts”.</p> \n<p>He also outlined his wish to see Joshua enjoy fighting again, and more than anything, to “be happy”.</p> \n<p>Given his mood in the aftermath of Saturday’s fight, that feels like very wise advice indeed.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/21/leeds-drunken-otley-run-goes-from-high-spirits-to-public-menace","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T09:00:05Z","webTitle":"Leeds’ drunken Otley Run goes from high spirits to public menace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/leeds-drunken-otley-run-goes-from-high-spirits-to-public-menace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/leeds-drunken-otley-run-goes-from-high-spirits-to-public-menace","fields":{"headline":"Leeds’ drunken Otley Run goes from high spirits to public menace","trailText":"Pub crawlers behaving badly could now be hit with a £1,000 fine for antisocial acts","byline":"Robyn Vinter","body":"<p>For decades, donning a fancy dress costume and trying to complete the Otley Run has been a rite of passage for students living in Leeds.</p> <p>The pub crawl takes in some 15 pubs, depending on who you ask, beginning in Woodies Ale House, on Otley Road in Headingley, and ending a couple of miles south in the city centre – if participants make it that far, which they usually don’t.</p> <p>For as long as the tradition has existed, locals have enjoyed seeing the mismatched Super Mario characters, groups of sexy lifeguards and the odd six-foot-three rugby player dressed as Marge Simpson.</p> <p>But now anyone tackling the Otley Run may have to contend with more than a hangover afterwards – they might also be hit with a £1,000 fine. Leeds city council has said it will begin to clamp down on antisocial behaviour on the boozy run after escalating complaints from residents.</p> <p>“It was a fun thing and a well-known characteristic of the area, and it didn’t cause too much trouble,” said Al Garthwaite, a local councillor for Headingley, Hyde Park and Woodhouse. “As a councillor, I didn’t have any complaints about it.”</p> <p>But since the pandemic, the number of boozy, costume-clad groups has exploded and a different – and more troublesome – demographic has joined in, causing constant and sometimes serious problems for those who live and work in Headingley. Garthwaite said: “The groups seem to be bigger and we’re finding that it’s men-only groups, grown men from their late-20s even into their 50s.”</p> <p>She said these groups, many of which are stag parties, have started to come from all over the UK on organised trips. British Transport Police have reported more people coming off the train drunk at an earlier hour, she added.</p> <p>“They basically create a trail of destruction. These men are probably Mr Nice Guy at home, they’ve probably got families, jobs, but they turn into Mr Nasty Guy when they’re all together, out to get drunk.”</p> <p>Olympia Agorini, front-of-house manager at the Box, one of the livelier bars in Headingley, said in her four years there she had noticed a difference. “Saturdays have always been busy but now the clientele is difficult. There are a lot of middle-aged men from London, and they don’t behave. They don’t care about being barred because they’re going back to London. They have no affiliation with Headingley and no respect for the area. It shouldn’t be happening.”</p> <p>Problems reported to the council and police include littering, broken glass, vomiting, public urination and more serious crimes like harassment of retail and bar staff, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/04/public-sexual-harassment-could-become-criminal-offence-in-england-and-wales\" title=\"\">sexual harassment</a> of pedestrians and flashing, including around children.</p> <p>Garthwaite, who is the lead councillor for ending violence against women and girls, said she had also had reports of numerous similar incidents, and had held meetings with local residents and Leeds North West MP Alex Sobel to discuss the antisocial behaviour. “Quite a lot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/sep/26/when-will-women-feel-safe-on-uk-streets\" title=\"\">young women have told me that they don’t go into Headingley</a> on a Saturday especially, so they’re not going to the shops, they’re not going to where they live.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6990833863f46dd67a641ecc5c6f1b02e9980507\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6990833863f46dd67a641ecc5c6f1b02e9980507/0_267_5051_3031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Three young women on the Otley Run.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Participants on the Otley Run – in the past, the run has been seen as ‘a fun thing’ by locals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NB Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One student reported being so badly harassed by a group of males that she ran into traffic to get away from them, while an elderly woman said the men clogging the streets meant she no longer went to mass in the cathedral on Saturday evenings.</p> <p>Pubs are now turning away the most inebriated groups. The Original Oak, one of the bigger pubs on the route, turned away 98 people last Saturday and they have been given a radio to alert others further down the route of the worst offenders.</p> <p>Garthwaite said nobody is trying to cancel the Otley Run but more needs to be done to protect residents. “The police have applied for funding so that they can increase patrols. Police do patrol but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/25/ministers-pledge-to-raise-police-numbers-dismissed-as-hypocrisy\" title=\"\">their numbers have been severely cut</a>, and if they’re called away to an emergency, they’re not there to stop things from happening,” she said.</p> <p>A council clampdown would be possible because the area is covered by a public spaces protection order. While it was not previously enforced, the council and police do have the power to issue fines of up to £1,000 to anyone causing a public nuisance. Councillors are also looking at a common code of conduct for all the bars to empower other customers to report bad behaviour.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/21/national-trust-members-get-ready-to-choke-on-your-carrot-cake","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T09:00:05Z","webTitle":"National Trust members get ready to choke on your carrot cake | Stewart Lee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/national-trust-members-get-ready-to-choke-on-your-carrot-cake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/national-trust-members-get-ready-to-choke-on-your-carrot-cake","fields":{"headline":"National Trust members: get ready to choke on your carrot cake","trailText":"The creeping pushback against the ‘woke’ won’t stop until we’re neck-deep in deregulated dystopia","byline":"Stewart Lee","body":"<p>Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are currently promoting the benefits of the deregulated “special economic zones” known as freeports, despite evidence that they encourage organised crime, money-laundering, drug-trafficking and terrorist finance, though admittedly the first three of these supposed problems appear to be common leisure activities for most Tory MPs. I’m here all week! Try the Colombian!!</p> <p>Joined-up thinking, or paranoia depending on your point of view, suggests the next logical step from freeports is “charter cities”, allowing whole regions to be run as “corporate fiefs” by big business, stripped of tiresome regulations in the pursuit of profit. As long ago as 2010, the rightwing Tufton Street-based Taxpayers’ Alliance thinktank proposed that Hull “became our own version of a charter city [with] minimum wage, working-hours regulations, social benefits for working-age citizens, and central government planning regulations abolished”. Businesses that have made themselves useful to the Tories will doubtless be the beneficiaries here, just as they were when the PPE billions were doled out with due diligence.</p> <p>Could Boris Johnson’s wedding venue donors at Daylesford Organic be given a south Devon section incorporating the whole of Dartmoor and the entire South Hams region? Could Ultimo, the lingerie company formerly owned by the Tory peer Michelle Mone, be handed the entire east Midlands from Burton upon Trent to Upper Broughton? Will the Tory-adjacent businesswoman Jacqueline Gold’s Ann Summers organisation be left to run the Humber sector from Spurn Head to Howden, including Hull? Can Matt Handcock’s local pub landlord be allowed to do whatever he wants with both Needham Market and Clacton-on-Sea? And if this is the case, can these companies be trusted to respect the rights of the citizens of whom they will have dominion, when there are no regulations to protect them?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Butterflies don’t care about unisex toilets.

Should the people of Corby and Kettering be forced to wear untested Ultimo corsets, which could explode on contact with back sweat? Should people from Hull, and their orifices, be used as guinea pigs for untried, and potentially unsafe, Ann Summers sex toys, such as a turbo-charged, post-Brexit version of the Ann Summers bestseller the Anal Training Kit? As if Brexit wasn’t enough of a disaster as it is, are these some of the new “Brexit benefits” currently rolling down the sewage outlet of post-Brexit Tory deregulation?</p> <p>It’s fun, isn’t it, to joke about the Brexit Tories’ attempts to turn Britain into a horrible dystopia designed to make money for their friends at the expense of the environment, the arts, education, human rights and so forth. Ha! Ha! Ha! But, here at the Edinburgh fringe, I popped out between my own shows to see two Ukrainian standups in <em><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/from-ukraine-with-laughs\">From Ukraine With Laughs</a></em>. Pavlo Voytovych presented a slick club set with cosmopolitan, pan-European reference points that would chime in his adopted Berlin; Dima Watermelon’s deadpan absurdity was darkened by attempts to deal with the systematic stealing of his homeland, the militarised erasure of the culture he grew up in. It made me think about what it would be like to lose the country you loved. And I realised I was.</p> <p>It’s hysterical, of course, to compare the Brexit Tories’ stealthy but determined dismantling of the Britain we cherish with Putin’s physical assault on Ukraine. But if you’ve ever shown an interest in architecture, gardening or nature, doubtless the infiltrated algorithms of your social media feeds are steering you towards the respectable-looking Restore Trust organisation, which is reminding National Trust members to renew their memberships before 26 August, so they can vote in the charity’s autumn AGM. All well and good, surely?</p> <p>Nominally a “forum where members and friends of the National Trust can discuss their concerns about the charity’s future”, the innocuous-sounding Restore Trust is in fact designed to stem the National Trust’s drift towards “wokeness” (by addressing links between its sites and slavery, for example). Restore Trust backer Neil Record, for one, is a financier and sometime Tory donor who has funded the climate-denial lobby group the Global Warming Policy Foundation, also based on Tufton Street, and chairs Net Zero Watch, a thinktank spin-off on the same street lobbying to scrap net zero commitments. This is a worrying development given the vast tracts of land the National Trust manages and the millions of non-politically affiliated invertebrates in its keep. Butterflies don’t care about unisex toilets. They just want the plants they lay their eggs on to flower when they are supposed to.</p> <p>In last year’s National Trust board member elections, one of the six preferred candidates that Restore Trust’s supporters hoped to vote into a position of influence was the self-styled “reverend” Stephen Green, who has supported the death penalty for gay sex in Uganda, believes all Muslims are going to hell and, when he was campaigning against a theatre piece I worked on decades ago, refused to shake the hand of a gay journalist because he knew “where it had been”. It is not known if Green believes garden design in National Trust properties should reflect one specific period in the house’s history or attempt to illustrate many simultaneously. We do know, however, that he thinks it is impossible for a husband to rape his wife.</p> <p>It seems bizarre that it is suddenly necessary for reasonable people, who probably only joined the National Trust because they like carrot cake and a firm hanging buttress, to make sure they vote in the organisation’s 5 November AGM to prevent fun days out in historic locations becoming weaponised as yet another front in the far right’s culture war against everything nice.

Clanchy, an author who was heavily criticised last summer for language used in her memoir about her years as a teacher, is talking to a lawyer about her legal position, she has revealed to the <em>Observer</em>. She and her supporters, including publishing doyenne Carmen Callil, are also calling for an independent report into the society’s processes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Writers have always been vile to each other, but they used to be vile in dark corners.

She has since talked of a period of mental ill health caused by the impact of the incident.</p> <p>“Writers have always been vile to each other, but they used to be vile in dark corners.

The poet added that both she and Pullman regret his initial reference to the kind of censorship inflicted by the Taliban, in a tweet that ultimately led to his resignation in March.</p> <p>Despite a call for unity from the Society of Authors this weekend, the battle over its leadership style looks likely to rage on. Last week, Harris was caught up in controversy when she appeared, in remarks she subsequently rewrote, to parody online comments made by Rowling in support of freedom of speech and Salman Rushdie, the victim of a knife attack during an event in New York.</p> <p>On Friday, the SoA attempted to turn the page by avowing its commitment to free speech. “We again call on all authors to converse with dignity and respect and to unite to work together on the issues which affect us all,” a statement on its website reads. The detailed response also says that the society has investigated allegations it failed to support gender critical members but has found “no basis for complaint”.</p> <p>But two rival letters have been circulating among members of the society since Harris’s Twitter post about literary death threats. An initial open letter, hosted on writer Julie Bindel’s Substack page, called on Harris to resign because the society had “failed to come to the defence” of threatened authors such as Gillian Philip, Rachel Rooney, Onjali Rauf, Bindel and Clanchy. A rival letter, released by the author Melinda Salisbury, defends Harris’s reputation as “a stalwart, fair, dedicated and passionate chair”.</p> <p>On Thursday, Bindel’s Substack page carried a follow-up letter disputing the arguments of Harris’s defenders and repeating the claim that gender-critical writers do not receive enough support. Harris, it argued, has a right to her own views but should “separate those views from her role at the Society of Authors”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/19/salman-rushdie-writers-new-york-read-works-solidarity\">Salman Rushdie: writers gather in New York to read author’s works in solidarity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Novelist Amanda Craig is one of the authors judged to have been failed by the SoA, according to its critics.

He was also the finance minister who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/07/the-family-took-over-how-a-feuding-ruling-dynasty-drove-sri-lanka-to-ruin?ref=upstract.com&amp;curator=upstract.com\" title=\"\">presided over economic meltdown</a> before being forced to resign with the first wave of the <em>Aragalaya</em> (struggle), as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/13/this-is-a-huge-moment-sri-lankans-vow-to-continue-protests-until-demands-are-met\" title=\"\">nationwide protests</a> came to be known.</p> <p>One of his last interviews was less concerned with impending economic doom and more with the dangers of crows at Katunayake airport flying into aeroplanes. It didn’t help that Basil’s limited English vocabulary did not include the word “crow”; he referred to the birds by their Sinhala name of <em>kaputas</em>, thus sealing his own nickname and inspiring some of the catchier chants of the <em>Aragalaya</em>, which rid the island of him and his brother Gotabaya, the president.</p> <p>A depressing truth lay beyond the caricature. How could a man unable to say the word crow pronounce bigger words such as debt restructuring, bridging finance and austerity measures, when negotiating with the International Monetary Fund? </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite all the self-inflicted tragedies, as all those who have visited and who live here know, Sri Lanka is not a miserable place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But despite all the self-inflicted tragedies, as all those who have visited and those who live here know, Sri Lanka is not a miserable place – not yet, at least. While Sri Lankans negotiate queues and rising prices and wait for the economic hitmen to save them, the jokes will continue to write themselves. The band will keep playing while the ship sinks. The papare trumpets will blare while the team loses.</p> <p>News Curry is predictably coy about who and how many they are. “We are the voice of reason or treason, depending on who’s doing the laughing,” they say in an online exchange. “We are anonymous for security reasons and to prevent the state from having the last laugh.”</p> <p>These days, it is difficult to tell the difference between News Curry headlines and actual ones, like “No more nepotism, says MP Namal Rajapaksa” – nephew and son of two former presidents.</p> <p>In the tough months ahead, Sri Lankans may draw strength from their ability to grin at tragedies and laugh at their fears. Though perhaps it is also time to get serious about reform and recovery, to elect a new generation of serious men and women with serious solutions, and to give the jokers a rest.</p> <p><em>Shehan Karunatilaka’s novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/09/the-seven-moons-of-maali-almeida-by-shehan-karunatilaka-review-life-after-death-in-sri-lanka\" title=\"\">The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida</a> is longlisted for the 2022 Booker prize</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/may-i-have-a-word-about-civil-servant-speak","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T09:00:04Z","webTitle":"May I have a word about… civil servant speak | Jonathan Bouquet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/may-i-have-a-word-about-civil-servant-speak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/may-i-have-a-word-about-civil-servant-speak","fields":{"headline":"May I have a word about… civil servant speak","trailText":"No one mangles the language like the Department for Work and Pensions","byline":"Jonathan Bouquet","body":"<p>Truly, the Department for Work and Pensions moves in mysterious ways, its debt-gathering duties to perform. Damien Dove from Sunderland recently received a missive from the department over an overpayment on his housing benefit.</p> <p>Cue some classic civil servant speak: “This was a debt owing to Mr Dove’s local authority; regulations require us to recover such debts when requested to and due to the automated nature of our systems the notification was generated without agent input. We supported Mr Dove, whose chosen payment method would’ve incurred a charge, by suggesting a free alternative.” What an outpouring of guff. And the debt? 2p.</p> <p>It’s not just this country that is suffering from a severe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/drought-parched-gardens-fire-ravaged-fields-10-things-you-should-know\" title=\"\">drought</a>, as I’m sure you’re aware. Dried-up lakes in America’s parched south-west have offered up a fossilised mastodon skull, ancient Native American dwellings and a B-29 Superfortress. The diminishing <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11114703/Lake-Mead-retreated-drought-exposing-bodies-feared-linked-Mafia-hits.html\" title=\"\">waters of Lake Mead</a>, 20 miles from Las Vegas, seem to be offering a solution to where mobsters got rid of their victims. There was, for example, the man who had been shot in the head and stuffed in a barrel, plus a human skull. And how did Travis Heggie, a former National Park Service official, describe these gruesome findings? “This is just the tip of the iceberg.” I’m not sure this is the most felicitous phrase in the circumstances.</p> <p>Moving swiftly along to the exciting world of white goods. I’m grateful to Geoff Cusick for drawing my attention to the following from Italian kitchen company Bertazzoni, which proudly advertises “food and beverage preservation systems”. As Mr Cusick rightly observes: “I think we used to call these fridges.”</p> <p>And a heartfelt grumble from David Harris about the use of the word preventative. “What’s wrong with preventive? Surely the corresponding noun for the outrage would be preventation. Is there such a word? I doubt it. I hope not!”</p> <p>Couldn’t agree more.</p> <p>• Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist.

Inflation has burst <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis-recession-looms\">above 10%</a> for the first time since Argentina was gearing up to invade the Falklands in early 1982.

Retail sales <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/19/retail-sales-in-great-britain-rise-despite-cost-of-living-crisis\">were higher</a> in July than they were in June despite the progressively tighter squeeze on living standards. Airports are busy with holidaymakers, house prices keep on rising. Odd sort of crisis, you might think.</p> <p>One possibility is that the gloom surrounding the economy has been overdone. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/19/retail-sales-in-great-britain-rise-despite-cost-of-living-crisis\">Unemployment is low</a> and job vacancies are high. People are not fearful of losing their jobs and if they are laid off they can hope to find another one relatively quickly.</p> <p>Demand for foreign holidays is strong because many households built up savings during the pandemic when spending opportunities were restricted. Those cash buffers are now being drawn down, bridging the cost of living gap left by rising inflation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/31/era-of-soaring-house-prices-is-ending-as-central-banks-raise-rates\">Era of soaring house prices is ending as central banks raise rates | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, the Bank of England has raised interest rates at the last six meetings of its monetary policy committee, but in real terms – adjusted for inflation – borrowing costs are still low. Put together all these factors and there is a case for saying the UK will experience a relatively mild downturn this winter.</p> <p>Even the dire state of consumer confidence can be explained away, because a breakdown of the latest snapshot of sentiment shows people are much gloomier about the state of the economy than they are about their personal finances. The wall-to-wall negative reports about a looming cost of living crisis has been registered but, so far at least, households think they are managing.</p> <p>It is curious, to say the least, that confidence as measured by GfK is reported to be lower than it was during the three-day week of early 1974, the deep manufacturing recession of the early 1980s and the period in 2008 when it looked as if the banking system would collapse. That may reflect the ubiquitous nature of modern media, and particularly social media, rather than objective economic conditions.</p> <p>That is the upbeat view. There is an alternative, with consumers in denial about the horrors to come and having a last splurge of spending before they tighten their belts during autumn’s perfect storm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/10/what-cost-of-living-crisis-tory-hopefuls-fuss-over-tax-cuts-is-devoid-of-reality\">What cost of living crisis? Tory hopefuls’ fuss over tax cuts is devoid of reality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The gloomy view of the economy goes something like this. Growth has pretty much ground to a standstill in the first six months of 2022, with output rising a bit in the first quarter and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/aug/12/uk-economy-gbp-energy-prices-crisis-inflation-bank-of-england-growth-recession-fears-ftse-business-live\">falling marginally </a>in the second quarter. The labour market has reached a turning point: employment growth is stalling and the number of job vacancies is coming down.</p> <p>For now, this is a relatively slow process and many businesses are able to pay more than they would like to attract and retain staff. For the moment, they feel they can pass on the cost of higher wages to their customers by raising prices. The pickup in retail sales growth will do little to discourage them from doing so. This will feed through into core inflation – the cost of living excluding food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco – which is closely watched by the Bank of England and which rose above 6% last month.</p> <p>A double-digit inflation rate and signs that consumer demand is holding up make it more likely the Bank will raise rates by 0.5 percentage points next month, after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-1-point-75-per-cent-in-biggest-hike-in-27-years\">similar increase </a>in August.</p> <p>This will add to the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses just as higher domestic fuel prices bite. October’s increase in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/09/uk-energy-bills-forecast-to-hit-4266-from-january\">energy price cap </a>will push up the annual inflation rate still further, intensifying the squeeze on real incomes and massively adding to the fixed costs for millions of businesses.</p> <p>There has been plenty of attention paid to what the successor to Boris Johnson will do to alleviate the pain about to be inflicted on households, but less focus on what they ought to be doing to help businesses. In the short term, restaurants, hotels and high street shops will try to pass on their higher costs but they will be less able to do so as consumer demand weakens in the autumn than they have been in the summer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/19/uk-small-businesses-forced-to-close-by-soaring-energy-bills\">Many will throw in the towel</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Industrial unrest will provide another dimension. Figures from the Office for National Statistics last week showed total annual pay growth in the private sector running at 5.9% and 1.8% for the public sector.</p> <p>With inflation running at 10.1%, that represents a cut in living standards of more than 4% in the private sector and more than 8% in the much more heavily unionised public sector. Inevitably, there will be more strikes as workers – who can justifiably say they are not responsible for the cost of living crisis – seek to prevent themselves from getting even poorer.</p> <p>The Bank of England leans towards the gloomier of these two scenarios, which is why it is forecasting a protracted recession for the UK in which unemployment rises by more than a million. Threadneedle Street thinks the good news (such as strong retail sales) is unlikely to persist, and that looks like a reasonable call.</p> <p>While that won’t stop the Bank from continuing to raise interest rates in the short-term, by this time next year the monetary policy committee will be under pressure to cut them. The economy might appear to be strong. The labour market might seem to be defying gravity. But it is really just a mirage. Consumers are right to be downbeat even if they don’t yet quite appreciate what is coming.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/21/watch-out-smart-doorbell-open-invitation-cyber-attackers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T08:30:04Z","webTitle":"We can make our phones harder to hack but complete security is a pipe dream | John Naughton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/watch-out-smart-doorbell-open-invitation-cyber-attackers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/watch-out-smart-doorbell-open-invitation-cyber-attackers","fields":{"headline":"We can make our phones harder to hack but complete security is a pipe dream","trailText":"Even the latest iPhone scare won’t persuade us to choose safety over convenience","byline":"John Naughton","body":"<p>Apple caused a stir a few weeks ago when it <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/07/apple-expands-commitment-to-protect-users-from-mercenary-spyware/\" title=\"\">announced</a> that the forthcoming update of its mobile and laptop operating systems would contain an optional high-security mode that would provide users with an unprecedented level of protection against powerful “spyware” software that surreptitiously obtains control of their devices.</p> <p>It’s called Lockdown Mode and, according to Apple, “offers an extreme, optional level of security for the very few users who, because of who they are or what they do, may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from NSO Group and other private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware”.</p> <p>Lockdown is effectively an alternative operating system mode. To turn it on, go to settings, choose it and restart your device. When you do, you find yourself with a rather <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-ios-16-lockdown-mode/\" title=\"\">different iPhone</a>. Browsing the web is clunkier, for example, because Lockdown blocks many of the speed and efficiency tricks that Safari uses to render web pages. Some complex but widely used web technologies, like so-called just-in-time JavaScript compilation, which allow websites to run programs inside your browser, are disabled unless you specifically exclude a website from restriction. Still, more people might be persuaded to plump for greater security after vulnerabilities were revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/18/apple-security-flaw-hack-iphone-ipad-macs\" title=\"\">on Apple devices</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no such thing as a completely secure networked device</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lockdown also limits all kinds of incoming invitations and requests (for example, from FaceTime) unless you have specifically asked for them. In messages, the phone won’t show link previews and will block all attachments with the exception of a few standard image formats. Nor will it allow access to anything physically plugged into it. And so on.</p> <p>The result of engaging Lockdown is that you have an iPhone that is more secure but less convenient to use. And, in a way, that is the most significant thing about Apple’s decision. As the security guru <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/07/apples-lockdown-mode-2.html\" title=\"\">Bruce Schneier</a> puts it: “It’s common to trade security off for usability and the results of that are all over Apple’s operating systems – and everywhere else on the internet. What they’re doing with Lockdown Mode is the reverse: they’re trading usability for security. The result is a user experience with fewer features, but a much smaller attack surface. And they aren’t just removing random features; they’re removing features that are common attack vectors.”</p> <p>Ever since people started to worry about computer safety, the issue has been framed as striking a balance between security and convenience. Up to now, convenience has been winning hands down. Take passwords. Everyone knows that long, complex passwords are more secure than simple ones, but they’re also hard to remember. So, being human, we don’t use them: in 2021, the five most <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords\" title=\"\">commonly used passwords</a> were: 123456, 123456789, 12345, qwerty and password.</p> <p>In the era of mainframe computers and standalone PCs, this kind of laxity didn’t matter too much. But as the world became networked, the consequences of carelessness have become more worrying. Why? Because there is no such thing as a completely secure networked device and we have been adding such devices to the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) on a maniacal scale. There are something like 13bn at the moment; by 2030, the tech industry thinks there might be <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1183457/iot-connected-devices-worldwide/\" title=\"\">30bn</a>.</p> <p>The conventional adjective for these gizmos is “smart”. They can be “hi-tech” items such as smart speakers, fitness trackers and security cameras, but also standard household things such as fridges, lightbulbs and plugs, doorbells, thermostats and so on. From a marketing point of view, their USPs are flexibility, utility and responsiveness – in other words, convenience.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In our Gadarene rush into the Internet of Things we are busily creating an attack surface of near-infinite dimensions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But smart is a euphemism that tactfully conceals the fact that they are tiny computers that are connected to the internet and can be remotely controlled from a smartphone or a computer. Some are made by reputable companies, but many are products of small outfits in China and elsewhere. They come with default usernames and passwords (such as “admin” and “password”) that buyers can change (but usually don’t). Because they’re networked, they are remotely accessible by their owners and, more importantly, by others. And there are billions of them out there in our homes, offices and factories.</p> <p>Security researchers use the term “attack surface” to describe the number of possible points where an unauthorised user can access a system, extract data and/or inflict damage. The smaller the surface, the easier it is to protect. Unfortunately, the corollary also holds. In our Gadarene rush into the Internet of Things we are creating an attack surface of near-infinite dimensions.</p> <p>The strange thing is that we already know what the consequences of this are like and yet seem unperturbed by them. In 2016, the security community was transfixed by a number of huge <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack\" title=\"\">distributed denial-of-service attacks</a> that caused outages, internet congestion and in one case overwhelmed the website of a prominent security guru.</p> <p>Such attacks used to be conducted by botnets of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet\" title=\"\">thousands of infected PCs</a> but the 2016 ones were carried out by a botnet that included perhaps half-a-million infected “smart” gizmos. The Mirai malware that assembled the botnet <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/\" title=\"\">scoured the web</a> for IoT devices protected by little more than factory-default usernames and passwords and then enlisted them in attacks that hurled junk traffic at an online target until it could no longer function.</p> <p>Mirai is still around, so you might not be the only entity benefiting from those fancy new networked lightbulbs. The cost of convenience will be higher than we think. So upgrade those passwords.</p> <p><em>• </em>John Naughton chairs the advisory board of the <a href=\"https://mctd.ac.uk\" title=\"\">Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy</a> at Cambridge</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/seamas-oreilly-when-cbeebies-stage-a-show-at-the-globe-even-shakespeare-would-have-loved-the-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T08:30:04Z","webTitle":"When CBeebies stage a show at the Globe, even Shakespeare would have loved the drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/seamas-oreilly-when-cbeebies-stage-a-show-at-the-globe-even-shakespeare-would-have-loved-the-drama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/seamas-oreilly-when-cbeebies-stage-a-show-at-the-globe-even-shakespeare-would-have-loved-the-drama","fields":{"headline":"When CBeebies stage a show at the Globe, even Shakespeare would have loved the drama","trailText":"Children’s TV stars dressed as Elizabethans have my four-year-old and me enthralled","byline":"Séamas O’Reilly","body":"<p>As we stroll into the Globe, my son gasps. ‘We’re here!’ he says, heartily impressed. It would be wonderful to say this was due to some precocious adoration of England’s bard on his part, but he’s actually recognising it from the ads he’d seen for the Globe on the tube a few days earlier, and which I’d painstakingly reminded him he would be visiting very soon. Since this poster was right beside a much brighter poster advertising <em>Paw Patrol</em> LIVE at Wembley Arena, it took considerably more time to explain that his favourite troupe of libertarian canines would not be in attendance. He would, however, see some of his favourite TV characters, since this was a CBeebies performance of <em>As You Like It</em>, featuring some of the channel’s biggest stars.</p> <p>CBeebies is, of course, a staple of both our lives.

To me, he’s often been something like a co-parent. I don’t think there’s a parent in the UK who doesn’t value the contribution they make to society, and there’s a fair majority who’d burn Downing Street to the ground if their proposed, unjustified cuts to CBBC exceed their reach and target its younger sibling. This is not a neutral position, but I refuse to adopt one. There is such a thing as a public good, and thoughtful, diverse and informative free-to-air children’s programming is just such a thing. We’re just lucky that beyond all that, CBeebies programming is also funnier, smarter, sillier and wiser than it has to be, year after year.</p> <p>I have had misgivings about their output before – you will remember the mild nervous breakdown I suffered while trying to work out the relative scales of characters on <em>In The Night Garden</em> – but when I got the chance to see the stars of the CBeebies House, <em>Andy’s Dinosaur Adventure</em> and <em>Something Special</em> donning Elizabethan garb in a big wooden sphere, it was an easy yes. In fact, it was the easiest yes since that time this magazine offered me a spa photoshoot in which my four-month-old baby would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jan/13/25-holidays-retreats-to-reboot-your-life-yoga-surfing-pool-spas\" title=\"\">be pictured with cucumber slices on his eyes</a>.</p> <p>Now his eyes are wide open, taking in the tiered seating that rises around the stage like a gladiatorial arena. In truth, I don’t know which of us is more enthralled. In my 11 years in London, I’ve never even been to the big, outside bit of the Globe and I’m astonished by the scale and detail. I’d put <em>As You Like It</em> down in my head as one of those comedies where the women all dress like men – and I am proven correct as the show unfolds. I watch as a four-year-old boy is transported by period surroundings, 400-year-old language and just enough modern whizzbangery to keep him rapt with every word.</p> <p>Star power doesn’t hurt, and Beatlemania erupts in the auditorium when Justin Fletcher takes the stage. As he bounds toward the yelping crowd, I share my son’s delight.

He also stood three times for the leadership of the party, twice narrowly failing. He has cast his vote in the current Tory leadership election, but refuses to say for whom he plumped.</p> <p><strong>We’re facing a cost of living crisis, with growing inflation and the ongoing war in Ukraine. How should these problems be dealt with?<br></strong>In the short term, we’ve got to go through probably a very serious economic crisis. I’ve felt for some time that we’re bound to have a very severe recession. And if we’re not careful, it’s going to be combined with very bad inflation, which does social, as well as economic damage. Brace yourself for it, but living standards generally are going to fall for the first time for a long time, and the main short-term measures should be to protect the very poor, very vulnerable and stop us seeing any increase in the number of people becoming destitute in this country. The government shouldn’t be asking themselves, what is the <em>Daily Mail</em> going to be saying tomorrow but what is the economy going to look like in a couple of years’ time when we have an election?</p> <p><strong>As a former chancellor of the exchequer, what do you think of the idea, put forward by Liz Truss in the Tory leadership campaign, that tax cuts will trigger economic growth?<br></strong>The simplistic idea that tax cuts will automatically produce growth is nonsense. Everybody would do it if that worked. There’s a slight touch of the Argentinian or Venezuelan government about it. This is not a time for tax cuts because we have incurred enormous public expenditure, which I supported, to stave off the worst effects of Covid-19, leading to enormous public debts. Tax cuts will stimulate growth in demand, but the problems are with the difficulties in supply, so they will push inflation further up.</p> <p><strong>You’ve been involved in politics for </strong><strong>nearly 60 years. How would you describe the political culture that we have at the moment?<br></strong>It has completely changed since I started. The politics of the early 1960s was very class based. Parliament was more powerful than it is today, but it was rather a distant and remote institution from the general public. The two parties were based on totally different principles – the existing social order, stability, on the Conservative side, and the struggle of the working class and a future socialism on the Labour side. The tone of debate was less aggressive, less frenzied. In those days, people voted for the same party as their family and very few people changed their votes at elections. Nowadays people have more polarised opinions, and no particular loyalty to anybody. Their politics are really volatile, and conducted in a bad-tempered way with a media-dominated debate, which concentrates on personalities rather than issues and avoids anything of any complexity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The present is anarchic, with nobody who can project to the public that they will make any significant difference</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What about the politicians themselves, have they got worse, as it is often said?<br></strong>When I find myself thinking that, I count to 10, because I know that this is what happens to veterans in every walk of life. Every elderly footballer, every elderly cricketer, every elderly politician, starts saying, what on earth are things coming to, why don’t we have people of the same quality today? But I suspect, when I was a young, keen beginner in politics, there were old boys in the House of Commons saying to each other, good grief what is the world coming to?</p> <p><strong>What have been the hinge events in your time in politics that you feel could have led to a better place had they gone in a different way?<br></strong>I think the fall of Margaret Thatcher brought the division on Europe in the Conservative party to a bitter and destructive level that has continued ever after. Margaret was convinced that it was all some kind of pro-European plot that brought her down and the worst of her friends encouraged her to believe that, leading to an absurd division over the ridiculous Maastricht treaty. It was a real turning point in the atmosphere inside the Conservative party and began the destructive Conservative civil war, which cost us office in 1997 and caused disaster eventually for David Cameron, when he foolishly called a referendum in 2016. I was very angry because he announced it without consulting his cabinet at all. He just did it to appease the rightwing backbenchers, to get them to stay quiet. It hadn’t crossed his mind that he might lose the referendum.</p> <p><strong>Can you ever imagine the UK returning to the EU?<br></strong>Not in the foreseeable, no. I satisfied my conscience by voting against article 50, when the courts overruled the government and said parliament did have a role. After that, I decided it was settled and all over. What mattered was the terms of our leaving because nobody had a clue what leaving the EU meant. And it was very important that we negotiated something that minimised the practical damage, which no member of the public had voted for, on issues that hadn’t even been considered in the referendum at all. We haven’t got Brexit done. It might be possible to develop a more tangible and grownup relationship with Europe over the next few years. But any idea we can go back into the European Union and sign up for the project again is for the birds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d416f13e2e2cff6fadf80cdb980c8784aee3f06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d416f13e2e2cff6fadf80cdb980c8784aee3f06/0_70_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clarke with Tony Blair and Michael Heseltine at the launch of the cross-party Britain in Europe campaign, October 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clarke with Tony Blair and Michael Heseltine at the launch of the cross-party Britain in Europe campaign, October 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You stood three times for the Tory leadership and polls showed that you were the most popular with the general public, so how difficult is it to play to the party membership while still keeping an eye on the nation at large?<br></strong>Two of the three times, I led at every every stage of MPs’ votes and all the rest of it, and lost at the final one because I was seen as too pro-European for the Conservative party members. The members are not typical of Conservative voters, let alone of the general public. My backers were always urging me to make a Eurosceptic speech in order to ease people’s fears. And I wouldn’t. I could see no point in compromising myself by promising things I didn’t believe in.</p> <p><strong>You once said the idea that Boris Johnson would become prime minister was “ridiculous”. How do you think he did?<br></strong>He’s delightful company, very entertaining with a big personality, and he is highly intelligent, but he has a temperament that makes him unsuitable for political office. There’s no particular political subject that he has strong views on. He tried to get in apparatchiks to actually run the government, first Dominic Cummings and then, after he fell out with him, the country has been run by a lot of Carrie’s friends. He purged the party of some of its very best future leading figures and put Brexiteer yes men and women in the cabinet to largely disastrous effect.</p> <p><strong>Who do you think was the best leader the Conservative party never had?<br></strong>In my personal opinion, it was a great loss for the country that we didn’t have Michael Heseltine as prime minister. But I didn’t vote for Michael after Margaret resigned, because I thought he would divide the party. Having wielded the knife, he couldn’t wear the crown. Had I known at the time that the party was going to rip itself apart anyway, I might have gone for Hezza.</p> <p><strong>Who will win the next general election?<br></strong>You should never predict a general election with two years to go. In the present simplistic, polarised, populist, rancorous state of political debate, faced with the worst combination of problems, and war, the state of the health service and social care, who knows? It’s anarchic, the present situation, with nobody emerging on either side who can project to the public the confidence that they will make any significant difference.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/21/red-rose-review-marriage-bad-sisters-sharon-horgan-the-sky-at-night-james-webb-space-telescope","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T08:30:03Z","webTitle":"The week in TV: Red Rose; Marriage; Bad Sisters; The Sky at Night","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/21/red-rose-review-marriage-bad-sisters-sharon-horgan-the-sky-at-night-james-webb-space-telescope","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/21/red-rose-review-marriage-bad-sisters-sharon-horgan-the-sky-at-night-james-webb-space-telescope","fields":{"headline":"The week in TV: Red Rose; Marriage; Bad Sisters; The Sky at Night","trailText":"The makers of Sex Education concoct a gripping tech horror; Sean Bean and Nicola Walker bicker beautifully; and Sharon Horgan’s new sibling comedy is a hoot","byline":"Hannah Jane Parkinson","body":"<p><strong>Red Rose</strong> BBC Three | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0cpqxs6/red-rose-series-1-5-lockdown\">iPlayer</a><br><strong>Marriage</strong> BBC One | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0cpndzj/marriage-series-1-episode-1\">iPlayer</a><br><strong>Bad Sisters</strong> <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/bad-sisters/umc.cmc.14kr4vv65unannh7doqgvlh20\">Apple TV+</a><br><strong>The Sky at Night</strong> BBC Four | <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001b6m6/the-sky-at-night-the-james-webb-road-trip\">iPlayer</a></p> <p>A horror show called <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0cpqlr7\">Red Rose</a></strong>? Not a docuseries on Labour’s performance at the 2019 general election, but a BBC/Netflix collaboration from Eleven, the rapidly-rising production outfit that brought us <em>Sex Education</em>. The Red Rose in question is a creepy app that, downloaded on to the phones of post-GCSEs teens in Bolton, Lancashire, begins to manipulate them, on a spectrum from snogging their best friend’s boyfriend to suicide-possibly-murder.</p> <p>There’s a core group of friends loosening their school ties ahead of summer: the headstrong Rochelle, the beautiful Wren, the sharp-witted Ash, the nerdy Taz and the sweet Antony. Their plans for summer include getting pissed on the nearby moors, not terrorisation via iOS.</p> <p>The idea of a horror series located in a northern British town is a great one, given how rare horror is on UK screens and how London-centric TV drama is here. It’s a similar vibe to how <em>Stranger Things</em>’ eerie Upside Down was discovered in a rural town in Indiana and not the New York subway.</p> <p>But with shows in which viewers are required to suspend disbelief to immerse themselves in the supernatural (and there are definitely not-of-this-realm elements to the menacing <em>Red Rose</em>, including a flickering, ghost-like figure hiding in camera mode), the details of authentic existence have to be just that. There are perfectly pitched realities here: food bank use and pre-payment meters flashing zero will be familiar in a cost-of-living crisis, but certain elements are head-scratching.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The silences in Marriage make Pinter seem like a chatterbox</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Why, for example, is a kid in 2022 filming a party with a camcorder? And while there is a vogue for playing with time and setting (see the brilliant <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/04/the-end-of-the-fing-world-review-coal-black-comedy-makes-a-killer-return\">The End of the F***ing World</a> </em>and its mashup of droll modern-day teens, with 60s architecture and soundtrack), there is a particular stylistic choice in <em>Red Rose</em> that has, appropriately, haunted me: a motif of a choral version of Aqua’s Barbie Girl. I’m a big fan of juxtaposition in television soundscapes, but in this case we get mourners throwing dirt on a coffin to a quivering voice singing “life in plastic/ it’s fantastic”, which would maybe work if the person had died of a botched cosmetic procedure, but literally only then.</p> <p>Nevertheless, <em>Red Rose</em> reminds me a bit of the breakout tech-thriller <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/06/chloe-review-erin-doherty-is-outstanding-in-this-social-media-thriller\">Chloe</a></em>, in that I was adamant I did not like it, then watched the first three episodes with nary a loo break. I’m intrigued as to whether the malevolent app will turn out to be purely of the paranormal variety, or will go the route of <em>Black Mirror</em>’s Shut Up and Dance episode, which featured black-hat coders, the likes of which are generally terrifying and already wreaking havoc IRL.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46b85a307a0cd2643cca367c5ac3e5b74ee427a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46b85a307a0cd2643cca367c5ac3e5b74ee427a1/0_128_6048_3627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Bean and Nicola Walker, in for the long haul in Marriage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean Bean and Nicola Walker, in for the long haul in Marriage. BBC/The Forge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rory Mulvey/BBC/The Forge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From teens to parents: Nicola Walker (Emma) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/14/sean-bean-interview-marriage-nicola-walker-chatterley\">Sean Bean</a> (Ian) have been married for 27 years, with a uni-age adopted daughter, Jess, and a son who died, although we don’t immediately know how. From writer Stefan Golaszewski (<em>Mum</em>; <em>Him &amp; Her</em>), <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0cpnd15\">Marriage</a></strong> will divide audiences into those who think it slow and plotless, and those who think it beautiful in its quietness and characterisation. We open with Emma and Ian bickering about a jacket potato in an airport cafe, before she offers a supportive hand to soothe his fear of flying. This gentle back-and-forth sets the tone. Sure, nothing much happens in episode one, but that’s rather the point. Ian, who has lost his job and his mother (unclear what Lady Bracknell would make of this), loads the dishwasher a lot. Emma’s attempts to talk to her elderly father go unrewarded. The silences in <em>Marriage</em> make Pinter seem like a chatterbox.</p> <p>If I’m honest, the monotony of this suburban life rather horrifies me. But there is a lot of love, kindness and loyalty – something that Jess’s obnoxious, snobbish boyfriend on a visit from London is too entitled to appreciate (as in <em>Red Rose</em>, we’re in the north). There are wonderful observations: Ian’s lonely loitering and friendly but extended conversations with a millennial receptionist crosses into mild harassment – though he is mortified when he realises. And there are developments on the horizon: I’m wondering about the history between Emma and her smarmy, younger boss (Henry Lloyd-Hughes) at her office job. There are four episodes, and I care enough about these characters to continue. It should go without saying that Walker and Bean are excellent throughout.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there are darker goings on in the Garvey family; five Irish sisters, with vastly differing personalities but shared loyalties, in Sharon Horgan’s latest, <strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/bad-sisters/umc.cmc.14kr4vv65unannh7doqgvlh20\">Bad Sisters</a></strong> (the concept is borrowed from a Belgian show, transferred to just outside Dublin, and is an AppleTV+ original). The pilot is called The Prick, and within seconds we’re confronted with a corpse in an open coffin with an unfortunate erection. You know <em>Bad Sisters</em> is going to be immense fun, and smart – especially when the next shot is Horgan’s Eva holding a hose at waist-height watering some roses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ee19ab465c5d263e98c34ba08fa3bea40ffa20e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ee19ab465c5d263e98c34ba08fa3bea40ffa20e/0_0_6008_3607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne-Marie Duff, Saise Quinn, Sharon Horgan, Eva Birthistle, Sarah Greene and Eve Hewson in Bad Sisters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne-Marie Duff, Saise Quinn, Sharon Horgan, Eva Birthistle, Sarah Greene and Eve Hewson in Bad Sisters.

He’s even worse than Jess’s boyfriend in <em>Marriage</em>. That John Paul ends up dead and four of the five sisters despised him does not go unnoticed by an insurance broker desperate to avoid paying out a life policy – something possible if he can prove foul play. Given that in flashback we’ve seen the sisters cackling about how they might murder John Paul (“I’d feed him to sharks!”), it’s not an awful hunch. Cue a black comedy of investigation.</p> <p>As you might expect, <em>Bad Sisters</em> is a hoot, with some fantastic set pieces, both gentle and elaborate: sea swimming on Christmas Day; gas explosions in wood cabins; Lizzo concerts. The cast is exquisite, and includes man-of-the-moment Daryl McCormack (better known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/19/good-luck-to-you-leo-grande-review-emma-thompson-excels-in-stagey-sex-comedy\">Leo Grande</a>). There are 10 episodes in all, and I intend to eke them out.</p> <p>To Warwick University, where <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mk7h\">The Sky at Night</a></strong> presenter Chris Lintott gets to view, along with buzzing students, the very first images – “stunning, iconic, beautiful”, as Lintott accurately describes them – from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/james-webb-space-telescope\">James Webb space telescope</a>. “Many people have been waiting 20 years for this moment,” he tells us, which explains why all of the scientists and professors who contribute to this programme are fizzing with excitement.</p> <p>Lintott takes us on a road trip of experts: Dr Hannah Wakeford at Bristol University explains exoplanets to us; a Cardiff academic schools us on dying stars. Watching <em>The Sky at Night</em> is, for mainstream audiences, like reading <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, or the joy I explicitly felt in 2012 when Cern’s Large Hadron Collider detected the Higgs boson particle. A discovery only bettered by finding out last week that Olivia Newton-John’s grandfather was the physicist, Nobel prize winner and subject of my school study project, Max Born. The result of <em>The Sky at Night</em> is that I spent last night ordering physics books online; it’s a half hour everybody on the planet can enjoy.</p> <h2>What else I’m watching</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81045829\">Echoes</a> <br></strong>(Netflix)<br>Look, there’s never going to be a solo performance of twins better than Lindsay Lohan in <em>The Parent </em><em>Trap</em>, but Michelle Monaghan gives it a good go in this thriller.

Ten years is too late,” she said.</p> <p>“(Drainage) is the best option for urgent flood mitigation for the community, who are filled with fear and uncertainty about what ... coming weeks might bring.”</p> <p>Meteorologists have warned Australia is in for a third year of La Nina weather, meaning more rain for NSW as it grapples with the devastating fallout of two recent major floods.</p> <p>Hawkesbury locals heard from a University of NSW engineering expert, <strong>Dr</strong> <strong>Stuart</strong> <strong>Khan</strong>, on Saturday who said draining the dam ahead of floods threatened Sydney’s drinking water supply.</p> <p>Dr Khan said other water sources would be needed to help prop up the water supply if Warragamba needed to be drained.</p> <p>“Reducing the current water storage in Warragamba Dam is a realistic alternative to raising the dam wall,” he said.</p> <p>“No solution provides complete protection from flooding, maintaining a lower water storage in Warragamba can significantly mitigate many floods, reducing peak flood heights and enabling additional evacuation time.”</p> <p>A recent independent report and a separate parliamentary inquiry on NSW’s flood response suggested raising the dam wall could delay key infrastructure flooding by 11 hours, including the vital evacuation route on Windsor Bridge.</p>  <figure class=\"element

the community “particularly gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men” to be vigilant for symptoms following the local transmission.</p> <p>There have been 42 monkeypox cases identified in the state including one case that acquired their infection in NSW and two that acquired their infection within Australia.</p> <p>Victoria is also on alert after detecting community transmission in “about half” of the state’s 40 cases.</p> <p>NSW Health executive director of health protection <strong>Dr Richard Broome </strong>urged the community to remain “vigilant” for symptoms regardless of whether they’d visited high risk areas.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Men who have sex with men who are returning from overseas should contact their GP or local sexual health clinic for a check-up when they return as symptoms of monkeypox can be mild.</p> <p>Symptoms usually begin seven to 14 days after exposure through skin-to-skin contact and can include fever, headache, body aches and a rash or lesions on the genital area.</p> <p>It is important that people with these symptoms avoid close contact with others, including sexual activity, as condoms are not effective at preventing the transmission of monkeypox.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>NSW Health</strong> has been prioritising “high-risk” groups in the rollout of the latest smallpox vaccine while retaining a “small stock” for post-exposure prophylaxis.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We continue to work with our community partners to formulate a plan to rollout the additional doses of the Jynneos smallpox vaccine

of the Ediacaran explosion of life when the earliest forms of complex multicellular animal life evolved.</p> </blockquote> <p>The geological and paleontological forms within the Flinders Ranges make it an important site to pursue World Heritage status, the minister said.</p> <p>Lead authors of the heritage bid have toured several key sites to assess the scientific values of sites including along the <strong>Brachina</strong> <strong>Geological</strong> <strong>Trail</strong> and in <strong>Nilpena</strong> <strong>Ediacara</strong> <strong>national</strong> <strong>park</strong>.</p> <p>The

South Wales minister for the environment <strong>James</strong> <strong>Griffin</strong> has announced a $9.1m plan to restore lost biodiversity to Sydney Harbour and improve water quality.</p> <p>Griffin said in a statement on Sunday that under the program kelp forest would be regrown in the harbour to provide marine habitats for penguins, seals, seahorses and turtles.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Celebrated Australian writer <strong>Clive</strong> <strong>James</strong> reminisced about our magnificent Sydney Harbour, likening it to ‘crushed diamond’, and we want to restore that same brilliance to the habitats that lie beneath the surface.</p> <p>Sydney Harbour is a modern, working harbour at the beating heart of our city, but the effects of urbanisation and industrial activity have resulted in the loss of marine habitats and the species that call them home.</p> <p>While Sydney’s water quality has significantly improved in recent decades, so much so that we all delight at sightings of whales and seals in the harbour, there’s no better time to supercharge our restoration efforts.</p> </blockquote> <p>Griffin said the project would involve installing hundreds of “living seawall” panels, replanting sea grasses and regrowing kelp forest in nine locations.</p> <p>The Seabirds to Seascapes project will also involve a census of little penguins in the state and a seal survey to learn more about the state’s resident fur seals.</p> <p>Seaweeds such as crayweed provide critical habitat and food for marine life. They also act as underwater forests, capturing carbon and creating oxygen.</p> <p>However, crayweed completely disappeared from the Sydney metropolitan region from Palm Beach to Cronulla in the 1980s due to pollution, and has never returned.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-21T01:56:50.946Z\">at 2.56am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-63015fa08f081780606cc301\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-21T01:15:33.734Z\">2.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Call for reform to Australia’s ‘needlessly complex’ skilled migration scheme</strong></p> <p>A report from <strong>Deloitte</strong> <strong>Access</strong> <strong>Economics</strong> has called for reform to Australia’s “needlessly complex” skilled migration system to deal with labour shortages.</p> <p>With skilled migration at a fraction of pre-pandemic levels, Deloitte partner <strong>Fiona</strong> <strong>Webb</strong> urged Australia to show it was “open for business” by cutting red tape.</p> <p>This was in the context, the report found, of the economy shifting to a more skilled and knowledge-based workforce, with jobs in the sector forecast to grow around 2.1% or 39,300 workers, yearly between now and June 2032.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Alongside policy to ensure we are developing the necessary skills for the future within Australia, there needs to be a focus on overhauling our needlessly complex skilled migration system to ensure we can also attract workers with the skills we need.</p> <p>The highest order priority is to clearly signal to the world that Australia is open for business.

Keith Pitt was the minister, and there is no trick to this. I’m giving you a straight answer. Keith Pitt was responsible on all issues. One issue, Pep-11. What do I need to do?

Why get vaccinated if there is nothing of concern to get vaccinated against?” he said.</p> <p>Reicher added it was important to be clear about the threat from Covid, noting for those who are unvaccinated – or for whom the vaccines do not work well – Omicron can pose a serious risk.</p> <p>“But even for those who have been vaccinated, it is important to get a booster, because immunity fades over time,” he said. “A booster will provide you with good protection against serious disease and death. It will also provide you with protection against long Covid.”</p> <p>But, he added: “It won’t protect you that well from infection and all the disruption that entails – which is why, alongside promoting the booster, the government need to be considering further measures – like testing and good ventilation – to bring infection levels down.”</p> <p>Finn also stressed the need for clear communication over the booster programme, including around which jab to have.</p> <p>“We need to make an effort to inform people and, above all, to avoid a scenario in which people ‘wait’ for a modified vaccine rather than take what is going – if supplies of the bivalent don’t meet demand,” he said.</p> <p>But there is room for optimism, Finn added. “If the logistics of giving people both Covid and flu jabs at the same visit work out, that will make a big difference [to booster uptake],” he said.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “It’s inaccurate to say that a significant number of people didn’t take up their spring booster,” noting that eight out of 10 of those aged 75 and over had the jab.</p> <p>“We are not complacent about Covid and our world-leading vaccination programme has saved countless lives. That’s why we continue to work hard to reach those people who are still unvaccinated against Covid, including using walk-in and mobile vaccination clinics to increase access and convenience.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/21/avanti-paid-shareholders-115m-despite-abysmal-service-for-rail-users","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Avanti paid shareholders £11.5m despite ‘abysmal’ service for rail users","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/avanti-paid-shareholders-115m-despite-abysmal-service-for-rail-users","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/avanti-paid-shareholders-115m-despite-abysmal-service-for-rail-users","fields":{"headline":"Avanti paid shareholders £11.5m despite ‘abysmal’ service for rail users","trailText":"Train operator under fire for dividend payment amid severe cuts on its west coast main line","byline":"Jon Ungoed-Thomas","body":"<p>The worst-performing rail operator in Britain, which has severely cut back its services, is revealed to have paid out more than £11m in shareholder dividends last year.</p> <p>Avanti West Coast, the operator of the west coast mainline, provoked passenger outrage last week by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/15/labour-demands-action-over-avanti-west-coast-reduced-train-service\" title=\"\">cutting services</a>.

Arbitrary <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/rwanda\" title=\"\">detention and torture</a> are the norm in dealing with his critics and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/31/hotel-rwanda-businessman-paul-rusesabagina-held-on-terror-charges\" title=\"\">even heroes</a> who saved thousands of lives during the genocide are not spared.

Many refugees from a previous scheme arranged by Israel were coerced and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-61882542\" title=\"\">forced to flee</a> the country.</p> <p>All this is well known. What the British government is trying to do is conceal the fact that this is its official view, too, in an attempt to salvage the Rwanda deportation scheme. Liz Truss is apparently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/19/liz-truss-accused-of-delaying-human-rights-report-over-criticism-of-rwanda\" title=\"\">holding up publication</a> of the Foreign Office’s annual human rights report so as not to make public its criticisms of the Kagame regime.</p> <p>Whenever anyone dares to criticise Rwanda online there is usually a swarm of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iainoverton/status/1559873860778041344\" title=\"\">Kagame-supporting trolls</a> trying to push back. Earlier this year, after the unveiling of the Rwanda deal drew public criticism, Rwandan government trolls were joined by a new online army: Tory ministers, MPs and media friends who suddenly discovered their anti-racist credentials.</p> <p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, claimed that criticism of the scheme “speaks of inbuilt prejudice and, I would even go as far as to say, racism”. Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski told the LBC broadcaster Iain Dale that the pushback was “<a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/iain-dale/criticisms-of-rwanda-are-very-very-racist-daniel-kawczynski/\" title=\"\">very, very racist</a>”. (The fact that Kawczynski seemed not to understand the scheme at all, believing that it was about allowing Rwanda “to process them [asylum seekers] for us” when it is actually a one-way deportation ticket might make one wary of his analytical capacities.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Liz Truss is apparently holding up publication of the Foreign Office’s report so as not to make public its criticisms of the Kagame regime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Conservative peer and adviser to the British Board of Trade Daniel Hannan claimed that the critics were displaying “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/danieljhannan/status/1517448641350455296?lang=en\" title=\"\">belittling and racist attitudes”</a>. “Rwanda is a safe and prosperous country, guys,” he insisted. “Try to get over your stereotypes about Africa.” Which might be true if a nation that locks up its dissidents and is defined by the World Bank as a <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/low-income-countries\" title=\"\">low-income country</a> and among the poorest nations of the world could be described as “safe and prosperous”.</p> <p>Politicians and journalists who seem to spend much of their time denouncing the “woke” and castigating them for throwing around unfounded accusations of racism were happy to make that very accusation when it was needed to provide camouflage for a particularly obnoxious government scheme. Those who defended the “hostile environment” policies that gave rise to the Windrush scandal were now apparently truly concerned about racism and insistent that any criticism of an African country must necessarily be bigoted. Even the “woke” might have blenched at such naked opportunism.</p> <p>Having said all this, we should also be clear that the problem with Patel’s Rwanda scheme lies not just in the Rwanda part but with the scheme itself. If the asylum seekers were being deported to a human rights utopia rather than to a human rights wasteland, the scheme would be equally unconscionable. “If it was France, if we were sending people to Sweden, New York, Sydney, would they [the critics] change their mind?” Patel asked. No, I wouldn’t. But it’s worth noting that it’s not a coincidence that the asylum seekers are being deported to a country such as Rwanda and not to ones such as France or Sweden.</p> <p>What we are seeing today are rich countries bolting their doors and getting poor countries to act as homeless shelters for their “unwanted”. Britain views asylum seekers as a political problem so it has used its economic clout and political weight to get a poorer country to clean up what it considers a mess. Indeed, the Home Office is looking for <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/uk-talking-to-ghanaian-government-about-how-it-can-help-alleviate-immigration-problems-now-deleted-tweet-suggests-12402463\" title=\"\">other developing countries</a> to provide a similar service, although many have already contemptuously <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/ghana-blasts-uks-operation-dead-25983192\" title=\"\">turned it down</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s not a coincidence that the asylum seekers are being deported to a country such as Rwanda and not to ones such as France or Sweden</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Patel’s deportation scheme is no different to rich countries exploiting poor ones as repositories for their <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/29/opinions/by-exporting-trash-rich-countries-put-their-waste-out-of-sight-and-out-of-mind-varkkey/index.html\" title=\"\">toxic waste</a>, except that the “toxic waste” in this case happens to be living, breathing people, people with dreams and hopes and aspirations who have been turned into commodities to be traded on the global stage.</p> <p>Britain is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/24/new-age-imperialism-west-no-need-to-conquer-money-coercion-do-job\" title=\"\">not alone</a> in this. Over the past decades, many rich nations have moved from keeping out asylum seekers to “offshoring” – using third countries as processing centres for asylum seekers – to straightforward mass deportation without any consideration of those involved, their backgrounds or their futures.</p> <p>From <a href=\"http://www.refugeeaction.org.au/?page_id=4528\" title=\"\">Australia dumping</a> asylum seekers in Manus and Nauru to the EU using militias and warlords in Africa to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/10/sunday-essay-how-we-colluded-in-fortress-europe-immigration\" title=\"\">capture and imprison</a> potential migrants before they can reach the Mediterranean, to America employing troops <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2908-empire-of-borders\" title=\"\">beyond its borders</a> to prevent unauthorised people from moving towards the US, keeping the unwanted within the realm of poor countries has become global phenomenon.</p> <p>As with the Rwanda scheme, rich nations’ obsession with using more impoverished ones as holding pens for the west’s unwanted has led them to <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2017/12/libya-european-governments-complicit-in-horrific-abuse-of-refugees-and-migrants/\" title=\"\">steamroll any consideration</a> of human rights or even the most basic norms of decency. What is developing is a new imperialism in which immigration controls have become a means of segregating the world into rich, gated nations and poorer ones that take care of potential migrants to the west.</p> <p>So, yes, we should be concerned about human rights abuses in Rwanda.

These are just some of the promises offered by the world’s personalised vitamin providers as I flick through their various questionnaires, each hinting at the tantalising possibility of looking healthier, happier and younger, all for the price of a subscription.</p> <p>I settle on one particular provider, Nourished, a company that offers an intriguing blend of tailored vitamins and 3D printing for a monthly fee of £35.99. Rather than popping a series of pills each morning, it promises to combine all the nutrients you need – based on your answers to questions that range from the minutiae of your exercise regime to how regularly you travel internationally – into a single layered gummy.</p> <p>As a 33-year-old journalist with a penchant for unhealthy snacking, I list my screen time as excessive, my goals as weight loss/toning and a little extra energy and wait as the algorithm whirs and spits out my results. A few days later, a sleek box arrives in the post, filled with little sachets marked “Personalised Nourishments for David”.</p> <p>Nourished is the brainchild of Birmingham-based entrepreneur Melissa Snover, a self-described “avid vitamin user” who previously ran a confectionery business 3D printing sweets. Snover says she conceived the idea for the company after spilling a bag of supplements while travelling through Düsseldorf airport. “I realised, maybe we could do something with 3D printing technology to combine everything into one easy, personalised format,” she tells me, “that was more enjoyable to take and more convenient, which would increase adherence.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It all looks bullshit.

Like most of its competitors Nourished makes big claims. Some of the benefits listed for my personalised combination of vitamin B12, tart cherry, beetroot, Lutemax 2020, ginger extract, white kidney bean extract and a probiotic called BPL1 include suppressing appetite, reducing cravings, protecting my eyes from blue light and boosting sleep quality.</p> <p>But when I run these ingredients past a series of nutrition experts, they are far from impressed. “It all looks bullshit,” says Margaret Rayman, professor of nutritional medicine at the University of Surrey. “I don’t think there’s much information about any of these things changing your sleep.”</p> <p>Clare Collins, professor of nutrition and dietetics at the University of Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, agrees, describing the ingredients as “bogus”, arguing that the research cited in support of them tends to be of low quality.</p> <p>Snover vigorously defends Nourished’s selections, saying that the research reports they use to vindicate the products they recommend are put through an extremely rigorous auditing process. “The Lutemax ingredient that you’ve got recommended is actually a patented ingredient based on lutein, which has tons and tons of clinical data around how it can protect your eyes,” she says. “We use a lot of patented ingredients because of the level of clinical data behind them. When it comes to white kidney bean extract, there’s a lot of data there too. We’re looking for research that has been peer reviewed, that has been published in a reputable journal, that has been done on a decent number of people.”</p> <p>However Collins says that when she had <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/do-vitamin-supplements-prevent-macular-degeneration-86519\">reviewed the literature</a>, in her opinion there was no good evidence lutein could protect your eye health. “There haven’t been the rigorous, randomised controlled trials with tolerability for dose, looking at the side-effects,” she says. “That research simply isn’t there.”</p> <p>In recent months, the rapid rise of the personalised vitamin industry has come under increasing scrutiny from journalists and academics. The global personalised retail nutrition and wellness market was valued <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/personalized-retail-nutrition-wellness-market\">at $1.8bn in 2020</a> and some of the biggest food companies in the world have begun eyeing up this lucrative new industry. In 2019, food and beverage conglomerate <a href=\"https://www.nestle.com/media/news/nestle-health-science-acquisition-persona\">Nestlé acquired</a> the personalised vitamin subscription service Persona for an undisclosed sum.</p> <p>But while consumers are flocking to providers in droves – after launching in January 2020, Nourished reported a turnover of £1.5m in its first year and now ships more than 10,000 boxes a month – questions are being raised over what is being marketed to consumers.</p> <p>When BBC journalists tested a range of personalised vitamin companies in May for their <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m00174dg\">Sliced Bread podcast</a>, including Vitl and Vitamin Buddy, they found that they were recommended exactly the same supplements, despite entering different details in the personalisation quiz.</p> <p>Emily Burch, an accredited practising dietitian and researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia, is particularly cynical about companies that charge more for every supplement they recommend. She believes that: “Many of these companies cherrypick and overinflate the results from single research studies that have low scientific evidence. Their website might say, ‘Oh, there is science behind this vitamin for this group of people,’ but the findings don’t conclusively support what they are claiming.”</p> <h2><strong>Do we really need vitamin pills at all?</strong></h2> <p>Burch’s scepticism points to some of the general issues with vitamins as a whole. These have long been one of the wellbeing industry’s most reliable income generators to the extent that in recent years, major pharma companies have even got in on the game. Pfizer, GSK, Novartis and Unilever all manufacture and sell their own vitamin supplements.</p> <p>Vitamin hype first began in the US in the 1940s, as people flocked to their neighbourhood drug stores to get their hands on these apparent wonder pills. Since then, they have never stopped, with the purported benefits of vitamins spreading around the globe and helping to create an industry that is now worth an estimated <a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/vitamins-and-supplements-market-104051\">$129.6bn</a> (£107.5bn).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I think some people see vitamins as an extra insurance policy, but they’re not without harm</p> <footer> <cite>Clare Collins, professor of nutrition and dietetics</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But despite decades of research – the US National Institutes of Health has <a href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2020/february/the-truth-about-supplements\">spent more than $2.4bn</a> studying vitamins and minerals since 1999 – the evidence for whether they can significantly alter your health remains unclear. While there is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefectscount/basics.html\">some data</a> to support the benefits of folic acid supplements in early pregnancy, and zinc may help slow down age-related macular degeneration, there is no good evidence that vitamins will make you live longer, slow cognitive decline or lower your chances of chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer or diabetes. A <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m2511\">2020 </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m2511\">British Medical Journal</a></em><a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m2511\"> analysis</a> states that “randomised trial evidence does not support use of vitamin, mineral, and fish oil supplements to reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases [cancer, cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes].”</p> <p>In fact, some of the clearest evidence has found that in certain cases, taking vitamins can actually harm your health, especially if you smoke or take existing medications that could interact with a particular supplement. Both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/apr/29/cancer.uknews\">vitamin A</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18429004/\">beta carotene</a> have been found to increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers, while <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/vitamin-k-can-dangerous-take-warfarin/\">vitamin K</a> can reduce the potency of blood thinners such as warfarin, and St John’s wort may make drugs such as antidepressants less effective.</p> <p>Nutrition experts tend to feel that the average, healthy person is far better off trying to get their essential vitamin intake through eating a balanced diet with a wide variety of vegetables and fruits, through which essential nutrients will be better absorbed by the body, rather than taking additional supplements. Rayman points out that tomatoes contain all your potassium requirements, while minerals such as selenium can be found in shellfish.</p> <p>Collins also cautions that people who take excessive amounts of supplements can be prone to a condition called hypervitaminosis, which refers to abnormally high storage levels of vitamins in fat tissue that can go on to cause problems. As an example of this, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657096\">some research</a> has associated folic acid supplementation with an increased risk of prostate cancer in men. Excessive levels of iron can accumulate in the brain, <a href=\"https://florey.edu.au/about/news-media/high-iron-levels-accelerate-alzheimers-disease-progress\">which has been associated</a> with different neurodegenerative diseases.</p> <p>“I think some people see vitamins as an extra insurance policy but they’re not without harm,” says Collins. “If you don’t need them, the water-soluble ones you’re weeing out and the fat-soluble ones just get stored in your adipose tissue in your body or in your liver. But if you eat more vegetables in contrast, there are no harms, only benefits.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>By and large, those who are  taking extra micronutrients don’t need them because they already have a healthy diet</p> <footer> <cite>Ailsa Welch, professor of nutritional epidemiology</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Specific dietary requirements</strong></h2> <p>Where nutritionists do see a role for vitamins is in individuals with specific medical conditions or dietary requirements, as they may be deficient in certain minerals. Burch describes how people living with chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease and Crohn’s disease, among others, have problems with vitamin absorption. Studies have also shown that people following a vegan diet are likely to benefit from <a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-b12\">additional vitamin B12</a> supplementation, although in all these cases it is advisable to seek professional advice from a dietitian.</p> <p>Ailsa Welch, professor of nutritional epidemiology at the University of East Anglia, says that the age group who might actually benefit most from personalised vitamins is the elderly, who are more likely to become deficient in certain nutrients. “People who tend to have vitamin deficiencies are particularly older men, living alone and living on a very restricted diet,” she says. “But by and large, those who are taking extra micronutrients are generally those who don’t need them because they already have a healthy diet.”</p> <p>This seems to fit the profile of most subscribers to personalised vitamin providers. Nourished says its core customer base is aged between 29 and 45, while a typical Made4 Vitamins customer lies somewhere between 25 and 45.</p> <p>Rayman argues that if personalised vitamin providers are really doing their job, their algorithms should be able to recommend the right supplements when presented with a profile of someone who is likely to be deficient in certain nutrients.</p> <p>To test this out, we created a specific user profile – Sania, a 29-year-old Indian woman living in the UK who follows a vegan diet and is trying to get pregnant. We then attempted to enter these details into a range of personalised nutrition providers: Nourished, Persona, Made4 Vitamins and Vitl.</p> <p>“They should recommend vitamin D because her skin is dark and so will have a higher requirement,” says Rayman. “They should also suggest B12, which is missing in all vegan foods, iodine, which is crucial for brain development in the womb, and the main source in the UK is milk, dairy products and fish, as well as calcium because vegans tend to be low and have higher risks of bone fracture. Finally, long-chain n-3 fatty acids or fish oils, which are vital for the developing baby’s brain and eyes and cannot be made up from a vegan diet.”</p> <p>The only provider that offered all these options, and suggested the expected supplements, was Persona. However, this was also by far the most expensive option – while Persona offer a 60% discount on month one, the usual price would be $98 (£81).</p> <p>It is clear that one of the major limitations with all of these providers is that the personalisation aspect relies entirely on a user-completed quiz. Some feel that, in future, new technologies such as genotyping or microbiome sequencing may be able to provide a more precise and scientific method of identifying who is deficient in which nutrients, but this research is in its early stages.</p> <p>“In terms of genotyping and vitamin deficiencies, the science is promising for some things, but it’s not concrete and 100% there yet,” says Burch. “The interaction of nutrients with genotypes is complex and involves a lot of different genetic variations, so it is difficult to pin this down to only one or two variations.”</p> <p>In the meantime, if you really want to take vitamin supplements, most nutritionists recommend saving your wallet and buying a multivitamin tablet.</p> <p>“The prices these companies are charging seem a bit ridiculous,” says Rayman. “If you have any doubt, you can buy yourself a multivitamin that contains, say, 10 micrograms of vitamin D, 50mcg of selenium and 140 or 150mcg of iodine… from any supermarket and it costs virtually nothing.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/21/the-twilight-world-by-werner-herzog-review-japanese-officers-infinity-war","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T08:00:03Z","webTitle":"The Twilight World by Werner Herzog review – Japanese officer’s infinity war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/21/the-twilight-world-by-werner-herzog-review-japanese-officers-infinity-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/21/the-twilight-world-by-werner-herzog-review-japanese-officers-infinity-war","fields":{"headline":"The Twilight World by Werner Herzog review – Japanese officer’s infinity war","trailText":"The German film-maker’s partly fictionalised account of an imperial army soldier who refused to surrender until 1974 frustratingly fails to get inside its fascinating subject’s head","byline":"Rob Doyle","body":"<p>We’ve all heard about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/17/hiroo-onoda-japanese-soldier-dies\">Japanese soldier who, after the second world war ended, stayed on the Philippine jungle island </a>where he was stationed, armed and lethal, dismissing all signs that Japan had been defeated as enemy propaganda. His name was Hiroo Onoda; he finally stood down in 1974 after almost 30 years of delusional guerrilla warfare and died in 2014. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/07/werner-herzog-twilight-world-fire-within-stunts-interview\">Werner Herzog</a>, the prolific German film-maker who narrates his documentaries in a Wagnerian register (wonderfully parodied in the YouTube video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvWh6PMi9Ek\">Werner Herzog Reads Where’s Waldo</a>?), contrived to meet Onoda in 1997 and has now written a very short, only partially satisfying book about him. <em>The Twilight World </em>is best described as a nonfiction account of Onoda’s long, pointless mission that phases in and out of fiction – or vice versa.</p> <p>So why didn’t Herzog do the obvious thing and make a film about Onoda instead? Perhaps because another film-maker got there first: Arthur Harari, whose impressive feature<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/17/onoda-10000-nights-in-the-jungle-review-a-captivating-tragicomedy\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/17/onoda-10000-nights-in-the-jungle-review-a-captivating-tragicomedy\">Onoda: 10,000 Nights in the Jungle </a></em>has recently been released. Stretches of <em>The Twilight World </em>read like a screenplay or documentary outline that’s been injected with prose fiction growth hormones. In the expository and digressive passages, it’s impossible not to hear Herzog’s famous voice ringing charismatically in the inner ear (just as that of Quentin Tarantino resounded unmistakably in his recent novelisation <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/06/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-by-quentin-tarantino-review-from-auteur-to-author\">Once Upon a Time</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/06/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-by-quentin-tarantino-review-from-auteur-to-author\"> in Hollywood</a></em>). If a less celebrated figure than Herzog presented their editor with a book this slight, they’d probably be sent back to their desk to imagine their way deeper into the psychic jungle, fleshing it out with a few more chapters. Which is to say: we’re here for the writer as much as for the story.</p> <p>This isn’t Herzog’s first book — he is the author, most notably, of the 1978 travel diary <em>Of Walking </em><em>in Ice </em> – but they’re rare enough to invite the question we always ask when a lauded artist switches lanes: will he make a tit of himself? The start is shaky – if they ever award a prize for ropiest opening lines, my money is on Herzog (and his translator Michael Hofmann): “The night coils in fever dreams. No sooner awake than with an awful shudder, the landscape reveals itself as a durable daytime version of the same nightmare, crackling and flickering like loosely connected neon tubes.” Happily, this hallucinatory nonsense is a false alarm: the prose soon settles into a less hysterical descriptiveness, with only the odd surreal apocalyptic flourish. The author wisely trusts in the story he’s telling – and with one this good, he can well afford to move out of the way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In its brevity, the book is sometimes as superficial as a Wikipedia entry – whole decades are skimmed over in a line or two</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1944, young intelligence officer Onoda is sent by his superior Major Taniguchi to Lubang Island with orders to destroy an airstrip, undermine the enemy American forces with guerrilla attacks and await the triumphant return of the imperial army – a mission he will cleave to for three decades with dizzying literal-mindedness. Taniguchi tells Onoda: “Your base of operations will be the jungle. Your campaign will be one of attrition. Skirmishes, ambushes, unpredictable attacks. You will be like a ghost, elusive, a continuing nightmare to the enemy. Your war will be without glory.” With three men at his command – the last of whom will be killed in the jungle in 1972, two years before Onoda surrenders – the soldier first engages the US forces in combat and then, after they leave, commences his absurd, prolonged resistance to a vanished adversary.</p> <p>In Herzog’s account, Onoda’s war assumes the glitchy, totalising paranoia of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/philipkdick\">Philip K Dick</a> novel. With elegantly insane anti-logic, he interprets all evidence that the war is over as proof of the contrary. Newspapers, leaflets dropped over the jungle from aircraft, radio broadcasts and even pornography are deemed intricate forgeries designed to trick him into surrendering. Characteristically, Herzog envisions Onoda as a kind of existential hero – his mission obscure, his trials unknown, his enemy vast and metaphysical. Existence and combat are one: “Every human being on this island is my enemy.” Onoda is also, of course, a bizarre excrescence of imperial Japan, whose pressure-cooker code of duty, honour and sacrifice he takes to self-negating extremes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c68923fa29a66a89fb05759f89f167e21c042016\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c68923fa29a66a89fb05759f89f167e21c042016/0_0_1747_2500/699.jpg\" alt=\"Hiroo Onoda leaving the jungle in 1974, when he was finally persuaded that peace had broken out\" width=\"699\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hiroo Onoda leaving the jungle in 1974, when he was finally persuaded that peace had broken out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In its brevity, <em>The Twilight World </em>is sometimes as superficial as a Wikipedia entry – whole decades are skimmed over in a line or two – and at times frustratingly withholding. Herzog informs us that “the matter of those he had killed among the population never quite went away”, but no deeper investigation or reimagining follows. A bit of Googling reveals that Onoda and his comrades may have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/world/asia/hiroo-onoda-imperial-japanese-army-officer-dies-at-91.html\">murdered as many as 30 people</a> during his three decades as a rogue commando – which would make him one of the 20th century’s weirdest serial killers. <em>The Twilight World </em>provokes – and thwarts – an appetite to know more. Nearing his 80th birthday, Herzog gives off the megalomaniacal vibe of one who won’t let old age slow him down, perhaps won’t even notice that it’s happening.

In five swift chapters, beginning with Combat, when Theseus kills the Minotaur, and ending with Deus Ex Machina (the titles are beamed on the back wall), he tells the story of Ariadne, half-sister of the monster, who gives Theseus the means of killing him, runs away with her hero, and is then abandoned by him.</p> <p>Each section has its own movement language, reflected in Eilon Morris’s ever-changing score, which moves from electronica to classical to the sound of Irish dancing.

She responds as if entranced, till they both appear weightless, dissolving into another life.</p> <p>It is incredibly beautiful and serene, with superb dancing from all concerned. <em>Minotaur</em> is cleverly paired with a stripped-back version of Benjamin Britten’s cantata for mezzo-soprano and orchestra <strong>Phaedra</strong>, the story of Ariadne’s sister, who marries Theseus, but is consumed by her passion for his son, Hippolytus. Originally composed for Janet Baker, it’s performed here with incredible intensity by Christine Rice, accompanied by Richard Hetherington on the piano.</p> <p>The clarity of Rice’s singing, and her deep involvement with the story, bring its terrible passions to heart-piercing life.

Such was the concern about artwork created for the play emerging on the open market and being mistaken for genuine examples that they had to destroy them every night – recreating them again the next time.</p> <p>Kwei-Armah said: “We broke them up… Every night we had to destroy anything that was painted.

He immediately saw the potential.</p> <p>McCarten, a writer and producer whose acclaimed biographical films include those of Stephen Hawking in <em>The Theory of Everything</em> and Freddie Mercury in <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>, is now reworking <em>The Collaboration</em> for the big screen in preparation for a shoot that begins in about three weeks’ time, mainly in the Lower East Side of New York, where the artists used to hang out. It has a budget of about $20m.</p> <p>Kwei-Armah said that the film differs from the play, which was led primarily by dialogue: “The play had two stars, Basquiat and Warhol.

Next month will see the first of a series of significant changes to a government scheme which moves “dormant” money from financial institutions to the charity sector.</p> <p>The Reclaim Fund, set up in 2011 to distribute the cash from bank and building society accounts that have been left unclaimed for at least 15 years, will start targeting dormant pension benefits, insurance assets, collective scheme investments and shares in FTSE-listed companies from early next year.</p> <p>Over the last 11 years, some £1.6bn has been taken from dormant bank accounts, £880m of which has been passed on to charities.</p> <p>The expanded scheme will bring in a large number of new financial products from the first three months of next year. A pilot starts next month.</p> <p>Once the accounts have passed a minimum number of years untouched – 12 in the case of some of the new additions – the provider will try to contact the holder and, if unsuccessful, will then pass on the money to the fund.</p> <p>“The government legislated to expand the scheme into broadly three new asset classes, the first of which is insurance and pensions, so the lost proceeds from contracts that people have with firms,” says chief executive Adrian Smith.</p> <p>“The second area is in FTSE-listed company shares. So if you had shares with Vodafone or Coca-Cola, or something like that, and you’d lost those shares, that would be the second sector.</p> <p>“The third is investments … unit trusts and investment bonds that you might have had with JP Morgan or Schroders, for example.”</p> <p>Dormant shares will be sold and the money passed on to the fund. It is estimated that another £880m could be transferred from these three new areas, but over a number of years.</p> <p>Under the existing scheme, about 40 banks and building societies transfer money every year to the fund. With the expansion, city firms across the insurance, pensions, investment and wealth management sectors will be able to join. This could amount to up to 500 new firms, says Smith.</p> <p>Banks and building societies in the scheme hand over the sums that have lain completely untouched by the account’s owner for 15 years, and if no owner has been located after inquiries. The average amount in the accounts is £100.</p> <p>If the account holder contacts their bank after the money has been moved to the fund, they can still get it back. Since 2011, the fund has given back £100m to banks.</p> <p>“The same principle for the new scheme exists for the existing scheme, which is: if the customer comes forward, they will get back what they were entitled to if the transfer hadn’t happened,” says Smith.</p> <p>After the money is collected, it is passed to the National Lottery Community Fund. To date, among other projects, this has been used to help young people into work and housing, and for those who are tackling financial exclusion.</p> <p>Of the £880m transferred so far, more than £425m has been used to establish Big Society Capital, an independent financial institution aimed at connecting charities and social enterprises that want to borrow money, with investors motivated by a desire to deliver social change.</p> <p>However the voluntary scheme has run into controversy.

When he isn’t making singular records, McCombs has <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/interview-cass-mccombs.html\">worked in demolition and crashed on couches</a>; his is a landscape of fast-food restaurants and karaoke machines, where vans break down, people make mistakes and die too soon.</p> <p>A gentle, psychedelic wash glazes this set of songs whose musical erudition is worn lightly.

The lovely <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjQAx22SMA\">Karaoke</a> is a lovelorn Teenage Fanclub shuffle that wonders whether we all just perform secondhand emotions, where McCombs questions a relationship quoting everything from Unchained Melody to Stand By Your Man.

His firm, the High Intensity Network (HIN), claimed sending emergency services to respond to repeated calls from people in crisis “positively reinforce[s]” high-risk behaviour.</p> <p>SIM began expanding across the UK five years ago with response plans drawn up for particular patients and shared with emergency services.</p> <p>Critics say these plans instructed A&amp;E, ambulance, mental health services and police not to treat these people, many of whom they claim are at high risk of self-harm.</p> <p>Documents, released under information laws and seen by the <em>Observer</em> and <em>Liberty Investigates</em> show the HIN believed the scheme could save up to £80m over three years by tackling “particularly high users of health care and police time”.</p> <p>According to HIN’s estimates, the firm coordinated more than 40 teams to manage the care of 500 patients before StopSIM – a group of patients and their supporters – published concerns last year about the rollout, which had apparently taken place without the knowledge of Tim Kendall, NHS England’s national clinical director for mental health.</p> <p>In response, Kendall wrote last In May 2021 that SIM appeared to have “no evidence base”. He asked NHS Mental Health Trusts to submit reviews of the service, and HIN appears to have taken its website down.</p> <p>Kendall’s report has not yet been published, but responses to his review – obtained by freedom of information (FOI) requests – reveal misgivings about the scheme within trusts. One noted it “seemed to be focused on money saved or staff hours saved,” and there was “no reasonable way to defend SIM/HIN”.</p> <p>Newly released documents show the scheme is still being used. In response to FOI requests, three trusts and four police forces said they still had patients on SIM.</p> <p>One, Devon Partnership Trust, revealed it was still piloting SIM this year, and has several patients on it. South West Yorkshire Trust confirmed it had moved its SIM patients onto a new programme which also sees police officers accompany mental health practitioners to visit patients, though a spokesperson said the model differed from SIM and was based on consent and patient feedback.</p> <p>Gloucestershire NHS Trust said it had stopped using SIM, but invested in a Complex Emotional Needs service which “brings together health, police and voluntary care services and has supported people to realise positive change in their quality of life”.</p> <p>Doncaster, Rotherham and South Humber Foundation Trust said its SIM programme would be “rebranded”. When approached for comment, however, a spokesperson said SIM had been replaced with a new service that “differs significantly from SIM”. They said the scheme took a trauma-informed approach while police involvement was to help communication between teams, not contribute to care plans.</p> <p>Alexa Knight, associate director for policy and practice at <a href=\"https://www.rethink.org/\" title=\"\">Rethink Mental Illness</a>, said the continued use of SIM and SIM-like schemes “flies in the face of the legitimate concerns of campaigners with lived experience who raised the alarm on the serious flaws of this programme, which risks denying people access to life-saving treatment”.</p> <p>“Now we need assurances that mental health trusts have stopped using SIM or will do so urgently,” said Knight, “NHS Trusts must consider and respond to people’s concerns – this does not equate to simply relaunching SIM under a different guise.”</p> <p>The StopSIM campaign told the <em>Observer</em> and <em>Liberty Investigates</em> they are working with NHS England on a policy designed to ensure key concerns about denial of treatment are addressed. They plan to publish in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Kendall, NHS England’s national clinical director for mental health, said: “Any approach that seeks to punish, coerce, or withhold care from patients who are experiencing distress is deeply unethical.</p> <p>“The NHS is grateful to StopSIM coalition for highlighting these concerns which we immediately acted on – we will publish our full response to the campaign in the coming weeks.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/21/girlboss-used-to-suggest-role-model-sexist-putdown","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T07:30:02Z","webTitle":"‘Girlboss’ used to suggest a kind of role model.

The simplest answer, perhaps, is time. Once it was the term “career woman” that translated female ambition as selfish, immoral and slightly ridiculous; now, “girlboss” does the job. The morals in question have changed. The effect is the same.</p> <p>You may not have heard the word. It traces the rise and fall of a particular movement in feminism. Girlboss originated around 2014 as an approving description of the type of success epitomised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/sheryl-sandberg\" title=\"\">Sheryl Sandberg</a>’s “lean in” approach. It cheered on the rugged individualist making it in a man’s world through “moxie” and “hustle”.</p> <p>Then, as leaning in went out of fashion, around 2019, feminists changed their minds. Girlboss became an insult, used to belittle and accuse a type of manicured woman who pursues success at the expense of others. The founder of The Wing, a “feminist” workspace business that turned out to be riddled with <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/the-wing-rise-and-fall-a4491126.html\" title=\"\">toxic practices</a>, is a girlboss. Elizabeth Holmes, the fraudulent CEO of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/theranos\" title=\"\">Theranos</a>, is perhaps the quintessential girlboss.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Bad female CEOs started to be seen as a reflection on the whole idea of championing women in business</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The strength and scale of the backlash is such that it is still going three years later. There is a current Edinburgh show called <em>Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss</em> and a forthcoming book by the same name. There is a fad for girlboss villains on screen: unfeminist Shiv Roy in <em>Succession</em> (“What were you doing, brunching with some other sock-puppet girlboss presidents?” her brother Roman mocks her at one point); the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/feb/21/i-care-a-lot-review-rosamund-pike-peter-dinklage-gone-girl-amazon\" title=\"\">psychopathic but well-dressed heroine</a> of the film <em>I Care a Lot</em>.</p> <p>We should note that there is some merit to the backlash against girlbosses and the wider “lean in” project. It at least started with a good observation. Feminists correctly pointed out that a few women learning how to climb the ranks at the top of the corporate world doesn’t solve the big structural problems of patriarchy. There is far more to do.</p> <p>But this general observation soon grew into something more target-specific, which is where it started to go wrong. Girlbosses themselves – successful or ambitious women, in other words – became objects of hate. It was noted that they were not always feminists, although they tended to say they were, and that they were not always “good” or “nice”. Even worse, like men, they had the temerity to want success in systems and workplaces that weren’t fair to everyone and yet, like men, sometimes showed little interest in solving these wider problems.</p> <p>Bad female CEOs, such as Holmes, started to be seen not merely as bad people but as a reflection on the whole idea of championing women in business. Soon, girlboss was a repurposable insult that could be directed at any entitled-seeming woman with ambitions in the corporate world or who had a particular aesthetic (suit, heels, manicure). That mission creep feels familiar. The derogatory term “Karen” once usefully described a particular type of racist white woman but can now be freely directed at any middle-aged woman with a particular haircut.</p> <p>To address the distasteful problem of overconfident or entitled women, girlboss took on a ridiculing quality too: these women did not have as much power as they thought (after all, how could a woman really have power in a man’s world?). They were not self-made as they claimed, they were unwitting products of “benevolent sexism”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What started as a feminist observation has overthought itself into old-fashioned misogyny</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The feminist writer Moira Donegan has <a href=\"https://moiradonegan.substack.com/p/what-was-the-girlboss\" title=\"\">pointed out</a> that the trajectory of the girlboss has similarities with the phenomenon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/13/classics.gender\" title=\"\">chronicled by Susan Faludi</a> in <em>Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women</em> – the demonisation of career women as lonely, unhappy and unlikely to get married. (Men, we should remind ourselves, are not ridiculed as “boybosses”.)</p> <p>What happened here is that what started as a feminist observation has overthought itself into old-fashioned misogyny. The idea that women deserve success only if they are also good, kind, nurturing people who put everyone else first is, of course, a sexist one. No other group fighting for civil rights is tasked with ensuring all other groups have civil rights first – that would be a recipe for no progress at all. Deaf people who achieve success in the workplace against the odds do not tend to be lambasted for neglecting the cause of the blind.</p> <p>It would be nice if every woman who achieved success were a paragon of sisterly virtue. But is it really hypocritical or immoral to be a member of an oppressed group and care only about your own success? Follow the logic and the only group with no obligations at all is the one with no experience of oppression – rich white men. Surely success for even one woman should be counted as a (very small) feminist victory.</p> <p>What happened to the girlboss is symbolic of a clash between two strands of feminist thinking that run through the movement. Should you try to change society or should you help women navigate society as it is? Take, for example, the perennial issue of whether police should warn women not to drink too much on nights out or go down dark alleys alone. Many feminists object to this as victim-blaming and failing to address the real problem: violent men. But some, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/06/the-case-against-the-sexual-revolution-by-louise-perry-review-an-act-of-insurrection-a-new-guide-to-sex-in-the-21st-century\" title=\"\">Louise Perry</a>, make the point that these warnings are nonetheless vital. Violent men do exist and neglecting to warn women of these dangers would be a failure of feminism.</p> <p>The answer to the conundrum is that you need both. Push for change and help women in an imperfect world. Address male violence and warn women, too. Push for change in workplaces and celebrate women who succeed anyway. They are not incompatible.</p> <p>• Martha Gill is a political journalist and former lobby correspondent</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Back in the day, the toner was key. We were all indoctrinated to use toners. They were supposed to clean and tighten our pores, clear the debris left by our cleansers and balance out our skin. Toners were skincare. But really it was an oxymoron. Yes, we used them on our skin but toners were definitely not ‘skincare’. They were harsh, they stung, they stripped. It felt as if we were putting alcohol on our skin. Which, frankly, we were. And so, eventually, we all came to our senses and toners fell out of favour. Now, they are making a comeback. Thankfully, they have evolved from their predecessors. The newer formulations no longer deplete skin so intensely that you resemble a prune. They are much more sophisticated and multifaceted. I love to use this toner from Bliss after cleansing as it decongests pores and removes excess oil, dead skin cells and residue from your cleanser – which makes your skincare works so much more effective. The star ingredient here is niacinamide. Not only does it help tighten the look of pores, it also has skin-smoothing capabilities and protects skin from environmental aggressors. But it’s not aggressive. Because, unlike its earlier incarnations, it contains no alcohol. That in itself is bliss. <em>Bliss Disappearing Act Niacinamide PC + Pore Vanish Micro Purifying Toner, £12.99, <a href=\"https://www.boots.com/\">boots.com</a></em></p> <h2>On my radar… Beauty bars for more than a gentle cleanse</h2> <p><strong>Power clean</strong> Created with five times less water than its liquid counterparts and minimal waste packaging, these small but mighty cleansing bars address different skin concerns. <em>Kiehl’s Concentrated Facial Bar, £20.50, <a href=\"https://kiehls.co.uk/\">kiehls.co.uk</a></em></p> <p><strong>Loco for cocoa</strong> If your skin has a tendency to dryness, this gentle, non-stripping cleansing bar contains shea butter and coconut oil and is a godsend for face and body. <em>Fenty Skin Cocoa Cleans’r Soothing All Over Cleansing Bar, £16, <a href=\"https://fentybeauty.com/\">fentybeauty.com</a></em></p> <p><strong>Solid performer</strong> This solid face wash has been developed with dermatologists and is full of hyaluronic acid and ceramides, which means that it cleanses while also protecting the skin. <em>CeraVe Hydrating Cleansing Bar, £8, <a href=\"https://www.boots.com/\">boots.com</a></em></p> <p><em>Follow Funmi on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/funmifetto?lang=en\">@FunmiFetto</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/james-wong-on-gardening-grow-healthy-plants-with-no-need-of-fertiliser","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T07:15:02Z","webTitle":"Grow healthy plants with no need for feed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/james-wong-on-gardening-grow-healthy-plants-with-no-need-of-fertiliser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/james-wong-on-gardening-grow-healthy-plants-with-no-need-of-fertiliser","fields":{"headline":"Grow healthy plants with no need for feed","trailText":"Trees, shrubs and borders are quite happy without fertiliser, writes James Wong","byline":"James Wong","body":"<p>There is much received wisdom in horticulture that essentially takes a standard idea from agriculture and scales it down to the level of a domestic garden plot. While this might initially seem sensible, it turns out that pretty much every aspect of a garden is totally different to a farmer’s field, so, in reality, this approach rarely works. Perhaps the most important of these mistaken approaches lies in how we fertilise our plots. Changing how you do this will almost certainly save you time, money and even help the environment, too.</p> <p>A lot of standard horticultural advice is based on the premise that regular applications of fertiliser are absolutely crucial to healthy plant growth. This means lugging around big bags of manure to dig in each autumn, often after a summer of dosing up hundreds of watering cans with liquid feed. According to some advice on growing tomatoes, for example, you’d likely spend more on fertiliser than the value of the fruit you get. However, the scientific reality is that the vast majority of these laborious applications are not just entirely unnecessary, but can actually produce worse results. Excess nitrogen, for example, has been widely demonstrated to result in soft, sappy, growth that is less resistant to environmental stresses, reduces the sugar content of harvests and even suppresses flowering. That’s before we consider the fact that run-off can pollute groundwater and the huge amount of carbon emissions created in the production of fertiliser in the first place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e71984d0c26bab90248a0a7ca79d3dd28bf483e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e71984d0c26bab90248a0a7ca79d3dd28bf483e/0_208_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Top toms: plants grown in pots will appreciate a liquid feed, but why grow them in pots?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Top toms: plants grown in pots will appreciate a liquid feed, but why grow them in pots?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why does farming rely so much on fertiliser applications? Well, in agriculture the continual growing and harvesting of crops essentially acts like a pump, depleting minerals from the soil as plants draw them out of the ground and concentrate them in their tissues. These are then taken off site, rather than being returned to the soil. Over centuries, this continual cycle means that most farmland is lower in natural fertility than average domestic plots. Extra applications of nutrients are simply not necessary in most domestic plots for most plants.</p> <p>The only garden practice that really mimics the agricultural process is conventional lawn care. Lawns do usually need regular applications of fertiliser to keep green and lush, but most trees, shrubs and general garden borders really don’t require external mineral inputs at all – just like forests. (If you have one of those fancy mowers that chops out clippings into tiny particles that are then returned, almost invisibly, straight back into the lawn, you won’t need to fertilise.)</p> <p>The other exception is plants that are grown in pots, and that’s largely because the compost-based growing media used in them, in particular peat, contain little to no natural fertility and locks users into constantly topping this up with liquid feed applications. In almost all instances, planting everything you can in the ground will free you from the need for 90% of fertiliser applications and, out of porous pots, watering, too. Give yourself more time enjoying your plot than digging manure: ditch fertiliser and you’ll probably see results that are just as good, if not better.</p> <p><em>Follow James on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/blog/2022/aug/21/south-africa-england-test-series-lords-first-test","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"As South Africa’s Test fortunes wax, interest in five-day format wanes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/21/south-africa-england-test-series-lords-first-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/21/south-africa-england-test-series-lords-first-test","fields":{"headline":"As South Africa’s Test fortunes wax, interest in five-day format wanes","trailText":"Dean Elgar’s side may be the world’s best but they’re losing the battle back home to preserve the longest form of cricket","byline":"Andy Bull","body":"<p>The last day of the Test stretched on long after England’s batsmen had been and gone. When the presentations were finished, the interviews wrapped, the hoardings packed, the crowd still lingered in the stands with nothing better to do on a free sunny afternoon than ask each other: “Who fancies another?”</p> <p>I passed three men sprawled in the front row of the Mound Stand, all in linen suits, one with his loafers up on the boundary boards. “Excuse me,” he called out as I walked around the outfield, “but what happens now?” I wondered what he was talking about. “Is there going to be some music or something?”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/england-south-africa-first-test-day-three-match-report-cricket\">Sorry England slump to innings defeat inside three days against South Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I am not sure what he expected, maybe for the marching band who had been parading around the ground at lunch to come back and lay on another performance. He was one of the corporate guests. There are a lot of them at Lord’s. Tests there seem to have become dress-up events, hardly anyone goes in their everyday clothes. Which might be why the atmosphere felt so odd on that last afternoon on Friday, when the tumbling wickets were mostly met with bewildered indifference, as if people were surprised to find that the match had worked out differently from what was listed on the printed itineraries provided by their hosts.</p> <p>These days, being able to moan about all this is as much of a privilege as being able to afford the tickets to begin with. English cricket has plenty of problems but a lack of corporate sponsors and spectators is not one of them and that is a lucky position to be in. Look closely at this South Africa team, closer, I guess, than that chap in the Mound Stand, and you will notice the one thing they are missing is a sponsor’s logo. Partly that is because of neglectful administration, partly it is because of the fallout from their recent social justice and nation building hearings into racism in the game. It is also a sign of dwindling interest in the longest form of the sport.</p> <p>South Africa are a world-beating team, top of the Test Championship, have one of the most exciting fast-bowling attacks to come here in years and they cannot even get someone to pay for the advertising space on their shirts. In England we are lucky enough to be still worrying about whether Test cricket has a future whereas in South Africa one prominent administrator put it in an off-the-record conversation this week: “The battle has already been lost.” They cannot really afford to play Test cricket any more.</p> <p>The International Cricket Council has released the playing schedule for 2023 to 2027. England will play 43 Tests, Australia 40, India 38 and South Africa, the third-oldest Test nation, only 28. They will play three Tests against Australia this winter, renewing one of the sport’s great rivalries, and after that they have four years of two-Test series. Because, as Cricket South Africa’s CEO, Pholetsi Moseki, told ESPNcricinfo: “We know that you need to play a minimum of two Tests in a series for the World Test Championship and so that’s what we’ve done.” They are essentially playing as little of it as they can get away with.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"387b118b5eed11245c0456eeee5f8b61f4f3e359\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/387b118b5eed11245c0456eeee5f8b61f4f3e359/0_94_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Jansen celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Jimmy Anderson to clinch South Africa’s easy victory in the first Test.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Jansen celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Jimmy Anderson to clinch South Africa’s easy victory in the first Test.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not even clear when, if ever, South Africa will be back to play another Test series in England. It is certainly not going to be any time in the next five years. If they do return in that time, it will be to play someone else in the final of the World Test Championship next year. If they make it, they will have played as many Tests at Lord’s in those 12 months as they have in their own country, because the only matches they have arranged in that time are two against West Indies next January.</p> <p>Instead they have cleared out their domestic schedule to make room for their new T20 tournament. All six of the new franchises are owned by Indian Premier League teams, which is one reason why Cricket South Africa is not scheduling any international matches during the IPL either. So that is three and a half months of the year blocked off for T20 league cricket.</p> <p>All this so that they don’t end up back in the position they were in last March, when six of their players, including all four of the fast bowlers who routed England, were forced to choose between turning up for a home series against Bangladesh and playing in the IPL.</p> <p>England’s Test cricket is a mess. The administrators’ back-to-front plan for fixing it seems to be to shove it all to the front end of the summer to make room for the Hundred. But they are at least playing plenty of it. South Africa’s, on the other hand, seems to be in an existential crisis even while the team is playing so well.</p> <p>Maybe their players have an edge that England’s do not, which is that their commitment to the format is, at this point, almost the only thing keeping it going. Their former captain and current T20 league commissioner, Graeme Smith, said on Sky on Friday that in the near future “you might be down to only five or six nations that play Test cricket at this level.” It is not clear whether his, one of the oldest and proudest, will be one of them.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/21/ukraine-fc-kryvbas-ignore-nearby-shells-as-new-season-looms","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"‘We’re not afraid’: Ukraine side FC Kryvbas ignore nearby shells as new season looms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/ukraine-fc-kryvbas-ignore-nearby-shells-as-new-season-looms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/21/ukraine-fc-kryvbas-ignore-nearby-shells-as-new-season-looms","fields":{"headline":"‘We’re not afraid’: Ukraine side FC Kryvbas ignore nearby shells as new season looms","trailText":"The club have refused to leave their tough, plain-speaking city in order to provide a symbol of resistance for their proud fans","byline":"Nick Ames","body":"<p>On a slight incline overlooking FC Kryvbas’s training facilities, the skeletal frame of a mining tower sets slowly into action.

There are more than 50 mines, quarries and plants in the area and this is by no means the biggest. Trucks haul iron ore from top to bottom, the round trip of about an hour taking place up to 10 times a day, but in wartime the facility has operated at around 20% capacity with transportation options restricted.</p> <p>“I’m amazed every day I come to work,” says Oleg Podkopaiev, the quarry’s deputy director and a Kryvbas fan. He worries that, within three decades, the ore may have been exhausted and that his home city may come to resemble Detroit. Everything in Kryvyi Rih is built around this blue mineral and its football club would not exist without it.</p> <p>“Kryvbas is at the heart of our city and community,” Podkopaiev, a jovial 40-year-old, says. “It’s absolutely necessary for morale here that the club starts playing again. We have to go on living.”</p> <p>Kryvbas and their supporters have tried to help their compatriots do exactly that. Pavlo Petrechenko, a matchgoer since 1997, is a member of the Old School fan sector and recounts how they set up a joint bank account with the club to collect donations for medical supplies, pickup trucks, drones and other equipment to help the military. Many of the group went to fight at the front; four have already died in places such as Mariupol and Kharkiv oblast.</p> <p>“We know it may end up being more,” he says. “When we play our first game back in Kryvyi Rih, we will do something to honour them. This city is strong; the orcs got a bit close but we withstood, because our people have iron strength.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ae60501f8cef1572f9fed6a3a954723f8bdbbcd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae60501f8cef1572f9fed6a3a954723f8bdbbcd2/0_302_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kryvbas fan Pavlo Petrechenko sits in the stands with the Guardian’s Nick Ames.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kryvbas fan Pavlo Petrechenko (left), who has been going to matches since 1997, with the Guardian’s Nick Ames.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vudi Xhymshiti/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When he was younger, Petrechenko shared a stage with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Kryvyi Rih’s most famous son and a driving force of Kryvbas’ recent revival. The pair were comedians: Zelenskiy’s group, Kvartal 95, would face the Punks troupe featuring Petrechenko in local talent shows during the 1990s.</p> <p>Artem Gagarin, the vice-president of Kryvbas, was a few years their junior and considered one of the president’s comic proteges. Petrechenko shakes his head and laughs when asked if he sensed his contemporary was set for a career in high office. “But he’s proved everyone wrong,” he says. “He got lots of criticism before the war and has shown the true Kryvyi Rih character.”</p> <p>It helped him to the top and may ensure Ukraine prevails, too. Riabov knows what the miners and their peers have wrought. “There has always been a winners’ spirit here,” he says.</p> <p>***</p> <p>It is a bright Saturday morning. The previous day’s downpour is a distant memory but some things remain constant. A couple of hours ago, four Kalibr cruise missiles were shot down above Dnipro, 85 miles north-east, and the awful wail of air raid sirens echoed around Kryvyi Rih. Most of the public continue as if impervious: the unique underground trams on the metro keep shuddering along; a couple walk along the pavement sharing the weight of a huge, vibrant basket of flowers.</p> <p>At the Kryvbas training ground, Volodymyr Baienko is carrying on too. He has just travelled overnight from western Ukraine, where he was negotiating with potential new signings. Putting a squad together has been no mean feat. “On 7 April we only had five players here,” he says.</p> <p>The first team had been on a training camp in Turkey when the war began and within a fortnight Baienko knew he would have to allow many of the squad, Riabov included, to continue their careers abroad on loan. Others would depart permanently. For a 32-year-old whose playing career ended in June 2021 before he moved to an upstairs role at Kryvbas, this year has presented the steepest of learning curves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cdfa97c1b7031913e77332b4db92ae90ac76068\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cdfa97c1b7031913e77332b4db92ae90ac76068/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volodymyr Baienko, the CEO of FC Kryvbas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘While others have hesitated we’re moving forward, because we’ve got ambitious targets.’ Volodymyr Baienko, the CEO of FC Kryvbas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vudi Xhymshiti/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Look around, look at everyone working,” he motions, wearing a sharp white shirt and looking every inch the urbane young executive.

But my opinion is that, despite its horrors, the war can be viewed as a chance. While others have hesitated we’re moving forward, because we’ve got ambitious targets.

They always played to big, baying crowds, by the standard of Ukraine’s regions. In 2020, they were renamed from Hirnik Kryvyi Rih, a short-lived successor, upon an instruction personally made by Zelenskiy. When they played FC Cherkaschnya in their first game under the old name a year ago, Zelenskiy was there to kick the first ball; the club were promoted to the top flight and feel slick, driven, purposeful.</p> <p>The coup of Vernydub’s arrival demonstrates that and so does the fact players such as the Croatian defender Dragan Lovric have been happy to return for the new campaign. Lovric, injured while his teammates were in Turkey, saw bombs fall near Kryvyi Rih in February and had to spend 50 hours driving back home to Split, but knew he would be back at the first opportunity.</p> <p>“Some others from my country have offers from this club but they don’t believe me, they think I’m a little crazy and can’t believe it is virtually normal life here,” he says. “I tell them to come; I think it’s safe, even though nobody knows what’s coming next.</p> <p>“I think people here were surprised to see me return, but we see hope here. Nobody believed we could be in a footballing situation so soon but we want to show the world we are not afraid.”</p> <p>Lovric hopes Kryvbas will be allowed to play home games in Kryvyi Rih; it could happen soon, perhaps as early as next month. Iron will pays no deference to danger, on the football field or elsewhere.</p> <p>“From the very first days of war I knew Ukraine will not lose,” Baienko says. “I witnessed the war in Donetsk when it began in 2014, and I know the Ukrainians are unbreakable people. We are building our mentality, building our history.”</p> <p>High above him, those steel pully wheels keep inching round and round.

Two years before the next general election it is obvious – just as it was in 1977 before Margaret Thatcher won in 1979 – that the existing policy framework has reached its sell-by date. Then it was the postwar settlement – including incomes policies and public ownership – whose weaknesses were becoming ever harder to defend, even among those of us who recognised its strengths. At the very least it needed a wholesale rethink and makeover, or, as Thatcher argued, be repudiated with a bracing new framework adopted in its place.</p> <p>So, in 2022 we have the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/after-inflation-again-outpaces-forecasts-13-per-cent-peak-looks-optimistic-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">13% inflation </a>or even higher, swingeing energy bills that will topple millions into destitution. Add in the failures of privatisation dramatised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/water-firms-england-wales-litres-leaky-pipes-ofwat\" title=\"\">excessive water leakages</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/beachgoers-warned-to-stay-away-after-sewage-alerts-across-england-and-wales\" title=\"\">raw sewage</a> blighting many beaches and rivers, an impossibly overstretched NHS, and workers being badged as irresponsible for merely trying to resist dramatic cuts in their real incomes. All this has crystallised how the whole Thatcherite edifice of economic and social policy, decaying for years, is suddenly and obviously redundant.</p> <p>The Tory party’s response – to elect Liz Truss as its leader to double down on a framework that does not work – is wildly out of keeping with what is needed, and out of step with the popular mood. The Conservatives’ substantial poll deficit with Labour – the highest for a decade – is certain to widen further. </p> <p>The evidence of the mood change is all around. Later this week, Ofgem is expected to announce that the price cap for energy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/04/ofgem-confirms-energy-price-cap-to-be-updated-every-three-months\" title=\"\">will double</a> in October to £3,500, with a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/energy-bills-uk-forecast-april-b2142883.html\" title=\"\">peak of £5,000 expected in April</a>. The social impact will be catastrophic. The Truss team has yet to show its hand, but the range of floated options limits extra household assistance to hundreds of pounds when it needs to be thousands.</p> <p>People are genuinely fearful: consumer confidence is broaching all-time lows. The Labour leader Keir Starmer’s simple solution – freeze the cap for six months over the winter – is understandable and effective. It not only has the support of <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/utilities/survey-results/daily/2022/08/15/b2ca4/1\" title=\"\">85% of Labour voters</a> but, importantly, 75% of Conservative voters. Time was, just a year or two ago, when a confident Tory party and its press would have dismissed the freeze as “Marxist”. Not in August 2022.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A centrepiece of Thatcherism – that privatisation plus 'light touch' regulation could be applied in any utility – is under siege</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So it continues. In today’s environment, the leader of the RMT union, Mick Lynch, wins arguments over the need to strike to preserve living standards. A respected senior ex-BP executive, Nick Butler, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/bp-energy-sector-incompetent-ofgem-freeze-price-cap-tax-profits\" title=\"\">writes damningly</a> of an incompetent Ofgem, profiteering energy companies, and accepts that the weakest may need to be nationalised.

Only 15 years ago, when the financial crisis broke, he resisted public ownership for fear of Tory taunts. Not in 2022.</p> <p>A centrepiece of Thatcherism – that privatisation plus “light touch” regulation could be applied in any utility – is under siege as never before. Camilla Cavendish, head of the No 10 policy unit under David Cameron, catches the moment when <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f752468a-58e2-4928-9e3b-ee5bcce252aa\" title=\"\">she writes</a> in the <em>Financial Times</em> that water privatisation as designed has failed. What matters for utilities is that they deliver the public interest of cost effectiveness, resilience, reliability and service. That cannot be said today of the universe of energy and water companies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/water-firms-england-wales-litres-leaky-pipes-ofwat\">Water firms in England and Wales lost 1tn litres via leaky pipes in 2021</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What to do? Even Truss proposes a review into how British utilities are regulated, inclining to the idea of merging all the regulators into one. (Wrong answer.) The Corbynite left and some in the union movement propose wholesale renationalisation. But there is a gulf between that and the last resort public ownership of individually failed utilities of the type Brown and Butler accept. There is little evidence that laying out up to <a href=\"https://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/articles/price-tag-for-labours-renationalisation-starts-at-196-billion-cbi/\" title=\"\">£200bn</a> to take over every utility will bring the universal benefits needed; moreover, this is cash that could be better deployed elsewhere – on levelling up and the drive to net zero.</p> <p>The better option is more forensic. Look more closely and there is an intriguing spectrum of performance. The government’s 2021 <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1088896/Water-and-sewerage-companies-in-England-environmental-performance-summary-graphic-2021.pdf\" title=\"\">environmental evaluation</a> of nine English water companies shows, miserably, that six receive either one or two stars. (Southern and South West, beach polluters-in-chief, are the <a href=\"https://environmentagency.blog.gov.uk/2022/07/18/water-company-environmental-performance-hits-new-low/\" title=\"\">one-star performers</a>.) But there are three companies – Northumbrian Water, Severn Trent and United Utilities – that all earn the maximum four stars. What is needed is a regulatory, licensing and governance regime that fosters many more top-star performers, with public ownership the last resort option for the one-stars.</p> <p>Importantly, the top performers all place social purpose at the heart of their business. All closely engage customers in their decision-making, variants of how the publicly owned Scottish Water, another high performer, has established an independent customer group (ICG) as a permanent independent watchdog that it closely consults and informs. This should not be the preserve of the best. Every water company should embrace a public benefit requirement along with an ICG.. Imagine, for example, campaigner Martin Lewis as chair of Thames Water’s ICG: overnight, the dynamic would change.</p> <p>Ofwat should not only ensure that this happens but insist each company meets tough statutory universal service obligations. It has begun to move in this direction, but has been far too accommodating to the complaints and counterchallenges from weak performers. No more. If water firms can’t meet the public interest targets on leaks, pollution and capacity, licences should be withdrawn and the companies for a period be run by the state. They exist to sustain life: not to maximise shareholder value.</p> <p>A similar regime should be established for the energy companies, again with a dedicated regulator respecting the particularity of the sector. This is not nationalisation but arguably something superior: the assertion of the public interest as a system and a culture. It is what Starmer is aiming for – still imperfectly but nonetheless his clear direction of travel. It is, contrary to his critics in the leftist bubble who are careless of winning elections, very much in the interests of every citizen, which is what makes the proposition so powerful. If he can hold his fissiparous party together, it also promises to make him prime minister.</p> <p>• Will Hutton is an Observer columnist</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/21/louisiana-sea-turtles-chandeleur-islands-new-orleans","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Endangered sea turtles found on Louisiana islands for first time in 75 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/21/louisiana-sea-turtles-chandeleur-islands-new-orleans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/21/louisiana-sea-turtles-chandeleur-islands-new-orleans","fields":{"headline":"Endangered sea turtles found on Louisiana islands for first time in 75 years","trailText":"Kemp’s ridley sea turtle, world’s smallest sea turtle species, discovered in Chandeleur Islands off coast of New Orleans","byline":"Maya Yang","body":"<p>For the first time in 75 years, hatchlings of the world’s smallest sea turtle species have been discovered on the Chandeleur Islands, a chain of barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of New Orleans.</p> <p>Wildlife experts at the Breton national wildlife refuge have documented more than 53 turtle crawls and two live hatchlings that were navigating towards the sea, Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority announced in a press<a href=\"https://us9.campaign-archive.com/?u=3d6138b29e4223c069af96595&amp;id=f8d723a51b\"> statement</a> this week.</p> <p>The news was particularly uplifting for environmentalists because the hatchlings were Kemp’s ridley sea turtles, an endangered species that also happens to be the world’s smallest sea turtle. The turtles are predominantly found in the Gulf,<a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/kemps-ridley-turtle\"> according to</a> the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p> <p>Their population flourished during the early 1900s as tens of thousands of females nested in Rancho Nuevo, Mexico. However, from the mid-1900s to the 1980s, their population dropped drastically, reaching a low of only several hundred females.</p> <p>Some of the major threats Kemp’s ridleys face include being caught unintentionally by fishers, being harvested or having their eggs harvested, degradation of their nesting habitats, natural predators preying on their eggs and hatchlings, being struck by sea vessels, ocean pollution and climate change.</p> <p>The recent discovery of the hatchlings in Louisiana is particularly significant as 95% of the nesting take place in Tamaulipas, Mexico.</p> <p>“Louisiana was largely written off as a nesting spot for sea turtles decades ago, but this determination demonstrates why barrier island restoration is so important,” said the coastal authority’s chairman, Chip Kline.</p> <p>He added: “As we develop and implement projects statewide, we are always keeping in mind what’s needed to preserve our communities and enhance wildlife habitat. Having this knowledge now allows us to make sure these turtles and other wildlife return to our shores year after year.”</p> <p>The BP oil spill resulting from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion significantly affected the Chandeleur Islands, along with various hurricanes and other tropical weather systems in recent years. As a result, the coastal authority and Louisiana’s wildlife and fisheries department have been closely monitoring the islands since May as part of a regional effort to restore them. The effort involves replenishing and protecting various marine life that have been affected by the oil spill.</p> <p>“It is well known that the Chandeleur Islands provide key habitats for a host of important species; however, with the recent discovery of a successful Kemp’s ridley sea turtle hatching, the islands’ value to the region has been elevated,” said the wildlife and fisheries department’s secretary, Jack Montoucet.</p> <p>“We are gaining a better understanding of the benefits this barrier island restoration may provide in the recovery of this endangered species across the Gulf of Mexico.”</p> <p>The coastal authority’s executive director, Bren Haase, added: “We have a responsibility to protect the wildlife here, and that means creating safe and nourishing environments for these turtles and other animals that call Louisiana home. It’s an exciting discovery, and we hope to see additional hatchlings emerging in the weeks and years to come.”</p> <p>The peak of sea turtle nesting season runs from June through July, with most hatchlings beginning to emerge 50 to 60 days later. Additional nests may be discovered in the weeks to come, according to the coastal authority.</p> <p>In addition to Kemp’s ridleys, wildlife experts have also discovered the threatened loggerhead sea turtles nesting on the islands.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/21/anais-in-love-review-anais-demoustier-intoxicates-in-comic-french-love-triangle","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"Anaïs in Love review – Anaïs Demoustier intoxicates in comic French love triangle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/21/anais-in-love-review-anais-demoustier-intoxicates-in-comic-french-love-triangle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/21/anais-in-love-review-anais-demoustier-intoxicates-in-comic-french-love-triangle","fields":{"headline":"Anaïs in Love review – Anaïs Demoustier intoxicates in comic French love triangle","trailText":"Cinema’s latest irresistible chaotic femme, Demoustier is perfectly cast in first-time writer-director Charline Bourgeois-Tacquet’s sparkling romance","byline":"Wendy Ide","body":"<p>She’s a familiar character. Skittish, self-absorbed, seductive and terminally unreliable, Anaïs (Anaïs Demoustier) is the latest incarnation of the chaotic femme, the slightly more world-weary European spin on the “manic pixie dreamgirl” trope that is a fixture in the American indie movie circuit.</p> <p>Loosely inspired by the gamine free spirits of the French New Wave, the chaotic femme tends to be in her late 20s or early 30s and at an impasse in all aspects of her life, with a tendency to sabotage the elements that threaten to succeed. She spends an inordinate amount of time running: the chaotic femme is always late, has great legs and favours short skirts, all the better to flit through various photogenic European city backdrops. Like her predecessors – Julie in Joachim Trier’s <em>The Worst Person in the World</em> and Paula in Léonor Serraille’s <em>Jeune Femme</em>, Anaïs ought to be insufferable. She’s feckless, enragingly disorganised and has the attention span of a three-year-old in the throes of a sugar rush. She’s part glitterball, part wrecking ball. In real life you would avoid her like a norovirus omelette. But filtered through the forgiving lens of first-time writer and director Charline Bourgeois-Tacquet’s peppy comic love triangle, she becomes a fascinating, intoxicating presence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Demoustier so supercharges her performance with charisma, she almost seems to sparkle</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The key to bringing magnetism to a superficially annoying character is, as always, in the casting. Just as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/20/renate-reinsve-actor-worst-person-in-world-interview\">Renate Reinsve</a> flooded Julie in <em>The Worst Person in the World</em> with an itching, restless intelligence that explains her fickle lack of focus, so Demoustier works a similar alchemy with Anaïs. Often cast in intense, passionate roles – she was fiercely serious opposite a more flamboyant Romain Duris in François Ozon’s <em>The New Girlfriend</em>; intellectually agile in <em>Alice and the Mayor</em> – here Demoustier gets to show a more playful side. Anaïs is an incorrigible flirt. She seduces in order to reject, and is comfortably certain that all her (many) failures and transgressions will be forgiven thanks to her considerable charm. And in this she is correct. She is utterly beguiling. There’s a pivotal scene in which Anaïs, in the audience at a literary event, catches the eye of the speaker. And Demoustier so supercharges her performance with charisma, she almost seems to sparkle.</p> <p>It’s a performance that works in tandem with the film-making to give depth to the woman we see on screen. We are introduced to Anaïs – running, of course – to the accompaniment of a scurrying, tumbling piano score, like panic-induced palpitations in musical form. Her full-tilt movements are shadowed by a camera that seems to be as easily distracted as she is. It picks up on the essential details, however – the way that, having finally dumped her half-on, half-off boyfriend and embarked on an affair with Daniel (Denis Podalydès), an older man, her eyes slide away from his hungry gaze, as though she is already casing out an escape route.</p> <p>But while her relationship with Daniel is over almost before it starts, Anaïs is increasingly fascinated by his author partner, Emilie (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, delivering her trademark breathy, slightly dishevelled sexy/neurotic shtick), connecting at first with her writing and then through a chance encounter on the street. Impulsive and instinctive as always, Anaïs drops everything, including her dissertation, a job and her cancer-stricken mother, to place herself in Emilie’s orbit.</p> <p>The reward is a sensual brushing of hand against thigh on a beach, a chime of synchronicity on the dancefloor and a cloud-parting moment of realisation. There’s a reason why all of her relationships have failed until now. Why she unceremoniously turfs her men from her bed after sex. The film’s arc might not leave Anaïs as a <em>better</em> person exactly – the apparent disregard for her mother’s deteriorating health suggests that empathy is markedly absent from the emotional baggage she hauls – but she does end the picture closer to taking control of her destiny rather than constantly trying to outrun it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zzroHaUSTE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_zzroHaUSTE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zzroHaUSTE\">Watch a trailer for Anaïs in Love.</a></figcaption> </figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/emma-beddington-my-kids-have-moved-out-but-dont-call-me-an-empty-nester","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"My kids have moved out, but please don’t call it an empty nest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/emma-beddington-my-kids-have-moved-out-but-dont-call-me-an-empty-nester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/emma-beddington-my-kids-have-moved-out-but-dont-call-me-an-empty-nester","fields":{"headline":"My kids have moved out, but please don’t call it an empty nest","trailText":"I want to take issue with this nests metaphor, life is far harder for real birds, says Emma Beddington","byline":"Emma Beddington","body":"<p>I’m nearly an empty nester. That conjures up conflicting images in popular culture: is it knitwear and cruises, or divorce and microdosing? Either way, there’s a notion of freedom – to take up ceramics, become a sourdough bore, do an Open University degree or, as a woman from my choir apparently did, just stand in the garden and scream.</p> <p>About the screaming: I’m not actually feeling the need, for now. I have always enjoyed my sons’ progress towards autonomy. It’s not wholly selfish (though I can’t wait to live off toast and takeaways). My memories of later childhood are of impotent boredom; of waiting for real life to start.</p> <p>My nest doesn’t feel empty now anyway. You just need to count the number of oversized plastic beakers emblazoned with “PhD Nutrition” (where did these cups get their PhDs, hmm) around the house. They sit, clogged with an inch of sludgy pea protein in the sink or under the sofa, where the ants are relishing the opportunity to improve their muscle tone. I could write a hymn of loathing to protein culture, the rancid tang of fake vanilla and the cult of “bulk”, the macho fonts and metal shaker balls that entangle themselves in the drainer rack and bounce out of the cupboards, but will save it for another time. The TV is pumping out weighty dramas about drug dealing, large abandoned trainers ambush the arthritic dog, my crisp stash has been pillaged and their father is muttering with familiar futility about lights left on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even the gormless pigeon youths who spent weeks contentedly paddling in the water bowl are gone.

I am sure Everything Is Fine!). He will leave – the elder is already gone and only passing through – and our nest will be officially empty.</p> <p>I want to take issue, though, with this nest metaphor. I suppose people started thinking about parenting using birds because we saw the feathered version played out year after year, the big-small drama of it. But as someone who has spent this spring and summer obsessively observing my local birds in a way that is absolutely not a compensatory coping strategy – no, why would you say that – I have notes.</p> <p>First, there is much more death in the bird world. My younger son goes out late, usually on his bike, sometimes all night, occasionally without warning. I lie awake catastrophising, but he’s always come back, so far. The garden birds were less lucky: the percentage of babies who successfully fledge is never high. In March, I disturbed his revision to show him a blackbird ferrying sticks and fluff into the hedge outside his window. In April, I saw her bring beakfuls of worms, then I saw her hover in fear as the neighbours’ cat sat for hours, radiating casual menace, on the fence above the nest (I chased it away, but it returned), then I didn’t see her. I took the dead babies out of the nest, half-feathered, bug-eyed and scrawny, and cried for days. One sparrow fledgling flew into the window and broke its neck; a starling fledgling succumbed to a mangled leg.</p> <p>It’s a much slower process raising our young, too. Sure, we live far longer, but the weeks I watched the great tits service their nestbox of screaming babies felt like a frantic fight for survival for both adults and young. Maybe I’m just far enough from life with newborns not to remember that feeling, but raising humans is a marathon: meals and laundry and learning; failing and getting it wrong; just occasionally getting it right.</p> <p>Then when bird babies leave it’s definitive. Through June, my son cycled off in the mornings with his clear plastic bag of pens and I distracted myself topping up feeders and water bowls. I listened to the now-familiar patchwork of calls – alarm and reassurance and just checking in – as my “How was it?” WhatsApps went unread. Then exams ended and he disappeared into a long midsummer stretch of parties and farewells. So did the birds. The front garden blackbirds, who eventually raised a brood successfully, vanished overnight. The great tit teenagers argued with each other in the hedge for a few weeks, but they’ve dispersed now, too. Even the gormless pigeon youths who spent weeks contentedly paddling in the water bowl are gone. But my son comes back, exhausted and hungover (and my other son came home to strip the cupboards with locust-like efficiency). Human fledglings don’t really leave home any more, not in this economy. The birds mean it.</p> <p>Finally, unless you’re Alec Baldwin or Bernie Ecclestone, that’s it: there won’t be another brood. So thank God for the birds, which seem to be my empty nest hobby, not ayahuasca or swinging. There are long-tailed tit fledglings at the bottom of the garden and another pigeon nesting in the apple tree; I can see it when I stand underneath, wondering what comes next. That’s partly why I’m not screaming: I wouldn’t want to disturb it.</p> <p><em>Follow Emma on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BelgianWaffling?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@BelgianWaffling</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global-development/2022/aug/21/sierra-leone-protests-inflation-cost-of-living","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"‘Explosion of violence’: Sierra Leone picks up the pieces after protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/21/sierra-leone-protests-inflation-cost-of-living","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/aug/21/sierra-leone-protests-inflation-cost-of-living","fields":{"headline":"‘Explosion of violence’: Sierra Leone picks up the pieces after protests","trailText":"At least 21 protesters and six officers have been killed as anger over the soaring cost of living spins out of control","byline":"Emmanuel Akinwotu in Lagos and Muhammed Basiru Sanusi in Freetown","body":"<p>As workers cleared broken glass from the shattered windows of Mohamed Sillah’s restaurant in Freetown, he described the events of last week, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/sierra-leone-rocked-by-deadly-violence-at-cost-of-living-protests\">rare protests against soaring inflation and the rising cost of living</a> shook the capital of Sierra Leone.</p> <p>“It was an explosion of violence,” Sillah said of the damage inflicted on his and other buildings. “We don’t usually see this in Sierra Leone but we are in tough times.”</p> <p>Businesses, government offices and buses across eastern Freetown were charred or destroyed completely in the violence as police and security officials brutally cracked down on demonstrators.

A tense calm settled, with ordinary life gradually returning.</p> <p>The government has partly blamed the opposition for the protests, branding them an attempted coup, and launching an inquiry into alleged organisers. However, protesters interviewed by local media described their movement as “faceless” rather than orchestrated by one group, and reflective of widespread discontent.</p> <p>President Julius Bio dismissed the idea that the protests were reflective of public anger. “This was not a protest against the high cost of living occasioned by the ongoing global economic crisis,” he said. “The chant of the insurrectionists was for a violent overthrow of the democratically elected government.”</p> <p>But on the ground it is clear that many people shared the protesters’ grievances.</p> <p>Inflation rose to almost 28% in June, fuelled first by the Covid pandemic easing and then the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Food inflation is at the highest level in decades, almost doubling since September 2021.</p> <p>In recent months doctors and teachers have gone on strike, with demands for pay increases to meet rising inflation.</p> <p>At a market in Western Rural, traders who asked not to be named lamented how the prices of rice, onions, tomatoes and beef had all risen by about 50% over the last year, with the price of fuel and palm oil roughly doubling.</p> <p>Marcella Samba-Sesay, the director of Campaign for Good Governance, a civil society group, said that the government had not clearly articulated to the majority of people why the economic challenges had worsened. </p> <p>“There is an information gap in the country where the government’s message doesn’t reach many people. They have not effectively communicated to people why things are getting bad and that is making people angrier,” she said.</p> <p>Anger has also been rising over the authorities’ refusal to permit protests. Under the terms of a public order act adopted in 1965 during colonial rule. protest organisers usually have to ask the police for permission to protest.</p> <p>“But most of the time, when the issues are political, the police will say no,” said Samba-Sesay. “So people who want to come out and protest have not been given the permission to do so.”</p> <p>In July, hundreds of women working in markets protested in Freetown, condemning the government’s handling of the economy. Many shops and stalls closed in support of the demonstrations. Dozens of women were arrested by police. Several alleged they had been beaten and sexually abused by officers.</p> <p>“People are really suffering, and feel the government is not responding or allowing them to have a voice,” Semba-Sesay said. “We need people to be able to channel grievances through legitimate means.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/21/iran-gloats-america-plots-but-even-a-nuclear-deal-will-not-tame-tehran","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"Iran gloats, America plots, but even a nuclear deal will not tame Tehran | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/iran-gloats-america-plots-but-even-a-nuclear-deal-will-not-tame-tehran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/iran-gloats-america-plots-but-even-a-nuclear-deal-will-not-tame-tehran","fields":{"headline":"Iran gloats, America plots, but even a nuclear deal will not tame Tehran","trailText":"As Khamenei crows over Rushdie, Biden seeks a revived pact.

The black-turbaned ayatollah’s bigoted, blinkered outlook has been poisoning the well of Iranian politics and society since he first took power in 1989.</p> <p><em>Kayhan</em> newspaper, known as Khamenei’s mouthpiece, praised Rushdie’s assailant, saying “his hands should be showered with kisses”. A jubilant headline declared: “Devil’s neck under the sword”.

No matter, apparently, that it impoverishes and isolates Iranians while endangering their neighbours.</p> <p>After last year’s rigged presidential election, won on a record low turnout by Khamenei’s hardline stooge Ebrahim Raisi, lingering hopes of reform evaporated. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/world/europe/iran-us-nuclear-deal.html\" title=\"\">Internal repression is terrifying. </a>Political dissidents, women’s rights activists, ethnic minorities, dual nationals and<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/world/europe/iran-us-nuclear-deal.html\" title=\"\"> Bahá’ís are persecuted mercilessly</a>.</p> <p>Iran’s economy, plagued by endemic corruption and sanctions, is in a shocking state. While oil and gas export earnings have risen, officials, clergy and other groups linked to the regime, such as the Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia, are the main beneficiaries. It’s a mullah’s version of trickle-down economics, without the trickle.</p> <p>Year-on-year inflation reached 52.5% in June. Reduced food subsidies are hurting badly. At least 30% of Iranians live below the official poverty line. Strikes are commonplace. But few have forgotten 2019’s nationwide “Bloody November” anti-regime protests, when many hundreds were gunned down. <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/iran%E2%80%99s-economy-growing-so-iranian-discontent-203459\" title=\"\">Only 28% think Raisi does a good job</a>.</p> <p>“The policies that ...

By celebrating the assault on Rushdie, the clerical establishment seems to be saving face at home,” commentator Sayeh Isfahani wrote.</p> <p>Externally, <a href=\"https://worldcrunch.com/world-affairs/iran-khamenei-support-russian-victory\" title=\"\">Iran sides ever-more closely with Russia </a>and China. Hosting Vladimir Putin in Tehran last month, Khamenei claimed that, just as with Iran, the west and Nato opposed a “strong, independent Russia”. Like Putin, he is delusional about his country’s global standing and scorns the US as a declining power. <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/russia-training-drones-iran/index.html\" title=\"\">Iran is reportedly supplying drones to help Russia attack Ukraine</a>.</p> <p>China is Iran’s biggest energy customer, with Beijing <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-buys-more-iranian-oil-now-than-it-did-before-sanctions-data-shows-2022-03-01/\" title=\"\">now importing more oil than before US sanctions were imposed</a>.

Like Russia, China has taken Iran’s side on disputed UN nuclear inspections.</p> <p>Donald Trump’s idiotic decision to trash the 2015 nuclear pact led, predictably, to a rapid acceleration in Iran’s programme. It now says <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/khamenei-adviser-says-tehran-capable-building-nuclear-bomb-al-jazeera-2022-07-17/\" title=\"\">it can build a bomb within months</a> but has no plans to do so. Short of time, the Biden administration may soon agree a revised pact – yet deal or no deal, the regime’s behaviour seems unlikely to alter radically.</p> <p>There’s little sign, for example, of a reining-in of its regional ambitions. Khamenei personally commands the Quds Force, Iran’s extraterritorial military arm, which operates via proxies in Yemen, Lebanon and Palestine. Israel’s hopes that, through currying favour with Putin by soft-pedalling over Ukraine, it could shatter the Russia-Iran axis in Syria have been dashed.</p> <p>Most disruptive right now is the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/khamenei-adviser-says-tehran-capable-building-nuclear-bomb-al-jazeera-2022-07-17/\" title=\"\">huge instability rocking Iraq</a>, caused by rivalry between Tehran-backed Shia parties and militias and the popular, anti-Iranian, anti-American nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.

Then came the Rushdie horror and the Iranian media’s macabre triumphalism.</p> <p>Americans, too, should be deeply suspicious of Tehran’s intentions, suggested Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour – because Khamenei’s grip on power, and that of the illegitimate elite surrounding him, pivots on unceasing confrontation with the Great Satan. “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/opinion/iran-america-nuclear-policy.html\" title=\"\">US-Iran normalisation could prove deeply destabilising</a> to a theocratic government whose organising principle has been premised on fighting American imperialism,” Sadjadpour wrote. Iran’s leaders, he argued, couldn’t change even if they wanted to. “Even if the nuclear deal is revived, Tehran’s worldview will endure.”</p> <p>It’s plain Khamenei needs the American enemy. But is the converse also true? For the Republican right, Iran has long been a useful bogeyman to frighten the voters, corral Gulf Arab allies and rally support for Israel. So can Iran trust the US to honour the terms of any reworked nuclear pact?</p> <p>Whatever the White House says now, it’s by no means certain Biden’s eventual successor will do so.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Based on a sample size of one, it appears that an Emmy nod can cure Covid. Sarah Niles was laid up in bed at home in London when she heard that, 5,000 miles away in Los Angeles, she’d been nominated for best supporting actress in a comedy series. “I was feeling really sick,” she says, “but I soon got better. A few hours later I started testing negative.”</p> <p>Her role as the sports psychologist Dr Sharon Fieldstone in the hit football comedy <em>Ted Lasso</em> has brought overdue acclaim for an actor who’s been flitting between stage and screen for two decades. Niles is a regular performer at the National Theatre, the Royal Court, the Old Vic and the RSC. TV viewers might recognise her from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/08/i-may-destroy-you-review-michaela-coel-could-this-be-the-best-drama-of-the-year\" title=\"\">I May Destroy You</a></em>, as Officer Funmi, who interviews Michaela Coel’s character after she’s raped. Or from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/08/catastrophe-sharon-horgan-rob-delaney-season-four-review\" title=\"\">Catastrophe</a></em>, as Sharon Horgan’s sarky schoolteacher colleague Melissa. Film fans might know her from Mike Leigh’s <em>Happy-Go-Lucky</em>, or Sarah Gavron’s <em>Rocks</em>.</p> <p>Now, in her mid-40s, fame and acclaim are finally arriving. “I’m probably in a better place to handle it now,” she says. “I’m certainly a much better actor.” She pauses and laughs. “But I still would have liked to be a bit more successful earlier on. I’ve been acting professionally for 20 years – it’s been a long time coming. I’ve had so many lovely messages: ‘You deserve all your flowers, Sarah.’ ‘You’re here and you’ve always been here.’”</p> <p>Alongside the mighty <em>Succession</em>, <em>Ted Lasso</em> dominates the Emmy shortlists. They’re like the Manchester City and Liverpool of prestige TV’s Premier League. <em>Ted Lasso </em>clocked up a whopping 20 nods in total, making it the most nominated comedy for the second year running. Niles is joined in her category by castmates Hannah Waddingham (who plays club owner Rebecca Welton) and Juno Temple (WAG-turned-PR whiz Keeley Jones).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ba82c623e79a5459414ad417cc28237677fc51e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ba82c623e79a5459414ad417cc28237677fc51e/0_110_6474_3884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emmy nominated: Sarah Niles as Dr Sharon with Jason Sudeikis in Ted Lasso.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kicking off: Sarah Niles as Dr Sharon with Jason Sudeikis in Ted Lasso.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LMK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Sharon arrived in season two of the much-loved soccer-com, helping to bring new depth to the show’s characters, and providing a gear change from the goofy comedy. For Niles, the key to her understated performance is stillness – not always easy when you’re playing the straight person to the show’s star and co-creator, the American actor Jason Sudeikis.</p> <p>“It’s hard,” she admits. “I giggle so much, it’s ridiculous. People often say I’m the one who laughs most on set, but that’s between takes, then I turn my poker face on. When he cast me, Jason described my character as all-seeing and all-knowing. So I just try to ground myself, trust myself, be still and watch him. It’s fascinating to just sit and observe someone like that.”</p> <p>Niles’s role in such a blockbuster hit is striking a chord with audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. “So many people have come up and said how important it is, seeing her up there. Women love her because she’s unashamedly able to say that she’s good at her job. Not with arrogance, just with confidence. So often, both as women and as Brits, we self-deprecate and apologise. We think that if you downplay your qualities, people will be more attracted to you. That’s not the case and no way to live.”</p> <p>She goes on: “A lot of Black women, especially in America, love Dr Sharon because she’s standing in her power and her strength. It’s about seeing yourself represented. Often when you see Black female characters on screen, they’re going through some kind of turmoil. Dr Sharon just exists in her power. I’ve learned a lot from playing her. I’ve always apologised for my talent, tried to be not too on the front foot. But to embrace your gifts is exciting.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e40209d2cf4cb8a0fc7bf2032d82b1b8ae3ee202\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e40209d2cf4cb8a0fc7bf2032d82b1b8ae3ee202/0_884_4713_5569/846.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Niles shot for OM\" width=\"846\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m quite bouncy and hyper in real life’: Sarah Niles wears dress by <a href=\"https://www.lkbennett.com/\">LK Bennett</a>, earrings by <a href=\"https://www.lovenesslee.com/\">Loveness Lee</a> and heels by <a href=\"https://rupertsanderson.com/\">Rupert Sanderson</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Chalkley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Niles was born</strong></em> in Thornton Heath, south London, the youngest of three children, to Barbadian parents who came over in the late 1950s. Her father was an electrician, her mother a care nurse. Young Sarah would accompany her mum on weekly shopping trips to Brixton market. One of her earliest memories is seeing the aftermath of the 1981 riots. “I used to listen to the grownups talking and remember saying, ‘I like Michael Foot, but Margaret Thatcher is stupid!’ I had no idea what I was talking about, but it went down well.”</p> <p>Shy and awkward, she wasn’t your typical show-off. But she adored listening to the stories of her parents and their friends – tales from back home in the Caribbean, gossip from the “blues parties” they threw at one another’s houses. It was the transporting element of storytelling – “trying to find home”, Niles suspects, as a daughter of immigrants – that led her towards acting. School plays gave her a chance to “try not being myself and explore”. She later trained at Manchester’s Capitol Theatre, whose alumni include Steve Coogan and David Threlfall.</p> <p>Her childhood heroes were the singer Lena Horne, the actors Diahann Caroll and Mona Hammond, and incongruously, Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. She daydreamed about being part of the <em>A-Team</em>, and watched TV comedy with her dad while he roared with laughter. “Some of it was so inappropriate: Les Dawson, Kenny Everett. He loved Alf Garnett, too.”</p> <p>In recent years, their relationship has entered a new phase. “My dad’s got Alzheimer’s now,” she says. “It’s such a strange and cruel disease. It makes me quite melancholy, but my parents always taught me to find beauty in the cracks of a thing. So what it has allowed me to do is have some beautiful moments being in the present with him and enjoying those times together while we can. You’ve got to bask in the sun of life.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b334536c7c97b5aa7e90ea816a8d8df2049c554b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b334536c7c97b5aa7e90ea816a8d8df2049c554b/0_43_2834_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"“It was one of those rare scripts where you keep turning the pages and can’t stop cracking up”: Sarah Niles with Sharon Horgan in Catastrophe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It was one of those rare scripts where you keep turning the pages and can’t stop cracking up’: Sarah Niles with Sharon Horgan in Catastrophe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Johnson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Niles now has a 10-year-old daughter of her own – and a cat – with her husband, an artist who runs community workshops for people with autism and learning differences. The key to their happy marriage? “Acceptance and finding time to a have fun together. We’ve got this little plaque on the mantlepiece that says ‘Adventure is worthwhile.’”</p> <p>Niles counts herself fortunate to have worked with two of our finest female screenwriters in Sharon Horgan and Michaela Coel. She adored her time on <em>Catastrophe</em> (“One of those rare scripts where you keep turning the pages and can’t stop cracking up”) and she can’t speak highly enough of<em> I May Destroy You</em>. “It was one of my favourite times ever on set,” she says. “I come from a theatre background and this had similar energy. It felt like we were a company – sensitive, supportive, all taking care of each other. It was wonderful, but sad as well. I’m humbled that Michaela Coel was brave enough to put that piece out there. It was probably a necessity for her. A proper piece of art. I’ve never had an experience like it.”</p> <p>The running thread through her memorable TV roles, Niles decides, is that stillness. “I’ve started to realise that all those characters have a kind of resting place. Dr Sharon’s like that. Funmi the police officer and Melissa the teacher is like that. I’m quite bouncy and hyper in real life and I probably don’t get enough sleep. But on screen, stillness is my power.”</p> <p>There have been glimpses of vulnerability beneath Dr Sharon’s coolly poised exterior. It’s implied that she is lonely and viewers saw her flat littered with empty wine bottles. Niles is tight-lipped, but hints that this might be explored further in the upcoming third series. “She’s got hidden depths. There’s so much juice there. Dr Sharon needs her own spin-off, basically.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd15f0ec8d4b0de143fe42a382365f1599bf4284\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd15f0ec8d4b0de143fe42a382365f1599bf4284/0_701_4766_5868/812.jpg\" alt=\"Brighter later: Sarah Niles wears dress by Roksanda and earrings by Vivienne Westwood.\" width=\"812\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brighter later: Sarah Niles wears dress by <a href=\"https://roksanda.com/\">Roksanda</a> and earrings by <a href=\"https://www.viviennewestwood.com/en/\">Vivienne Westwood</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Chalkley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Has Niles had therapy herself? “Yes. I was actually having therapy while shooting <em>Ted Lasso</em> because so much was happening with Covid, with Black Lives Matter, with trying to self-care in lockdown. My daughter was asking me questions that I didn’t have the answers for. I decided it was my duty to be a better person and help out, so I got back into therapy.”</p> <p>We’ll next see her on screen playing the villainous matriarch in the glossy new drama <em>Riches</em> – an ITV/Amazon co-production about a self-made black British family with a multimillion cosmetics empire. It’s been described variously as “a love letter to Black London” and “the Black <em>Succession</em>”.</p> <p>“I can see why, because it’s about a family at war, vying for power,” Niles says. “But it could also be a catalyst for all kinds of conversations. For a long time, we only really saw Black people on TV in crime dramas. There would always be guns or drugs involved. But I remember watching the first episodes of <em>EastEnders</em> back in the 80s. There was a Turkish family, a Black family, Asian characters. I was like, that is it! That is London! Somewhere down the line, we lost that multicultural Britishness that makes this country so unique. We rarely see diverse characters sharing space. We panic and think there has to be some big explanation for why they’re together, rather than just existing.”</p> <p>Representation is improving, albeit slowly. “There’s still so much work to be done,“ she says. “We came across some hurdles with <em>Riches</em>. Part of the problem is that these Black Britons haven’t been seen on TV before. In the real world, our appetite and our need for those stories is miles ahead of what’s being shown on screen. I’ve yet to see older Black women sharing space. The other night, I was watching [director Steve McQueen’s film] <em>Widows</em>, with Viola Davis and Cynthia Erivo, thinking, ‘I can’t wait until we get to that place.’ We’ve got so many more stories to tell in this country.”</p> <p>Niles still experiences all manner of micro-aggressions – from casting directors making assumptions about her accent and social class, to airline cabin crew assuming she’s travelling economy, not business class. “There’s so much gatekeeping going on,” she sighs. “There might just be one Black person per show, or just a small group of Black actors who get the opportunities. I’ve been up for roles against people like Michaela [Coel] and Wumni [Mosaku], who are a decade younger than me. It got to the point where I’ve thought: ‘What’s going on here?’ I spent a lot of time worrying that I wasn’t the right type of Black actor to get certain roles. But there’s got to be room for all of us. I love the fact that lots of actors are taking control by trying to write and create their own work.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f0b9f8b460433c730ce42d534c7816dba434f11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f0b9f8b460433c730ce42d534c7816dba434f11/208_449_3591_4400/816.jpg\" alt=\"In the trenches: Sarah Niles wears dress and rollneck by Roksanda, earrings by Loveness Lee and boots by Legras at net-a-porter.com.\" width=\"816\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the trenches: Sarah Niles wears dress and rollneck by <a href=\"https://roksanda.com/\">Roksanda</a>, earrings by <a href=\"https://www.lovenesslee.com/\">Loveness Lee</a> and boots by Legras at <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-gb/\">net-a-porter.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Chalkley/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The UK screen industry is lagging behind, says Niles. “Sometimes people over here get scared. On <em>Ted Lasso</em>, for example, it’s a fascinating dynamic. Ted’s white, male, all-American, very positive, while this Black woman is a little bit distant. There’s conflict and cultural difference there. It took an Apple show to do that, I’m not sure a British show would be brave enough. And theatre is absolutely ahead of screen. I’ve done a lot of plays at the Royal Court where those characters wouldn’t necessarily have been a Black woman on screen. But it will change because the younger generation aren’t going to stand for that.”</p> <p>As an 80s kid, Niles says <em>Riches</em> reminds her of super-soaps like <em>Dallas</em> and <em>Dynasty</em>. Does that make her Joan Collins? “I wish!” she laughs. “That woman is beyond classy. You have to be on this earth quite some time to learn that. I made a beeline for her at the launch night of <em>The Elephant Man</em> with Bradley Cooper, but suddenly got starstruck. My chest got tight and all this crap came out: ‘I’m a big fan, love your work.’ And she said, ‘I love yours too, darling!’ And I was like, ‘No you don’t, but that’s a very good answer.’ She’s gutsy and unapologetic. I love how hard she and Diahann Carroll fought for equality on that show, both financially and creatively.”</p> <p>It’s not just ethnic diversity where showbiz needs to raise its game, it’s ageism, too. “Growing up, I watched a lot of programmes with older women, but I worry we’ve gone backwards a bit,” Niles says. “I hope there’ll be a renaissance. So many of the women I look up to as actors are just so gorgeous and sexy. They just reside in this power that you cannot understand in your 20s. They’ve got so much: vulnerability, experience, sense of humour. And they’re so naughty, it’s delicious. I can’t wait to hit my 50s and 60s. If we could write women like they are in real life at those ages, there’s some exciting characters to play.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Growing up, I watched a lot of programmes with older women, but I worry we’ve gone backwards a bit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She’s already ticked off one of her dream film directors in Mike Leigh. “I found his improvisational way of working so liberating,” she says. “He helped me trust my talent.” Who else is on her bucket list? “Paul Thomas Anderson, the Coen Brothers, Jordan Peele, Barry Jenkins… So many.”</p> <p>She recently shot a role as the mayor in the forthcoming movie <em>The Toxic Avenger</em>, starring Peter Dinklage as a nerd turned monster. “I only did a few scenes, but loved it,” she grins. “It’s a weird, wacky, culty comedy-horror. I auditioned and found out I got the job when [writer-director] Macon Blair sent me a DM on Twitter. That made me laugh even more because it’s not how things are normally done. My agent said ‘Let’s wait for confirmation in an email’, but I was like, ‘Nah, I’ve got the gig.’”</p> <p>When the Emmys ceremony takes place in a few weeks’ time, Niles will be there in all her finery (probably something sequined, she predicts), sitting shoulder pad to shoulder pad with teammates Temple and Waddingham. “There’s no sense of competitiveness,” she insists. “We’re all so happy for each other. Just being on the shortlist is the stuff of dreams because that’ll be forever: Emmy nominee.”</p> <p>Sarah Niles from Thornton Heath: Emmy nominee forever.</p> <p><em>Ted Lasso season 2 is currently streaming on AppleTV+</em></p> <p><em>Fashion editor Jo Jones; fashion assistant Roz Donoghue; photographer’s assistant Jomile Kazlauskaite; hair by Dionne Smith using Cantu Beauty; makeup by Kenneth Soh at the Wall Group using Augustinus Bader Skincare and Rose Inc makeup; manicurist Kione Grandison; shot at Iris studios</em></p> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/ng-interactive/2022/aug/21/simone-lia-captive-audience-cartoon","type":"interactive","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T07:00:02Z","webTitle":"Simone Lia: Captive audience – cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2022/aug/21/simone-lia-captive-audience-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/ng-interactive/2022/aug/21/simone-lia-captive-audience-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"Simone Lia: Captive audience – cartoon","trailText":"Is it a concert?","byline":"Simone Lia","body":"<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/03/comics-master-2016/embed/embed.html?srcs-mobile=https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3261f84dbe2bb8c76a680d3eb52718fa9bc5b4/0_0_1038_1254/414.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3261f84dbe2bb8c76a680d3eb52718fa9bc5b4/1036_0_1027_1254/409.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3261f84dbe2bb8c76a680d3eb52718fa9bc5b4/2065_0_826_1254/659.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3261f84dbe2bb8c76a680d3eb52718fa9bc5b4/2890_0_1239_1254/494.jpg&amp;ratios-mobile=120.77294685990339+122.24938875305624+151.97568389057753+101.21457489878543&amp;srcs-desktop=https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3261f84dbe2bb8c76a680d3eb52718fa9bc5b4/0_0_4129_1254/2000.jpg&amp;ratios-desktop=30.714285714285715&amp;credit=&amp;background=FFFFFF&amp;vpadding=20\" data-alt=\"Simone 21 Aug\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/03/comics-master-2016/embed/embed.html?srcs-mobile=https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3261f84dbe2bb8c76a680d3eb52718fa9bc5b4/0_0_1038_1254/414.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3261f84dbe2bb8c76a680d3eb52718fa9bc5b4/1036_0_1027_1254/409.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3261f84dbe2bb8c76a680d3eb52718fa9bc5b4/2065_0_826_1254/659.jpg+https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3261f84dbe2bb8c76a680d3eb52718fa9bc5b4/2890_0_1239_1254/494.jpg&ratios-mobile=120.77294685990339+122.24938875305624+151.97568389057753+101.21457489878543&srcs-desktop=https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3261f84dbe2bb8c76a680d3eb52718fa9bc5b4/0_0_4129_1254/2000.jpg&ratios-desktop=30.714285714285715&credit=&background=FFFFFF&vpadding=20\">Simone 21 Aug</a> </figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/21/yes-elite-football-plaything-global-wealth-but-could-be-part-of-another-better-england","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T06:30:01Z","webTitle":"Yes, elite football is a plaything of global wealth.

Will the game remain insulated from wider society, or help reshape it?","byline":"David Goldblatt","body":"<p>Last week, the <a href=\"https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/premier-league-us-tv-rights-nbc-2028-espn-cbs/\" title=\"\">Premier League announced a $2.7bn (£2.3bn), six-year American TV deal with Comcast NBC</a>, a sum that will push the league’s annual turnover above £6bn and marks the moment at which income from foreign media rights income exceeds domestic income. It is a fitting marker for the league’s 30th season and its three decades of hyper-globalisation. First, the Premier League’s global TV audience outstripped domestic viewership. Then the entirely <a href=\"https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/article/remember-when-chelsea-selected-first-all-foreign-team-\" title=\"\">foreign XI fielded by Chelsea in 1999</a> announced the globalisation of the league’s labour market; foreign players now make up around three-quarters of the club’s squads. Foreign coaches, once entirely absent, are now in the majority, as are foreign owners, who hold majority stakes in 16 out of the 20 clubs.</p> <p>The league has benefited from an income-sharing model among the clubs that ensures, if not widespread competition for the top spots, a fiercely competitive league on a game by game basis, as it has from astute marketing, world-class broadcasting and the value of English as a global language. But it is economic globalisation itself that has been the main driver, generating an upward spiral of growth. Over the past 30 years, seemingly impervious to the global financial crisis, austerity and Brexit, the league’s <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-releases/articles/deloittes-annual-review-of-football-finance-european-football-market-revenues-rise-by-10-in-2020-21-season-despite-almost-complete-loss-of-matchday-revenues.html\" title=\"\">annual turnover</a> has soared by an astronomical 2,900%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Premier League is a very English story, for it is obvious that power, voice and influence can all be purchased here</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, if globalisation has been the mainspring of the league’s growth, it has always relied on English clubs’ local narratives and identities to frame it and the energy and culture of the English crowd to animate it. A big part of the league’s televisual appeal appears to rest on the intensity of supporters and the relentless attacking football this encourages and this despite huge increase in ticket prices, a rapidly ageing audience and the deadening effect of ever more corporate stadiums.</p> <p>These are all particularly English stories. As the past 30 years have seen a widespread sell-off of communal assets to foreign states, so too in football. The wild inflation of the housing market by the global super-rich is matched by the escalating and implausible prices paid for football clubs. With the unstoppable growth of a globalised finance sector that pays a small number of people huge salaries while becoming increasingly disengaged from the rest of the domestic economy, the Premier League is an even sharper analogy of the British economy; the lower leagues find themselves falling further and further behind, with club owners risking ever more debt in a gamble to join the charmed circle.</p> <p>Not that they will actually make any money out of the Premier League, where most clubs continue to rack up losses. But profit is not really the purpose of the exercise. Mohamed Al Fayed did not buy Fulham and Harrods because of their rates of return, but to use as tools in his long battle to gain British citizenship and an entree into its elite. Roman Abramovich <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/02/chelsea-swiss-billionaire-hansjorg-wyss-says-offered-chance-buy-club-roman-abramovich\" title=\"\">lost £1.5bn</a> laundering his own reputation and managing his escape from Putin’s Russia. Thaksin Shinawatra, the exiled Thai prime minister, bought Manchester City as a way of sending political messages back home. The ruling houses of the UAE and Saudi Arabia are certainly not counting on Manchester City and Newcastle United to bankroll their retirements, but are busy using them to burnish their global reputations.</p> <p>In this too the Premier League is a very English story, for it is obvious that power, voice and influence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/21/butler-to-the-world-by-oliver-bullough-review-bent-britain-at-your-service\" title=\"\">can all be purchased</a> by foreign individuals and corporations. Throw in the US billionaires, asset-strippers, hedge funds and assorted Czech, Chinese and Greek oligarchs who have bought stakes in clubs and we have a reasonable cross-section of the global elite that has made London its home. Look at the way that Manchester City <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/21/great-english-city-sold-abu-dhabis-elite-manchester\" title=\"\">has bullied</a> the city’s council and Manchester United and Liverpool’s American owners tried to reform the Premier League to the benefit of the big clubs and you have a reasonable take on how business is now done here.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Given such extraordinary wealth, the league could be funding the magnificent displays of compassion of its fans and players</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet, despite all of this, the Premier League, and English football in general, continues to offer glimpses of another England. Victory in the Women’s Euros was accompanied by a version of the English nation that was not only feminine but refreshingly bereft of references to the Second World War. Widespread fan protest over the creation of the European Super League last year demonstrated a deep resistance to the crass commercialisation of closed leagues and forced the government into a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-the-fan-led-review-of-football-governance#:~:text=Details,strengths%20of%20the%20football%20pyramid.\" title=\"\">policy review</a> of football governance. <a href=\"https://www.premierleague.com/news/1680826\" title=\"\">Support</a> by the Premier League for Black Lives Matter and players who have chosen to take the knee has been among the most public and powerful statements of anti-racism in English civic life. Perhaps most remarkable of all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/marcus-rashford\" title=\"\">Marcus Rashford</a> forced the government to change its mean-hearted school meals policy, while <a href=\"https://en-gb.facebook.com/FansSupportingFooddbanks/\" title=\"\">Fans Supporting Foodbanks</a>, which collects donations at grounds on match days, has become one of the sector’s largest grassroots initiatives.</p> <p>What story will the Premier League tell us this year? The needs of the World Cup, shifted from its usual summer slot to a more clement winter in Qatar, will see the league stop for six weeks in November and December, promising to disrupt the best-laid plans of every team. But more telling, I think, will be how an ever richer league looks alongside raging inflation, a precipitous decline in real wages, widespread fuel and food poverty and no doubt more extreme weather.</p> <p>Given such extraordinary wealth, the league could be investing serious money in a carbon-zero transition, as some of its most environmentally minded clubs have begun to do; it could be cushioning the inevitable hardship faced by clubs lower down the ladder that will be crushed by rising energy prices; it could be supporting and funding the magnificent displays of compassion and solidarity of some of its fans and players. Or it might, given its insulation from English society and its economic misfortunes, choose, like the current government, to do nothing at all. That would be the most English story of all.</p> <p>• David Goldblatt is the author of The Ball Is Round: A Global History of Football and The Game of Our Lives</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A lot of most catastrophic decisions come from autocratic decision-making. That is certainly the case with Vladimir Putin but also Saddam Hussein and even [the Argentine military dictator Leopoldo] Galtieri during the Falklands war.”</p> <p>But he adds: “It’s not that democracies always make better decisions.” </p> <p>As Freedman’s book sets out to show, in key interactions between military and political leaders – which even in the best circumstances can be characterised by tensions and personal conflicts – it is the lack of open and often critical feedback that leads to bad decision-making.</p> <p>“Autocracies don’t have the feedback mechanism, and dig themselves in by believing that the advantage of autocracy is bold and decisive decision-making.</p> <p>“While in certain circumstances you can tolerate quite a lot of bad decision-making and come out all right, because you have superior numbers, where it is very tight, one poor decision or bit of bad luck can put you out completely.”</p> <p>And while Russian military operations for more than a century have often relied on using overwhelming numbers (often with little consideration for losses), in Ukraine, Russia appears to have been constrained by domestic political considerations from introducing a general mobilisation, which has limited the scale of forces it can deploy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ed7349cde2e0a713aba3c67ea16355d2c182b2d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed7349cde2e0a713aba3c67ea16355d2c182b2d7/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, has written a new study about command in military conflicts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, has written a new study about command in military conflicts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One issue that has intrigued Freedman, as well as other analysts, is why Putin – whose use of force had been limited in scope before Ukraine – embarked on such a dangerous and badly prepared-for gamble in Ukraine.</p> <p>“Military force had been quite good for Putin up until now. He used it effectively in Chechnya, Crimea, Georgia and Syria. He used it in quite a limited fashion in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/17/vladimir-putin-denies-russian-forces-eastern-ukraine-kiev\" title=\"\">Ukraine’s Donbas region in 2014</a> where those doing his dirty work wanted him to take an even more aggressive approach.</p> <p>“But his approach to the current Ukraine conflict has clearly been deluded. You have to assume he didn’t realise the gamble he was taking. He genuinely thought Ukraine would crumble quite quickly, and it’s hard to know why. “Even those [foreign] analysts who thought Ukraine’s military might not do well didn’t believe that the Ukrainian people would succumb. But he did.</p> <p>He did see it as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-attacks-ukraine-news-vladimir-putin-zelenskiy-russian-invasion\" title=\"\">special military operation</a> [ the term the Kremlin has consistently used rather than “war”] that would last a few days. And once that plan had failed, they were on the back foot.”</p> <p>A key failure, in Freedman’s view, was that while Russian intelligence had widely infiltrated Ukraine – as even Kyiv has acknowledged – the key figures around Putin either did not understand Ukraine or acted as an echo chamber for him.</p> <p>“Experts on Ukraine in Russia don’t seem to have been consulted. It looks like Putin was talking to his mates in the FSB [the federal security service] and GRU [military intelligence ] who shared his prejudices. And the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/putin-angry-spectacle-amounts-to-declaration-war-ukraine\" title=\"\">ranting speech he gave on 21 February</a> [three days before Russia invaded] is still as good a guide as anything to believe what he thinks. It is clear from that that he finds it very hard to take Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, seriously. I think he thought Zelenskiy would make a deal. He didn’t.”</p> <p>At the heart of the problem, Freedman believes, is the rigidly hierarchical nature of the Kremlin’s decision-making and how those at the very top are immune to responsibility for mistakes.</p> <p>“There are no incentives to tell the truth on the ground to the higher command. The senior military – people such as defence minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov – are all part of the inner circle. They’ve sacked lots of generals now they know that there’s a problem. But it’s not them that’s the problem. It’s always someone else.”</p> <p>And since Russia’s first plan to topple Ukraine with a<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/russia-eastern-ukraine-push-protracted-war\" title=\"\">coup de main against Kyiv collapsed within the first few weeks</a> amid fierce Ukrainian resistance and Russian logistical incompetence, Moscow has struggled to find a credible plan B.</p> <p>“They tried for plan B – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/vast-russian-military-convoy-kyiv-siege-ukraine\" title=\"\">the famous convoy that gathered outside Kyiv</a> – but they couldn’t find one. It was logistically beyond them. The lines were too exposed. So they reverted back to concentrating on the Donbas.</p> <p>“Even then it took until May to focus on what they could do – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/russia-opens-artillery-barrages-in-south-and-east-ukraine\" title=\"\">artillery barrages on a narrow front</a>, a tactic for which Ukraine had no easy response, except to take heavy casualties until western weapons systems began arriving.”</p> <p>Even now, six months into the war, Freedman struggles to understand the logic of the Kremlin, not least its tactic of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/13/the-guardian-view-on-europes-energy-crisis-facing-down-putin-will-not-come-cheap\" title=\"\">creating a wintertime energy crisis in Europe</a> to undermine support for Kyiv.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are no incentives to tell the truth on the ground to the higher command. They are all part of the inner circle</p> <footer> <cite>Lawrence Freedman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“I think the only ‘theory of victory’ the Kremlin has at the present is that the west turns on Ukraine because of the energy crisis. But the surprise there is that Moscow has not asked for a ceasefire now. That would put Zelenskiy on the spot because he couldn’t agree to one.</p> <p>“Instead, Putin is still acting as though he expects more from this war than he has already got. Why I think there are some signs of desperation on the Russian side is that some are beginning to recognise that an energy crunch is not going to lead to a betrayal of Ukraine. In the long term, that signals the risk of deep damage to Russia’s economy.”</p> <p>While Freedman is cautious about predicting that Russian forces could face a second big setback – not least in the south of Ukraine, where Kyiv has been effectively pressing on Kherson – he sees the same lack of institutional imagination defining the future trajectory of the war.</p> <p>“Is there going to be something big like Russian forces getting encircled and trapped [around Kherson]? Unless the system gets a shock like the one experienced in late February and early March [when Russia abandoned its effort to take Kyiv], I think Russia will doggedly carry on, if for no other reason than that it can’t think of anything better to do. The Kremlin is paralysed.”</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/command-9780241456996\" title=\"\">Command: The Politics of Military Operations from Korea to Ukraine</a></em> <em>by Lawrence Freedman is published by Allen Lane on 8 September</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/21/oil-giants-lobbying-firm-provided-admin-support-to-mps-investigating-energy-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Oil giant’s lobbying firm provided ‘admin support’ to MPs investigating energy crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/21/oil-giants-lobbying-firm-provided-admin-support-to-mps-investigating-energy-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/21/oil-giants-lobbying-firm-provided-admin-support-to-mps-investigating-energy-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Oil giant’s lobbying firm provided ‘admin support’ to MPs investigating energy crisis","trailText":"Calls for greater oversight of parliamentary groups after concerns raised about Tory backbench committee","byline":"Shanti Das","body":"<p>A lobbying firm whose clients include the oil giant BP provided “administrative support” to a committee of Conservative MPs conducting an inquiry into the energy crisis.</p> <p>Crowne Associates took meeting minutes and helped compile reports for the <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5829a293e4fcb505194767d9/t/624da58a6c7a08260385279d/1649255820644/1922+Backbench+Committee+on+BEIS+Energy+Inquiry+Report+April+2022.pdf\" title=\"\">1922 backbench committee on business, energy and industrial strategy</a>.

The 1922 sub-committee said Crowne Associates and its clients had “no involvement or influence in any of the content [of its reports] at any time”.</p> <p>Crowne Associates said its work for BP was separate from its work for the MPs, while BP said it had hired the company not to represent its interests in Westminster but to conduct research into social mobility.</p> <p>But campaigners said the fact a lobbying firm was providing secretariat services to a parliamentary group raised concerns about the potential for lobbying in parliament and the possibility of private interests gaining front-row access to key policymakers and discussions.</p> <p>Faye Holder, programme manager for oil and gas at the InfluenceMap thinktank, which tracks lobbying by polluting industries, said the arrangements could enable companies to “launder their influence” via “opaque intermediaries”.</p> <p>She said: “This is highly concerning from a transparency point of view.” </p> <p>Darren Jones, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee and a Labour MP, added that private firms did not usually play a role in backbench committees because declaring benefits was “very difficult”. He said: “My view is that if backbench committees are going to be doing this kind of work, there should be additional regulation and oversight of the work they’re doing and the way in which they’re financed. It’s either a loophole or a black hole for regulation.”</p> <p>He added that the use of the parliamentary logo on the 1922 sub-committee’s reports was a “red flag” that wrongly suggested they were official reports from parliament, not produced with support from industry. “If these reports are having influence on ministers, that would be very significant,” he said.</p> <p>There has been a series of revelations about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/20/lobbyists-for-oil-and-gas-companies-shell-bp-exxonmobil#:~:text=The%20findings%20follow%20a%20series,interests%20since%20the%202019%20election.\" title=\"\">lobbying by the fossil fuel industry</a>, which has been widely blamed for delaying the response to global warming since the first warnings in the 1980s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6130149c7421e5f1363b8230630a926770537b2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6130149c7421e5f1363b8230630a926770537b2e/0_251_7524_4514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BP logo at a petrol station\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BP said the company was ‘hired by a completely different part of the business’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recent investigations into “back door” lobbying have focused on all-party parliamentary groups, which are informal cross-party groups of MPs, rather than backbench committees, which are made up of MPs from a single party who advise frontbenchers on policy. The central 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs is seen as pivotal in shaping policy and has historically wielded great sway over the party leadership. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/05/graham-brady-1922-committee-chair-conservative-tory-mps\" title=\"\">Sir Graham Brady</a>, its chair, said sub-committees such as the BEIS one were elected under the central committee’s auspices but “entirely independent in their activities”.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Leadsom said the BEIS backbench committee was “grateful to have received secretarial support” from Crowne Associates in “writing up the minutes of independent evidence sessions and compiling the two reports so far” and said it had no influence over its work. The spokeswoman added that there was “no financial connection” with the committee and that the £2,093 sum declared in the register of interests from the firm was “purely notional”.</p> <p>She said: “Each of the 1922 backbench committees identify and arrange their own secretarial support. The secretariat support provided by This Is Purpose is clearly disclosed in the report and in the MPs’ register in accordance with the guidelines.” </p> <p>She said the use of the parliamentary logo was allowed on the reports because it was “clear” that backbench committees were not official committees, adding that the secretariat support from Crowne Associates was declared in July because “it did not reach the declarable threshold until the second inquiry was completed”.</p> <p>Crowne Associates, trading as This Is Purpose, said its work for the MPs and BP was separate and that it was “not contracted by BP’s government affairs team”. It added: “The recommendations for the report are wholly the committee’s own and all our work is properly declared.” </p> <p>BP said the company was “hired by a completely different part of the business to conduct research for our social mobility report which outlines how we can better support social mobility and support more apprenticeships and work placements”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/21/the-storm-is-upon-us-review-qanon-history-updated-trump-january-6","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"The Storm is Upon Us review: indispensable QAnon history, updated","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/21/the-storm-is-upon-us-review-qanon-history-updated-trump-january-6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/21/the-storm-is-upon-us-review-qanon-history-updated-trump-january-6","fields":{"headline":"The Storm is Upon Us review: indispensable QAnon history, updated","trailText":"Donald Trump welcomed the conspiracy at the White House.

Partly because of the crucial role played by so many QAnon devotees in the storming of the Capitol on 6 January 2021 but mostly because Rothschild documents how much of this insanity has penetrated to the heart of the new Republican party, propelled by many of America’s most loathsome individuals, from Ted Cruz and Donald Trump Jr to Alex Jones, Michael Flynn and Roseanne Barr.</p> <p>As Rothschild writes of Trump’s first national security adviser, “Flynn’s family even filmed themselves taking the ‘digital soldier oath’... part of what would become a total enmeshment between members of the Flynn family and QAnon.”</p> <p>In the two years before the 2020 presidential election, “nearly 100 Republican candidates declared themselves to be Q Believers” while Trump “retweeted hundreds of Q followers, putting their violent fantasies and bizarre memes into tens of millions of feeds”.</p> <p>Asked about a movement which has repackaged most of the oldest and harshest racist and antisemitic conspiracies for a new age, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/19/trump-qanon-praise-conspiracy-theory-believers\">Trump</a> gave his usual coy endorsement of the behavior of America’s most damaged internet addicts.</p> <p>“I don’t know much about the movement,” he mumbled, “other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate.”</p> <p>In winter 2021, as the Omicron variant sent Covid cases skyrocketing, “QAnon promoters were among the most visible anti-vaccine advocates pushing out lies and conspiracy theories” to “dissuade people from getting vaccinated”.</p> <p>As with so many of QAnon adherents’ positions, the message was “both clear and completely contradicted by the available evidence: they believed the pandemic was over and any mandates related to vaccines or masks were totalitarian control mechanisms that were actually killing people”.</p> <p>More than anything else, this is the latest horrific confirmation of what the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/\">recently</a> described as “the power of social media as a universal solvent, breaking down bonds and weakening institutions everywhere it reached”.</p> <p>Like so many other ghastly conspiracies of recent decades, especially the blood libel that the Sandy Hook massacre was a staged event in which no one was actually killed, QAnon was propelled at warp speed by a combination of the incompetence and greed of all the big-tech big shots: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.</p> <p>Rothschild describes the usual futile internet game of Whac-A-Mole.</p> <p>Reddit “abruptly banned the 70,000-member r/Great Awakening board because members had started harassing other users” and had released the personal information “of at least one person they incorrectly claimed to be a mass shooter”.</p> <p>No matter: Q followers just migrated to Twitter and “closed Facebook groups with tens of thousands of members … Just in 2018, Q believers shared Q YouTube videos over 1.4m times, and drove hundreds of thousands of shares to Fox News, Breitbart and the Gateway Pundit”.</p> <p>By 2019, “Trump was routinely retweeting QAnon-promoting accounts.” By the 2020 election, “Trump had retweeted hundreds … and was regularly sharing memes created by the movement”.</p> <p>When Twitter and Facebook finally started “cracking down on Q iconography in the summer of 2020”, much of the movement just moved on to Instagram.

The formerly third most powerful Republican leader in the US Congress had been punished too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The thought that if you don’t do what we like, then we will just get rid of you and march on and do it ourselves – that to me is fascism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Bowers’s case, his assailants in the Arizona Republican party wanted to punish him because he had steadfastly refused to do their, and Trump’s, bidding. He had declined to use his power as leader of the house to invoke an “arcane Arizonan law” – whose text has never been found – that would allow the legislature to cast out the will of 3.4 million voters who had handed victory to Joe Biden and switch the outcome unilaterally to Trump.</p> <p>Bowers has a word for that kind of thinking. “The thought that if you don’t do what we like, then we will just get rid of you and march on and do it ourselves –<strong> </strong>that to me is fascism.”</p> <p>Come January, Bowers will no longer be an Arizona politician. He can now speak his mind. He did just that, for more than two hours in an interview with the Guardian this week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b1fe2d3d3966caa243749a9ed185be7fa791f20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b1fe2d3d3966caa243749a9ed185be7fa791f20/0_424_5973_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘The constitution is hanging by a thread.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The constitution is hanging by a thread.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Riding/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He spoke his mind about the phone conversations he had with Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani at the height of the stolen election mayhem in 2020. He spoke about the “clown circus” of Trump loyalists who tried to bully him into subverting the election, and about the “emotional violence” that has been embraced by increasingly powerful sections of the Republican party in Arizona and nationally.</p> <p>He spoke his mind too about the very real danger facing democracy in America today – to his astonishment, at the hands of his own party.</p> <p>“The constitution is hanging by a thread,” he told me. “The funny thing is, I always thought it would be the other guys. And it’s my side. That just rips at my heart: that we would be the people who would surrender the constitution in order to win an election. That just blows my mind.”</p> <h2>‘I’m not a man of means’</h2> <p>Bowers will talk about all that, and much more. But first, he wants to show me around his spiritual home. He arranged to meet me at his family’s ranch, “so you can see a bit of why I think the way I do”.</p> <p>The ranch is nestled in a hollow among desert hills about 90 minutes’ drive east of Phoenix, at the end of five miles of dramatically snaking dirt road. Fifteen months ago a wildfire swept through the area, destroying majestic cottonwoods and sycamores and sending flames high up above the hills. The main house came within 10 feet of being destroyed and his art studio, replete with many of his landscape paintings and a large portion of his legislative papers, was burnt to ashes.</p> <p>I ask him what this extraordinarily beautiful and harsh landscape reveals about his political character. “Well, I’m not a man of means,” he said. “We pay for things as we go. We are compelled to work, to do things with our hands. That gives you a different appreciation of life. Things have a bigger meaning.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed109be85037983ebda3021a8d3dac1a3241b0c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed109be85037983ebda3021a8d3dac1a3241b0c6/0_422_5638_3385/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bowers: ‘Family, faith, community – these are values at a very core level.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bowers: ‘Family, faith, community – these are values at a very core level.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Riding/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bowers said that his core values were instilled in him as a child growing up within a conservative Republican tradition. He is the father of seven children, one of whom, Kacey, died last year. “Family, faith, community – these are values at a very core level. You don’t survive out here, on land like this, alone.”</p> <p>A fourth-generation Arizonan, Bowers, 69, grew up within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, better known as the Mormon church. His faith, along with his other great passion for art – he is a painter and sculptor – is visible all around. The front of the main house is lined with three large bronzes depicting the epic 1,100-mile journey across America that the Mormons undertook in 1846-47.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I campaigned for Trump, I went to his rallies, I stood up on the stage with him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From the beginning, conservatism and the Republican party were interchangeable for Bowers. “Belief in God, that you should be held accountable for how you treat other people, those were very conservative thoughts and the bedrock of my politics.”</p> <p>He identifies as “pro-life”, sees the US constitution as being inspired by God, and voted for Trump in the 2020 election. “I campaigned for Trump, I went to his rallies, I stood up on the stage with him,” he said.</p> <p>Somewhere along the line, though, things started to come unstuck. A rift opened up between his old-school Republican values and those of a new cadre of activists who were energized by Trump and his embrace of conspiracy theories and strongman politics.</p> <p>In hindsight, Bowers now recognizes that the opening shots of the conflict were fired not around the 2020 presidential election but earlier in the year, in the initial days of Covid. Trump-fanatical Republicans in the Arizona house displayed in their anti-mask antics the same disdain for the rules, the same bullying style, that was later to erupt in the stolen election furor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9eff35ab9333be3d15cf3e5e168bae5a00fe05cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eff35ab9333be3d15cf3e5e168bae5a00fe05cc/0_185_4435_5543/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bowers with an example of the art he produces.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bowers with an example of the art he produces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Riding/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It was like a prep show,” he said.</p> <p>Then came the first signs of Trump’s refusal to accept defeat in the 2020 election. Bowers himself always expected that the presidential race in Arizona would be close. “We were very much aware that a demographic of women, 18 to 40, college-educated, professional, with small children, were not voting for Donald Trump,” he said.</p> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/arizona-president-results\">results were confirmed</a>, and Biden had won by 10,457 votes, the slimmest margin of any state, Bowers was unsurprised. But such was the brouhaha as armed Trump supporters protested outside counting centers in Maricopa county <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/cyber-ninjas-company-led-arizona-gop-election-audit-shutting-down-n1287145\">demanding “audits”</a> that he decided to take a look for himself.</p> <p>He gathered a group of trusted lawyers and went to investigate the counting process close up. “I saw incredible amounts of protocols that were followed and signed off by volunteers – Democrats, Republicans, independents. Yes, Republicans for crying out loud! And they did it by the book.”</p> <p>On 22 November 2020, two weeks after Biden had been declared the next president of the United States, Bowers received a call from the White House. Trump and Giuliani were on the line.</p> <p>After exchanging niceties, they got down to business. Giuliani said they had found 200,000 illegal immigrants and 6,000 dead people who had voted in Arizona. “We need to fix that,” Giuliani told him, cajoling him to call a special committee of the Arizona legislature to look into the supposed fraud.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump, you know, he wasn’t angry. He wasn’t threatening. Giuliani, he was the bulldog</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bowers remembers vividly how Trump and Giuliani played good cop and bad cop on that call. “Trump, you know, he wasn’t angry. He wasn’t threatening. He never said to me, ‘I’m going to get you if you don’t do this.’ Giuliani, he was the bulldog.”</p> <p>In return, Bowers was polite but firm. He told the duo that they had to provide hard evidence. “I said, ‘I’m not doing anything like this until you bring me something. Let’s see it. I’m not going to have circus time at the house of representatives.’”</p> <p>That’s when Trump and Giuliani unveiled their second, even more incendiary, proposal. They had heard that there was an “arcane Arizona law” that would allow the Republican-controlled legislature under Bowers to throw out Biden’s electors and send Trump alternatives to Congress in their place.</p> <p>It took a moment for the penny to drop. Bowers was being asked to overturn the election through diktat.</p> <p>“I’m not a professor of constitutional law, but I get the idea. They want me to throw out the vote of my own people,” he recalls thinking. “I said, ‘Oh, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. So now, you’re asking me to overthrow the vote of the people of Arizona?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b5d599c96709537efed26816fda2e42b016cb74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b5d599c96709537efed26816fda2e42b016cb74/0_422_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bowers is sworn in before testifying during the fourth hearing by the House January 6 committee in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bowers is sworn in before testifying during the fourth hearing by the House January 6 committee in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bowers’s response to the good cop, bad cop routine was categoric. He told them: “I took an oath to the American constitution, the state constitution and its laws. Which one of those am I supposed to break?”</p> <p>It didn’t stop there. Bowers was pounded by wave after wave of demands that he subvert the election, some coming from the White House, some from “America First” politicians closer to home.</p> <p>The speaker continued to be lobbied right up to the eve of January 6 when John Eastman, the conservative law professor advising Trump on his attempted electoral coup, rang him and exhorted him to “decertify” the electors. “Just do it and let the courts figure it all out,” Eastman said.</p> <p>Bowers was direct on that occasion too. “No,” he said.</p> <p>As January 6 approached, and the cries of stolen election reached fever pitch, the attacks on Bowers became personal. A “Trump train” of angry fanatics blaring their horns in pickup trucks festooned with Maga flags turned up at his home in Mesa, some bearing digital boards proclaiming him to be a pedophile.</p> <p>To protect his family, he would step outside the house and confront the protesters. One man had three bars on his chest, signalling he was a member of the far-right militia group the Three Percenters. The man was screaming obscenities and carrying a pistol. “I had to get as close to him as I could to defend myself if he went for the gun.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I never had the thought of giving up. No way. I don’t like bullies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The worst of it was that during several of these menacing protests, his daughter Kacey was inside the house mortally ill in bed with liver failure. “She would say, ‘What are they doing out there?’ She was emotional. She told me, ‘I’m going to die.’ I said, ‘Honey, you’re not going to die.’ So she had feelings, we were trying to keep her positive.”</p> <p>Kacey Bowers did die, on 28 January, three weeks after the insurrection at the US Capitol.</p> <p>I asked Bowers whether, through all this, he had ever doubted his strength to stand up to the onslaught. Were his values tested?</p> <p>“I never had the thought of giving up,” he said. “No way. I don’t like bullies. That’s one constant in my life: I. Do. Not. Like. Bullies.”</p> <h2>Primary defeat</h2> <p>In July, the executive committee of the Arizona Republican party censured Bowers. Its chairwoman, Kelli Ward, a Trump devotee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelliwardaz/status/1549600052858957824\">said that he was</a> “no longer a Republican in good standing”.</p> <p>Then on 28 July, Bowers was <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/29/arizona-legislature-primary-election-results-august-2022/10108530002/\">effectively turfed out</a> of the Arizona legislature when he was defeated in the primary by the Satan-evoking Farnsworth. That same night, the slate of election deniers standing for statewide positions won a clean sweep.</p> <p>Republican nominations for governor, a US Senate seat, state attorney general and secretary of state all went to enthusiastic backers of Trump and his 2020 attempted coup. They included Mark Finchem, who was present at the attack on the US Capitol on January 6 and who continues to try to decertify Biden’s presidency to this day.</p> <p>Finchem is now the Republican candidate for secretary of state. Should he win in November, he would be in charge of Arizona’s election administration through the 2024 presidential contest, in which Trump has indicated he is likely to be competing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7d7cb673695919d5761ae111e2072c9faeef9f7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d7cb673695919d5761ae111e2072c9faeef9f7d/0_339_5973_3584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rusty Bowers’s spiritual home: the family ranch in Arizona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bowers’s spiritual home: the family ranch in Arizona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Riding/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ascent of election deniers across the board marks the final transformation of the Republican party in the state. Trump’s grip is now complete; the strain of constitutional conservatism epitomized by Bowers is in the wilderness.</p> <p>“I think it’s a shame,” was his rueful reflection on that transition. “The suite of candidates that we now have representing what used to be a principled party is just like, wow … It’s like being the first colonizer on Jupiter.”</p> <p>In February, a mega <a href=\"https://kjzz.org/content/1799682/david-farnsworth-defeats-rusty-bowers-arizona-senate-legislative-district-10\">“election integrity” bill</a> was introduced into the Arizona legislature that was the culmination of the anti-democratic drift of the party. <a href=\"https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/bills/HB2596P.pdf\">House bill 2596 </a>would have given the Republican-controlled legislature the power to reject any election result that the majority group didn’t like.</p> <p>Bowers resoundingly killed off that bill by sending it to languish not in just one house committee, but in all 12 of them. “I was trying to send a definitive message: this is hogwash. Taking away the fundamental right to vote, the idea that the legislature could nullify your election, that’s not conservative. That’s fascist. And I’m not a fascist.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s a party that doesn’t have any thought. It’s all emotional, it’s all revenge. It’s all anger. That’s all it is</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bowers said he remains optimistic that the party will one day find its way back on to the rails. He draws succor from the many people who have come up to him since his defeat telling him – quietly, so that nobody can hear – that they admire him and back him.</p> <p>“It’s not like I’m alone in the wilderness. There’s a lot of people from all over the United States thanking me.”</p> <p>But for now, he accepts that things are likely to get much worse before they get better. I ask him, at this moment, is the Republican party in Arizona lost?</p> <p>“Yeah,” he said. “They’ve invented a new way. It’s a party that doesn’t have any thought. It’s all emotional, it’s all revenge. It’s all anger. That’s all it is.”</p> <p>He held the thumb and digit finger of his right hand so close together that they were almost touching. “The veneer of civilization is this thin,” he said. “It still exists – I haven’t been hanged yet. But holy moly, this is just crazy. The place has lost its mind.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/21/we-are-being-abandoned-when-the-energy-bill-goes-up-by-100000-a-day","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"‘We are being abandoned’: when the energy bill goes up by £100,000 a day","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/21/we-are-being-abandoned-when-the-energy-bill-goes-up-by-100000-a-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/21/we-are-being-abandoned-when-the-energy-bill-goes-up-by-100000-a-day","fields":{"headline":"‘We are being abandoned’: when the energy bill goes up by £100,000 a day","trailText":"If domestic bills are climbing, so too are those of schools, sheltered housing and museums.

It has been a gruelling few weeks at the helm of Brunelcare, a charity that provides sheltered housing to 1,400 people and runs seven care homes in Bristol and Somerset.</p> <p>“We were set up during the blitz when older people were being bombed out of their homes in Bristol. Our mantra then was to keep them warm, keep them fed, and keep them alive – and we haven’t really needed to worry about that in the decades since,” the chief excutive says at the charity’s head office in the city. “Now we’re in a situation where we need to make sure people are kept warm and we need to make sure people are fed.”</p> <p>Last week Goldsworthy was forced to sign a new energy contract worth £7.7m because prices were rising by £100,000 a day. From October it will be paying more than five times what it used to pay for gas and electricity, which was about £1.5m a year. “We’re in an absolutely impossible situation. I’ve had one of the worst weeks ever and I’ve been through Covid so I know what hard times are like,” she says, shaking her head gently. “We are being abandoned again.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf30182d021110033bf977583d637ea72536de0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf30182d021110033bf977583d637ea72536de0c/0_105_3648_4560/800.jpg\" alt=\"Oona Goldsworthy of Brunelcare in Bristol. ‘I’ve had one of the worst weeks ever,’ she says. ‘We are being being abandoned again.’\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oona Goldsworthy of Brunelcare in Bristol. ‘I’ve had one of the worst weeks ever,’ she says. ‘We are being being abandoned again.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gem Hicks Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goldsworthy worries about the impact this huge financial burden will have on residents of the sheltered homes. Staff are desperately seeking to cut energy usage by 20% and ensure residents are claiming their full benefit entitlement, but she dreads the winter. “We are planning for an emergency,” she says. “Brunelcare alone does not have the means to help everyone through this cost of living crisis.”</p> <p>Service charges paid by sheltered housing residents are likely to more than quadruple. “There is currently no protection for some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in this country because they do not buy their own gas and electricity. They have been forgotten about,” says Goldsworthy. “We are really worried about how they will cope this winter – many could be forced to choose between heating and eating. It is horrific.”</p> <p>The government’s energy price cap and £400 bill rebate only apply only to domestic customers who buy their own electricity and gas. They do not help people living in sheltered housing or care homes, where the energy to heat and power their homes is purchased on the wholesale market by a charity or private provider. The vast majority of Brunelcare’s residents are on low incomes, with 70% entitled to benefits including universal credit and pension credit. However, these benefits do not cover increased energy costs</p> <p>The lack of government help could have serious consequences. “Like many other charities, we can’t just absorb these kinds of price increases,” says Goldsworthy.</p> <p>“We’ll have to make cuts and put up our charges [for sheltered housing] to cover this. Unless the government steps in, it will put into jeopardy our ability to continue to support our residents in the way we always have.”</p> <p><em>Tom Wall</em></p> <h2><strong>The museum bosses</strong></h2> <p>Diana Leitch, chair of the trustees of the Catalyst Science Discovery Centre and Museum in Widnes, Cheshire, said the museum was stunned when its quoted gas bill for the year rose by 460%. She said the museum would be forced to look at cutbacks, but would try to avoid reducing opening hours.</p> <p>The museum’s annual gas bill to the end of September 2022 was £9,700, but on 5 August it was quoted £48,582 for a renewed annual contract from 1 October.</p> <p>Leitch said: “We were so stunned by this we started to look around to find if we could find something better. We found other suppliers were doing what is called closing their books and were not making offers. In the interim, the cost to renew our contract had risen to £54,362.”</p> <p>It meant the cost of renewing the annual gas contract had been rising by nearly £580 a day. The museum sought the help of a broker in finding a new contract and signed a new contract on Thursday for £44,000.</p> <p>Leitch said: “You can see the enormity of what is going on. And it’s happening everywhere. We don’t wish to cut back on what we are providing.</p> <p>“Widnes is a deprived area and there are three food banks within half a mile of where we are. These are the people who making the decision on whether they eat or have heat. People will be coming into museums to keep warm.”</p> <p>Lee Juby, the museum’s chief executive, said: “Energy bills are a large proportion of our cost, but we have enough reserves to get through this.</p> <p>“There will be undoubtedly some organisations that don’t survive.”</p> <p><em>Jon Ungoed-Thomas and Rebecca Brahde</em></p> <h2><strong>The headteacher</strong></h2> <p>Instead of recovering from a “hellish few years” running 18 schools during a pandemic, Dan Morrow, CEO of the Dartmoor Multi Academy Trust, spent his holiday last week writing different versions of budget cuts, including job losses, to present to his board.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fcc6af4c1ec3886dd26814792a11c283463eda89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcc6af4c1ec3886dd26814792a11c283463eda89/0_466_3456_4320/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Morrow, CEO of Dartmoor Multi Academy Trust. ‘I can’t sleep,’ he said.

It isn’t just elusive, I fear it doesn’t exist.”</p> <p>At the end of last term Morrow knew things were bad. He had to find an eye-watering £800,000 to cover the increase in energy bills. He had cancelled job ads to recruit important support staff in areas including attendance and family liaison as well as teaching assistants. Then it got worse. The trust had budgeted what had been suggested for teachers’ pay, but at the start of the holidays the government announced an increased pay rise of 5%, which was followed by a separate rise for local council support staff, with no extra cash to pay for them. That meant finding an extra £900,000.</p> <p>Morrow is clear that he “absolutely supports” these pay increases. “They are in fact real terms pay cuts as they are significantly below inflation. But they are significantly above funding,” he said.</p> <p>His budget plans include redundancies, he said, “but this will be our absolute last option”. Nonetheless, he will have to freeze all recruitment, which equates to a 5% cut in staff, or 45 jobs. He is also looking, with regret, at cutting uniform and food grants for struggling families, school trips, sports competitions and new books.</p> <p>He fears the poorest children, many of whom are already significantly behind because of Covid, will be hit hardest. “They are labelled disadvantaged but are under-served by a system that appears to want to keep them in their ‘place’,” he said. “It means the idea that education is part of the levelling up agenda isn’t just risible, it is patently untrue.”</p> <p><em>Anna Fazackerley</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/21/the-tory-leadership-contest-could-alienate-voters-in-blue-and-red-wall-seats","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"The Tory leadership contest could alienate voters in blue and red wall seats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/21/the-tory-leadership-contest-could-alienate-voters-in-blue-and-red-wall-seats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/21/the-tory-leadership-contest-could-alienate-voters-in-blue-and-red-wall-seats","fields":{"headline":"The Tory leadership contest could alienate voters in blue and red wall seats","trailText":"Analysis: the party’s coalition is built on the ‘red wall’ and younger southern professionals, whose patience for posturing is limited","byline":"Will Jennings","body":"<p>The Conservative leadership campaign has seen the party jettison large parts of the platform it was elected on in 2019 – not least Boris Johnson’s pledge to level up the country – tacking rightwards on the economy and issues such as the environment and education.

Many marginal constituencies in the south-east – places such as Esher and Walton and Winchester – are home to large numbers of graduates and professionals, groups that once upon a time were reliable Conservative voters. The party can no longer take these voters for granted, especially those of working age.

Many of these seats could come under threat if the new PM does not tack back towards the centre ground after the leadership contest is over.</p> <p>At the same time, Truss’s focus on tax cuts, and her reluctance to commit to help people with rising fuel bills in winter, threaten an important part of the party’s electoral coalition. First-time Conservative voters in former industrial towns in the Midlands and north of England tend to hold more leftwing attitudes on public spending and redistribution than their counterparts in the south. As the country’s economic position worsens in the autumn, many of these voters will be looking for the government to intervene. Tax cuts will be low on the agenda for most voters, and if expectations about tackling regional inequalities end in disappointment, there is a risk that many of the people who lent their vote to the Tories in 2019 will return to Labour at the next election. This could put many of the 45 “red wall” seats lost to the Conservatives back in play.</p> <p>Regardless of the outcome of the leadership contest, the Conservative party seems set to double down on its culture-war agenda while pushing rightwards on the economy.</p> <p>If the new PM persists with this course, especially in the context of a serious economic crisis, the party is in deep danger of losing seats both in its southern heartlands and in the red wall at the next election.</p> <p><em>Will Jennings is </em><em>professor of </em><em>political </em><em>science and </em><em>public </em><em>policy at the University of Southampton</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/aug/21/the-big-picture-communal-living-in-modern-st-petersburg-francoise-huguier","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"The big picture: communal living in modern St Petersburg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/21/the-big-picture-communal-living-in-modern-st-petersburg-francoise-huguier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/21/the-big-picture-communal-living-in-modern-st-petersburg-francoise-huguier","fields":{"headline":"The big picture: communal living in modern St Petersburg","trailText":"In the 00s, French photographer Françoise Huguier documented the many Russians still living in crumbling communal houses commandeered during the revolution","byline":"Tim Adams","body":"<p>During the 1917 revolution, the Bolsheviks seized the grand private houses in the centre of Moscow and St Petersburg and established each of them as a communal living space for 10 or more families. The <em>kommunalk</em><em>a</em> survived the Soviet years, but after the collapse of communism many were sold off and restored to private ownership. In St Petersburg, in particular, however, a housing crisis meant that a large number of the buildings remained communal. By the time the French photographer <a href=\"https://agencevu.com/en/photographer/francoise-huguier/\">Françoise Huguier</a> began to document them in 2001, perhaps 300,000 people still lived in these crumbling houses. Some had been resident since before the war.</p> <p>Huguier rented a room in one of the buildings and over the following decade lived there on and off for months at a time. She recalled her first night clearly: “Someone was kicking my bedroom door: I woke up with a jolt. It was four in the morning. Two guys holding bottles of vodka insisted we got to know one another. Their room was at the end of the corridor. On the way we bumped into an old woman. With a wave of her hand she seemed to say: don’t worry, I keep watch day and night…”</p> <p>Huguier produced a book of photographs, some of which feature in a new retrospective of her work, devoted to the idea of “discretion”: the way in which, over time, she and her camera became invisible to her subjects. Huguier lived as an accepted member of the <em>kommunalk</em><em>a</em>, in which strict etiquette still governed the use of communal kitchens, but in which there were also profound issues with poverty and addiction.

Vladimir Putin likes to talk about the second world war, Russia’s best war, but the closest parallel is probably the Crimean war, which dragged on for two and a half years, from 1853 to 1856, before the exhausted belligerents worked out a peace agreement.</p> <p>An underachieving Russian military failed to achieve any of its goals. But the British and French, who forged an alliance with the Turks, encountered frustrations of their own as they groped toward a victory that felt pyrrhic at times. Surprisingly, one of the war’s great legacies was felt in the US, where an unexpected chain of events, tied to Russia’s defeat, helped to end slavery.</p> <p>Can any lessons be drawn from the Crimean war today?</p> <h2>Wars end differently than they begin</h2> <p>Carl von Clausewitz wrote: “In war more than anywhere else things do not turn out as we expect.” Few expected war in 1853. When it came, most predictions turned out to be inaccurate, including a belief that the Russian army was invincible, especially when fighting close to the Motherland.</p> <p>The Crimean war began for the smallest of reasons, when Russian and French monks quarreled over who held the right to a key to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. As it turned out, that key would unlock Pandora’s box, leading Russia’s tsar, Nicholas I, to invade the Ottoman empire with hopes of gaining Constantinople, now Istanbul.</p> <p>The Ottomans were joined by France and Britain, which sent ships and troops to the Black Sea. A war of attrition ensued, including naval battles as far away as the Baltic and the Pacific.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Only a miracle can extricate him from the difficulties heaped on him and Russia by his pride, shallowness and imbecility</p> <footer> <cite>Karl Marx on Nicholas I</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Poorly trained soldiers fight poorly</h2> <p>Before the Crimean war, Russia’s huge army was feared throughout Europe. But its weakness soon became evident. With demoralized troops, many young conscripts or landless serfs, Russia lost most engagements and ended the conflict with its military reputation in tatters. Its weapons were vastly inferior to those of the British and French, who had steam-powered frigates and rifles that fired accurately over long distances.</p> <p>Despite these advantages, victory came at a high price and there were strains within the alliance. Serious tactical blunders stopped the French and British winning more decisively and each side suffered about 250,000 casualties, most of whom died from disease. That led to a third lesson …</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2e4ddc7a7b1189142db2b43ebe5969fbc04626d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e4ddc7a7b1189142db2b43ebe5969fbc04626d/410_1439_3038_2549/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Sparling, full-length portrait, seated on Roger Fenton's photographic van from Roger Fenton Crimean War photograph collection\" width=\"1000\" height=\"839\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roger Fenton’s mobile dark room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger Fenton/Library of Congress</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>It is difficult to wage an unpopular war</h2> <p>The invention of the camera and the telegraph allowed a new breed of witness to cover the Crimean war in detail. There were still treacly accounts of derring-do – an insipid memento of the conflict was Alfred Lord Tennyson’s poem, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jan/20/poem-of-the-week-charge-light-brigade-tennyson\">The Charge of the Light Brigade</a>, which turned a colossal act of stupidity – the rash order of a general to attack an impregnable position – into a puddle of Victorian piety.</p> <p>But the spread of photography and rapid dispatches from the front muted this old-fashioned kind of writing, much as cellphones have blunted Putin’s efforts to brand his invasion a success, and focused attention on possible war crimes. Working out of a wine wagon converted into a mobile dark room, a British photographer, Roger Fenton, was able to capture the visual story of the war with images of stunning clarity. Journalists filed stories from the front, so readers in London and Paris could experience the war from their armchairs. That helped build support when the war was going well but it also raised the pressure when it was not.</p> <p>Even American readers were following the war, thanks to the remarkable reporting of a London-based German reporter, Karl Marx, who filed 113 articles for the New York Tribune. Marx was a harsh critic of Russia’s military adventure, pointing out its strategic vagueness, its ineptitude and its utter waste of human life. Denouncing the tsar as an “imperial blunderer”, he poured out vitriol that might make Putin wince today: “Only a miracle can extricate him from the difficulties now heaped on him and Russia by his pride, shallowness, and imbecility.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a53814032a77cfa058d283717ee6c770052db083\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a53814032a77cfa058d283717ee6c770052db083/0_0_2539_3352/757.jpg\" alt=\"Abraham Lincoln, in an image taken in 1863.\" width=\"757\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abraham Lincoln, in an image taken in 1863.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Gardner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A vague peace will lead to new problems</h2> <p>The Treaty of Paris ended hostilities in 1856 but left unaddressed many other concerns, including the porousness of south-eastern Europe’s boundaries – the “Eastern Question” would plague leaders until the first world war in 1914. After a relatively long peace following the Napoleonic era, the Crimean war unleashed a new volatility in great power politics. Europe would see a series of small, nasty wars before the immense carnage of the 20th century.</p> <h2>Wars have distant consequences</h2> <p>Nicholas I died in 1855. His son, Alexander II, accepted defeat but then did a remarkable thing. Looking at the causes of the disaster, he recognized that Russia’s performance was related to its rigid class structure and heavy reliance on serfs. Accordingly, he abolished serfdom with a proclamation of emancipation on 3 March 1861.</p> <p>By coincidence, that was the day before Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated as president of the United States. Lincoln understood the power of the precedent and issued an Emancipation Proclamation of his own, on the first day of 1863.</p> <p>In other words, a war that had nothing at all to do with freedom when it started helped make possible one of the greatest manumissions in history, on a different continent, a decade later.</p> <p>The American purchase of Alaska was another legacy. After Crimea, the young tsar knew he could not defend this distant frontier and decided to sell it to a nation with a more realistic hope of populating it someday.</p> <p>In that, and in so many other ways, we continue to live in a world shaped by a small, mostly forgotten war in south-eastern Europe.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://macaulay.cuny.edu/directory/ted-widmer/\">Ted Widmer</a> is a distinguished lecturer at the Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York and the author of Lincoln on the Verge: Thirteen Days to Washington, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/lincoln-on-the-verge-thirteen-days-to-washington/9781476739441\">published in the US</a> by Simon and Schuster</em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/21/emily-maitlis-jon-sopel-the-news-agents-podcast-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel: ‘Risk, jeopardy, challenge.

They would, we were told, be presenting a daily news podcast together, a format inspired by their partnership on <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p07h19zz\">Americast</a></em>, a BBC series that had been a huge hit (at moments, it was the UK’s most listened to podcast in any genre). Was this a coup? It certainly was. Inside the BBC, no one had any idea that two of its biggest names were about to depart until after the pair had been driven, in a car with blacked-out windows, to Global’s HQ in Leicester Square to sign the deal of their lives in conditions of utmost secrecy. In media circles, the gossip thereafter was energetic and, possibly, somewhat envious. Both were reported to have won hefty pay rises in the process (at the BBC, Sopel earned at least £235,000 and Maitlis at least £325,000).</p> \n<p>And now here they are, the nearest thing British news has to a pair of high-octane celebrities, waiting to greet me on the other side of a set of security barriers, a small PR retinue in tow. How are they feeling? Are they nervous, excited or both? In fact, their mood seems to be set today to lightly giddy. Having worked on the podcast for weeks – dummies have been made, complete with real-life interviewees – both are about to disappear for a holiday before their launch at the end of this month. There is a feeling that school is out, at least for a while; Maitlis is wearing shorts with her heeled mules.</p> \n<p>But perhaps this is just how they are. There has always been something slightly playful about their relationship or so they tell me once we have installed ourselves around a table in a nondescript meeting room. Maitlis says that when, long ago, they used to present on the BBC news channel together, the danger that he would make her corpse was ever-present. Off air, there was much giggling. “What was that programme?” asks Sopel, who is smiley and loquacious. “You know… the one where there were these couples living next door to each other and they were great mates and they had an organic garden?” Does he mean <em>The Good Life</em>? “Yes, <em>The Good Life</em>.” Maitlis, who is made of somewhat sterner stuff, rolls her eyes. “That doesn’t make sense at all,” she says. “Are you thinking I’m Barbara?” But it gets worse. “No, the other one,” he announces. (He means the dreaded Margot, with her kaftans and her snobbish affectations.) Maitlis flashes him an indulgent smile. “We’re not like them in any sense,” she says, with all the firmness of a parent.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"750c498853321bb22f45539cba7d7a8f263ddf2b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/750c498853321bb22f45539cba7d7a8f263ddf2b/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Marr is among other big names to have quit the BBC in recent years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Marr is among other big names to have quit the BBC in recent years.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Global/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In recent years, Global has been the cause, at least according to the <em>Daily Mail</em>, of something of a brain drain at the BBC, Shelagh Fogarty, Eddie Mair and, more recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/24/andrew-marr-vows-to-ruffle-feathers-on-lbc-after-quitting-bbc\">Andrew Marr</a> having all signed to LBC. But the move of Maitlis and Sopel is, perhaps, of a different order altogether. They aren’t filling existing slots in a schedule. They are trying something entirely new, the concept of which I’m not sure I entirely understand. Perhaps this is a stupid question, but what, precisely, will a daily news podcast involve? When will it land and when do they hope listeners will listen to it?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Impartiality will be really important for us. We’re not trying to do shock-jock stuff</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Emily Maitlis</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>True to form, Sopel answers first. “Well, it’s not going to be breathless, breaking news, just yapping and hyperventilating,” he says. “We’re going to stand back from the big story. We’re going to ask: what do I need to know about this? What will be really engaging, intelligent, something I didn’t already know? We’re going to get some really great guests who will illuminate these topics.” OK, but could he give me an example? Two days before, for instance, Britain saw record temperatures. So would their podcast, were they to be making it right now, look at the weather? Maitlis now jumps in. “My feeling is that it wouldn’t,” she says. “Our producer found this marathon going on in Death Valley in California, so we could have done that as an opener… like: you might feel this is unbearable, but what about there? But beyond that – not to underplay climate change – everyone’s doing the same story. We’d kind of like to hold back on that.”</p> \n<p>All the same, isn’t there already a lot of in-depth news available elsewhere? How will they compete? “That’s the challenge,” says Sopel. “I’m not saying it’s going to be easy.” So will they record it on the day and put it out, say, in the evening? “We’re working on the speed of turnaround,” says Maitlis. “At the moment, it’s got to be up by drive time [about 5pm] and we’ll record it mid-afternoon.” The show will be called <em>The News Agents</em> (do you see what they did there?). They’re aiming for a two-hour turnaround and while the five podcasts they’ll put out every week won’t be more than an hour long, they will never, other than in exceptional circumstances, be shorter than 30 minutes. “You’ve got to be realistic about people’s driving time, or walking the dog time, or whatever it happens to be,” says Sopel.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a65bbbc255c652d5f0a5716317793b02a84194cf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a65bbbc255c652d5f0a5716317793b02a84194cf/95_1333_3340_2005/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maitlis and Sopel are good friends off air. ‘We can be honest with each other,’ says Maitlis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maitlis and Sopel are good friends off air. ‘We can be honest with each other,’ says Maitlis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maitlis relishes the “endless flexibility” of a podcast. “On a day when the prime minister is making a statement at seven o’clock, we’ll go: hang on guys, it’s worth waiting and we’ll drop it later. After the byelections [when the Conservatives lost both in Wakefield, and in Tiverton and Honiton], we all decided that we would all have stayed up through the night and [dropped it] first thing in the morning.” Then again, the byelections happened on the same day as Roe v Wade was revoked by the US supreme court, thus radically restricting women’s abortion rights. “I think we would have done two podcasts on that day, probably,” says Sopel.</p> \n<p>All this does sound exciting, but I still wonder: how will they wheedle their way into people’s busy, overstuffed lives? “We’ve got to make it a habit-forming thing,” says Maitlis. It would, she says, be crazy for them to tell me that they know exactly how it’s going to work at this point. It is a case of responding to the audience’s needs. “What we loved about <em>Americast</em> was that people were really hungry for it, [disappointed] when there wasn’t an episode.” They relish the thought of listeners asking why they aren’t doing this or that subject. “We’ve got to find our way. If we’re doing a lot of stories about South Sudan, and there isn’t an audience out there for South Sudan, you know, we would try to work around that. You have to tell stories that are editorially important, but you also have to tell stories that people feel they are not getting elsewhere. That’s the challenge and it is a risk.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"aca1584c-a481-4c88-9d16-a3b5f5ebfdcf\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Four other notable news presenting duos</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid<br></b><em>Good Morning Britain, ITV (</em><em>2015-2021</em><em>)</em></p>\n    <p>Morgan and Reid presented the ITV breakfast show&nbsp;<em>GMB</em>&nbsp;until he quit last March after a row about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.

She is the instigator, the motor, the disruptor. Think back to last December. Omicron was spreading across the UK. Masks were again mandatory in public indoor spaces. In the same month, she and the former producer of <em>Americast</em>, Dino Sofos, who’d recently left the BBC to set up his own production company, went for a walk in the park. “Like spies,” she says. Sofos asked her: would you really leave the BBC? “And I said yes. And then I said: but we’d never get Sopes, would we? And Dino said: no, because Sopes is going to be the BBC’s new political editor.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I didn’t think we’d get Lewis Goodall. I’m thrilled… he speaks to our ambition</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Jon Sopel</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Had Sopel been offered Laura Kuenssberg’s job? “They hadn’t yet etched my name on the cup. But the cup was ready,” he says. “It was clearly intimated and I think other people had been discouraged from applying.” Did he have doubts about that job? “I don’t want to sound glib, but I think going from travelling on Air Force One and being in the east room of the White House to sitting in a transport select committee in Westminster… I had reservations.” When Maitlis approached him with the idea of joining Global, and working again with Sofos (he’ll produce their new show), he thought it was a perfect opportunity. They could both leave the BBC “at the top of their game”. It was a “no-brainer”. After this, it was all a matter of timing. Both wanted their exit to be “clean and gracious”. Sopel: “I wasn’t prepared to jerk the BBC around.” Maitlis: “The last thing you want to do is – can I say prick-tease? – is to be a prick-tease.” She wants me to put a parental advisory on this bit of the interview.</p> \n<p>Cut to the day when they were meant to formalise everything. A storm blew in and Maitlis, away on the south coast, had no wifi or phone signal. A gossipy colleague rang Sopel and put the frighteners on him. “Oh no, I thought. Is she on a plane, about to sign for some American network?” The back-stabber! But it all worked out in the end. They were driven into the car park at Global, security guards shutting the lifts so no one could see them as they moved through the building. “If we hadn’t been participating, it would have been, like, wow!” says Maitlis. “But it was scary as well. An emotional moment.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf52a1d13996ec76bfc9af2f949deefaea3de6b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf52a1d13996ec76bfc9af2f949deefaea3de6b/126_0_1049_630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Goodall, Newsnight’s policy editor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis Goodall, Newsnight’s policy editor.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Only once the deed was done, and publicity photographs had been taken, could the BBC be informed – about half an hour before Global announced its coup. Were their bosses upset? Angry? Disappointed? Were they thanked for their years of service? Apparently, I should ask other people about this. “We got a lovely, lovely message from Richard Sharp, the chairman,” says Maitlis. (This is telling, I think. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/07/richard-sharp-bbc-chair-may-be-a-tory-donor-but-it-could-be-far-worse\">Sharp, who was appointed last year</a>, is a former adviser to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak and a Conservative party donor; some believe he will not prove to be much of a friend to the BBC.)</p> \n<p>But all this talk of clandestine negotiations and fresh fields can’t disguise the fact that their departure coincided with a “clampdown” on impartiality by the BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, something that Maitlis in particular has seemed sometimes to struggle with in recent years (in May 2020, the BBC said that her opening <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/27/bbc-switches-emily-maitlis-in-newsnight-episode-over-cummings-remarks\">Newsnight </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/27/bbc-switches-emily-maitlis-in-newsnight-episode-over-cummings-remarks\">monologue about the allegations that the prime minister’s adviser Dominic Cummings</a> had broken lockdown restrictions did not meet its standards of due impartiality). “I’m happy to engage completely with this subject,” says Sopel. “I just think it’s the big thing.” Is it one reason why they are at Global? “No, that’s not quite right,” says Maitlis. “I would differentiate between what we think about impartiality and what we’re trying to do here, which is just a bloody crazy idea.”</p> \n<p>They both have things to say about it, though. Sopel talks of the time he was on a trip with Barack Obama, who was flying to the UK, supposedly to try to influence the vote on Britain’s membership of the EU. Sopel filed a piece, only to get a call from a BBC night editor, who said: this is fine, but it hasn’t got anything about Nigel Farage in it. What was his response? “I said: I don’t think Nigel Farage was on the plane.” But impartiality, he believes, isn’t just about <em>how</em> you cover a story - it’s about <em>what</em> stories you cover. The BBC has, he thinks, “ducked” the reporting of the full consequences of Brexit.</p> \n<p>“Impartiality will be really important for us here,” says Maitlis. “We’re not trying to do shock-jock stuff. We’re not trying to scream opinions at the world. Impartiality, in its true sense, is about covering stories without fear or favour. I get nervous when impartiality is used as a way of shutting down journalists. Is it because you were asking questions you shouldn’t have been? I don’t think that’s impartiality - that’s censorship. And if your journalism is going to suffer by staying somewhere where you cannot ask those questions, what are you doing, right?” She remembers being on a panel shortly after the 2020 US election. The moderator said that “some people” believed that Trump won the election. “That’s technically true. But it doesn’t make it a fact. Election results aren’t feelings.”</p> \n<p>It is, I tell her, exhausting for journalists that so many politicians now simply lie; we waste time establishing facts when we could be doing something so much more vital. “That’s spot on,” she says. “With Partygate, I had this intelligence, but when Lewis checked it out with Downing Street, they just said: that is categorically not true. What do you do when you go to source and people won’t confirm the story? It is really tiring.” On the other hand, pointing out lies, however necessary, also wears down the audience or so Sopel thinks. “Covering the Trump presidency. If you go on the news every night and say: liar, liar, pants on fire, people will turn off.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aad25ff88d6b837eb0a665fe53dc097fb31e486f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aad25ff88d6b837eb0a665fe53dc097fb31e486f/84_44_3341_2006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maitlis’s interview with Prince Andrew is being made into two films.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maitlis’s interview with Prince Andrew is being made into two films.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Before I left my desk, a colleague suggested I ask Maitlis and Sopel where they fit in the pantheon of presenting partnerships, a notion that causes Maitlis visibly to blench. “We’re not trying to be Richard and Judy,” she says. “That’s silly.” But they are good pals, and know each other’s families, and she relishes the eye rolls she sometimes gets from Sopel’s daughter. Their dogs get on well, too. Will their friendship survive the pressures of working together every day? “We can be honest with each other,” says Maitlis. “Whenever I’ve dipped my toe into showbusiness, people are, like: amazing, marvellous, great! Whereas journalists just go: fuck you, fuck you and everything’s fine in the morning.” They annoy each other. It irritates her when he embarks, as he is prone to, on one of his rambling anecdotes and she is “extremely impatient”. He could “kill” her sometimes. But they’re there for one another. When Maitlis’s father, an academic at Sheffield University, died earlier this year, Sopel immediately asked for details of the funeral.</p> \n<p>All of which brings me to think that they must both have ideas about who should play Maitlis in the two – <em>two! – </em>planned TV dramas about her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/top-lawyer-calls-prince-andrew-bbc-interview-catastrophic-error\">extraordinary interview with Prince Andrew</a> in 2019 (the one with which she is involved will be made by Blueprint Pictures, which brought us <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/02/a-very-british-scandal-review-claire-foy-the-tourist-jamie-dornan-around-the-world-in-80-days-david-tennant-stay-close-cush-jumbo\">A Very British Scandal</a>,</em> starring Claire Foy as the naughty Duchess of Argyll). But alas, no. They are in talks with “a couple of [potential] Andrews”. But otherwise, she, like Sopel, is staying mum. All she will tell me is that “we have got to do it justice, because it’s not just a one-dimensional tale about Pizza Express, you know…” (Andrew claimed to have been in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/prince-andrew-denies-sex-with-teenager-as-at-home-after-pizza-party\">Pizza Express in Woking with his daughter Beatrice</a> on the date when it was alleged he had sex with Virginia Giuffre.)</p> \n<p>At which point, a publicist arrives, tapping a watch. Could I have an email address for one of them, in case I need to check anything?

Kwasi Kwarteng, an ideological soulmate since he and Truss helped write the state-shrinkers’ bible, <em>Britannia Unchained</em>, is routinely tipped as her chancellor, while her old friend and karaoke partner, Thérèse Coffey, seems destined (depending on who you believe) to become home secretary or chief whip. Top jobs are also expected to go to former leadership contenders Suella Braverman, Penny Mordaunt and Tom Tugendhat, all of whom backed Truss after falling by the wayside. Kemi Badenoch may pay a price for not jumping on the Truss bandwagon but few expect her to miss out entirely.</p> <p>Precisely what will happen to Rishi Sunak, who looks likely to end up being just another of Truss’s erstwhile rivals, is less certain. Given the bad blood that has developed between their respective campaigns over the contest, is Truss going to offer Sunak a job – and not just a job but a job he would actually be willing to accept?</p> <p>Truss’s decision on Sunak’s future, as well as her other cabinet picks, should give us an invaluable insight into one of the most important questions facing any party leader who takes over as prime minister after their predecessor has resigned (more often than not as a result of being forced out by their colleagues). Namely, in trying to put the party (and the government) back together after it has fallen apart, is it best to preserve some sense of continuity or to signal regime change by replacing what have arguably become all-too-familiar faces? Should one aim to emphasise unity, believing the old saw that voters don’t like divided parties? Or, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9e65c04-104f-4fe7-b106-99327621ac3f\" title=\"\">as some suggest</a>, is a clear-out essential if a new direction is the order of the day?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is Truss going to offer Sunak a job – and not just a job but a job he would actually be willing to accept?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A couple of supplementary questions arise. Which of the two approaches – continuity or clear-out – has been most commonly pursued by the Conservative party and which seems more likely to produce electoral success?</p> <p>A glance back at postwar political history reveals a clear, if relatively recent, trend – at least when it comes to Tory leaders who have taken over at No 10 courtesy of their colleagues rather than the electorate. As for which strategy – clear-out or continuity – better delivers eventual victory, that’s a little harder to tell.</p> <p>The simplest way of determining the trend over time is to compare the cabinets of the outgoing Conservative prime ministers with the cabinets first appointed by whoever took over from them. What proportion of those who sat around the table at the invitation of the ousted (or at least the ex-) PM retained their seats – even if they were appointed to a different post – under the new dispensation? Some of the churn will be accounted for by genuinely voluntary departures on the part of a few of those previously appointed as cabinet ministers. But that’s most easily controlled for simply by ignoring it in all six postwar handovers – 1955 (Winston Churchill to Anthony Eden), 1957 (Eden to Harold Macmillan), 1963 (Macmillan to Alec Douglas-Home), 1990 (Margaret Thatcher to John Major), 2016 (David Cameron to Theresa May) and 2019 (May to Boris Johnson).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bbce8400445a210390076a39b678e0d4fa2bb347\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbce8400445a210390076a39b678e0d4fa2bb347/1243_372_1404_1756/800.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Truss on a campaign visit to Belfast on 17 August 2022.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Truss on a campaign visit to Belfast on 17 August 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What we can’t ignore is that “cabinets” have effectively got bigger because of the fashion (presumably arising from a desire to minimise disappointment and also the number of colleagues outside the tent who might otherwise be tempted to piss in) to allow those not formally appointed to the cabinet to attend it nevertheless. But we can allow for that and we can also note that this de facto increase in those “in the room”, if not sitting around the table, could make unity (assuming that’s the path that’s chosen) easier to achieve: after all, it makes more slots available to any new leader anxious to soothe bruised egos and/or reward personal loyalty at the outset of their premiership.</p> <p>First things first, the trend is clear, but recent: whereas past Tory prime ministers who took over midstream tended to opt for continuity, their more contemporary counterparts have, for good or ill, opted for clear-outs. When Churchill was forced to make way for Eden in 1955, nearly 90% of his cabinet picks were kept on. Macmillan, in turn, retained three-quarters of Eden’s outgoing cabinet in 1957, while 80% of those serving in Macmillan’s last cabinet made it into Douglas-Home’s in 1963. True, after the brutal defenestration of Thatcher, in November 1990, her successor, Major, famously found room for Michael Heseltine, the man who did more than anyone else to bring her down. But – and this is all-too-easily forgotten – he also reappointed nearly 90% of those who’d served in her last cabinet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>John Major famously found room for Michael Heseltine, the man who did more than anyone else to bring Thatcher down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fast forward to 2016, when May took over from Cameron and a very different picture emerges: barely half of his picks kept their jobs when she put together her first cabinet. In 2019, when Johnson helped take out May in order to succeed her, fewer than a third of those in or attending her cabinet made the cut. In both cases, the number of new faces (some of whom were old faces who had previously been sacked or had resigned from cabinet) ran into double figures for the first time.</p> <p>That big shift says something profound about how politics and the Tory party have changed. As regards politics, it’s another reminder that prime ministers, inasmuch as they ever were, are no longer <em>primus inter pares</em> but have become more presidential figures – not merely captain of the team but also its manager and hence more willing and able to part with those whose faces and playing styles don’t fit, in exchange for those who seem happier to do their bidding.</p> <p>As regards the party itself, although it’s a simplification to suggest that the Conservatives had little or no ideology before Thatcher, it’s nevertheless the case that, ever since, and especially as Europe and culture wars have moved up in the mix, the party has become more of an arena, even a battleground, in that respect. Inevitably, and far more so than used to be the case, contested changes of leadership tend to revolve as much around principles (or what passes for principles) as around personality and practicalities. As a result, those who succeed to the premiership don’t merely want to stamp their authority on their party – they want to impose their worldview too.</p> <p>Whether the clear-out that is the correlate of that desire is more likely to bear fruit than opting for continuity is more of a moot point. Certainly, the “huge great stonking mandate” Johnson claimed to have won in 2019 suggests it might. Even if May’s catastrophic loss of her majority when she ill-advisedly went to the country in 2017 suggests otherwise, we shouldn’t ignore the fact that, while she sacrificed seats, her commitment to Brexit and ending austerity increased the party’s vote share substantially, especially in the Midlands and the north, helping to set up her successor’s big win two years later.</p> <p>But continuity can also work. Not for Douglas-Home admittedly: in 1964, a year after he took over, the Tories were out after 13 years in power. But others did better. In 1955, Eden increased the Tories’ overall majority from the mere 17 Churchill had managed four years earlier <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/anthony-eden\" title=\"\">to 60 seats</a>, and in 1959 Macmillan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_United_Kingdom_general_election\" title=\"\">increased it to 100</a>. Admittedly, the majority of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_Kingdom_general_election\" title=\"\">just 21</a> that Major won in 1992 paled in comparison with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_United_Kingdom_general_election\" title=\"\">102 Thatcher achieved</a> in 1987. But, compared with the drubbing that appeared to be on the cards when he’d taken over 18 months earlier, it represented something of a triumph – and one achieved with the economy struggling to emerge from recession and with a startlingly similar vote share (42%) to the one the Iron Lady had realised five years earlier.</p> <p>Nor does continuity of personnel necessarily preclude major changes of policy direction: Macmillan hastened the end of empire and began the UK’s move towards Europe – hardly minor adjustments. Meanwhile, clear-outs don’t always prefigure anything like a 180-degree turn: Johnson simply did Brexit harder than May and talked even more (even if he didn’t really do much more) than she had about investing in public services and in those parts of the country that had supposedly been ignored by previous governments.</p> <p>In any case, clear-outs can disguise continuities of a more worrying kind. Truss might appoint a new-look cabinet but, if they, like their predecessors, end up spending most of their time denying reality in order to save their boss’s skin, will anything have changed?</p> <p>• Tim Bale is professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/21/this-is-not-the-1970s-tory-pledges-to-cut-taxes-are-absurd","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"This is not the 1970s.

When Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, the top rate of income tax was 83%. In his first budget Sir Geoffrey Howe reduced it to 60%, and the basic rate from 33% to 30%. They decided it would look bad to lower the top rate alone, even though it was absurdly high. But to balance the books they were forced to raise VAT. They had committed themselves not to double VAT – in those days campaign commitments were serious – so they raised it from 8% to 15%.</p> <p>In his budget of 1988, my old friend Nigel Lawson brought the top rate down to 40% and the basic to 25%. These days the basic rate is 20% and the higher rate remains at Lawson’s level, except for the additional rate on incomes above £150,000, which is 45%. This history puts into context the absurdity of Truss’s and Sunak’s obsession with cutting present tax rates – she now, he later – when the nation’s infrastructure and public services have become an embarrassment. Current rates of taxation are miles, and years, away from the situation that faced the Thatcher government of 1979, and low by international standards.</p> <p>Oh and by the way: do these fanatics really want to emulate the Thatcher government’s “achievements” of presiding over a doubling of the inflation rate, to approaching 20%, between 1979 and 1980 – accompanied by the biggest recession since the second world war – and a level of unemployment that rose from under 1.5 million in 1979 (when Conservative posters proclaimed “Labour isn’t working”) to more than 3 million by 1986?

Moreover, they are not prepared to admit that the Brexit they promoted (in Sunak’s case) or accepted (in Truss’s case) is a disaster, severely damaging the investment they purport to champion, with ripple effects on output and, yes, taxable capacity.

The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-56526587\" title=\"\">rule of six</a> and support bubbles are but hazy memories, which makes it easy to forget that Covid continues to have a profound impact on some people’s lives.</p> <p>There are <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11040977/Care-home-Covid-rules-stopping-family-visits-campaigners-warn.html\" title=\"\">reports</a> of care homes still using the pandemic to restrict visiting, despite government guidance having changed months ago.

During 2020, adults with a learning disability aged 18-34 were <a href=\"https://www.mencap.org.uk/press-release/eight-10-deaths-people-learning-disability-are-covid-related-inequality-soars\" title=\"\">30 times</a> more likely to die after catching Covid than their peers.</p> <p>Nicky Clark, a campaigner for people with learning disabilities, told me what the pandemic has been like for her family. Emily, her daughter, is severely learning disabled and lives in a rented property with 24-hour support from three carers. She did not see her family for over a year. “It was absolute agony,” Nicky tells me. “Emily couldn’t understand why she couldn’t go swimming, to the cafe for lemonade, or to the seaside, or why everyone around her was wearing masks, or why she could only FaceTime us. She blamed herself – she thought she’d done something wrong.”</p> <p>This group feared the impact of Covid from the start: before the pandemic, the leading cause of death among people with learning disabilities was <a href=\"https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/documents/Health_inequalities_Respiratory_diseases.pdf\" title=\"\">respiratory disease</a>. Nicky campaigned for them to be given priority access to vaccines from the beginning. Yet even after the extra risks became clear, she was told by the government for weeks that they weren’t high enough. The guidance was not changed to include everyone on the learning disability register as clinically vulnerable until <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-56181154\" title=\"\">late February 2021</a>, after some had already been left <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56139393\" title=\"\">fighting for their lives</a> in hospital.</p> <p>Emily’s quality of life started to return following her jabs in February and May and her booster in November 2021. Nicky assumed that after further clinical reports on learning disabilities stressing the <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/assets/fans-dept/leder-main-report-hyperlinked.pdf\" title=\"\">importance of vaccination</a>, her daughter would be prioritised for a spring booster. She was wrong: almost 10 months after her last jab, she has still not had a second.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her life has become more restricted again and her hair has started to fall out again like it did in the first lockdown</p> <footer> <cite>Nicky Clark, mother</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Her life has become more restricted again and her hair has started to fall out again like it did in the first lockdown,” Nicky says. After weeks spent raising this, she has only just got confirmation from the government that adults with learning disabilities will be in the second priority group for the autumn booster rollout, but it could still be November before Emily is protected and can go out again.</p> <p>The cruelty is that all this was avoidable had Emily been given a spring booster. The government’s decision not to offer a booster to adults with learning disabilities takes no account of the trauma of avoidable hospital treatment for someone who may not, for example, understand why they need oxygen, or why their regular carers can’t come with them into hospital, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56139393\" title=\"\">described vividly</a> by radio DJ Jo Whiley about her sister, Frances, after she contracted Covid. In a world where infection rates are high and society-level precautions have been dropped, denying Emily a booster means she has needlessly forgone the things that give her life meaning.</p> <p>This is a microcosm of what those with learning disabilities and their relatives have to contend with. They have to fight the system to be treated with a shred of the dignity most of us would take for granted. Emily attended a residential school where, unbeknown to her parents, prone restraint was used on her; Nicky says that after she left Emily would put herself face down on the floor when she got distressed, until she eventually realised she would no longer be subjected to this.</p> <p>The government is committed to <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/1026/treatment-of-autistic-people-and-individuals-with-learning-disabilities/publications/\" title=\"\">reducing</a> the number of adults with learning disabilities and autism who live in residential facilities, but has missed already modest targets; Nicky says the only reason Emily lives independently today is because she and her husband persuaded the local authority to release a property earmarked for other purposes and put in place a care support package instead of the long-stay hospital that was proposed for her.</p> <p>Far too many young people are denied the chance to live lives infused with love and meaning, sectioned against their will for years in institutional settings that make their behaviours of distress far worse and more difficult to manage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Far too many young people are denied the chance to live lives infused with love and meaning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Journalists like <a href=\"https://www.ianbirrell.com/autistic-youngsters-are-wrongly-locked-in-mental-hospitals-say-health-chiefs/\" title=\"\">Ian Birrell</a> have uncovered horrific practices, such as the inappropriate use of drugs to control behaviour, young people living in isolation so extreme their meals are delivered to them through a hatch and families not being allowed to visit because it causes too much distress when they leave.</p> <p>Like the care home and children’s home sectors, some of these residential units are <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6661937/Five-new-secure-units-autistic-patients-set-open-UK-despite-pledge-close-them.html\" title=\"\">run for profit</a> by companies owned by private equity funds, which have spied an opportunity to make a healthy return out of a guaranteed government income stream through care for vulnerable people.</p> <p>It is not a question of money – a residential placement <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/6669/documents/71689/default/\" title=\"\">costs much more</a> than supporting an adult with learning disabilities to live in the community – but a lack of political will to change things. That lack of political will simply reflects the huge societal stigma that still exists around learning disability. For all the welcome focus on combating discrimination we have seen from the NHS, employers and educational institutions in recent years, the rights of adults with learning disabilities remain an unfashionable cause.</p> <p>In every aspect of their lives, the state and society treat them as second-class citizens, as problems to be managed and risks to be minimised, rather than as the individuals – with the same rights as all of us – that they are.</p> <p>• Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Asks David Williams","byline":"David Williams","body":"<p><strong>Taste the Difference Old Vine Garnacha, Calatayud, Spain 2019 (£10, <a href=\"https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/\">Sainsbury’s</a>) </strong>Winemakers love old vines for many reasons. They love them for the history and continuity they represent. They love them for the extra depth of flavour and natural balance their grapes seem to deliver (in wines such as Sainsbury’s vividly brambly northern Spanish red). They even love them for the way they look: the roughly wrinkled bark of their twisted trunks inspiring a certain anthropomorphic association with the wisdom of elders. Perhaps most importantly and urgently of all however – not least in this unceasingly baking northern hemisphere summer – winemakers love older vines for the way they cope with the increasingly demented weather patterns brought about by the climate crisis. This last idea was the subject of a fascinating article on wine lovers’ website <a href=\"https://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/old-vines-dig-deep-heatwave\" title=\"\">jancisrobinson.com</a> earlier this month, in which the wine writer Tamlyn Currin gathered a wealth of first-person testimony from winemakers all over the world who have discovered that their older vines (35 years and older) cope far better with extreme heat and drought (as well as frost, flooding and disease pressure) than younger plants.</p> <p><strong>Bellingham The Bernard Series Old Vine Chenin Blanc, Stellenbosch, South Africa 2020 (£11, <a href=\"https://www.tesco.com/\">Tesco</a>) </strong>Why do old vines seem so much more resilient? Currin’s piece posits a handful of hypotheses, starting with the deeper roots that old vines have when compared to their younger peers – the consequence of a life without irrigation in which the vines have been forced to burrow deep down to find their water supply from the moment they were planted. Other possibilities, which Currin concedes require greater study, take in genetics, the complex interactions with fungus in old vines’ root systems, their structure and the possibility that, in Currin’s words, “like trees, vines ‘learn’ with time and age, and can even ‘support’ each other”. Whatever the reason, there is a gathering consensus in the wine world that old vines will have an essential role to play in wine production as the climate crisis worsens – a notion that makes vines such as the 40-year-olds used to make Bellingham’s magnificently rich, complex, toasty, tropically fruited Cape Chenin seem all the more valuable.</p> <p><strong>Pedro Parra Imaginador, Itata, Chile 2019 (from £18.16, <a href=\"https://www.thefinewinecompany.co.uk/\">thefinewinecompany.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/\">whiskyexchange.com</a>; <a href=\"https://www.camvino.co.uk/\">camvino.co.uk</a>) </strong>The team at jancisrobinson.com has played a significant part in raising awareness of the value of old vines, and building a coalition to protect them, with their most significant contribution being their old vine register, a vast and growing database of 35+-year-old vineyards. Credit for the current conservationist mood must also go to the Old Vine Conference, an organisation that has brought together winemakers, winegrowers, merchants and journalists to discuss and share ideas about how best to protect these precious resources. There’s something hearteningly principled about the development: low-yielding old vines tend to be much less profitable than high-yielding young vines. But we shouldn’t underestimate the persuasive power of the sheer deliciousness of the best old-vine wines in rallying the hedonistic wine world to the cause. Chilean soil expert and wine producer Pedro Parra’s enchanting light red, with its flow of rosehip, blood orange, and smoky-meaty notes, for example, is a testament to the gathered strength of cinsault vines planted on the rocky granitic soils of Chile’s Itata Valley more than 50 years ago.</p> <p><em>Follow David Williams on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach?lang=en\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/21/plea-for-liz-truss-to-act-after-saudis-jail-uk-student-for-34-years-over-twitter-use","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Plea for Liz Truss to act after Saudis jail UK student for 34 years over Twitter use","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/plea-for-liz-truss-to-act-after-saudis-jail-uk-student-for-34-years-over-twitter-use","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/21/plea-for-liz-truss-to-act-after-saudis-jail-uk-student-for-34-years-over-twitter-use","fields":{"headline":"Plea for Liz Truss to act after Saudis jail UK student for 34 years over Twitter use","trailText":"Britain has a duty to speak out over mother who tweeted on women’s rights, foreign secretary told","byline":"Shanti Das","body":"<p>The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has been urged to intervene in the “outrageous” case of a Leeds University student jailed in Saudi Arabia for 34 years over her use of Twitter.</p> <p>Hilary Benn, Labour MP for Leeds Central, said the UK had a “duty” to press for the release of Salma al-Shehab, a Saudi national who had been living in Britain and was detained after returning to visit family last year.</p> <p>Shehab, who has two young children, was initially jailed for three years for “causing public unrest” and “destabilising civil and national security” after appearing to support activists and dissidents on Twitter.</p> <p>But an appeals court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/saudi-woman-given-34-year-prison-sentence-for-using-twitter\" title=\"\">last week handed down a new sentence</a> – 34 years in prison followed by a 34-year travel ban – after a public prosecutor asked the court to consider other alleged crimes. She has described suffering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/saudi-woman-sentenced-to-prison-for-twitter-use-faced-abuse-during-detention\" title=\"\">abuse and harassment behind bars</a>, telling a Saudi court she was subjected to interrogations after being given medications that exhausted her. Amnesty International has called for her “immediate and unconditional release”.</p> <p>In a letter to Truss, Benn says the UK must intervene, and calls on her to “make representations to the Saudi authorities” for Shehab “so that she can be freed to return to her family and to her studies”. He says the case is “completely at odds with Saudi Arabia’s claim to be improving human rights”, writing: “It seems that all she has done is use her Twitter account to support women’s rights and greater freedom, and to call for the release of imprisoned activists in Saudi Arabia.”</p> <p>Benn adds: “Saudi Arabia says, ‘we’re reforming the country.’ You can’t on the one hand say, ‘we are opening up and liberalising the country,’ and on the other hand send a woman to prison for expressing her opinions on Twitter.</p> <p>“I think we have a duty as citizens and countries to speak out wherever human rights are abused and denied in this way. The fact that she was a student in one of our universities adds to that obligation.” He calls the case “shocking and outrageous”.</p> <p>Leeds University said: “We are deeply concerned to learn of the recent development in Salma’s case and are seeking advice on whether there is anything we can do to support her. Our thoughts remain with Salma, her family, and her friends among our close-knit community of postgraduate researchers.” </p> <p>Shehab was in the final year of PhD studies in the School of Medicine, focusing on improving dental treatment for patients with disabilities.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia has sought to improve its global reputation in recent years through tourism campaigns and the hosting of major sporting events, including golfing championships and boxing matches.</p> <p>This weekend, it took centre stage when it hosted a heavyweight title fight between the British boxer Anthony Joshua and Ukrainian Oleksandr Usyk on Saturday night. The fighters are reported to have been paid four times more to fight at the Jeddah Superdrome than they would have received at Wembley. </p> <p>Critics say the events are part of efforts by Saudi Arabia to “launder its reputation” and distract from its poor record on human rights, a strategy termed “sportswashing”.</p> <p>In an interview on the <em>Today</em> programme on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday, boxing promoter Eddie Hearn, who represents Joshua, appeared to dismiss the criticism. He said there were “a lot of people that have opinions that don’t actually go and see things with their own eyes”, and that Jeddah today was “completely unrecognisable” to how it was three years ago. “People talk about sportwashing. If people want to use sport, want to use boxing to make changes, then I’m all for it,” he said.</p> <p>Bethany Al-Haidari, Saudi case manager at the Freedom Initiative, a US-based human rights group, said Shehab’s case was “shocking” but “one of hundreds”. “She’s just the one that the world happens to get the chance to see. But this is a larger problem,” she said.</p> <p>“There’s been a global campaign by the Saudi government to say things are changing and the country is reforming, but that’s just not true. In fact, it’s the opposite of what we’ve seen on the ground.”</p> <p>She said cases of abuses were not limited to Saudi nationals, adding that those travelling there for sporting and other events could be at risk. “Only last year, there was a case where a US citizen was pulled off a flight and detained. You never know what can happen, especially if you’ve ever talked about human rights or are from a minority. It’s not a predictable regime.”</p> <p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office did not respond to requests for comment.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/21/walters-london-so-many-reasons-to-go-back-restaurant-review","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Walter’s, London: ‘So many reasons to go back’ – restaurant review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/21/walters-london-so-many-reasons-to-go-back-restaurant-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/21/walters-london-so-many-reasons-to-go-back-restaurant-review","fields":{"headline":"Walter’s, London: ‘So many reasons to go back’ – restaurant review","trailText":"Nothing can beat a really good local restaurant, and this one in West Dulwich is a little beauty.

We’d already had the soundtracks of both <em>The Breakfast Club</em> and <em>Pretty in Pink</em>. Now it was time for a bit of melancholy post-punk with our dinner. That’s the key to a good neighbourhood restaurant. You’ve got to know the neighbourhood. The team behind <a href=\"https://waltersdulwich.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Walter’s</a>, recently opened amid the privet and spreading horse chestnut of London’s West Dulwich, clearly do.</p> <p>For here we all are, the comfortably paunchy middle-aged who were kids in the 80s and danced and snogged to these tunes, and who can still get a bit misty-eyed over a few bars of Don’t You (Forget About Me) by Simple Minds. Alongside these memories, played out at the dullest roar, we want a nice, creative bit of dinner without schlepping into town, and we are ready to pay properly for it if the cooking’s good and the portions don’t make you feel like a mug. At Walter’s the portions don’t make you feel like a mug. A restaurant like this will not survive on special occasions. It will only work if people keep coming back; if they store it away as a reliable promise, kept. Walter’s is that place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3d3b021ffa468ff1dc4e111d0e008da64b273d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3d3b021ffa468ff1dc4e111d0e008da64b273d7/0_212_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Crisp-skinned’: sea bass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Crisp-skinned’: sea bass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s also an intriguing case study in the post-pandemic hospitality business. Walter’s is named after Walter Hathaway, a milliner who was the first owner of this address. It belongs to Rob Hampton and Matt Lovell, the restaurateurs behind the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/oct/21/ofm-awards-2019-best-restaurant-the-oystermen-london\" title=\"\">Oystermen</a> in Covent Garden. As the latter’s name suggests, it’s a straight-up seafood restaurant, serving uncomplicated platefuls of the good stuff from British waters; a central London bistro with relatively restrained pricing. It’s been a solid success and the reasonable assumption is that they would find a site for a follow-up, somewhere else firmly in Zone 1.</p> <p>Instead, here they are in the especially leafy suburbs with a totally different bistro proposition. As the pandemic lay waste to the restaurant sector, sage types suggested that all the hot action would shift from the city centres to the neighbourhoods that ring them; places exactly like this. There are still a lot of businesses taking advantage of some beneficial post-Covid leases, but if it also means the likes of Hampton and Lovell try their hands here instead, on the site of what was a Café Rouge I never visited, then I’m all for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"764c048cd1353f858da319c17e10911dbaa65d05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/764c048cd1353f858da319c17e10911dbaa65d05/0_256_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Not a panzanella but pleasing all the same’: tomatoes and nectarines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Not a panzanella but pleasing all the same’: tomatoes and nectarines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because tonight, after recent reviews in Edinburgh and Swansea, Taunton and Dublin, I have simply followed the No 3 bus route 10 minutes from my south London home, to this clean-lined, half wood-panelled space, cleverly divided by rattan screens. I have a very well made, very cold margarita to drink, and a plate of fried friggitelli peppers to pick at, alongside some expertly engineered truffled arancini, while I make my choices.</p> <p>There’s nothing especially startling about the offer here. It’s food to oil conversation rather than become the focus of it; the sort of thing anybody who has eaten in a few restaurants over the past decade will recognise. There are four of us tonight and only five starters so we order them all. Yes please, we’ll have the duck liver parfait for the table, because the table is hungry, thank you very much. It’s glossy and rich and extremely well made, as you would expect of a kitchen led by Mateusz Gosek who has had time in significant kitchens on his CV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd497d1600ec133b21e44b302c6ccab705a2568b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd497d1600ec133b21e44b302c6ccab705a2568b/0_196_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Shimmering’: bream ceviche.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Shimmering’: bream ceviche.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are mussels in a brisk chilli broth, and hunks of braised cuttlefish in a mess of tomatoes, chorizo and chickpeas. There’s a shimmering ceviche of gilt-head bream, and a salad of tomatoes and nectarines with croutons, which is billed as a panzanella but isn’t really. It is pleasing all the same. It’s a table of “How’s yours?” and “Very nice, would you like to try some?” and “Yes please.” There’s attention to detail: the tiny balls of cucumber with the ceviche; the way the nectarines are fanned; the skinning and then pickling of the cherry tomatoes with the parfait.</p> <p>Main courses justify their £20-plus price tags by both execution and volume. Perhaps they’re doing themselves out of dessert orders by piling just so much glossy, velvet-red peperonata beneath that slab of crisp-skinned sea bass. And, my, that’s a fair old heap of braised lentils beneath the sizeable roasted guinea fowl. They haven’t skimped on the crushed new potatoes with the lamb rump either. Tonight, there’s a special of poussin, thickly coated in a hefty sate sauce with a proper hobnailed chilli kick, then grilled; a smart move, given how little flavour poussin brings to the party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7185c96db996871655ae221d17108e1ea32b2d91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7185c96db996871655ae221d17108e1ea32b2d91/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘A solid wedge’: Basque cheesecake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A solid wedge’: Basque cheesecake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If there’s a criticism, it’s that non-meat dishes are clearly not front and centre of anybody’s thoughts. If the main course offering pulls on the old Italian vegetarian fallbacks – a risotto say, or a pasta or, as here, a plate of gnocchi – you just know nobody is really with the project. It doesn’t matter how good those gnocchi are. They could do, they should do, better. Very much on the plus side, there’s a broad wine list that, on its first page, features two wines of the week discounted by roughly 25%. This may be because they really like the wine, or they simply bought too much and it’s not moving. But I’m a sucker for this stuff either way. A brisk bright fiano from Villa Raiano is reduced from £38 to £28; an earthy La Bioca nebbiolo is reduced from £47 to £35.25.</p> <p>It’s the sort of thing that will bring us back, as will the charming service. At one point our waiter overhears us discussing a much-loved but long-gone local café in Herne Hill. “Oh my,” he says. “My first job in restaurants was there. I was the kitchen porter.” It’s a small thing, but it’s also the very definition of neighbourhood. Desserts are designed for those who have made it through the mains. A lemon posset has failed to set, but I discover a taste for drinking citrussy custard. There’s a more successfully solid wedge of Basque cheesecake and a few of their ice-creams: a dollop of Eton mess, with cubes of meringue and a properly sprightly scoop of cherry. I note on the way out that they do brunch at weekends. Oh, and there’s a happy hour. You can also just come for a drink. There’s lots of reasons to go back. Given how dangerously close to my home it is, the odds of that happening are high.</p> <h2><strong>News bites</strong></h2> <p>Kevin Dalgleish, responsible for a series of food festivals in Scotland over the years attracting an impressive roster of fellow chefs, has opened a new restaurant in Aberdeen.

Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, the two candidates to be Britain’s next prime minister, are competing over who can offer the most appealing package of tax cuts and deregulation to the Conservative membership who will choose a leader on behalf of the country. Meanwhile, inflation has risen to double figures, energy bills are soaring, raw sewage is washing up on beaches, and hospitals are being instructed to prepare public health campaigns to encourage people to <a href=\"https://www.mylondon.news/news/health/cost-living-nhs-begs-patients-24808179\" title=\"\">minimise A&amp;E use over winter</a>.</p> <p>Both candidates have to some degree made tax cuts central to their pitch to run the country. Sunak has pledged to cut taxes by about <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62122166\" title=\"\">£23bn a year </a>over the next decade. Truss, who looks likely to win the contest, has gone much further, pledging tax cuts she claims will cost £38bn annually, but which economists believe could actually cost more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/08/liz-truss-plans-could-cost-50bn-a-year-and-will-fail-to-help-poorest-cope\" title=\"\">£50bn a year</a>. She claims this will promote growth, but these kinds of tax cuts will do nothing to address the real reasons for Britain’s dire productivity growth – a lack of investment in infrastructure, skills and other forms of capital – while significantly reducing the resources available for public services at a time when inflation is eroding the real value of budgets in hospitals, schools and care homes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some schools are reportedly looking at reducing the time children spend in school in order to save money</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most of the conversation about the cost of living crisis has, understandably, been framed through the lens of household budgets. But it will have just as damaging an impact on Britain’s public services. The NHS has been left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/observer-view-existential-nhs-crisis\" title=\"\">scarred</a> by a decade of underfunding, by staffing shortages and by the pandemic.

Headteachers are having to fund much-needed wage rises and meet increased energy costs from existing budgets. Some schools are reportedly looking at reducing the time <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11110335/Schools-consider-THREE-DAY-week-pay-teacher-salary-rises-crippling-energy-costs.html\" title=\"\">children spend in school</a> in order to save money, an unacceptable state of affairs in terms of the impact on children’s education after months of home learning during the pandemic and the cost of additional childcare for working parents.</p> <p>Rising wage and energy bills are already having a huge impact in childcare and adult social care too. As we report today, the energy bills of some care homes have more than quintupled this year and the Early Years Alliance <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62496728\" title=\"\">warned</a> last week that some nurseries are at risk of closure because of staff and heating costs. Across both sectors, the government does not provide sufficient funding for publicly funded places; charitable and private providers have sought to close the gap by cross-subsidising them from private fees, but this will put huge pressure on parents and relatives who are already struggling to afford fees.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Older people and adults with disabilities may be left unable to source the care they need if providers go out of business </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adult social care, in particular, is facing staff shortages as a result of Brexit. There is a risk that growing numbers of older people and adults with disabilities are left unable to source the care they need because care providers go out of business and that parents will not be able to find the childcare places that enable them to go to work. Children’s centres, libraries, museums and playgrounds, already severely affected by a decade of public spending cuts as a result of the financial crisis, will be further squeezed.</p> <p>As inflation continues to rise, and the economy is predicted to shrink next year, this is the time for the state to lean in, not out. The country needs public investment funded by borrowing to protect households from eye-watering increases in energy and food prices and to shield the parts of the state people will need to rely on more than ever from the corrosive impact of inflation. It is nothing short of madness to pledge a huge programme of tax cuts in this economic climate. It will lead to rising inequality, untold hardship and a significant and further scaling back in the quality of Britain’s education and health services.</p> <p>Truss is being thoroughly dishonest when she holds up tax cuts as the solution to the country’s economic woes, claiming they will boost growth while failing to come clean about the consequences. But is it any wonder? Both Sunak and Truss are products of a Conservative party that saw no problem in pursuing a costly and painful Brexit while simply pretending away the consequences for the economy and for Northern Ireland. Integrity has become devalued.

Be less hard on yourself and learn to make ‘I statements’","byline":"Philippa Perry","body":"<p><em><strong>The question </strong>I can’t seem to stop gossiping and complaining about the people around me. This primarily happens at work and I am not the only person who does it; it is a toxic environment where bitching is the norm, so it is hard to resist. Every day I give myself a little talk about how I am not going to say a bad word about someone and every day I get sucked into gossip or end up saying something mean. It is the trait I deplore the most in myself and I am starting to believe that deep down I am </em><em>a horrible person who doesn’t deserve any friends. I used to pride myself on my ability to be honest, opinionated and outspoken, but the balance has tipped into bitterness, whining and impulsive gossiping. The worst part is, when I bitch about someone, I </em><em>deep down </em><em>don’t feel negatively about them and am baffled as to why I say such horrible things.</em></p> <p><em>I have worked hard on myself in the last few years (becoming sober, going to therapy) and I am ashamed that I have not evolved into a better person. I don’t want to be small-minded by getting a thrill out of bringing others down. I really respect and admire people who are more positive, open minded and can control their thoughts and emotions around others – how do I become that person and say goodbye once and for all to this poisonous part of myself?</em></p> <p><em><strong>Philippa’s answer </strong></em>You’ve recognised and articulated your problem; you are well on the way to changing tack. I’d like you to look up Portia Nelson’s famous poem: <em><a href=\"https://beradiantsquared.com/an-autobiography-in-five-chapters/\" title=\"\">An Autobiography in Five Chapters</a></em>. It’s about walking down a road and falling down a hole. She falls in, it’s not her fault. Then she sees the hole, she knows she’s going to fall in, it’s still not her fault, after which she sees the hole, she falls in, it is her fault. She sees the hole, she walks around it. Then she walks down another street entirely. Her metaphor means that you need to cut yourself some slack when you are learning a new habit, it takes time to change behaviour.</p> <p>It is difficult to stop gossiping, especially if you feel insecure in your work environment. It is an expedient way to bond with someone when you have a third party that you both agree is in some way bad. As the socialite and wit Alice Roosevelt Longworth once said: “If you’ve got nothing nice to say… come and sit by me.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Instead of ‘he is irritating’ switch to ‘I feel irritated’, thus taking responsibility for your reaction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gossip can work as a glue, it flows between people who feel mutually friendly and it’s a sign that you trust them. There are downsides. If you hear negative gossip about someone, it can change the way you think about them, which can be unfair and harsh. Neither is it great when it seems it’s become your turn to be the subject of the gossip. But gossip can relieve feelings of tension or animosity you may have towards people as it can release pressure you may have felt but, of course, if you find a tactful way of more direct communication that may be better for everyone.</p> <p>In any group, there are stages of how the group develops. In 1965, psychologist Bill Tuckman observed these were: forming, storming, norming, then performing. It sounds like at work you are at the “norming” stage, and the norm is backstabbing and gossip! And as a group you have all got stuck there.</p> <p>I wonder if you can begin to change the culture of your workplace? The storm this can cause may not be terrible. This will help: Get into the habit of “I statements”. So instead of “he is irritating” switch to noticing “I feel irritated”, thus taking responsibility for your reactions and realising that just because someone irritates you it doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with them. This habit will help you take responsibility for your response rather than blaming the other. You can also wonder what it is about them that might be reminding you about a trait you have that you wish you didn’t. You can experiment with more direct communication. To do this, again stick to “I statements”. So rather than, say, “You are always late” try, “I get anxious unless you do this by then.” The general rule being, say how something makes you feel, and then say what behaviour you would like instead. It might not be as fun as moaning to your best office friend, but it could be more useful.</p> <p>You are very hard on yourself for gossiping. You are doing to yourself what you do to others. If you were more understanding with yourself, that is likely to contribute to you showing similar generosity towards your colleagues. You can already articulate your problem and you are at the stage of catching yourself after you’ve done it, so you are on the right track. Next stage is instead of beating yourself up about it, congratulate yourself – “Ah ha! That’s what I don’t want to do any more!” Defer judging altogether and be curious about people, and yourself, instead. Don’t judge, it’s not necessary to damn anyone nor praise them, you can just be interested in them.</p> <p>Notice your progress, notice the temptations and high-five yourself when you don’t act on them.</p> <p>And, if we are ever at the same party, come and sit next to me. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/from-the-observer-magazine-archive-interviews-with-surgeons-1988","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"‘It’s just glorified plumbing’: incisive interviews with Britain’s surgeons, 1988","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/from-the-observer-magazine-archive-interviews-with-surgeons-1988","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/21/from-the-observer-magazine-archive-interviews-with-surgeons-1988","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s just glorified plumbing’: incisive interviews with Britain’s surgeons, 1988","trailText":"Revealing, sometimes alarming insights from the people holding the knife.

Pope John Paul II, the archbishop of Canterbury, John le Carré, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Shirley Williams and many others thought the Mumbai-born author had brought the threat of an early demise on himself. He had decided to offend one of the great monotheistic religions and could expect those deeply offended by his book to take his life in the name of God.</p> <p>Commenting on the fatwa in his book <em>God is Not Great</em> some years later, Christopher Hitchens wrote: “One might have thought that such arrogant state-sponsored homicide, directed at a lonely and peaceful individual who pursued a life devoted to language, would have called forth a general condemnation.

It’s China’s disproportional and irrational reactions to such a visit that should be highlighted and strongly condemned.</p> <p>Over recent years, China has threatened Taiwan militarily, incrementally heightening its threat. Pelosi’s visit is opportunistically used by China as a pretext to further escalate its threat to Taiwan in an attempt to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. As some analysts have pointed out, even if Pelosi had not visited Taiwan, China would probably have seized another opportunity to achieve this aim.</p> <p>China’s recent military drills are highly dangerous, provocative and threatening to regional peace and stability, while disrupting international trade and transport. Taiwan strongly condemns China’s irresponsible actions and calls on the international community to unify and support democratic Taiwan to push back China’s military threat and its ambitious expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region.</p> <p>Criticising democratically elected leaders and prohibiting them from visiting democratic Taiwan because of China’s opposition will only embolden China and encourage more bullying.

Formal assessment was prioritised over creativity, and subjects that developed skills such as flexibility, autonomy and teamwork were systematically starved of funding, so the A-level menu in most state schools has become a shrunken shadow of what it was pre-Gove. We are now seeing the consequences of this playing out in higher education, as university after university drops or downgrades courses such as English Literature which don’t have an immediate monetary value.</p> <p>As Boakye points out: “Ultimately, the real prize [of education] is insight and empathy.” Unfortunately, these qualities are notable by their absence in Gove’s career, which, in terms he would recognise, I would characterise as “inadequate”.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Austin McHale</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\">Isleworth, London<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"></p> <h2>Oxford, ancient and modern</h2> <p>Peter Young writes that Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao will be the first minority woman to have her name on an Oxford college (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/why-surprise-when-wealthy-capitalist-makes-large-donation-to-oxford-college\" title=\"\">Letters</a>).

The 10th round was one of the best rounds I’ve seen to turn a fight – not back around, because it was very close at that point – But what Usyk did in the 10th, the 11th and the 12th was incredible. And that was the difference tonight because AJ didn’t start fighting fast enough, but he fought a much better fight [than last September]. He hurt Usyk badly the ninth. And I felt like going to come on strong but Usyk came out like a train. And as I said, that 10th round was the moment he decided to regain the fight. It was an incredible performance. He’s just too good. You know, he is too good and there’s no shame in it.”</p> <p>He continues: “You saw the reaction for AJ and that was from a human. He wanted to win so badly with so much pressure on his shoulders. And I think he just exploded because he lost and he was devastated and he’s given everything to try and win this fight. He couldn’t win the fight. He’s a competitor. He is a winner, but this man’s too good. That 10th round, the 11th round, the 12th round was just why this guy’s pound-for-pound number one.”</p> <p>Hearn is then asked whether he believes Usyk could beat Tyson Fury. </p> <p>“They’re both tremendous fighters,” Hearn says. “I’m not sure anyone can beat Oleksandr Usyk. You know, Tyson Fury is a clever man. He had the chance to fight him. He chose not to. Will he come out of retirement? Good luck to both of them. But you know, this man is an incredible fighter. AJ gave you everything. He had a great training camp. He was desperate, desperate to win this fight tonight, as you saw, but he wasn’t good enough on the night and that’s sport. That’s high-level boxing. He lost 115-113. He lost a split decision to the pound-for-pound number one. There’s no disgrace in that. But he’s not pound-for-pound number one. He’s got to go away if he wants to, come back, rebuild, get the frustration out. ‘Cause you saw part of it there. And be happy.

But then almost out of nowhere the Briton lands a big left hook followed immediately by a right hand. Usyk’s motor is simply too good. He won’t stop throwing and is trading shots with Joshua in a round that he probably doesn’t need to have. What valor, from both men! Usyk lands a crushing left hook, followed by a three-punch combination. And there’s the final bell. This one was closer than the first instalment and Joshua showed far better, but we should be looking at an uncontroversial points decision for Oleksandr Usyk.</p> <p><strong>Guardian’s unofficial score: Usyk 10-9 Joshua (Usyk 116-112 Joshua)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-630167958f08f8ea5d3a1431\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T23:00:41.344Z\">12.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 11</strong></p> <p>Joshua has shown in the last few minutes that he’s dangerous at all times, but he’s looking fatigued as Usyk has found a second wind and looks to pour on the punishment. The Ukrainian was far more active in the 10th and he’s busier here in the 11th as well. Joshua smartly keeping targeting Usyk’s body, but the champion is throwing and landing more.

And now Joshua looks like he’s in trouble. Usyk is opening up to the body. Joshua rocks Usyk with a right hand and the champion is hurt again, but Usyk fires back with shots to the head and body. Usyk is doing serious damage here, throwing and landing in flurries of punches. Joshua has backed up to the ropes on his own and it looks like he’s tired. There’s the bell and Usyk’s 10th was just as dominant as Joshua’s ninth.

The head movement in particular has slowed down, giving Joshua a more stationary target. Joshua is upping the tempo and the pressure. Joshua is moving forward and letting his hands go with Usyk in retreat! Usyk looks like he’s in trouble. Joshua is landing big shots but not punching himself out, picking his shots with intelligence. Joshua has Usyk reeling toward the ropes but he’s able to make it to the bell. The most dominant round for either man tonight and surely Joshua’s best in either fight.</p> <p><strong>Guardian’s unofficial score: Usyk 9-10 Joshua (Usyk 86-85 Joshua)</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T22:53:37.938Z\">at 11.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-630164c88f081780606cc318\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T22:48:45.132Z\">11.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 8</strong></p> <p>Usyk slips at least a half-dozen punches as Joshua moves inside, but Joshua is able to land a couple more shots to the body. Joshua throws a mean right hook but Usyk gets away in the nick of time. Joshua lands a punishing three-punch combination to the body, his best sequence of the night, and Usyk briefly winces in pain while rushing in to clinch. That’s the route for AJ and he needs to keep it up. A great round for the ex-champion. Usyk finishes the frame strong but it wasn’t quite enough. </p> <p><strong>Guardian’s unofficial score: Usyk 9-10 Joshua (Usyk 77-75 Joshua)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-630163a98f081780606cc312\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T22:44:23.862Z\">11.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 7</strong></p> <p>Compubox informs us that Joshua has landed 16 body shots through at the halfway point after only landing 15 in the entire first fight, but it seems like too many of the bad habits from 11 months ago are beginning to surface. Usyk cracks Joshua with a sneaky inside left hand after slipping inside the job. Wow. Usyk is setting the pace and Joshua badly needs to shake things up before this one gets out of hand. </p> <p><strong>Guardian’s unofficial score: Usyk 10-9 Joshua (Usyk 68-65 Joshua)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-630162c28f0828049565d4f1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T22:40:16.984Z\">11.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 6</strong></p> <p>Joshua is having his best success when he targets Usyk’s midsection. More good body work by Joshua moves the Ukrainian back toward the ropes. But Usyk is slipping a lot of the upstairs shots and countering with aplomb. Usyk just doing a little bit more right now: busier, more accurate and fleeter of foot. Some close rounds but I have it four rounds to two to Usyk at the midpoint.</p> <p><strong>Guardian’s unofficial score: Usyk 10-9 Joshua (Usyk 58-56 Joshua)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-630161e68f0828049565d4ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T22:36:44.170Z\">11.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 5</strong></p> <p>A very good fight so far between two top operators. But Usyk is looking more and more comfortable, setting the pace with left hands down the middle and using his foot speed to pirouette out of harm’s way. Joshua catches Usyk with a big shot right below the beltline and gets a warning from the referee. Usyk cracks Joshua with a big counter left. Joshua starting to look like he’s trying to box the clever southpaw, which is a bad move. </p> <p><strong>Guardian’s unofficial score: Usyk 10-9 Joshua (Usyk 48-47 Joshua)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-630160e38f081780606cc309\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T22:32:34.713Z\">11.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 4</strong></p> <p>Usyk is looking more comfortable in there, even as Joshua continues to move forward and close distance. Usyk lands a big right hand about a minute to the round but Joshua takes it well. Joshua is really focusing on the body and scoring well there. Usyk is still punching in high volume but Joshua is answering every combination that he throws, which is something he didn’t do in their first meeting. Usyk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CompuBox/status/1561118567004872707\">threw and landed more shots</a> in that round than any of the first three according to Compubox’s punch statistics.</p> <p><strong>Guardian’s unofficial score: Usyk 10-9 Joshua (Usyk 38-38 Joshua)</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T22:33:26.923Z\">at 11.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-63015fca8f081780606cc303\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T22:27:28.833Z\">11.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 3</strong></p> <p>Joshua lands a big right hand. He looks much better tonight so far than in the first fight and it’s not been very complicated: a precise jab and well-placed straight right hands have made things a lot more complicated for Usyk. Usyk is throwing punches in bunches but not landing many, owing to Joshua controlling the distance well and better-than-usual head movement. Usyk lands a snappy left hand through Joshua’s guard in the final seconds but it’s not enough to undo all the Briton’s good work. </p> <p><strong>Guardian’s unofficial score: Usyk 9-10 Joshua (Usyk 28-29 Joshua)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-63015ec88f08f8ea5d3a1404\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T22:23:22.903Z\">11.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 2</strong></p> <p>It appears Angel Fernandez is the chief second and the man in the ring for Joshua and not Robert Garcia as announced by Michael Buffer during the pre-fight introductions. Joshua is throwing more shots to the body and landing a few in the opening minute of the second. Joshua looks poised and patient as he looks to close the distance. Usyk working very hard to circle and move out of danger and also create openings. Joshua lands a sharp uppercut to the body. Another good right hand by Joshua. A great round for the former champion. </p> <p><strong>Guardian’s unofficial score: Usyk 9-10 Joshua (Usyk 19-19 Joshua)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-63015db28f08f8ea5d3a13fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T22:19:03.417Z\">11.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 1</strong></p> <p>And we’re off. Joshua in all black trunks, Usyk wearing white with blue and yellow trim. Both men are circling one another in the center of the ring, the preferable area for the Ukrainian. A couple of Usyk jabs have gotten through. Joshua lands a right to the body but Usyk snaps Joshua’s head back with a hard left jab. Not a ton of action in a feeling-out first round but Usyk has done enough to take it.</p> <p><strong>Guardian’s unofficial score: Usyk 10-9 Joshua (Usyk 10-9 Joshua)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div

over Zhilei Zhang by scores of 114-113 and 115-112 (twice) in the last undercard bout.</strong> That means the final countdown for the main event is on. Joshua and Usyk are expected to make their ringwalks in the next 15 minutes or so.</p> <p>That’s just enough time to read up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/20/how-robert-garcia-can-help-anthony-joshua-against-oleksandr-usyk-boxing\">the major shake-up in Joshua’s corner</a> ahead of tonight’s career-defining fight. </p> <p>A refresher: Joshua’s one-sided defeat to Usyk last September at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was, above all, a tactical catastrophe. Rather than press his natural advantages in height, reach and power, the Briton curiously attempted to outbox the superior boxer in front of him. As the rounds progressed and Usyk mounted a commanding lead on the scorecards, Joshua was done no favours by a corner unable to implement anything even resembling an adjustment to alter the one-way traffic.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From the moment Joshua exercised his immediate rematch clause in the aftermath, it was clear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/29/anthony-joshua-let-down-by-his-corner-in-oleksandr-usyk-defeat\">a sweeping change was necessary</a>. That meant ending his decade-long partnership with Robert McCracken, the only trainer he’d ever known as a professional, who also guided Joshua to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/anthony-joshua-wins-gold-boxing\">a star-making Olympic gold medal</a> as the head coach of Team GB’s boxing team at the 2012 London Games.</p> <p>Joshua toured the United States at the end of last year in search of a replacement with Virgil Hunter, Eddy Reynoso and Ronnie Shields emerging as leading candidates. But he ultimately opted for Garcia, whose sterling reputation has only grown in the decade since he gained mainstream recognition upon being voted trainer of the year by America’s boxing writers in 2012.</p> <p>“He’s a teacher, he’s not a coach,” says Abner Mares, the three-division champion who teamed with Garcia after a series of confidence-shaking defeats to regain the featherweight title in 2016. “A coach can put on mitts, just sit and look pretty and tell you what you do, but this guy teaches you. He guides you. If a fighter walks into his gym, he doesn’t try to change how you stand or what you bring. He works with what you have, and that’s what separates Robert from other coaches.”</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7723f04e4bc5836229eb29b26f7cbdfa10661511\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7723f04e4bc5836229eb29b26f7cbdfa10661511/0_0_3500_2265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Filip Hrgovic v Zhilei Zhang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filip Hrgovic, left, outpointed Zhilei Zhang by scores of 114-113 and 115-112 (twice) in their IBF heavyweight title eliminator on Sunday morning in Jeddah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-630150818f08f8ea5d3a13d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T21:28:48.531Z\">10.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And now for the $80m elephant in the room.</strong> That’s the record site fee which Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has reportedly paid for the right to stage tonight’s rematch with Usyk and Joshua due to clear around $35m apiece. Nice work if you can get it. </p> <p>But the event has also drawn fierce backlash from critics who accuse the Saudi government of using sports to launder the kingdom’s dismal human rights record, alleged ties to the September 11 attacks, severe repression of women’s and LGBTQ+ rights and the 2018 murder of the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p> <p>Those uncomfortable underpinnings were thrust to the fore again on Friday when our Sean Ingle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/anthony-joshua-urged-speak-out-human-rights-abuses-saudi-arabia-oleksandr-usyk\">reported</a> that Joshua was urged to speak out by a pro-democracy activist whose brother was among 81 people executed by the state in March.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Guardian can reveal that Joshua was recently sent a letter by Yasser al-Khayat, whose brother Mustafa was killed in the largest mass execution in Saudi Arabia’s history, asking him to follow the lead of Muhammad Ali and Lewis Hamilton by standing up for freedom and human rights in the buildup to his world title fight which takes place in Jeddah on Saturday.</p> <p>“My brother was executed by the Saudi Arabian authorities for daring to ask for basic human rights that you enjoy in the UK,” the letter tells Joshua. “He was one of the 81 men killed in the largest mass execution in the country’s history. Over half of them, including Mustafa, were executed for taking part in pro-democracy protests.</p> <p>“Saudi Arabia executed him in secret and we weren’t given any notice.

The arena has been less than half full most of the night, although I’m guessing it will be full by time Joshua and Usyk do battle, which is approximately 1am local time. It’s also very hot and humid here still, although the air conditioning turned up so much in the media centre that I’m having to wear a jumper. Also, the food is sensational.

Joshua has disputed the notion, but there’s no question those rumbling calls for retirement will only mount with a second straight setback.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Joshua firmly believes he can avoid a third defeat in his 27 fights, the other being his shock stoppage at the hands of Andy Ruiz Jr in June 2019, and instead is setting his sights on becoming a three-time heavyweight world champion, having previously reclaimed his titles with victory in his rematch with Ruiz Jr in Riyadh six months after their initial contest. In his return to Saudi Arabia, the 32-year-old also addressed the idea that a second defeat to Usyk would be a fatal blow to his future prospects, insisting that is unfair in as much as it his call.</p> <p>“It’s up to me at the end of the day, it’s not up to anyone else what I do with my career,” said Joshua. “I don’t have to do this. Why do I do it? It’s because it’s all I know.</p> <p>“This is also my 12th consecutive world title fight. I’ve been in world title fights back to back 12 times. It happens – if you’re fighting people at world level, you’re meeting people of world-level quality. I’m not fighting people who are below par.”</p> <p>This is a sentiment shared by Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, who has labelled Usyk, who fights here having served in the Ukrainian army as part of the country’s defence against Russia’s invasion, a “genius” and insisted that should be taken into consideration if he is again victorious at the weekend.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tonight’s undercard has been whizzing along with a number of brief encounters forcing a couple of swing bouts into the queue. But we’re still on schedule for the main event between Usyk and Joshua to get under way at about 12.54am local time (ie 10.54pm in London, 5:54pm in New York and 7.54am in Melbourne).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c9e75ad0207780b61a5dbd2c1cc046173643154\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c9e75ad0207780b61a5dbd2c1cc046173643154/0_0_3500_2405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Callum Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Callum Smith, right, ensured himself a WBC light heavyweight title shot with a one-punch knockout of Mathieu Bauderlique on the Usyk-Joshua II undercard on Saturday night in Jeddah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T20:33:04.464Z\">at 9.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-630123708f08f8ea5d3a133d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T20:00:50.945Z\">9.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bryan will be here shortly.</strong> In the meantime here’s our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/anthony-joshua-oleksandr-usyk-boxing-rematch-saudi-arabia\">Sachin Nakrani’s big fight preview</a> from the ground in Jeddah.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/anthony-joshua-oleksandr-usyk-boxing-rematch-saudi-arabia\">Anthony Joshua desperate to avoid line in the sand with Usyk rematch | Sachin Nakrani</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/21/oleksandr-usyk-beats-anthony-joshua-by-split-decision-to-retain-world-titles","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T23:34:49Z","webTitle":"Oleksandr Usyk beats Anthony Joshua by split decision to retain world titles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/21/oleksandr-usyk-beats-anthony-joshua-by-split-decision-to-retain-world-titles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/21/oleksandr-usyk-beats-anthony-joshua-by-split-decision-to-retain-world-titles","fields":{"headline":"Oleksandr Usyk beats Anthony Joshua by split decision to retain world titles","trailText":"The Ukrainian retained his world heavyweight titles with an impressive display before his beaten opponent delivered a four-minute monologue","byline":"Sachin Nakrani at Abdullah Sports City Arena","body":"<p>For Anthony Joshua it was ultimately all too much. Having been defeated by the outstanding Oleksandr Usyk for a second time and consequently failing in his bid to regain his status as a heavyweight champion, he threw two of the victors’ three belts out of the ring before storming out of it himself on what was a hot night in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia’s city by the Red Sea, in more ways than one.</p> \n<p>Joshua soon returned but, quite clearly, the 32-year-old’s emotions were still getting the better of him. Having appeared to exchange angry words with Usyk he then took to the microphone and, in front of a crowd of about 10,000 gathered at this venue, delivered a curious monologue.</p> \n<p>“If you knew my story you would understand the passion,” he declared. “I ain’t no amateur boxer from five years old that was an elite prospect from youth.

And there was more to come their way. “I’m not a 12-round fighter, look at me, I’m a new breed of heavyweights,” Joshua continued. “Mike Tyson, Sonny Liston, Jack Dempsey, ‘you don’t throw combinations like Rocky Marciano’, I’m 18 stone, I’m heavy, it’s hard work.”</p> \n<p>Joshua’s speech came with a few swear words but also congratulations for the man who had just defeated him. “This guy here is a phenomenal talent,” he said having wrapped his arm around Usyk. “We’re going to cheer for him three times.” And the crowd did, still, however, quite clearly confused by what was happening.</p> \n<p>And perhaps Joshua didn’t know what he was doing, or saying, either. It certainly felt like heat-of-the-moment stuff, provoked by a very real sense of hurt and disappointment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkySportsBoxing/status/1561142348532404225\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"𝐔𝐍𝐃𝐄𝐑𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐏𝐀𝐒𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍!\" 💯<br><br>Anthony Joshua takes the microphone to vent his frustrations before congratulating Oleksandr Usyk 🎤<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UsykJoshua2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UsykJoshua2</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/KPlmjRDm4k\">pic.twitter.com/KPlmjRDm4k</a></p>— Sky Sports Boxing (@SkySportsBoxing) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkySportsBoxing/status/1561142348532404225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 21, 2022</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>This was meant to be Joshua’s night of redemption, when he regained the WBA, WBO and IBF titles Usyk had taken from him when the pair met in Tottenham 11 months ago. The Ukrainian had been supreme that night but, equally, Joshua had let himself down having made the curious decision to abandon his instincts and instead try to out-box his opponent. It was never going to work and he paid the price.</p> \n<p>This time around there was to be no repeat mistake. Armed with a new coach in the highly regarded Mexican-American Robert Garcia, Joshua vowed to be more aggressive and he lived up to his word, charging forward in the first round, securing the centre of the ring in the second and consistently stinging his opponent with thudding shots, no more so than in the ninth round when the challenger had the champion scrambling around the ring having unleashed hell.</p> \n<p>But it was at that very moment Usyk showed his class, smashing Joshua back in the 10th with a big left hook and continuing to unload from there. He also dominated the final two rounds and, having largely impressed throughout the contest, it came as no shock when he was declared the winner, the only surprise being that it was via a split decision, with two of the judges delivering scores of 115-113 and 116-112 in his favour while the other deemed Joshua to be the winner via a score of 115-113. Cue the raising of many eyebrows.</p> \n<p>A dubious call but also one that spoke to the gutsy display Joshua delivered here and ultimately it would be a shame if that was overshadowed by his flashes of petulance after the fight. Defeat, a third in 27 fights as a professional, clearly stung. Joshua had the chance to join Muhammad Ali, Lennox Lewis, Vitali Klitschko and Evander Holyfield in becoming a three-time heavyweight champion; instead he remains rudderless in his division and with few paths back to the top. Those pre-fight suggestions that this would be the right time for him to call it a day will only grow.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"98d1b649-8e90-4b24-822e-4012a76bdd6f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xvqqedm3HDM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>For Usyk, meanwhile, a 20th straight win across two divisions cements his status as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world and puts him in prime position for a mouthwatering unification battle with Tyson Fury should the 34-year-old Mancunian step out of his latest period of retirement, something he suggested he would do <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tyson_Fury/status/1561138327964860420?s=20&amp;t=lNd5VWNSwZ3DinP9g4cDOQ\">on social media</a> shortly after the fight. It’s a contest Usyk certainly wants.</p> \n<p>“I want to fight him and if I’m not fighting Tyson Fury, I’m not fighting at all,” he declared here, having paid tribute to the Ukrainian military, something of great importance to the 35-year-old. He spent time before this fight serving in his country’s armed forces as part of their defence against Russia’s invasion. Usyk came here determined to provide his war-torn homeland with a reason to feel pride and joy and well and truly delivered.</p> \n<p>This was the second time Joshua had fought in Saudi Arabia, following his victory over Andy Ruiz Jr in Diriyah three years ago. As was the case then, both fighters were asked in the buildup about how they could justify taking part in an event that, quite clearly, was part of the kingdom’s sportswashing strategy. Neither gave especially satisfactory responses, with Joshua making clear he was “here for boxing”. No doubt the minimum £33m purse he and Usyk reportedly received for squaring up in the Middle East played a part in both of their decisions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/aug/20/anthony-joshua-v-oleksandr-usyk-ii-world-heavyweight-boxing-live\">Oleksandr Usyk defeats Anthony Joshua to retain world heavyweight titles – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And so, ultimately, attention turned to the Abdullah Sports City Arena, an impressive venue but unfitting for a contest of this magnitude given it only has capacity for 10,000 spectators. To put that into context, a crowd of 68,000 gathered to see these two fight in north London last year. The rematch clearly deserved a bigger stage, and the knock-on effect of not having one was an atmosphere that rarely rose above polite.</p> \n<p>In fairness to those in attendance here, which included boxing legends Roberto Duran and Naseem Hamed, the volume was lively enough by the time Joshua and Usyk emerged to do battle shortly after 1am local time and continued to rise during an epic encounter.</p> \n<p>Usyk was initially able to keep Joshua at bay with his southpaw jab but soon the challenger was landing with a succession of right hands. Usyk responded with a couple of clubbing lefts in the fourth that forced Joshua back while also bewitching him with his characteristically slick and clever movement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But Joshua kept on coming and connected with two crushing shots to the body in the sixth, forcing Usyk on to the ropes. Yet again, however, the champion displayed his class by smoothly getting out trouble and peppering Joshua with punches from various angles.</p> \n<p>The seventh and eight round were largely even and then came the ninth as Joshua exploded into life, fully using his superior size and power to rock the man in front of him. It looked like a shock win was on the cards but then Usyk did what he does best – taking command of a fight through a combination of sublime technique and relentless ferocity. In the end his victory was beyond question, something Joshua, in the most unique of fashion, also had to accept.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/21/has-the-energy-price-cap-had-its-day","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T23:05:52Z","webTitle":"Has the energy price cap had its day?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/21/has-the-energy-price-cap-had-its-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/21/has-the-energy-price-cap-had-its-day","fields":{"headline":"Has the energy price cap had its day?","trailText":"This week’s widely feared increase will fuel growing debate in the UK about how well the policy is working","byline":"Alex Lawson Energy correspondent","body":"<p>Next weekend, Britain will experience its first August bank holiday unencumbered by Covid for three years. Notting Hill carnival will explode on to the streets of west London, Manchester will host Pride celebrations and a vintage steam rally should charm the punters near Looe in Cornwall.</p> <p>But a nasty prelude threatens to puncture the nation’s mood before the festivities kick off: Friday’s energy price cap announcement. The energy regulator Ofgem is poised to update the public on the new level for the cap, which will be implemented on 1 October. Annual bills are currently capped at £1,971 and this is forecast to hit £3,582 in the autumn, a prediction which has been raised several times since the record summer cap was introduced in April.</p> <p>The government is examining a suite of options to help consumers, and in particular vulnerable households, tackle rising costs. These include suggestions that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/18/uk-energy-bills-crisis-fund-price-cap-deficit-tariff-scheme\" title=\"\">the price cap may be frozen for a fixed period</a>.</p> <p>This week could also mark the beginning of the end for the cap, which has proved a divisive policy blamed for the collapse of nearly 30 suppliers during the energy crisis – most notably Bulb, which remains in government-backed administration.</p> <p>The cap traces its roots to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/24/ed-miliband-labour-freeze-prices-2017\" title=\"\">a Labour conference speech by then leader Ed Miliband in 2013</a>, when he promised to impose a 20-month freeze on energy prices if elected. Despite Miliband being ridiculed, Theresa May’s government implemented the cap in 2019 in an effort to crack down on perceived profiteering in the energy industry.</p> <p>“It was introduced to stop what ministers saw as gouging of loyal customers – whether that was happening, who knows, but that was the reason for its creation,” says Robert Buckley of consultancy Cornwall Insight. “It has forced all consumers to become exposed to these huge rises in energy bills.”</p> <p>However, the existing legislation, which allows the cap to be extended annually, expires next year and many believe that the policy is now on borrowed time.</p> <p>“The cap is not fit for purpose,” says Buckley. “It forces suppliers to all hedge in the same way or lose their licence. So if their hedging costs are higher than the cap, they cannot pass that on to customers. You scrap the cap and still protect the most vulnerable.”</p> <p>Efforts to revamp the cap have proved divisive. Ofgem has modified the way it is calculated and moved from announcing a new cap every six months to every quarter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>This week also brings unfortunately timed interim results from Harbour Energy, one of the biggest producers in the North Sea</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, it has been caught between the twin aims of protecting consumers and ensuring more suppliers do not collapse. This tension led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/ofgem-director-christine-farnish-quits-over-energy-price-cap\" title=\"\">the dramatic resignation last week of an Ofgem non-executive, Christine Farnish</a>, who argued the regulator was favouring businesses at the expense of consumers.</p> <p>Many suppliers without long-term hedging policies found themselves pushed into making huge losses, unable to pass on increased costs to customers above the cap. This problem persists for Bulb, which has about 1.6 million customers: the government has prevented the company from hedging the cost of fuel, exposing it to the huge price rises in the wholesale gas market seen since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>This week also brings unfortunately timed interim results from Harbour Energy, one of the biggest oil and gas producers in the North Sea. Each booming financial update from rivals such as BP and Shell has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/an-insult-soaring-profits-at-shell-and-centrica-cause-outrage\" title=\"\">greeted with a torrent of condemnation</a> this year, as energy companies profit while the public faces a cost of living crisis.</p> <p>London-listed Harbour is expected to publish an upbeat update, with analysts at Jefferies forecasting free cashflow of $891m (£752m) for the first six months of the year.</p> <p>The company has been among the hardest hit by the oil windfall tax as recent investments, including the Tolmount gas field off the Yorkshire coast, are just bearing fruit. It has also claimed that its hedging policy has meant it has not yet felt the full effects of high energy prices.

I’ve never, never gone into a game thinking: ‘I’d take a draw here.’”</p> <p>For all his enduring front-foot principles, Newcastle are significantly tighter defensively than his old Bournemouth side. Bolstered by Nick Pope’s arrival in goal from Burnley, they have maintained clean sheets while taking four points from their two opening games, against Nottingham Forest and Brighton.</p> <p>Erling Haaland and his City friends promise to present Sven Botman, Newcastle’s new centre-half, with a sterner test and Howe says he could be persuaded to make a rare switch from his preferred back four at St James’ Park on Sunday.</p> <p>A change to a central defensive trinity could also accommodate Botman, Dan Burn and Fabian Schär while liberating Kieran Trippier and Matt Targett to operate as wing-backs. Burn excelled after arriving from Brighton in January but, like Botman, he is left-footed. The consensus is that the Dutchman – a £35m signing from Lille – and Switzerland’s Schär make a more balanced partnership in Howe’s 4-3-3 configuration. Shape shifting to 3-4-3 would enable Newcastle to retain Burn’s commanding influence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"308c9e0d11f6bdad7ea631c21069f6f13beda783\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/308c9e0d11f6bdad7ea631c21069f6f13beda783/223_281_2038_1222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sven Botman helps Newcastle to keep a clean sheet at Brighton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sven Botman helps Newcastle to keep a clean sheet at Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Callis/MB Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I’m tempted to play lots of ways,” Howe says. “Getting the balance between attacking and defending is key in these sorts of games.”</p> <p>This particular match represents a litmus test of Newcastle’s progress since their Saudi Arabian-led takeover and Howe’s appointment late last year. At the time the team had failed to win a game all season under their previous manager, Steve Bruce, and looked relegation bound but, assisted by a £90m January spending spree, Howe guided them to an assured 11th-place finish. Now his overlords in Riyadh and Jeddah will be keen to see tangible progress.</p> <p>“Sunday’s game is the ultimate test for me,” says Howe, who after spending £60m on Botman, Pope and Targett this summer remains in the market for another striker and a midfielder. “Games against Manchester City and Liverpool are the real barometer of our quality.</p> <p>“We want to narrow that gap between us and the top teams. I thought last season’s games against City were tighter than they looked on paper.”</p> <p>Now Pep Guardiola has added Haaland to his attacking armoury and Pope must trust that an outstanding performance against the formidable Norway striker would not merely confirm his place on England’s flight to Doha and November’s World Cup but offer Gareth Southgate pause for thought about Jordan Pickford’s status as his first-choice goalkeeper.</p> <p>Howe tends to be circumspect in dispensing opinions but does not discourage the idea that Pope could dislodge his Everton counterpart, while also leapfrogging Arsenal’s Aaron Ramsdale.</p> <p>“Everyone’s frustrated we haven’t been able to sign more players,” says Howe, whose room for transfer-market manoeuvre is limited by the need to remain within financial fair play restrictions. “But Nick’s been brilliant for us. I’m sure he has ambitions to push Jordan Pickford. When you’re in his position, you’re close to playing.</p> <p>“You’ve got to reach and strain to try to make that jump and, with the start he’s made here, he’s done himself no harm.</p> <p>“His ability to claim crosses and shot-stopping are of the highest level and he’s distributed the ball really well. He’s very cute and clever with how he does it. He’s made a big impact.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/20/klopp-claims-liverpool-should-get-points-if-old-trafford-game-abandoned","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T21:30:50Z","webTitle":"Klopp claims Liverpool should ‘get points’ if Old Trafford game abandoned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/20/klopp-claims-liverpool-should-get-points-if-old-trafford-game-abandoned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/20/klopp-claims-liverpool-should-get-points-if-old-trafford-game-abandoned","fields":{"headline":"Klopp claims Liverpool should ‘get points’ if Old Trafford game abandoned","trailText":"Jürgen Klopp believes Liverpool should be awarded three points if their game at Old Trafford against Manchester United on Monday is abandoned due to protests","byline":"Andy Hunter","body":"<p>Jürgen Klopp believes Liverpool should be awarded three points if their game at Old Trafford on Monday is abandoned because of protests against Manchester United’s owners, as happened 15 months ago.</p> \n<p>Liverpool’s visit to Old Trafford <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/02/manchester-united-fans-invade-old-trafford-pitch-during-glazer-out-protests\">was postponed in May 2021</a> when United fans entered the stadium, closed at the time because of the pandemic, during protests against the Glazer family.

After Fernandinho decided to go to Brazil, the rest is history, we were looking for a holding midfielder and we thought he was perfect for us.”</p> <p>Bielsa helped City by adapting Phillips’s game, after he had come through the ranks at Elland Road as a more attack-minded player. The 26-year-old was an unused substitute in the Community Shield against Liverpool before making his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/07/west-ham-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">debut in City’s Premier League opener late on at West Ham</a>.

The former president and his allies have previously moved quickly to request special masters, including when the office of his former lawyer Michael Cohen was searched in 2018.</p> <p>The timing is important because the federal agents who execute search warrants are typically themselves members of a so-called taint team and filter what they remove from a property in real time. For documents with classified markings, those are sent to relevant agencies for review.</p> <p>But the nearly two-week delay means that even if Trump had filed a motion when Trusty first indicated, and the court restrained the justice department from further examining the seized materials until filtered by a special master, prosecutors may have already sifted through it all.</p> <p>The impetus to file a motion now, the sources said, appears to have come in part as a reaction to criticism from other Trump allies that the former president’s legal team had not filed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/trump-redacted-affidavit-release-mar-a-lago-fbi-search\">motion to unseal the affidavit</a> underpinning the Mar-a-Lago search, or any other formal legal action.</p> <p>Trump was unimpressed that Fox News host Laura Ingraham repeated that criticism in an interview Thursday with one of his lawyers, Christina Bobb, one of the sources said, and indicated that he thought his lawyers should be fighting harder on his behalf against the justice department.</p> <p>Another person close to the former president said that account was “fake news”. Trusty – and two other lawyers on the Trump legal team – did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>But the announcement about a potential filing by Trump came less than 24 hours after the Fox News segment, while Bobb’s appearance – now widely seen as the face of Trump’s defense team in this case – was also the subject of internal criticism among aides, the sources said.</p> <p>The news about a potential court filing in the Mar-a-Lago case first came from Trump himself. “A major motion pertaining to the Fourth Amendment will soon be filed concerning the illegal Break-In of my home, Mar-a-Lago,” the former president said on his social media website on Friday, alluding to the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p> <p><em>Note: This post was updated to note there had still not been a filing on Sunday.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/21/number-96-turns-50-the-mayhem-and-mishaps-behind-australias-trailblazing-soap","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T20:00:50Z","webTitle":"Number 96 turns 50: the mayhem and mishaps behind Australia’s trailblazing soap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/21/number-96-turns-50-the-mayhem-and-mishaps-behind-australias-trailblazing-soap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/21/number-96-turns-50-the-mayhem-and-mishaps-behind-australias-trailblazing-soap","fields":{"headline":"Number 96 turns 50: the mayhem and mishaps behind Australia’s trailblazing soap","trailText":"For five nights a week in the 1970s, the show brought nudity, plot twists and progressive politics to primetime.

By 11am Gordon [McDougall, who played Sheila’s husband Les] and Jim Elliott [Alf] would be quite woozy. Ron Shand [Herb] never drank, just hugged his glass. So, it was decided to create Norma’s Bar from which I could serve flat cola or coloured water as wine.</p> <p>Jan Adele as Trixie O’Toole was always invited to tell one of her outrageously rude jokes just before a scene, so we’d all be genuinely laughing and jolly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was quoted in the media (only if I talked of my sex life and recipes)</p> <footer> <cite>Candy Raymond, who played Jill Sheridan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Dina Mann (Debbie Chester): </strong>I remember a scene with Jan Adele and Sheila Kennelly in the wine bar. Unbeknownst to Sheila the scene was already in the can, but having worded Jan up, [director] Brian Phillis asked for another take. Jan, as Trixie O’Toole, enters the wine bar and Norma says something along the lines of “How are you ducky?” to which Jan replied: “Gawd, what do you have to do to get a drink around here? I’m as dry as a nun’s cunt.”</p> <p>Sheila didn’t bat an eyelid and continued to her last line.</p> <p><strong>Sheila Kennelly: </strong>An artist played by Owen Weingott decided to paint a portrait for Norma’s Bar which turned out to be similar to <a href=\"https://www.youngandjacksons.com.au/chloe\">Chloe</a> hanging in a Melbourne hotel – Norma reclining almost naked. Eunice Dyer, the Channel 10 artist who actually did the painting, was confronted by me in a neck to ankle caftan. “Couldn’t you pose in your undies?” she sadly asked. “No fear,” I replied. Eunice gave Norma a beautifully tilted bosom which I much preferred to the real thing.</p> <h2>Sex scenes and nudity</h2> <p><em>The series heralded full-frontal nudity on the small screen, with some actors contractually obliged to strip, while gay sexuality was presented as a vibrant part of life.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2d4aad203de7e79c730969475f56c1d5513491e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2d4aad203de7e79c730969475f56c1d5513491e/76_140_2734_2019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Hasham as Don and John Orcsik as Simon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"738\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Hasham as Don and John Orcsik as Simon.

Shaking with fear on those cold sheets, aware my new bride (in real life) would see the scene in a few weeks, I couldn’t get in the mood – or the right position for acceptable screen bonking. Director Brian Phillis was very quiet and helpful as I fluffed the first handful of takes, but his mood intensified. “Just another one, Harry, but for God’s sake look as if something is happening under there,” he demanded. The moment Brian said “Good, we’ve got it”, I grabbed the pillow, held it over my vitals and shot off the set, not really caring how much of a view everyone got of my unprotected rear.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A series of farts ensued, and my secret was out</p> <footer> <cite>Bunney Brooke, who played Flo Patterson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Julian Rockett (Adam Shaw): </strong>I was the first male nude on colour TV in Australia.

During rehearsals for one of those early scenes with Dorrie I misread “berserk” as “beresk”.

I had to as well. Inevitably, our disguise would be penetrated by people around us and often because of Elaine’s vocal support for the opposing team (her voice was so distinctive).

In the public narrative of the pandemic, people with disabilities don’t get to be main characters if they’re inconveniencing the healthy.

Celemajer has written and spoken about how we’re drawn to individual protagonists experiencing personal transformations, and how distinctly <em>not </em>useful that is for understanding institutional violence, structures, and abstract or enormous outcomes.</p> <p>It is frustrating but essential that we consider the power and the limitations of individual empathy.

A treaty sets out the terms of engagement and obligations of all sides to maintain the agreement.</p> <p>New Zealand (Aotearoa), Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Japan, Greenland and the US have all negotiated treaties with Indigenous peoples.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/victoria-passes-landmark-legislation-to-create-first-nations-treaty-authority\">Victoria passes landmark legislation to create First Nations treaty authority</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Canada<strong> </strong>has made about 70<a href=\"https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1100100028574/1529354437231\"> recognised treaties</a> with First Nations peoples since 1701. In some cases, such as Nunavut in northern Canada, they have led to self-government. But not all treaties are <a href=\"https://indigenousstudies.utoronto.ca/news/treaty-myths/\">easily understood</a>, workable or extant.</p> <p>The United States government ratified more than 364 treaties between 1778 and 1868. Treaties were largely used by the US to put an end to conflict, and later used to <a href=\"http://recordsofrights.org/themes/4/rights-of-native-americans#the-end-of-treaty-making\">force Native Americans off their </a>lands.

It is still being grappled with. There were two versions – one in English and one in Māori - and they were not exact translations, so there were major differences in interpretation, especially around Māori sovereignty. In 1975, the <a href=\"https://waitangitribunal.govt.nz/treaty-of-waitangi/meaning-of-the-treaty/\">Waitangi tribunal</a> was set up to determine the issues raised by these different meanings. In 2014 it decided the Māori leaders who signed did not cede sovereignty, a big step forward.</p> <h2>How long has treaty-making been on the agenda in Australia?</h2> <p>In Australia, there has never been a treaty negotiated between Aboriginal and Islander nations and the commonwealth.</p> <p>Calls for treaty<strong>-</strong>making go back decades. A line is often traced from the 1963 Yirrkala bark petition – in which Yolngu (the Indigenous people of north-east Arnhem Land) asserted their sovereignty over lands where the federal government had allowed a bauxite mine – through the 1966 <a href=\"https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/wave-hill-walk-off\">Gurindji walk-off</a> at Wave Hill station, and the NT Aboriginal Land Rights Act in 1976, all the way to 1988, when the Treaty 88 campaign took off amid <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nlCxz650Yo&amp;ab_channel=DreamscapePublishing\">huge Aboriginal protests </a>against the bicentennial.</p> <p>In June that year, traditional owners presented <a href=\"https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/barunga-statement\">the Barunga statement</a> to Bob Hawke, who promised there’d be a treaty by the end of 1990. As Yothu Yindi sang in Treaty, a 1991 song about the events that day, “promises can disappear, just like writing in the sand”.</p> <p>In 2007, in perhaps an attempt to derail further treaty calls, the Howard government developed a plan for symbolic constitutional recognition. Successive governments have committed to some form of recognition.</p> <h2>What are the states doing on treaty-making?</h2> <p>At least three states have formally embarked on treaty processes, and some are also exploring truth-telling.</p> <p>The Queensland government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/queensland-to-unveil-indigenous-truth-telling-inquiry-as-part-of-path-to-treaty\">announced on Monday</a> it would set up an independent treaty institute to design a framework for agreement making with the government and it will support a three-year long truth-telling inquiry.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Victoria became the first state to pass legislation to set up an independent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/07/decolonisation-in-action-victorian-treaty-negotiations-to-be-overseen-by-independent-authority\">Indigenous treaty authority</a>, to “umpire” treaty negotiations and resolve disputes between traditional owner groups and the state government.</p> <p>Victoria has also embarked on truth-telling, which is proving challenging for many reasons. The Yoorrook justice commission handed down its first report in July, outlining elders’ experiences of colonisation and the stolen generations. It is seeking a two-year extension on its final report to 2026, to ensure the truth-telling process does not “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/09/yoorrook-the-fight-for-victorias-truth-telling-commission-to-achieve-its-groundbreaking-goals\">replicate colonial injustices</a>” and re-traumatise Aboriginal people.</p> <p>The Northern Territory treaty commission handed its final report to the government in March, after four years of consultation with communities. It said the firm focus of any treaties must be to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/29/nt-treaties-must-achieve-highest-levels-of-self-determination-for-first-nations-commissioner-says\">enable First Nations self-government</a>. The NT should establish a First Nations forum and develop a territory-wide agreement that would set the minimum standards for all subsequent treaties. Importantly, treaty-making could be between Indigenous nations as well as with governments.</p> <p>The government said it would provide a comprehensive response by the end of 2022.</p> <p>In March, Tasmania’s<strong> </strong>then<strong> </strong>premier, Peter Gutwein, said there was<strong> “</strong>broad support to take further steps” on truth-telling and treaty. There are plans for an advisory body, Gutwein said, and all registered Aboriginal community organisations were invited to be involved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/queensland-to-unveil-indigenous-truth-telling-inquiry-as-part-of-path-to-treaty\">Queensland to unveil Indigenous truth-telling inquiry as part of path to treaty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Western Australia, the landmark <a href=\"https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-the-premier-and-cabinet/south-west-native-title-settlement\">south-west native title settlement </a>is often cited as Australia’s first treaty.

There has been no commitment to a treaty, but a broad commitment to the principles of the Uluru statement.</p> <h2>What about a national treaty?</h2> <p>In 2017 at Uluru, the <a href=\"https://www.referendumcouncil.org.au/\">Referendum Council</a> convened the First Nations constitutional convention, where the Uluru Statement from the Heart called for sequential reforms: a voice, treaty and truth.</p> <p>In July this year the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/29/anthony-albanese-reveals-simple-and-clear-wording-of-referendum-question-on-indigenous-voice\">a preferred form of words</a> he wants to put to the Australian people in a referendum, to amend the constitution to enable a voice to parliament to be established.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"234a7db93bfe5c2f3e07b5558a2ac2caf08fecaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/234a7db93bfe5c2f3e07b5558a2ac2caf08fecaa/0_147_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney and prime minister of Australia Anthony Albanese at Garma festival 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney and prime minister of Australia Anthony Albanese at Garma festival 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If successful, it will give parliament the enabling power to settle on the details of the voice after a referendum. The Balnaves chair for constitutional law at the University of New South Wales, Prof Megan Davis, said in early August it was a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/06/a-civil-mature-conversation-architects-of-the-uluru-statement-make-plea-for-consensus-on-referendum\">common constitutional technique” to defer detail </a>to the parliament at a later date.</p> <p>“That’s how, for example, the high court was set up,” Davis said. “The enabling provision has passed, and the institution’s been set up later.”</p> <p>On Friday, the minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, said the government’s “priority” is to conduct the referendum.</p> <p>“I’m not sure people appreciate just how complex and how involving that is,” Burney told the ABC.</p> <p>So, to follow the sequence, any federally negotiated treaties are still a long way off.</p> <h2>Why do First Nations want to negotiate a treaty or treaties?</h2> <p>“So that we can overcome those huge injustices that still, unfortunately, persist in our society,” the Queensland treaty advancement committee co-chair Dr Jackie Huggins said this week.</p> <p>“The path to treaty is about how we mend the very fabric of our society.”</p> <h2>And what about the view that treaties are only symbolic; they don’t achieve practical change?</h2> <p>If done right, treaties allow Aboriginal people to run their own affairs, the NT acting treaty commissioner, Tony McAvoy, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-29/nt-treaty-report-released-by-commissioner/101192202\">told the ABC</a> in March.</p> <p>“When Aboriginal communities [and] Aboriginal organisations design and deliver the services for Aboriginal people, those services are the most effective at that time. We would see a significant change in the levels of disadvantage if we’re able to ensure those governments are supported and properly resourced to do the work,” McAvoy said.</p> <p>Pat Anderson, one of the key campaigners for the Uluru statement, said these reforms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/06/a-civil-mature-conversation-architects-of-the-uluru-statement-make-plea-for-consensus-on-referendum\">allow for Aboriginal people to directly tell governments</a> what they want and need.</p> <p>“We won’t have to beg anymore, we won’t have to justify ourselves.

They can’t believe it,” says Sandra Pankhurst, the subject of Lachlan Mcleod’s second documentary, Clean. </p> <p>Pankhurst is a person who has led many lives within a life: adopted as a child, then severely abused by her adoptive parents; emerging from a failed marriage and coming out as a transgender woman in the 1980s; working as a drag queen and sex worker; and eventually starting her own cleaning business in the 1990s. Late in her life (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/jul/08/a-spectacular-person-sandra-pankhurst-subject-of-the-trauma-cleaner-dies-in-melbourne\">she died in 2021</a>), Pankhurst became a public figure after the publication of Sarah Krasnostein’s expansive, heartfelt and award-winning book about her life and line of work, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/28/i-started-dry-retching-the-compassion-of-a-trauma-cleaner\">The Trauma Cleaner</a>, in 2017.</p> <p>It doesn’t matter whether you’ve read Krasnostein’s book; Mcleod is adept at letting the story unfold without unnecessary intervention.

If you have read it, then Clean, while having no association with Krasnostein’s book, acts as a sequel of sorts: in it we see Pankhurst in the aftermath and right up until her death. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/28/i-started-dry-retching-the-compassion-of-a-trauma-cleaner\">‘I started dry retching’: the harrowing world of a trauma cleaner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pankhurst’s cleaning company is no ordinary business. Based in Frankston, Victoria, Pankhurst and her team specialise in “trauma cleaning”: swabbing-down crime scenes and suicide sites, assisting the mentally and physically disabled with home maintenance, and clearing out hoarders’ homes and deceased estates.

The film is the opposite of what John Berger criticised in Ways of Seeing: “Art that makes inequality seem noble and hierarchies seem thrilling”. Instead, Clean is a tapestry that helps bring a character’s story to the public eye in a way that is as unsensational as it is intuitive. Here, Mcleod is both interlocutor and witness. When hoarders, the disabled and previously incarcerated people are often subject to an outsider’s gaze – and as the middle classes aspire towards minimalism and Marie Kondo-style “decluttering” - Clean shows that, as Pankhurst says early on, “Everyone’s got trauma; it’s not the demographic, it’s the circumstance.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0061cd3bcdd4141bd64f93dad786aac24c0b991\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0061cd3bcdd4141bd64f93dad786aac24c0b991/0_698_7817_4692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the 2022 Australian documentary Clean, about the late ‘trauma cleaner’ Sandra Pankhurst.

We follow Pankhurst’s staff – on their way to work, at home or on the job – and it’s clear they share her ethos of “promoting care, compassion and dignity” with their clients. Their work can be hard, they admit – one cleaner likens the work of sorting through debris for used syringes to a game of pick-up sticks – but it can also be worthwhile.</p> <p>However, Mcleod’s major misstep is adding unnecessary reenactments of events from Pankhurst’s past. Between interviews, there are scenes shot in a muted colour palette – of a lone boy sitting at a desk, blood dripping in reconstructed crime scenes, sex workers performing their jobs and smoking cigarettes. Paired with the overworked original score by Patrick Grigg, these scenes feel bathetic; Pankhurst is a natural storyteller, and her no-bullshit presence tells us enough.</p> <p>That being said, there is a certain vulnerability in Pankhurst that comes through in Clean. She tries to remain stoic, even through bouts of laboured breathing, and abruptly changes the subject when she is asked a question that catches her unawares. Before going on stage to speak at a conference, she casually tells someone that a tumour has been discovered in her brain. Much like the elaborate makeup she puts on every day, Mcleod shows us that Pankhurst’s mask is well-worn, constructed through decades of trauma and her stubborn determination to leave it all behind. </p> <ul> <li><p><em>Clean is screening as part of the 2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/melbourne-international-film-festival\">Melbourne international film festival</a>.

The telegraph line brought settlers, the destruction of the environment and death for Aboriginal people.</p> <p>Both stories are true.</p> <p>The idea to link Australia by telegraph to the world took shape as Britain began to send undersea cables across vast portions of the globe from the 1850s, but the task of crossing the continent from south to north appeared too daunting for many years, not least after the disastrous Burke and Wills expedition of 1861.</p> <p>But the following year the Scottish explorer John McDouall Stuart travelled from South Australia to the north coast and back, demonstrating that the journey was eminently possible, however arduous.</p> <p>With imperial cable connections by then stretching to India and beyond, Australia eyed the prospect of communicating with Europe in mere hours, instead of the months needed for a sea voyage.

The government then offered a contract to build the rest of the line, all the way to the tiny outpost of Darwin, by 1 January 1872.</p> <p>The budget was £128,000 (though that blew out to £239,588), and the SA superintendent of telegraphs, Charles Todd, was appointed to manage construction.</p> <p>“In such a large, dry continent with so little communication infrastructure, this was one of Australia’s greatest ever engineering undertakings,” <a href=\"https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/overland-telegraph\">the National Museum of Australia declares</a>.</p> <p>“The Overland Telegraph changed the way Australia related to the world and the country’s extreme isolation was broken.”</p> <p>Julian Todd, Charles Todd’s great-great-grandson, points to the “extraordinary” scale and speed of the accomplishment. The decision, the relevant legislation, the tenders and construction of the line itself were all completed within two years.</p> <p>“That’s 36,000 holes you have to dig, 3,000km of telegraph wire, a track that’s 10 metres wide,” he says.</p> <p>“You have to not only find the workers – blacksmiths, carpenters, cooks, storekeepers, linemen, surveyors, telegraphists … there are horse wagons, bullock drays and Afghan camels brought to the centre of Australia.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"042cd1e266de82e63289374b88aa4f1e34037987\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/042cd1e266de82e63289374b88aa4f1e34037987/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Todd’s great-great-grandson Julian Todd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Todd’s great-great-grandson Julian Todd says his ancestor had ‘a deep respect for the Aboriginal community’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A couple of months after the line from Adelaide to Darwin was connected, it was linked to an underwater cable that went to Java, and from there all the way to London.</p> <p>“In those days, SA was the wheat capital of Australia,” Todd says. “The entire wheat crop was sold to England because of that wire.</p> <p>“It was extraordinary technology for a country that had experienced, up until then, the tyranny of distance. Socially and economically, it made a huge impact in Australia.”</p> <h2>‘Through the very centre of Australia’</h2> <p>The line follows Stuart’s route, which itself followed a “traditional trade route created and travelled by Aboriginal people for millennia”, the museum says.</p> <p>If you were to travel from Adelaide to Darwin today, with your eyes peeled for what’s left of this great endeavour, you would see remnants of some of the 36,000 telegraph poles or their old holes.

The line was in fact complete, but Patterson cut it so he could ceremonially join it again.</p> <p>However, he had some trouble and a little shock.</p> <p>“Half the party seized hold of me and the wire and the other half the other end and stretched with all might and main to bring the two ends together. All our force could not do this,” he wrote, as Pugh recounts.</p> <p>“I then attached some binding wire to one end. The moment I brought it to the other end the current passed through my body from all the batteries on the line. I had to yell and let go.</p> <p>“Next time I proceeded more cautiously and used my handkerchief to seize the wire. In about five minutes I had the joint made complete, and Adelaide was in communication with Port Darwin.”</p> <p>To celebrate this great triumph, Patterson had his men fire their guns 21 times, and smash a brandy bottle (filled with tea) against the final pole.</p> <p>The first message sent was a sober one from a bureaucrat to the governor, ending in “God save the Queen!”.</p> <p>Todd’s first message was: “We have this day or within two years from the date it was commenced, completed a line of 2,000 miles long through the very centre of Australia a few years ago a <em>terra incognita</em> and supposed to be a desert.”</p> <h2>‘A really brutal history’</h2> <p>Robyn Smith, a lecturer at the University of Newcastle, works on the colonial frontier massacres map that informed the Guardian’s Killing Times project. She says as well as the massacres directly associated with the Overland Telegraph line, there was a slower shock wave that devastated Aboriginal lives.</p> <p>The bullocks, horses and camels brought in to build the line trampled the landscape, as did the cattle that came later. Settlements and towns sprang up around the telegraph stations, and pastoralists claimed the land for themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73b7d9e3506d3aec2613623542f6819dfd35585b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73b7d9e3506d3aec2613623542f6819dfd35585b/0_0_5000_3064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pastoralists\" width=\"1000\" height=\"613\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pastoralists who came with the telegraph ‘just took matters into their own hands’, says Robyn Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Library &amp; Archives NT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Smith says the Overland Telegraph line was the first catalyst for the colonisation of the Northern Territory. It enabled the second, which was pastoralism.</p> <p>“Todd’s instructions were that the camps and repeater stations were to be located close to two things: water and suitable timber to cut and use for poles,” she says.</p> <p>So those working on the line and their animals were competing for water and other resources with the local Aboriginal people.</p> <p>Todd instructed his men to have “minimal impact” on Aboriginal people, but that was always unrealistic. More like a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, Smith says.</p> <p>That meant the liberal use of euphemisms by the overseers and pastoralists as massacres continued. “Dispersals” meant not the scattering of Aboriginal people, but their deaths. “Stern reprisals” was the same. Then there was “teach a lesson”, and “justice was done”. All mean “killed”, Smith says.</p> <p>“So that’s what happened along the line. Then the pastoral stations fanned out from that. And pastoralists are a different breed. They just took matters into their own hands.”</p> <p>Smith says the dominant narrative of the line is that of pioneering triumphalism, which overshadows the harsh reality of the project.</p> <p>“There’s a really brutal history attached to both the Overland Telegraph line and the pastoral stations,” she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"weekend app\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&link=true&link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>There’s no doubt Charles Todd was enormously accomplished – a brilliant meteorologist, astronomer and public servant.</p> <p>Julian Todd says his great-great-grandfather (for whom the Todd River was named) and his wife, Alice, (for whom Alice Springs was named) had “a deep respect for the Aboriginal community”.

In these court rooms, he had taken the stand, a picture of a befuddled, grandfatherly man with shaking hands and a fading memory.</p> \n<p>As a key witness<strong> </strong> Ric Blum was under interrogation by the sharp and precise Adam Casselden SC, assisting the coroner, Teresa O’Sullivan<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p>It was all leading to the one central question. The reason we were all there. To find out what happened to Marion Barter.</p> \n<p>That this day, the inquest into the disappearance of Barter, had come was almost surreal to most of us in the room – her family who loved her, those of us who never knew her but had joined the search, covered the story and become invested.<strong> </strong>After all the leads we chased, after all the clues that made no sense, after all the years of wondering, it was a day that we feared<strong> </strong>might never have happened. </p> \n<p>Barter’s daughter Sally Leydon had been looking for her mother for 25 years. Now here in front of her was a man who<strong> </strong>might hold the answers.</p> \n<h2>The daughter searches</h2> \n<p>I first heard about Barter in 2010, when a detective chief inspector handed me a torn piece of paper with a name and number on it. A woman had disappeared in mysterious circumstances, but was not officially listed as missing by the police.</p> \n<p>I rang the number and Leydon answered – she had been waiting for someone, anyone, to call. </p> \n<p>We met in Brisbane more than a decade after Barter disappeared and she would tell me a story that has haunted me ever since. Leydon was then the mother of three small children and utterly bewildered. She had spent her wedding day in 1999 looking around for her mother to arrive. She had missed having her mother to help her through pregnancies. Though years had passed, she retained meticulous detail of her mother’s last known movements. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c54274df41c67b719e888abe1b9ee51b1f666372\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c54274df41c67b719e888abe1b9ee51b1f666372/0_199_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Leydon looks at old pictures of her mother Marion Barter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sally Leydon looks at old pictures of her mother.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Maurice Smith/Oculi</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Barter had been a primary school teacher at The Southport School in south-east Queensland. “She loved ballet, opera, the finer things of life,” Leydon says. “She was not a street-smart, savvy woman. She was naive and gullible.”</p> \n<p>More than anything Barter wanted to be in a relationship. “She needed to have a man in her life,” says Leydon. At 51 her romantic life had been bumpy; she had been married three times. Her failed love life weighed on her. She just wanted to be loved.</p> \n<p>Leydon had been through all her mother’s marriages and relationships with her. They<strong> </strong>had always been close and open with each other.</p> \n<p>Then in March 1997 Barter made an abrupt life change. She quit her job, sold her house and announced she was going on a sabbatical to Europe.</p> \n<p>And she<strong> </strong>became uncharacteristically secretive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Australia Weekend signup\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Not long before Barter was due to fly to Europe, Leydon had stopped at a local McDonald’s and saw her car at the petrol station. Leydon would describe a tall man sitting in the car with her, partly obscured by the lights on the windscreen. Barter got out of the car to get petrol, Leydon recalls, but seeing her daughter got back in and sped off the wrong way through the drive-in. </p> \n<p>Barter left Australia on 22 June 1997. For a few weeks, she would call to check in on her daughter, making sure she was OK.</p> \n<p>On 1 August Barter phoned Leydon from Tunbridge Wells.<strong> </strong>They spoke until she ran out of coins in a phone box. Barter was tying up loose ends in Australia, housekeeping. She said she was going to stop writing postcards and letters for a while – “I need to rest”.<strong> </strong>There was no indication that there was anything wrong. She said that she missed her daughter. “She said I was the best daughter,” says Leydon. “That was the last time I spoke to my mum.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a98ebe3ecd8d4f4f9e2f73b30db6fdc8aae966d6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a98ebe3ecd8d4f4f9e2f73b30db6fdc8aae966d6/0_201_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A picture of Marion Barter with her daughter Sally Leydon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘She said I was the best daughter’: an old photo of Marion Barter and Sally Leydon.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Maurice Smith/Oculi</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After that call,<strong> </strong>postcards and birthday presents for friends and family arrived. Leydon would receive postcards from the Sussex coast and London. Her mother was having a “wonderful” time. She’d been “brave” and hired a car, and was on her way to Amsterdam. “I’m in a holiday mood and beginning to unwind with all this beauty surrounding me,” she wrote to Leydon. There was no mention of returning to Australia.</p> \n<p>And then there was silence.</p> \n<p>On 18 October, when Barter didn’t contact her son Owen for his 23rd birthday, Leydon became concerned. Barter had been exceptionally close to Owen as a child and Leydon didn’t believe she would have missed his birthday. Leydon realised she had no idea where her mother was.</p> \n<p>She contacted Barter’s bank. At first the bank was reluctant to disclose personal information – until it saw what was happening to her accounts. On 2 August, only one day after her carefree phone call to Leydon from Tunbridge Wells, money began disappearing from her accounts. Over a three-week period in August and September<strong>, </strong>when her family believed she was in Europe, $5,000 a day had been withdrawn in Byron Bay and Burleigh Heads in northern New South Wales. Leydon reported her missing to police.<strong> </strong>Just a few days earlier, on 15 October 1997, $80,000 had been electronically transferred to an unknown account.</p> \n<p>But the Byron Bay police did not pursue an investigation. “I got called probably a week to 10 days after<strong> </strong>[reporting her missing] telling me that they had located my Mum and that she didn’t want anyone to know where she was or what she was doing,” Leydon recalls. She remembers the police reporting they had spoken to a bank teller who said Barter had talked to her of “starting a new life” as she withdrew the last of her money.</p> \n<p>There is now no police record of this conversation. The case was marked “not a priority”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily morning briefing newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download the free app</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/mar/17/make-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend?CMP=cvau_atom\">get our weekend edition</a> for a curated selection of the week's best stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/guardianaustraliagdn\">YouTube</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://tiktok.com/@guardianaustralia\">TikTok</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_atom\">\"Full Story\"</a> in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The last trace of Barter was her Medicare card being used at an optometrist in Grafton on 13 August 1997 <strong>–</strong> around the time the phone calls had stopped, and when postcards and presents from Barter, believed to be in Europe, were arriving.</p> \n<p>Since then there has been no proof of life. Her superannuation has never been touched, nor the money she deposited in the UK before travelling, she has never had a parking ticket, or been to a doctor, or received a pension from Centrelink.</p> \n<p>In the first year after her mother stopped communicating, Leydon was desperately worried about her. She was<strong> </strong>23 years old and trying to plan her wedding, which her mother had organised to be held at the chapel at The Southport School. “It should have been the most exciting time of my life.”</p> \n<p>For years afterwards Leydon was torn. Was her mother still alive but inexplicably didn’t want anything to do with her family? Or had she been the victim of some sort of foul play? Either way it was agony.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c939eec141dc0b8a5bef6cb0c4a0757de0c91bc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c939eec141dc0b8a5bef6cb0c4a0757de0c91bc/0_296_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of Sally Leydon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sally Leydon realised she had no idea where her mother was when she missed a family birthday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Maurice Smith/Oculi</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>A new name</h2> \n<p>For two decades as Leydon tried to get someone to help search for her mother, she had doors closed in her face.</p> \n<p>She badgered the Byron Bay Senior Detective Constable Gary Sheehan, who in 2011<strong> </strong>started looking into the case, often in his own time. Even though the original police file had been lost, he kept digging until he uncovered a stunning piece of information.</p> \n<p>In May 1997, two months before she left Australia, Barter had changed her name by deed poll. Leydon didn’t believe that Barter would have had the wherewithal to do this on her own.</p> \n<p>“For her to change her name is beyond me,” Leydon said. </p> \n<p>But because of the name change police maintained that Barter had staged her own disappearance. Sheehan closed the case, marking her as located.</p> \n<p>Some years later, Leydon got hold of the name change documents. Barter had changed her name to Florabella Natalia Marion Remakel. It was a wildly decorative name that made no sense. Leydon had never heard her mention the name Florabella. </p> \n<p>“I need a drink,” Leydon said when she told me this in 2019, and I have to admit, so did I.</p> \n<h2>The podcast detectives</h2> \n<p>Leydon never gave up hope that her mother was alive and hiding somewhere.</p> \n<p>“If she chose to disappear, I will understand. But I just want to give her a hug,” she told me in 2019.</p> \n<p>Leydon’s life went on. Her children grew. Her search continued, she never stopped pushing for answers. And then came the true crime podcast which changed everything.</p> \n<p>In 2019 Alison Sandy, the FOI officer at Seven News, heard about Leydon’s search through a mutual friend, and worked to turn the tale into a podcast. Within a month of its launch The Lady Vanishes had been downloaded 1m times. Today that number has reached almost 12m.</p> \n<p>Among those listeners grew an armchair detective army, pursuing leads and digging into Barter’s case. Joni Condos, a cookbook writer and former social worker, was one of those amateur sleuths. Condos revealed herself to be a formidable investigator. The name Remakel struck her.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ae75166393b986c5f2bf9cfeb9e32e6713f9388\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ae75166393b986c5f2bf9cfeb9e32e6713f9388/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joni Condos, a researcher on the Marion Barter missing person cold case\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘My heart just went into my throat’: Joni Condos is a researcher on the Marion Barter case.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“When they said the name I got this weird feeling in my gut,” she says. It was such an unusual name. A month after the podcast was launched she ran the name “through all these active online databases”. “If you just put Remakel in you would never have got it.” She tried putting spaces between the letters in different combinations.</p> \n<p>And then she found it. “My heart just went into my throat and I felt like I could hardly breathe.” A 1994 lonely hearts ad in Le Courrier Australien, a French-English bilingual newspaper. Fernand Nocola Remakel was “47 years old, single, large, brunette, sober, non smoker, university graduated, multi home owner, intelligent, multi lingual, genuine, morally aligned. Searching for a lady with a free heart. Looking for a permanent relationship and or marriage.”</p> \n<p>It had a Lennox Head post office box and phone number. “Overnight I did mapping of the Remakel name around the world.” There was only one person of that name and age – he lived in Luxembourg.</p> \n<p>Another listener contacted Leydon to say he had researched at the library and located the owner of the phone number on Remakel’s lonely hearts ad. In the 1995 White Pages the number was linked to a business called Ballina Coin Investments owned by Frederick and Diane De Hedervary. The phone number had only been active for six months.</p> \n<p>“That is when everything just closed in,” Condos says. “I got into the National Archives and ordered up every record under this guy’s [De Hedervary] name.” </p> \n<p>She found an immigration file in which there were notes on the back of a notepad written by an Asio agent. There was a list of 30 aliases this person used.</p> \n<p>In the supreme court registry Condos found he had changed his name by deed poll 12 times.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All the while, it was the single phone number on the lonely hearts ad linking De Hedervary to Remakel which kept the podcast fans digging.</p> \n<p>Condos and Leydon put together a dossier. “Joni and I just had been working tirelessly for the entire year,” Leydon says.</p> \n<p>Leydon flew to Sydney on 29 November 2019 and spent a day with NSW police crime command. “I took down all my documents that I could possibly carry,” she recalls.</p> \n<p>Twenty-two years after Leydon first reported her mother missing, the unsolved homicide unit established Strike Force Jurunga to investigate Barter’s disappearance. The investigation would lead police to the man now known as Ric Blum. Police would find a lapsed Queensland driver’s licence in the name of Fernand Remakel that linked to De Hedervary and hence to Blum.</p> \n<h2>Finding the passport</h2> \n<p>While the police investigation continued, the sleuths did not stop.</p> \n<p>In 2020, Condos found documents showing<strong> </strong>that just one day after Barter had called Leydon for the last time, in August 1997, a person travelling on a passport as Florabella Natalia Marion Remakel flew in to Australia. On her passenger form it stated that Florabella was married, living in Luxembourg, and that her occupation was “home duties”. Barter had never mentioned Luxembourg to anyone. It declared the person would be in Australia for eight days. The passport was never used again.</p> \n<p>For years we had all suspected that whoever took her money had a female accomplice posing as Barter.</p> \n<p>Then Condos found Florabella’s returning passenger card in the National Archives. When Sally saw it for the first time she saw the handwriting was her mother’s. It was the same distinctive cursive as on the postcards. Now she had to face the fact that her mother had come back to Australia. She was not in Europe, dead or alive.</p> \n<p>The moment it all clicked into place was, Leydon says, “quite terrifying”.</p> \n<h2>The four women of the inquest</h2> \n<p>Nearly three years later, on that tropical day of sun and rain last February, I was not the only person getting the chills as the inquest commenced at the quaint old courthouse in Ballina.</p> \n<p>A series of women would come before the court; wives or lovers of Fernand Remakel, Frederick De Hedervary, Rick West. All had been offered to be whisked away from their humdrum lives, Casselden would allege. And all would identify Ric Blum as the man they’d had a relationship with, although he had used different names over time.</p> \n<p>Over five days, Casselden would weave the stories of the women together, seeking to establish a pattern that he alleged Blum – going by the name Remakel, De Hedervary or West – followed. The counsel assisting would tell the court that NSW detectives had found 30 aliases linked to him across multiple jurisdictions nationally and internationally. They had identified 10 passports that had been issued to him with eight different names.</p> \n<p>The coroner would hear that Blum had had a relationship with Monique Cornelius in Luxembourg in the early 1980s. While he was at it, it was submitted, he had taken the identity of her ex-husband Fernand Remakel. A surname which, decades later, Barter would assume.</p> \n<p>Next up in the witness box, Blum’s fourth wife, Diane De Hedervary, said she didn’t know why her husband kept changing his name.</p> \n<p> Wed in 1976, early in their marriage they had lived in Luxembourg and a village near Tunbridge Wells. Prickles ran down my spine. This was where Barter had last made contact with her daughter.</p> \n<p>Diane De Hedervary said he had a “small” extra income trading rare coins.</p> \n<p>Then came the lovers. The witnesses’ stories were strikingly similar.</p> \n<p>The next woman, Ginette Gaffney-Bowen, said she met Frederick De Hedervary through a lonely hearts ad. Soon, she told the inquest, he would suggest that they start a coin trading business together and that she sell her Sydney house and he’d buy an apartment in Paris. She said she gave him her bank card to buy a fax machine for the business and he allegedly took $30,000 from the account. When she refused<strong> </strong>to sell her house, she told the coroner, he tried to blackmail her. “He only wanted money,” she said.</p> \n<p>The final woman, Janet Oldenburgh, told the inquest she was contacted by Rick West after her husband left her. After she was granted sole ownership of her home she said that West asked her to start a fresh life with him on the French Riviera. She told the coroner she had given him power of attorney over her “in case something happens” before they flew to Europe, with West carrying all of Oldenburgh’s identity documents and title deeds in a small tapestry bag.</p> \n<p>They travelled to the same places that Barter’s postcards had come from, before she said West left her with a cousin in Manchester, claiming that he had urgent business elsewhere and then that he’d been robbed, was in hospital and all her documents had been stolen. When Oldenburgh rushed back to her house, after borrowing money from her cousin to return home (she said West was unable to get her a return flight for weeks), she said she found West there – without any sign of injury.</p> \n<p>The court adjourned, and after a six-week break the inquest resumed on 27 April at Byron Bay courthouse.</p> \n<h2>Blum responds</h2> \n<p>Dark-haired, blue-suited and wiry, Casselden had been circling, expertly building a case. Now Blum took the stand. </p> \n<p>Blum shuffled into the court and heaved himself into the witness box. Now 82, breathing through his mouth and speaking with a thick accent, he took long pauses and went off in tangents.</p> \n<p>He had admitted in a police interview that he had an affair with Barter in early 1997 but has always denied he had anything to do with her disappearance.</p> \n<p>And he could not explain why he changed his name so frequently.</p> \n<p>Blum told the court “I can’t give you a proper explanation” why he had gotten a Queensland driver’s licence in the name of his former lover’s ex-husband, Fernand Remakel. He denied most of the allegations by Gaffney-Bowen and Oldenburgh. He denied suggesting that he and Gaffney-Bowen start a coin collecting business together, and of the allegation he had taken $30,000 from her bank account he said “no, didn’t happen”. “I never did,” he said of allegations of blackmail. “I never took advantage of anyone, my God.”</p> \n<p>Blum denied telling Oldenburgh he had been robbed and assaulted. Casselden asked: “Was there any intention of wooing Janet so you could take advantage of her for personal and financial gain?” Blum replied: “I never had any money from her.” Blum had, said Casselden, “the title deeds to her property and power of attorney”. Blum replied: “I never had those in my hands.” Casselden asked: “Do you accept that you misled her in your true intentions?” He replied: “I never promised her anything.” </p> \n<p>He said he had only seen Barter four times between February and June 1997. He had met her through a lonely hearts ad, he admitted. <strong> </strong>As Leydon sat in the courthouse, Blum told the inquest that he had ended it with Barter because he was married and she was “insatiable”.</p> \n<p>He met Barter in February 1997. She had engaged a real estate agent to sell her house on 15 March. He denied suggesting to her that she should sell it and start a new life overseas. On 20 May Barter changed her surname to the same name as his fraudulent driver’s licence. </p> \n<p>The “coincidences”, as Casselden would call them, were piling up.</p> \n<p>Casselden told the inquest<strong> </strong>that Blum and Barter had flown out and then back into the country within days of each other.</p> \n<p>On 14 October he had opened a safe custody envelope at the Commonwealth Bank in Ballina, Casselden told the inquest. That was one day before $80,000 was electronically transferred from Barter’s bank account. There are no bank records of where that money went.</p> \n<p>The safe custody envelope was closed again after 13 days.</p> \n<p>Casselden played a video to the inquest from Blum’s police interview last September. He was being interviewed by Detective Senior Constable Sasha Pinazza from the homicide squad.</p> \n<p>“Did you murder Marion Barter?”</p> \n<p>“Are you kidding?” he replied.</p> \n<p>Pinazza said: “No, I’m not kidding. And I expect you to answer my question seriously. Did you in any way harm Marion Barter?”</p> \n<p>“No,” Blum replied.</p> \n<p>“Did you have any interaction with Marion Barter after she returned to Australia on 2 August in 1997?”</p> \n<p>“No,” Blum said again.</p> \n<p>“Do you know where she is?”</p> \n<p>“No.”</p> \n<p>Casselden pointed out, as he had before, that Barter’s family were in the court. “Is there any information you could provide to assist Barter’s family and the police in locating her?”</p> \n<p>He replied: “I wouldn’t know where she is.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"751470802e462834d0c08fa6607ad9420e7941e2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/751470802e462834d0c08fa6607ad9420e7941e2/0_263_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A picture of schoolteacher Marion Barter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police have recently increased the reward for information on Marion Barter to $500,000.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Maurice Smith/Oculi</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong> </strong>Leydon dropped, her head between her knees, burst into tears and couldn’t stop shaking. “My body was having a complete meltdown like I’ve never experienced before.

She is the kind of person who hits the gym when she is stressed. Strong, capable, patiently answering media questions. But Leydon is profoundly changed by the long fight for justice. “I often wonder why I am not sitting in a corner rocking back and forward.”</p> \n<p>Coroner Teresa O’Sullivan is due to hand down her findings on 30 November. Meanwhile, police continue their investigations and recently increased the reward for information to $500,000. </p> \n<p>Outside the court Leydon said she had done it all for her children. Her daughter, Ella, was by her side through the inquest. She was a little girl when I first met her, but she’s grown into a young woman studying aeronautical and electrical engineering. Leydon worries about the effect this has all had on her family. But, she says, “I can’t rest, it causes my heart to ache every day.”</p> \n<p>She still doesn’t know what happened to her mother, or where she is. Or if she ever will.

Knowing he would receive a bill for this that he could not afford, he did not follow this advice.</p> <p>“Instead I waited all night for my symptoms to subside and called the local GP clinic the next day for an appointment,” he said. “On the call I was told they had recently stopped bulk billing and as a new patient I would need to pay for an appointment upfront ($90) and then would have the rebate refunded into my account, leaving a gap of $15 that I would pay.

They have now decided to stop bulk billing,” she wrote. “I don’t know what I’ll do now – everything is so expensive and I’m very frightened.”</p> <p>Another university student, in Sydney, explained that he had been on the books of a bulk-billing doctor for more than 10 years. He put off non-urgent visits during the pandemic, he said, but when he finally did try to make an appointment recently, the clinic no longer recognised him as an “existing patient” within their system, and was not taking “new” patients.</p> <p>Those in rural and regional areas said they often had to travel long distances to access bulk-billing healthcare. One man from Adelaide Hills in South Australia, who has a back injury and mental illness, and is on jobseeker, said the nearest bulk-billing GP was four towns – 30km – away from where he lived. “So much for living in a decent country,” he said. “I have not felt part of this society for many years now.”</p> <p>“It is difficult enough to find a GP appointment at all, let alone one that bulk bills,” wrote a family of three in rural Victoria. They described having to make a 140km round trip to access a doctor that would bulk bill all members of the family.</p> <p>A mother of three in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales said her GP used to bulk bill children under 15 prior to Covid lockdowns, but now charges nearly $90 for a 15-minute consultation. As three of her children have ongoing conditions, she frequently has to postpone her own medical needs to afford theirs. Even still, there was regularly a three- to four-week wait for appointments – in one instance, she had to take her child to emergency for a prescription for antibiotics as it was not feasible to wait weeks for treatment.</p> <p>Readers in Tasmania, in particular, reported difficulties.</p> <p>“It’s impossible to find a bulk-billing clinic,” wrote Tilly Clota from Hobart, who has endometriosis. “Wait times to book an appointment are generally two weeks as well. Because of this, I recently went to [the local hospital emergency department] for chronic pain in my abdomen and back, as I was worried it might not be endometriosis related, and couldn’t wait two weeks to find out.”</p> <p>Another woman living in regional Tasmania said she travelled an hour each way to access a doctor, and that the clinic often has up to a four-week wait for appointments.</p> <p>A resident of Canberra, where bulk-billing rates are also woefully low, wrote that she pays a $55 gap fee for a standard appointment with her doctor, and is $95 out of pocket for the long appointment required to renew her mental health plan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/creating-a-genuinely-universal-medicare-will-require-politically-difficult-actions\">Australians think they have universal healthcare.

spokesperson said an officer “must have the state of mind required” under the legislation governing search powers, Dr Vicki Sentas, a lecturer at the University of NSW, said the response showed officers “misunderstand the legal purpose of strip-searches”.</p> <p>“Strip searches should never be used as proactive crime prevention to deter future offending,” said Sentas, who in 2019 co-authored a report which found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/22/extraordinary-rise-in-strip-searches-by-nsw-police-fuelled-by-use-of-sniffer-dogs\">the use of drug dogs was

It also shows that Truss has, in the last fortnight, slipped well behind Keir Starmer when voters are asked who would make the best prime minister.</p> <p>Starmer appears to have finally struck a chord with the electorate with his plan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/13/keir-starmer-demands-ban-on-raising-energy-prices\" title=\"\">first revealed in last Sunday’s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/13/keir-starmer-demands-ban-on-raising-energy-prices\" title=\"\">Observer</a></em>, to freeze energy prices this autumn.

The former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke, interviewed in the <em>Observer </em>New Review, dismisses Truss’s tax plans as “nonsense” and says they will stoke inflation at the worst possible time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/21/ken-clarke-tax-cuts-growth-conservative-tory-leadership\">Ken Clarke: ‘The idea that tax cuts will automatically produce growth is nonsense’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour now senses one of those rare political turning points, the potential beginning of the end of its 12-year period in opposition. Its strategists say the last week has been the best since Starmer became leader. A senior member of the Starmer inner circle told the <em>Observer</em> that “this was a week in which political battle lines were drawn – most obviously for the coming weeks but more subtly for the years to come.”</p> <p>The likes of Gove seem to sense the same movement of what John Prescott once described as the political “tectonic plates”. He and Raab appear to believe that Truss has catastrophically failed to grasp both the extent of the cost of living crisis and the dire political consequences for her party of inaction to address it.</p> <p>Gove said yesterday in an article for the <em>Times</em> that “the answer to the cost of living crisis cannot be simply to reject further ‘handouts’ and cut tax” – milder than Raab’s attack on her economic policies as an “electoral suicide note” – but a damning condemnation nonetheless.</p> <p>It is not just Labour that now feels Truss will be good news for the party. The Liberal Democrats have formed a new “Truss attack unit” believing they can repeat a recent string of byelection victories over the Tories in scores of blue wall seats at the next general election, in those constituencies where they are the main challengers to the Conservatives.</p> <p>Notably, in many of these seats – including Raab’s in Esher and Walton where the deputy PM had a majority of just 2,743 over the Lib Dems in 2019 – the incumbent MPs are coming out in support of Sunak, not Truss.</p> <p>The new Lib Dem unit has already begun drafting Truss attack ads for distribution in these areas, focusing on her failure to help people with soaring energy bills and “blue on blue” clashes in the leadership contest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e83903c2130900cab6593dea50c36d3437a78b99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e83903c2130900cab6593dea50c36d3437a78b99/135_0_2429_3036/800.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Gove: ‘The answer to the cost of living crisis cannot be simply to reject further handouts and cut tax.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Lib Dems believe liberal Tories will also dislike Truss’s criticisms of “woke” civil servants, her conversion to the “benefits of Brexit” having been a Remainer at the 2016 referendum, and her new-found green scepticism, including a recently stated dislike of solar panels in rural areas.</p> <p>Parts of the country where the Lib Dem attack unit will focus are the Home Counties – Surrey, Sussex, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Kent – as well as seats further afield in Devon and Shropshire.</p> <p>Organisations backing cooperation between progressive parties to oust the Tories sense that Truss offers real opportunities. Neal Lawson, spokesman for the Win as One campaign, which encourages progressive alliances on the left, said: “Many Tory seats in the blue wall are on a knife edge and a rightwing Truss leadership could push them over the edge. This is specially the case where there are more progressive voters who could well align to back the best placed non-Tory if they shift further to the right.”</p> <p>Among more liberal, often Remainer, one nation Tories who are now backing Sunak there are two remaining sources of hope. The first is that polls of Tory members which have given Truss huge leads over recent days somehow turn out to have been wrong. The Sunak camp seems sincerely to believe that the evidence from the ground shows the race to be far tighter than these polls of members suggest. One cabinet minister backing Sunak said he believed the former chancellor still had a one in three chance of winning and that the trend was clearly in Sunak’s direction.</p> <p>The other hope is that if Truss does win, she will dump much of the agenda outlined in her campaign, and cast aside the rightwing supporters she is said to be considering appointing to high positions.</p> <p>A former cabinet minister who is backing Sunak said the test would be what Truss does when she gets into Downing Street, not what she has said on the campaign trail. “If she carries on with full-on culture wars and the anti-woke stuff, as well as the economic stuff, she will just come across as Boris without the charm,” he said. “Then she will turn off people in the blue wall.

Proposed cuts to national insurance would favour the wealthy, and changes to corporation tax apply to big businesses, not small entrepreneurs.</p> <p>“I cannot see how safeguarding the stock options of FTSE 100 executives should ever take precedence over supporting the poorest in our society, but at a time of want it cannot be the right priority.”</p> <p>Another former Cabinet colleague of Gove and Truss, who is backing Sunak, said: “If Liz does not change tack and back a real economic package that does more to help those in need, I think we will be in big trouble.

By the end of the first week, the country had already settled into a new reality in which roads were dotted with checkpoints run by locals carrying whatever arms they could get their hands on, mayors strutted around their towns in body armour organising the defence, and families endured separation from their loved ones, as millions of women and children rushed to safety abroad.</p> <p>Split-second decisions could mean life or death. People whose friends had mocked them in previous weeks for hoarding food or making escape plans were now hailed as prophets. Countless families decided to leave Kyiv for the peaceful commuter towns to its west, hoping to sit out the expected attack on the city there, only to find themselves subjected to a month of terror from occupying forces, while the centre of the capital remained relatively unscathed.</p> <p>In the southern city of Mariupol, those who decided to leave in the first days, when it was still possible, were able to find safety in other parts of Ukraine or abroad.

The resistance began with Zelenskiy and his team, who stayed in Kyiv instead of fleeing, and was replicated at many levels of society.</p> <p>“The Kremlin really hoped that we would be disoriented and would run away,” said deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk, who had been called several days before the invasion by the British ambassador <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/stay-go-ukrainian-mayors-agonising-choice-russia-invaded\" title=\"\">and advised to flee</a> the capital.

Trukhanov was indicative of a change among many Ukrainian officials in the south and east of the country, who had previously been perceived as pro-Russian, but now came down firmly on the side of Kyiv.</p> <p>“They didn’t expect that there would be barricades in Odesa, and that people wouldn’t welcome them with bread and salt, that Kharkiv would fight, that Chernihiv would fight,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf0240fdd493419b347de4c62cb2b254d3715f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf0240fdd493419b347de4c62cb2b254d3715f6/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukrainian refugees arrive from their homeland at Zahonyi railway station close to the Hungarian-Ukrainian border on 27 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukrainian refugees arrive from their homeland at Zahonyi railway station close to the Hungarian-Ukrainian border on 27 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the nearby Kherson region, where the Russian army was able to roll in without much military resistance during the first few days of the war, it is clear that some security officials collaborated with the Russians, and a number of politicians have agreed to work for Kremlin-run administrations.</p> <p>But locals report that the Russians are now struggling to fill mid-level positions, and face a strong underground opposition from among the majority of locals who remain loyal to Ukraine.</p> <p>Back in February, the stated goal of the “special military operation”, as the Kremlin calls it, was that it was all about protecting the Russian-speaking populations of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and the meaningless goal of “denazification” of the country.</p> <p>“They said they are going to free us from Nazis, I said very good, but during 33 years of living in Melitopol I never met one,” said Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol, who was kidnapped and interrogated for several days before being released in a prisoner swap and sent to Kyiv-controlled territory.</p> <p>At other times, Kremlin talking heads have said the conflict is about Nato, and the encroachment of the military alliance on Russia’s borders.</p> <p>As the Russian advance on Kyiv stalled, Putin’s hopes of a swift operation that would install a new pro-Russian government in Kyiv, and keep Ukraine as a nominally independent state but inside Moscow’s orbit, were exposed as being based on a total misunderstanding of how Ukraine has changed in recent years.</p> <p>That led to a change in rhetoric. Now, Russian politicians talk in the language of a naked land grab, of creating a “buffer” in Ukraine between Moscow and the west. The disdain for Ukrainian people, language and culture, always lurking in the background, has come more to the fore.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1af6a4b9a55b032469ca4221db811b02c7a3ab48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1af6a4b9a55b032469ca4221db811b02c7a3ab48/0_244_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy addresses the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos by video link in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy addresses the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos by video link in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This mixed messaging could be seen in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/children-back-in-school-after-cleanup-in-traumatised-ukrainian-village\" title=\"\">school building in Novyi Bykiv</a>, east of Kyiv, where a Russian Buk missile battalion was based for a month at the beginning of the war. After the withdrawal, the soldiers’ scrawled chalk messages on the blackboards showed the muddle of sentiments the Russians had experienced: some were apologetic, others abusive. In the classrooms, they had painted over the faces of Ukrainian historical and literary figures, a literal manifestation of the desire to erase Ukrainian culture.</p> <p>Some of the troops appeared confused and tormented by their role as occupiers. “Listen, I’m sorry. We didn’t know it would be like this,” one tearful soldier told a woman whose beauty salon he was using as a base, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/barbarians-russian-troops-leave-grisly-mark-on-ukraine-town-of-trostianets?fbclid=IwAR1Lk52bk9CHIfA-xXYTCKzLT5GPwt5SBOBpQgw3uQRD2_5yoyDT69KFyLI\" title=\"\">during the occupation </a>of the town of Trostianets.</p> <p>But this confusion quickly turned to anger and hatred when the Russians were faced with a surprisingly fierce Ukrainian counter-attack and felt the anger of the local populations, instead of the gratitude they had been told to expect.</p> <p>Throughout the occupied areas around Kyiv, Russian soldiers committed murder and other war crimes. There was widespread looting. When news of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/dozens-bucha-civilians-killed-flechettes-metal-darts-russian-artillery\" title=\"\">horrors in Bucha</a> and elsewhere began to seep out at the end of March, it only hardened Ukrainian resolve, and has left psychological wounds that are likely to fester for generations.</p> <p>In Russia, initial horror at the invasion among political and business elites was followed by a recognition that it had fundamentally changed the dynamic between Russia and the west. Faced with a stark choice, most have chosen to stay quiet or to rebrand themselves as patriots.</p> <p>“With the sanctions, people realise they have no chance of a life in the west any more, so they’re all rallying around the flag,” said one Kremlin-connected source.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1a6b67e13268b252fbab262ea6460d4d6d7bd12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1a6b67e13268b252fbab262ea6460d4d6d7bd12/0_0_3500_2636/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wounded Ukrainian serviceman after a battle with Russian troops and Russia-backed separatists in Luhansk region in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wounded Ukrainian serviceman after a battle with Russian troops and Russia-backed separatists in Luhansk region in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lower down the chain, many Russians have left the country, either for political reasons or because sanctions made their businesses impossible. Just as in the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution a century earlier, cities close to Russia’s borders have filled up with tens of thousands of Russian exiles.</p> <p>Riga, the capital of Latvia, has become the hub for independent journalists who have been criminalised and banned from working in Russia; Yerevan in Armenia is where thousands of tech professionals have travelled and now call home. Tbilisi in Georgia, the Turkish city of Istanbul, the Serbian capital Belgrade and Berlin all have new Russian exile communities.</p> <p>On occasion, the insistence by Russian exiles that they, too, are victims has caused friction with the larger communities of Ukrainian refugees forced to flee the invasion.</p> <p>Six months in, how it all ends is a question that is harder than ever to answer. In the early weeks of the war, the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich travelled to Kyiv on a Kremlin-sanctioned mission to broker peace talks between Zelenskiy and Putin.</p> <p>In March, Abramovich felt he might be close to achieving something that could serve as a workable template for talks between the two leaders, according to those briefed on the discussions, but nothing came of it.

Two minutes later, Britain’s most talented young athlete finally found her pot of gold.</p> \n<p>Victory came with a familiar display of class and authority, the 20-year-old from Wigan striding clear with 250m to go before quickly putting the race to bed. In truth, European gold was hers long before she eased up to win in 1min 59.04sec, half a second clear of France’s Rénelle Lamote. Afterwards Hodgkinson was asked whether it was easy as it appeared. “I’m glad it looked like that,” she said, which was her polite way of saying yes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/20/joe-fraser-leads-gb-gymnastics-team-to-dominant-european-gold\">Joe Fraser leads GB gymnastics team to dominant European gold</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This was another fine night for Britain at these championships, with the men’s 4x400m relay team taking gold, the women bronze, and Lizzie Bird coming third in the 3,000m steeplechase. But naturally the focus was on Hodgkinson, who won the first outdoor title of her career after two near misses in the last month.</p> \n<p>The first had come at the world championships, when she lost to the brilliant American Athing Mu by 0.08sec. The second at the Commonwealth Games when Mary Moraa rope-a-doped her on the final lap. The third time, though, proved a charm. “I refused to walk away today without gold,” she said, breaking out into the widest of smiles.”</p> \n<p>What also pleased Hodgkinson was that she altered her tactics, choosing instead to see how the race developed in front of her. “I wanted to do something a little bit different,” she said. “I think it might have been a bit obvious if I’d gone to the front like I have been doing all year. The last 120m I went for it and hopefully it was enough.”</p> \n<p>As she admitted afterwards, she and her coach Trevor Painter had chatted about seven potential scenarios. “We’ll discuss A, B, C, D, E, F, G options of what could happen,” she said. “The last thing he said to me was: ‘you’ll know what to do’. Ultimately the 800m changes so much so you’ve got to be able to make decisions on the spot.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1103b91d1f625479785dc7a7e3f638d1393d1105\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1103b91d1f625479785dc7a7e3f638d1393d1105/0_124_3707_2225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gold medalists Matt Hudson-Smith, Lewis Davey, Joe Brier, Alex Haydock-Wilson, Charles Dobson and Rio Mitcham on the podium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gold medalists Matt Hudson-Smith, Lewis Davey, Joe Brier, Alex Haydock-Wilson, Charles Dobson and Rio Mitcham on the podium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maja Hitij/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And so she did. For a while it looked as if Jemma Reekie, who has battled glandular fever, might chase her home – but she faded badly to slip to fifth. The third Briton in the race, Alex Bell, was sixth.</p> \n<p>“It’s extra special because my parents are here, which is really nice,” said Hodgkinson. “I’m just happy to finally be on top of the podium.”</p> \n<p>And what an incredible 18 months it has been for Hodgkinson, who first advertised her talent in March 2021 when, just four days after her 19th birthday, she won the European Indoor title.</p> \n<p>That made her the youngest British winner in the event for more than 50 years. Yet she barely paused for breath before smashing Kelly Holmes’s national record, winning Olympic, world and Commonwealth silver, and then taking her first major outdoor title here in Munich.</p> \n<p>This was a night that was not only about her speed, but her guts too. Hodgkinson had admitted sleeping all the time after such a tough season. Yet she still had enough in the tank to beat the best in Europe – and in style too.</p> \n<p>“The last two years I’ve got four major outdoor medals so I really can’t complain,” she said, before revealing she wasn’t entirely satisfied. “I was 0.08 away from being the world champion so that will play on my mind for the next year.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hodgkinson shook her head, however, when asked whether she would be hitting Munich to celebrate. “No, I’m going to bed,” she replied. “I’m so tired. After Zurich I’m going to go on holiday and treat myself.”</p> \n<p>Instead, she said, her parents would be celebrating on her behalf. “They don’t get to see me too often. They didn’t come to Eugene, it was just too expensive, but they’ll be on the wine for me tonight.”</p> \n<p>Britain’s 4x400m men’s team of Matt Hudson-Smith, Charlie Dobson, Lewis Davey and Alex Haydock-Wilson looked the clear favourites on paper – however they only just clung on to win gold in 2min 59.35sec, ahead of Belgium and France.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Britain’s women’s team of Victoria Ohuruogu, Ama Pipi, Jodie Williams and Nicole Yeargin finished with bronze behind the Netherlands and Poland. Victory for the Dutch also earned Femke Bol her third gold medal – making her without doubt the athlete of these championships.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, Lizzie Bird just about held on to take bronze behind Albania’s Luiza Gega, who won in a championship record 9min 11.31sec. Sweden’s Mondo Duplantis also posted a championship record as he jumped 6.06m to take gold in the pole vault competition, which was held in difficult conditions. Given the cold weather, Dulplantis wisely decided not to celebrate by attempting another world record.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/20/emily-wilson-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T19:00:47Z","webTitle":"Emily Wilson review – a portrait of the artist as an X Factor wannabe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/20/emily-wilson-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/20/emily-wilson-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"Emily Wilson review – a portrait of the artist as an X Factor wannabe","trailText":"Wilson relives her tumultuous turn as a teenage talent show contestant armed with laughter and song, topped with a touching tribute to her plucky younger self","byline":"Brian Logan","body":"<p>‘Why did I? Oh God, why did I?” We can all get embarrassed recalling our adolescent lives: Emily Wilson sings this great big cringe of a song to a backdrop of videos, images and social media output immortalising the naive enthusiasms of her teenage self. But worse, far worse, is to come. Wilson’s show is about starring on The X Factor in the US when she was 15. It did not go well. Then it did. Then it didn’t again. Teenage Emily was wrung out and tossed aside. Eleven years on, she’s here to face down those demons, armed only with archive footage, laughter and song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"308d06b420b30306f606bf87d1f234dfce1e9d18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/308d06b420b30306f606bf87d1f234dfce1e9d18/85_0_2818_3523/800.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Wilson: Fixed\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Wilson: Fixed</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s hard to imagine anyone not being gripped by Wilson’s tale, combining as it does several modern obsessions – celebrity, abusive behaviour, kids on social media – and adding a dash of redemption for good measure. “Growing up, all I ever wanted was to be famous,” says Wilson, which makes her easy prey when Simon Cowell’s star-making juggernaut rolls into her New Jersey town. With best friend Austin (together they are AusEm – geddit?), Wilson graduates via auditions and “boot camp” to The X Factor proper. But not before she’s been humiliated on national TV and forced to sunder her singing duo in favour of a naffer outfit entirely.</p> <p>To anyone still in these TV shows’ thrall, Wilson offers a useful corrective. On this evidence, they’re rigged, and reckless with the real lives of the wannabes they dazzle then discard. Wilson emerges deeply scarred, and you can see why – at least on the strength of her first trial by Cowell and co, which is horrifying. (She doesn’t acknowledge as much, but her second rejection is much less brutal.) Intertwining her X Factor tale with contemporary diary entries (all crushes, prayers and inherited Republican prejudice), Wilson shows us the soil in which personal criticism from her celebrity judges took such deep root.</p> <p>Some might find Wilson’s ending to this tale of dreams dashed, as the grownup pays direct tribute to her plucky teenage self, a little schmaltzy. But it pierced my sentimental heart.

Rico Lewis, the young substitute who came on in the 82nd minute, managed 50% more touches than Haaland. Which means many things but perhaps most of all suggests just how radical a tactical change City are undergoing this season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/manchester-united-clearout-needed-brentford-premier-league\">A Manchester United clearout is needed. None of the parts fit together | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, though, it’s perhaps worth looking at why Haaland touched the ball so infrequently in that specific game. In those eight touches, Haaland managed two shots, one of them on target, and a key pass (his only other pass was the kick-off at the beginning of the second half).</p> <p>His long period without the ball came when the game was in effect over and City were happy controlling the ball. Even leaving aside his indirect involvement – the players he drew away, the space he created – Haaland had a clear and positive direct involvement in the play when City were attacking.</p> <p>His previous two games for City, when he competed the full match, had been different. Against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/liverpool-manchester-city-community-shield-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool in the Community Shield</a> he had 16 touches but managed three shots, one of them on target, and two key passes. In the Premier League opener <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/07/west-ham-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against West Ham</a> he had 32 touches, including five shots, yielding two goals (one a penalty); that was far more similar to his average touches per game at RB Salzburg and Borussia Dortmund.</p> <p>These are very early days but it seems unlikely the Liverpool and Bournemouth games will prove typical. Against Liverpool, although some of the reaction was probably exaggerated, neither Haaland nor City played well. Although he fluffed two decent chances, the bigger issue appeared to be that he was making runs and that the midfielders, conditioned to Pep Guardiola’s patient buildup, were not finding him. By West Ham that had changed, although there may not be many opportunities to make that sort of run behind the defensive line against teams who sit deep against City.</p> <p>Against Bournemouth, the issue in part was that there was little space for Haaland, with a narrow back three and two holding midfielders playing just in front of him – although even then, by drawing defenders to him, he was opening up the possibility of space in wider areas.</p> <p>More significant for City, though, was how close to Haaland Ilkay Gündogan ended up playing – surely a legacy of a team used to playing with a false 9, so the midfielders have to push into the space that would usually be occupied by the striker. It didn’t matter in a game City won comfortably, but against a higher level of opponent it may.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"211ee1780072b5e7741480cf9dfea63b8278c120\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/211ee1780072b5e7741480cf9dfea63b8278c120/0_68_4868_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola talks to Erling Haaland during Manchester City’s 4-0 win against Bournemouth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola talks to Erling Haaland during Manchester City’s 4-0 win against Bournemouth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Cameron/Manchester City FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But even if those issues are resolved, and even if Haaland will not come up that frequently against teams who defend as Bournemouth did, this does represent a significant shift of approach for Guardiola. He has habitually had his centre-forward operate almost as a midfielder – indeed, has often used a midfielder in the role – getting on the ball, playing a lot of passes, facilitating the remorseless skeins of possession.</p> <p>To move away from that towards a more orthodox central striker who wants the ball played quickly in front of him, who can play well while barely touching the ball, represents a major departure. Even if the 32 touches against West Ham turns out to be the norm, that is still roughly 30% less than Sergio Agüero averaged per game in his time under Guardiola and there was always the sense Guardiola wanted Agüero more involved in general play.</p> <p>So why would Guardiola take an attacking formula that had made City top scorers in the Premier League for the past five seasons and radically change it? Perhaps it’s simply that the Premier League no longer represents success for City: more significant are the repeated near-misses in the Champions League, the failures to finish off Real Madrid, Chelsea, Lyon and Tottenham despite spells in those ties when City were on top; perhaps, for all the complexity of Guardiola’s positional play, there are times when football is as simple as needing somebody who can put the ball in the net.</p> <p>But there is perhaps a broader trend here. Liverpool have signed Darwin Núñez, while Arsenal have begun using Gabriel Jesus as a fairly orthodox 9. It’s too early to be definitive, and to an extent the issue may be the characteristics of a small group of leading players, but it could be there has been a recognition that after years of diversifying the attack and focusing on the press, there is still value in more old-fashioned centre-forward virtues.</p> <p>For Guardiola to countenance such a major shift at this stage of his career is remarkable and suggests just how open he remains to new ideas, how conscious he is of the danger of stagnation and the need for innovation.</p> <p>This is the basis of the theory of development laid out by the advertising executive Alex Faickney Osborn in his 1948 book <em>Your Creative Power</em>. “The whole theory of creative tension,” he said, “rests upon the belief that in every respect and in every relation we find two elements which we cannot divorce; first, the principle of change; second, the principle of stability. The first principle is basic to our idea of evolution, growth, and progress. Without it, the world could not exist. The second principle is basic to our idea of balance and permanence.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7267f8e954d5c25e49b37b33b36c257cc40eec62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7267f8e954d5c25e49b37b33b36c257cc40eec62/0_0_4104_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rare touch for Haaland against Bournemouth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rare touch for Haaland against Bournemouth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in one way the signing of Haaland is a return to old principles – one prefigured, perhaps, by the signing of a dribbler in Jack Grealish the previous summer. Guardiola’s greatest achievement was at Barcelona, where the finely tuned system was challenged and augmented by the individual talents of Lionel Messi.</p> <p>Structure is vital in football, and nobody wins anything with anarchy, but equally it may be that a systematised approach leads to a reliance on order, such that a team struggle to respond in adversity. It may be the sparks of true brilliance are generated by that tension between seeming opposites, between the old and the new, between a strict system and anarchic individualism.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2022/aug/20/bournemouth-v-arsenal-premier-league-live-score-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T18:58:03Z","webTitle":"Bournemouth 0-3 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/aug/20/bournemouth-v-arsenal-premier-league-live-score-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2022/aug/20/bournemouth-v-arsenal-premier-league-live-score-updates","fields":{"headline":"Bournemouth 0-3 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened","trailText":"<strong>Minute-by-minute report: </strong>Martin Odegaard scored twice and William Saliba opened his account in fine style as Arsenal completely outclassed their hosts","byline":"Barry Glendenning","body":"<div id=\"block-63012f688f081780606cc259\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T19:02:43.025Z\">8.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">More from Mikel Arteta ...</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>“We started the game really well,” he tells Sky Sports. “We were dominant, precise.

A confidence, a pizazz absent for years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/20/gabriel-jesus-has-sparked-arsenals-wining-mentality-claims-mikel-arteta\">Gabriel Jesus has sparked Arsenal’s ‘wining mentality’, claims Mikel Arteta</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The visitors’ new captain, Martin Ødegaard, set them on their way with a brace inside a dozen minutes, William Saliba adding second-half gloss. Bournemouth were simply dismantled, a south-coast battering that they did not have the defences to withstand.</p> <p>“Trust the process,” Mikel Arteta had said. He kept saying it. First, they laughed, then they got angry. Not any more. No one is suggesting Arsenal will win the title. They will not win the title. There will be blips, embarrassing moments. But implosions appear unlikely. And the bond between players and supporters is strong, furthered perhaps by allowing camera access to football’s intimate areas last season. Yes, trust the process.</p> <p>Arsenal’s league position at this stage, though, is irrelevant to Arteta. “It’s very difficult to come here and win 3-0,” he said. “I’m really pleased, but at the same time we have to look at ourselves; there are many areas where we can still get much better.”</p> <p>This ground hosted Arteta’s first match as Arsenal manager back in December 2019. He has since slowly sucked the gold-plated poison out of the club, meaning just Bukayo Saka and Granit Xhaka remain as starters.</p> <p>And this new cohesion meant that, for the first time since the Invincibles of 2003-04, Arsenal fielded the same XI for their opening three league games.</p> <p>Their followers were buoyant even before kick-off. A coastal trip in the sunshine. What could go wrong? Well, they have been stung before. Yet they need not have worried; Bournemouth were, from the moment Rockin’ All Over the World blared out, compliant hosts.</p> <p>Away euphoria came within minutes, Ødegaard was the scorer but it was all about Gabriel Jesus. Among three changes made by Bournemouth was an appearance by Marcos Senesi, a summer acquisition from Feyenoord. His first act, on his full debut, was to be powered off the ball by Jesus, who took a perfect touch and jinked past Jefferson Lerma.</p> <p>A clever reverse pass put Gabriel Martinelli in down the left and, while Mark Travers made a smart save with his legs, Ødegaard had a tap-in. Jesus though, was the mobbed man. Senesi was replaced at the break; welcome to the Premier League</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"85248fc13fa1f025a43ec7d4e5d8d26511457c49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85248fc13fa1f025a43ec7d4e5d8d26511457c49/0_147_3138_1882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Ødegaard opens the scoring\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Ødegaard opens the scoring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Six minutes later the lead doubled. Saka found an overlapping Ben White, and the pullback was controlled by Jesus near the penalty spot. Before Jesus could strike, Ødegaard and his bright yellow footwear arrived to finish emphatically.</p> <p>VAR double-checked White had not mistimed his run, the goal stood and Arsenal settled into a rhythmic dominance. Ødegaard was the tempo setter, Martinelli and Jesus electrically charged.</p> <p>When Bournemouth were allowed to show glimpses of adventure, it was snuffed out. Much has been made of Oleksandr Zinchenko’s role as an inverted full-back and how it has allowed Xhaka a new freedom. But he is also a fine defender. Marcus Tavernier’s attempt to break was stopped with such ease, it would have been no surprise if Zinchenko had shrugged his shoulders afterwards.</p> <p>The third goal vacuumed any remaining air from Bournemouth. A short free-kick saw Martinelli dance down the right. His deep cross found Xhaka, who teed up Saliba. A glorious first-time, left-footed hit from the edge of the area flew past Travers. A would-be exquisite fourth by Jesus was ruled out by VAR for offside.</p> <p>Perhaps it is a tad unfair to judge Bournemouth on games like this. They won promotion under Scott Parker with a possession-based, controlled style. Exactly what they were on the wrong end of from Arsenal.</p> <p>Their first half was a non-event, but the hosts were a little brighter after a tactical tweak at the break. However by the time Kieffer Moore finally called Aaron Ramsdale into action – a towering header tipped wide – almost 80 minutes had passed. This was Ramsdale’s first return to Bournemouth since joining Arsenal via Sheffield United. With warm applause from all sides it must have felt like a testimonial at times.</p> <p>Parker’s post-match disappointment was clear. “While we could never get a foothold in the game, and never cause or pose Arsenal any sort of problem, our general demeanour was pretty poor,” he said. “I was disappointed immensely with that.”</p> <p>For all the concern Bournemouth fans would have felt, it was matched by the joy of Arsenal supporters. They spent 20 minutes of the opening period serenading Saliba with his name inserted into 1950s hit Tequila. It got a second airing after the final whistle, and, according to Arteta, permeated into the dressing room.</p> <p>Away supporters merrily breezed through their back catalogue of chants, even bringing out some new ones; Xhaka probably never thought he would hear the day his name would ring out joyously. He has earned it.</p> <p>Disappearing down the tunnel in solitude, Arteta even afforded himself a smile. He did not once turn around. He did not need to. He could hear the adulation loud and clear.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/20/libraries-and-museums-to-be-warm-havens-for-people-struggling-with-energy-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T18:31:28Z","webTitle":"Libraries and museums to be ‘warm havens’ for people struggling with energy bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/20/libraries-and-museums-to-be-warm-havens-for-people-struggling-with-energy-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/20/libraries-and-museums-to-be-warm-havens-for-people-struggling-with-energy-bills","fields":{"headline":"Libraries and museums to be ‘warm havens’ for people struggling with energy bills","trailText":"Libraries and museums are asking ministers for funding to cope with a rise in the number of visitors seeking shelter","byline":"Rebecca Brahde, Jon Ungoed-Thomas, Tom Wall and Anna Fazackerley","body":"<p>Britain’s libraries and museums are preparing to act as warm havens for people unable to afford to heat their homes in the winter months.</p> <p>Ministers are being called on to provide urgent new funding so public buildings can cope with a surge in visitors during the coldest months.</p> <p>The buildings will be part of a network across the country which will provide warm shelter to help reduce excess winter deaths linked to freezing conditions.</p> <p>The call for support to ensure key public buildings can keep their doors open comes as organisations across the country are being confronted with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/09/uk-energy-bills-forecast-to-hit-4266-from-january\" title=\"\">vast increases in energy bills</a>. One care homes group told the <em>Observer </em>that its annual energy bills are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/21/we-are-being-abandoned-when-the-energy-bill-goes-up-by-100000-a-day\">rising from £1.5m a year to £7.7m</a>.</p> <p>Alistair Brown, policy manager at the Museums Association, representing the museum sector, said: “Museums will be relied upon to respond to this crisis, but many will be struggling to heat their own spaces.</p> <p>“People are beginning to understand the scale of the crisis and we don’t want to reduce the hours that museums are open.”</p> <p>Catalyst Science Discovery Centre and Museum in Widnes, Cheshire, said last week that the quote for renewing its annual gas contract had risen from £9,700 to £54,362.</p> <p>Isobel Hunter, chief executive of Libraries Connected, which represents the public library sector, said: “Central government should provide councils with additional funding this winter to meet rising energy costs, which would help ensure libraries stay open as vital warm refuges for their communities.”</p> <p>Paul Drumm, of GLL, a charitable social enterprise that operates libraries in Greenwich in south-east London, said the borough’s libraries had already spent £28,000 on new seats and other furniture to prepare for the increase in visitors during the winter months.</p> <p>He said: “We are acutely aware of the huge impact that the energy crisis will have on many living within the local community. We will be promoting our libraries as designated ‘warm spaces’ for those who can’t afford to heat their homes.”</p> <p>The libraries and museums will be part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/uk-should-mobilise-army-of-volunteers-to-transform-energy-landscape\" title=\"\">national network of warm hubs </a>provided by local councils, community groups and charities. South Cambridgeshire district council issued a tender earlier this month for a contract to deliver “a series of warm hubs from community buildings” to support those at risk from the cold.</p> <p>Meanwhile Care England, which represents 4,500 care services, said operators were facing up to 500% increases in energy costs, with some considering reducing the number of elderly people they take from hospital wards or shutting their care homes in order to survive.</p> <p>“Care services across the country will have to close this winter unless the government takes immediate action. Some providers just won’t be able to go on – they will collapse,” said Professor Martin Green, chief executive of Care England. “There is no cap on energy costs for care homes and elderly care home residents do not get any rebate from the government.”</p> <p>Analysis by the consultancy BoxPower shows that care homes were paying energy costs equivalent to £700 per bed every year. But this month homes are being quoted the equivalent of £4,027 per bed for those wishing to purchase energy from October. This is an increase of around 437% in energy cost per bed in a 12-month period.</p> <p>Brunelcare, which provides sheltered housing to 1,400 people and runs seven care homes in Bristol and Somerset, was forced this month to sign a new annual energy contract worth £7.7m because prices were rising by £100,000 a day. The charity was paying around £1.5m a year until last year.</p> <p>“We’re in an absolutely impossible situation,” said Oona Goldsworthy, the chief executive of Brunelcare. “I’ve had one of the worst weeks ever and I’ve been through Covid so I know what hard times are like. We are being completely abandoned again.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said it had made £3.7bn of additional funding available to local authorities, which they can spend on adult social care. “No national government can control the global factors pushing up the price of energy, but we will continue to support businesses, including care homes, in navigating the months ahead,” a spokesperson said.</p> <p>Headteachers say they are faced with a “double whammy” of spiralling energy bills and an increased 5% pay rise for teachers. An executive headteacher in a multi-academy trust, who oversees a number of inner city secondary schools and asked not to be named, said: “I’m already at the bare bones of support staff. We won’t replace any staff as they leave.” His schools are already rolling two classes of children together to cover temporary staff gaps.</p> <p>Dan Morrow, chief executive of the Dartmoor multi-academy trust in Devon, said it was now a “race to the bottom” for schools, and the effects on children “will be profound for generations”. His trust needs to find an extra £800,000 for utility bills this year, and £900,000 for pay increases.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/20/russia-ukraine-war-putin-agrees-to-allow-inspectors-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T18:09:48Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: explosion reported in Crimea as UK says attacks behind Russian lines hitting logistics – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/20/russia-ukraine-war-putin-agrees-to-allow-inspectors-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/20/russia-ukraine-war-putin-agrees-to-allow-inspectors-at-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: explosion reported in Crimea as UK says attacks behind Russian lines hitting logistics – as it happened","trailText":"UK Ministry of Defence say ‘increasingly frequent’ attacks behind the front line are also affecting air basing","byline":"Nadeem Badshah (now) and Tobi Thomas (earlier)","body":"<div id=\"block-630123338f081780606cc22a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T18:09:48.220Z\">7.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>We are closing this blog now.

But the planned shipment, one of several the U.N. agency that fights hunger is pursuing, is more than six times the amount of grain that the first WFP-arranged ship from Ukraine is now carrying toward people in the Horn of Africa at risk of starvation.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Beasley spoke Friday from northern Kenya, which is deep in a drought that is withering the Horn of Africa region. He sat under a thorn tree among local women who told the AP that the last time it rained was in 2019.<br>Their bone-dry communities face yet another failed rainy season within weeks that could tip parts of the region, especially neighbouring Somalia, into famine. Already, thousands of people have died. The World Food </em><em>Programme says 22 million people are hungry.</em></p> \n   <p><em>“I think there’s a high probability we’ll have a declaration of famine” in the coming weeks, Beasley said.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The keenly awaited first aid ship from Ukraine is carrying 23,000 metric tons of grain, enough to feed 1.5 million people on full rations for a month, Beasley said. It is expected to dock in Djibouti on Aug. 26 or 27, and the wheat is supposed to be shipped overland to northern Ethiopia, where millions of people in the Tigray, Afar and Amhara regions have faced not only drought but deadly conflict.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Ukraine was the source of half the grain that WFP bought last year to feed 130 million hungry people. Russia and Ukraine signed agreements with the U.N. and the Turkish government last month to enable exports of Ukrainian grain for the first time since Russia’s invasion in February.</em></p> \n   <p><em>But the slow reopening of Ukraine’s ports and the cautious movement of cargo ships across the mined Black Sea won’t solve the global food security crisis, Beasley said.

As it approaches 9.30am in Kyiv, here is a summary of the latest developments on this Saturday 20 August 2022.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has agreed to inspectors visiting the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. </strong>According to the office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Russian leader had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> to the site, after Putin himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. The office said Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The UN secretary general has asked Russia not take the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant off grid. </strong>António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied facility not be cut off from Ukraine’s electrical grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow was planning to do so, saying the plant used “Ukrainian electricity”.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Western officials say there are growing concerns over concerns over water cooling at the Zaporizhzhia plant.</strong> Its existing reactor cooling system is critical to the safety of the site and relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation, but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from Ukraine’s grid.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>More than half of Russia Black Sea naval aviation has been knocked out</strong>, according to a western official in Ukraine.<strong> </strong>The Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea, western officials have said. However, overall “combat stasis” remains.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The US has announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine,</strong> including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. The US has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia’s media watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest.</strong> Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites – including Google – that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined the US-based live streaming service Twitch 2 million roubles ($34,000) and messenger service Telegram 11 million roubles for violating military censorship laws.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>A former Russian mayor has been appointed head of Russian-occupied Kharkiv, </strong>Ukraine’s second-largest city. It is the latest in a string of such appointments, which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory.</p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s economy minister has said the country’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year. </strong>Hit by Russia’s 24 February invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p>The Kyiv Independent reported that <strong>rescuers are searching for people and bodies </strong>under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on Kharkiv.<br></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>The Chinese and Russian leaders, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November</strong>, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News.<strong> </strong>“Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” he said. As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.<strong><br></strong></p></li> \n   <li><p><strong>Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled cities since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</strong>, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian frontline, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-20T17:42:40.215Z\">at 6.42pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/20/crimeas-civilians-sound-alarm-after-ukrainian-drone-hits-russian-fleet-hq","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T18:06:47Z","webTitle":"Crimea’s civilians sound alarm after Ukrainian drone hits Russian fleet HQ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/crimeas-civilians-sound-alarm-after-ukrainian-drone-hits-russian-fleet-hq","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/20/crimeas-civilians-sound-alarm-after-ukrainian-drone-hits-russian-fleet-hq","fields":{"headline":"Crimea’s civilians sound alarm after Ukrainian drone hits Russian fleet HQ","trailText":"Worried locals lambast Sevastopol’s governor after attack on region once regarded as impregnable","byline":"Emma Graham-Harrison in Kyiv","body":"<p>A Ukrainian drone hit the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea fleet in Crimea this weekend, the latest assault on a region Moscow once considered an impregnable fortress.</p> \n<p>Plumes of smoke were seen rising from the Sevastopol military base on Saturday morning, and city residents were urged to stay at home immediately after the strike, the latest in a string of high-profile attacks on sensitive targets there and inside Russia.</p> \n<p>The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, said there were no casualties, and initially claimed the drone flew into the airbase’s roof after troops stationed there were not able to shoot it down. He later said soldiers had been able to target the drone, and that it had fallen onto the airbase roof after being hit. “Clarification: the drone was hit...right above the fleet headquarters. It fell on the roof and caught fire. The attack failed. Well done boys,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>Previous attacks in Crimea, including one earlier this month on the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/russian-warplanes-destroyed-in-crimea-saky-airbase-attack-satellite-images-show\" title=\"\"> Saky airbase</a> that sent fireballs into the sky and destroyed nine or more warplanes, prompted many residents to flee the peninsula.</p> \n<p>Worried locals responded to Razvozhaev by asking how a drone had slipped through air defences that at the start of the war were considered among the most sophisticated in the world. “Was our air defence system on a lunch break?” asked one. “When will you finally close the city?” asked another, suggesting the attacks were the work of pro-Ukraine partisans in the peninsula. “We fought harder against the coronavirus! There were checkposts everywhere then, now anyone and everyone enters!!!!”</p> \n<p>Another wondered if more attacks were coming. Wednesday 24 August is Ukraine’s independence day, and will also mark six months since Russia’s invasion.</p> \n<p>Many in the country are worried that Moscow may be preparing some kind of major attack that day, but residents in Crimea are also apparently concerned that Ukraine wants to mark its successful resistance.</p> \n<p>“They have Independence Day on the 24th, maybe they are preparing something? And the [drone] is just to divert attention from the main thing.”</p> \n<p>The attacks came a day after the US announced a $775m arms package for Ukraine including drones, armoured vehicles and artillery.</p> \n<p>Government officials have repeatedly said that while western weapons allowed the country to save Kyiv, and hold off Russia in other areas, they are still woefully short of the arms needed to decisively defeat Russia.</p> \n<p>Promised supplies are also arriving slowly. Last week a senior source estimated only 10% of arms promised by the west had reached Ukraine. And on Saturday presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak warned Moscow was trying to create a “reputation crisis” for Ukraine that would slow the flow of western arms.</p> \n<p>Ukrainian troops are being pounded by weapons in the south and in the east, where Russian forces are still slowly advancing through a wasteland of cities shelled into ruin before they are captured.</p> \n<p>On Saturday they stepped up fighting to seize Bakhmut, one of the last major towns in the Donetsk region still held by Ukrainian forces, and which would clear the way for Russia to move on two other strategic targets, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.</p> \n<p>Russia last month took over all of the Luhansk region, which together with Donetsk makes up the industrial Donbas heartland. Russia-backed separatists self-declared a pair of independent republics there.</p> \n<p>After Russia’s failure to seize Kyiv, and setbacks in parts of the south including around the city of Kherson, capturing territory here has become a key military objective for Moscow.</p> \n<p>Shelling in the Mykolaiv region also seriously injured four children and five adults, with one girl losing an eye, said governor Vitaliy Kim. Shells landed in the town of Voznesensk, just 30km from the country’s second-largest nuclear power plant.</p> \n<p>There is growing global concern about Russia’s occupation of the nearby Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest in Europe, and suspicion that Russian authorities could try to disconnect it from the Ukrainian grid, which would raise the risk of a nuclear accident.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting: Artem Mazhulin</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/20/alabama-adam-simjee-talladega-national-forest-police","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T18:05:02Z","webTitle":"Student shot dead in Alabama forest by woman posing as stranded motorist, police say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/20/alabama-adam-simjee-talladega-national-forest-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/20/alabama-adam-simjee-talladega-national-forest-police","fields":{"headline":"Student shot dead in Alabama forest by woman posing as stranded motorist, police say","trailText":"Duo charged with murder over killing of Adam Simjee, 22, who was forced to walk into woods with girlfriend and died after gunfight","byline":"Maya Yang","body":"<p>When Adam Simjee and his girlfriend Mikayla Paulus stopped their car in the Talladega national forest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama\">Alabama</a> last week, after being flagged down by what the college students thought was a stranded driver, the couple did not think much of it.</p> <p>But the “stranded driver” – a woman named Yasmine Hider – turned out to be a gun-wielding robber who forced Simjee, 22, and Paulus, 20, to walk into the woods. Simjee pulled out his own handgun and shot Hider in defense of his girlfriend and himself, but he did not survive the confrontation – police allege Hider shot him dead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/louisiana-abortion-woman-nancy-davis-benjamin-crump\">Louisiana woman faces ‘horrifically cruel’ abortion choice over fetus missing skull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In another moment defying logic, the five-year-old child of a woman accompanying Hider held a loaded shotgun as police swarmed the forest to investigate. The child did not fire.</p> <p>A newly released press statement from the Clay county, Alabama, sheriff’s office released more details surrounding the case that left one University of Central Florida student dead and another in deep mourning.</p> <p>The statement recounts how Hider waved down Paulus and Simjee as the couple drove on a road winding through the national forest, asked them if they could help her get her car started, and forced them to walk into the woods at gunpoint.</p> <p>Simjee pulled out his own pistol and exchanged gunfire with Hider, wounding her multiple times, the sheriff’s office’s statement said. But Simjee was also hit and badly injured.</p> <p>Paulus, Simjee’s girlfriend, realized another woman accompanying Hider was watching the gunfight, according to sheriff’s deputies. Hider allegedly called out for help from that woman, who spoke with Hider briefly before fleeing and giving Paulus the chance to grab her phone and call 911 for help.</p> <p>When first responders got there, Paulus was performing CPR on Simjee, police said. Hider reportedly lay near the couple.</p> <p>Paramedics pronounced Simjee dead at the scene. They took Hider to a nearby hospital, where she underwent emergency surgery.</p> <p>Investigators later determined that Hider was living at a camp in the forest with the other woman, about half a mile from where Simjee and Paulus were held up. Deputies soon went to that camp, found the other woman there, and ordered her to the ground before her five-year-old son emerged from the woods holding a loaded shotgun.</p> <p>Deputies ordered the child to put the shotgun down, and he rested the weapon on the ground after walking over to his mother, identified as Krystal Pinkins, the sheriff’s office added.</p> <p>Authorities arrested Hider and charged her with murder, kidnapping and robbery. Pinkins was also arrested on the same counts while also being booked with child endangerment.</p> <p>State child welfare officials took custody of Pinkins’ son.</p> <p>Paulus, in a Facebook<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=mikayla%20paulus\"> post</a>, grieving Simjee’s killing, saying: “My reason for being, my soulmate, my life partner, the future father of my children, died in the middle of a state park in Alabama.

I remember my post-A-level Leeds for the burning lavatories, while as a music journalist at Reading, I recall trying to gently cajole a notoriously prickly member of an indie band into wearing a fake moustache for a photoshoot (he declined).</p> <p>I can remember seeing bands I wanted to see, and bands I didn’t, and being disappointed and impressed in both scenarios. But I don’t think I have ever gone to a festival with the aim of seeing one act and one act alone.</p> <p>Rage Against the Machine have <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.co.uk/music/news/rage-against-the-machine-cancel-headline-reading-and-leeds-sets-pull-2022-tour-21352/\" title=\"\">had to pull out</a> of their headline slot at next weekend’s Reading and Leeds, and other European shows, owing to “medical guidance” over an injury sustained by singer Zack de la Rocha. They have been replaced by the 1975, to the displeasure of some Rage fans, who, perhaps reasonably, have argued that, genre-wise, the swap is not like for like. After some initial confusion and a <a href=\"http://change.org/\" title=\"\">change.org</a> petition, some fans have been issued refunds for their tickets.</p> <p>Morally, though, should fans be entitled to get their money back if a headliner changes? Rage were playing their first UK shows in over a decade and if they are your favourite band, I can see why you might cough up for a day ticket just to see them. Ultimately, though, that’s a risk, because it isn’t a Rage Against the Machine show. It’s a festival, and there are other acts playing, and there is so much more to see and do. You’re paying for that, too. I am old now and therefore would rather have a root canal without anaesthetic than go to Reading or Leeds for the weekend – as it should be – but what a shame, not to be open to more than precisely what you expected to see.</p> <p>Besides, genre is in such a state of chaos, with most acts borrowing bits from everywhere, that even on the traditionally rock/metal day that Rage were due to top, the lineup is still pretty broad, if not leaning towards pop. It was never going to be Download with Halsey or Bastille or Run the Jewels so high up on the bill. The other acts who pulled out to go to the MTV awards instead, though, are a different story. They should be paying for every one of their disappointed fans’ tickets from their own pockets.</p> <h2>Tom Kerridge: Critics, don’t bite the hand that feeds you</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"539d50d01f0338a13dc88c45e6149f6ed14f352c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/539d50d01f0338a13dc88c45e6149f6ed14f352c/692_647_1687_1013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tucking in: Tom Kerridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tucking in: Tom Kerridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: West Contemporary Gallery/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em> </em></p> <p>Last week, the chef <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/tom-kerridge-defends-pub-charging-27773303\" title=\"\">Tom Kerridge</a>, who owns Britain’s only pub with two Michelin stars, patiently and carefully explained to the <em>Times</em> why he could work to campaign against the shameful rise of child food poverty in the UK (along with Marcus Rashford) while also cooking and selling expensive food in his fancy restaurant. </p> <p>He likened eating at The Hand and Flowers to a “ride in a Bentley” and gave a breakdown of the cost of good quality ingredients, qualified staff, overheads and VAT. The issue at hand, or at The Hand, is a steak and chips, for which he charges £87. (I’m salivating over the idea of its <a href=\"https://www.thehandandflowers.co.uk/menus/a-la-carte\" title=\"\">£26.50 strawberry and salted biscuit souffle</a>, but each to their own.) Kerridge explained that he would be lucky to make a profit of £9 on the dish, most of which would be put back into the business anyway.</p> <p>There is something snide and disingenuous about critics sneering that his food is expensive, as if that makes him a hypocrite in his campaigning work. The idea that he can’t fight for ordinary people to be able to afford to eat at all, while also having a restaurant that caters to people who can afford to splash out (and given that the rich are only getting richer, that seems like a sound business plan), is nonsense. But if the finger is pointed at Kerridge, then I suppose for a moment it isn’t pointing where it should be: at people for whom an £87 steak is nothing or at people who, like <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/liz-truss-insisted-luxury-lunch-25834430\" title=\"\">Liz Truss, insist on spending £1,400 of taxpayers’ money on a luxury lunch</a> at a private club owned by a Tory party donor.</p> <h2>Mariah Carey: All she wants for Christmas is it all to herself</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"930abf5f4b128f68d38da59c89365f1759f5829f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/930abf5f4b128f68d38da59c89365f1759f5829f/0_109_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Festive monopoly: Mariah Carey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Festive monopoly: Mariah Carey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the many joys of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-62564327\" title=\"\">Mariah Carey</a>, and there are so many, is that whenever you think she has reached maximum Mariah, that the Mariah-meter has tipped into the red and is in danger of smashing the glass, she pushes it just that little bit further. Last year, Carey’s legal team filed a petition to trademark the title “Queen of Christmas”, which would mean that only she could use the phrase, arguing that her 1994 megahit All I Want For Christmas Is You means she is synonymous with the festive season.</p> <p>The petition was made public in July, giving people the chance to object and, by Santa, did some other Queens of Christmas step forward to object.

If Carey’s petition were to succeed, it might end up being more Grinch-like than fairy at the top of the tree.

Pressing repeat bodes well for Paris 2024.</p> <p>Turkey, the expected challengers, faded to bronze. Italy claimed silver but were a gulf adrift of the British points tally of 254.295. Fraser, despite a fracture he still has to manage, skipped gleefully and without fear.</p> <p>“The main thing that’s kept me going is the team that stood with me,” he said. “When I doubted myself, they believed in me. And that’s what probably kept me going through those tough days and hard days.</p> <p>“Stood here right now, as team European champions, makes all of those hard times worth it.”</p> <p>True to form, he had to roll with another unanticipated punch, offering to sub in for the floor exercise when Tulloch took unwell overnight. “My face swelled up,” he said. “He looked like he’d had a boxing match,” Fraser said, grinning. That he took the smallest of penalties mattered little. His parallel bars was artistry in motion without a deviation in sight.</p> <p>By midway, triumph felt inevitable. On a gargantuan cream sofa parked in the middle of the arena, the Britons could afford to kick back their heels and lounge while others stumbled.</p> <p>Even when Regini-Moran slipped off the parallel bars, there was barely a twitch. Fraser backed him up with a score of 15.166. Then Hall ascended the high bar and scaled the heights. His colleagues watched and applauded. Their bonds run deep. “These guys are my brothers,” Hall said. “Like family.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3b57c86c4ab01b2e54e1b5fb90e8053f1d70556\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3b57c86c4ab01b2e54e1b5fb90e8053f1d70556/0_126_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Fraser masters the parallel bars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Fraser masters the parallel bars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sven Hoppe/DPA/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jarman is just 20 and still on the rise. His vault was pitch-perfect. An exquisite landing off the high bar, at the very end, doubled as a signal for celebration. Four golds at the Commonwealths, another for him here.</p> <p>“The whole experience feels like it’s been over in a flash,” he said. “Over the past few months, we’ve been training day in, day out. And to pull off what we did here is just incredible. The team score that we got gives us a lot of hope that we can do well on a world stage.”</p> <p>Fraser – already the first British male to become all-around champion of Europe here – can make history on Sunday. Only Beth Tweddle, among Britons, has previously corralled twin continental golds. The individual apparatus finals can propel him above and beyond.</p> <p>He has earned opportunities on the pommel horse and parallel bars with the highest scores in qualifying. An awesome foursome is within his grasp. His compatriots will surely strut to the podium as well. The current strength in depth, he underlines, is a potent driving force for all concerned.</p> <p>“We are such a great team, because things that I might lack in, other people cover,” Fraser said. “Things that they might lack in, I cover. And that’s why we gel so well together on that gymnastics floor. Which is amazing to see. We really do pull together in those hard moments.”</p> <p>This was the same lineup that collected gold in England’s colours at the Commonwealth Games and, despite the formality of official trials, will likely remain unchanged for the world championships in Liverpool two months from now. Max Whitlock, the event’s ambassador, has not officially ruled himself out from an active role. Surely that door is shut.</p> <p>A year out in sporting terms equates to a chunk of a lifetime. The six-time Olympic medallist turns 30 in January and appears likely to spend 2024 nurturing future generations at the clubs he has established rather than pinging around a pommel near the banks of the Seine.</p> <p>British Gymnastics will be wary of recalibrating a winning machine. With Russia banned from catching a ferry toward the Mersey, Britain expect to navigate towards the team podium again on home soil, with China and Japan their most probable foes.</p> <p>Nothing will be left to fate. “We’re just all so competitive,” Tulloch said. “We’re close, we want the best of each other, and we want to beat each other as well. And that just makes us even better, to push each other.”</p> <p>Europe cowered, global conquest at the world championships next. “We’re going to do incredibly there,” he said. “And I can’t wait for it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/20/irvine-welsh-everything-has-become-so-shouty-the-long-knives-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T17:00:45Z","webTitle":"Irvine Welsh: ‘Everything has become so shouty’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/20/irvine-welsh-everything-has-become-so-shouty-the-long-knives-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/20/irvine-welsh-everything-has-become-so-shouty-the-long-knives-interview","fields":{"headline":"Irvine Welsh: ‘Everything has become so shouty’","trailText":"The Trainspotting author on his new novel’s transgender storyline, using humour to give his readers a break and the debt he owes to Evelyn Waugh","byline":"Anthony Cummins","body":"<p>Irvine Welsh, 63, grew up in Muirhouse, north Edinburgh, and lives in Oxfordshire, having spent most of the 2010s in Chicago and Miami. <em>The Long Knives</em>, his 13th novel, is a sequel to 2008’s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/29/fiction.reviews1\">Crime</a></em>, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/18/review-irvine-welsh-tv-drama-dreich-plodding-deathly\">screened last year</a> as a six-part BritBox series with Dougray Scott in the lead role of DI Ray Lennox. In the new book, Lennox is tasked with solving the murder of a Tory MP found castrated in a Leith warehouse. Welsh spoke as shooting was about to begin on its television adaptation; other business in hand included <em>Trainspotting</em>’s forthcoming debut as a West End musical, two separate documentaries about his life (“like buses, you know”), a recently launched record label and getting married for a third time.</p> <p><strong>Did you always plan to write a sequel to </strong><em><strong>Crime</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br>Doing the TV show [of the first novel] piqued my curiosity. We were telling the story about Lennox’s family and this thing that happened to him as a kid, and since it was doing well and there was a chance for another season, I wrote about what would happen if he found the guys who abused him. But the novel I wrote then will be coming out next year, because it seemed to leave space for another book in between to develop the family drama and really set up the payoff. I thought if I could get it done in time, the show’s second season could be based on <em>The Long Knives</em> instead and it is. So having not had a book out since 2017, they’re now coming thick and fast because I did nothing in lockdown except write.</p> <p><strong>What led you to the novel’s transgender storyline?</strong><br>I just thought it was such interesting waters to go into. We’re all asking fundamental questions about identity now that the things that defined us are slipping away. It’s complex, moving-picture stuff. You don’t know how much of it is a distraction to keep us at each other’s throats politically: if trans women compete in athletics, or if they’re barred, it’s not going to change the fact that lots of people are going to die because everybody’s getting fucked with their heating bills over the winter. It’s obviously difficult waters to go into because everything has become so shouty. We had a trans adviser on the book and I was dreading it. I thought, this is going to be another layer of censorship. But it was incredibly educational. I learned a lot.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I like to challenge and annoy and disturb and irritate myself when I write</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Did anything change in the book?</strong><br>Certain things did change. There’s certain things I just got wrong; I’m happy to be corrected. Other things [other responses] were quite affirmative. It was nice to have the motivation for what I was doing understood.</p> <p><strong>What draws you to sexual abuse as a theme in your work?</strong><br>I like to challenge and annoy and disturb and irritate the fuck out of myself when I write. That’s really the motivation: to push myself to look at things that aren’t looked at in fiction, or get looked at in a very trite way from the godlike position of the author, rather than from the point of view of the people actually involved, who often get reduced to barbaric simpletons with no roots to their behaviour.</p> <p><strong>Yet, like most of your recent novels, </strong><em><strong>The Long Knives</strong></em><strong> is a comedy of sorts.</strong><br>I tend to use humour to give the reader a break. If you’re forcing people to look at potentially intolerable material, you have to give them space to reset; you can show as much darkness as possible as long as you’re groping in some ways for the light switch.</p> <p><strong>Plot didn’t always drive your fiction the way it does now.</strong><br>No, I’ve learned how to do that down the years. I didn’t know how to write a novel when I wrote <em>Trainspotting</em>. I had these loose stories that seemed to be heading somewhere; the start was going on too much about how they became junkies, so I cut it and went straight into their world and ended it with a heist ending I thought would be dramatic. Then I went on to <em>The Acid House</em><em> – </em>more stories. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1995/apr/23/featuresreview.review\">Marabou Stork Nightmares</a></em> was my first attempt at a conventional novel but it turned out quite experimental. I was just messing around in those first few books. They were probably the best ones, because then you learn how to write and you end up writing like everybody else [laughs].</p> <p><strong>The story goes that </strong><em><strong>Trainspotting</strong></em><strong> stood to be Booker-shortlisted in 1993 until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/jul/27/booker-prize-bias-english\">two judges threatened to quit</a>. Do you ever think what might have been?</strong><br>Probably what might have been is that it might’ve been shite. I can’t think of a working-class British writer who’s done massively well out of winning the Booker prize; it didn’t do [James] Kelman much good.</p> <p><strong>What have you been reading recently?</strong><br>The latest in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/17/the-secret-dj-from-ibiza-to-norfolk-broads\">The Secret DJ</a></em> series, which I really like. I’ve been DJing again compulsively this year and it’s just DJs talking about how they got into the business. I’ve just finished Rachel Ingalls’s <em>Mrs Caliban</em>, which I enjoyed – it’s kind of weird and cool. The other thing I’ve been enjoying is Stéphane Mallarmé’s <em>Collected Poems and Other Verse</em> [in an Oxford World’s Classics translation by EH and AM Blackmore]. I can’t read French and I love the way it’s got the French on the other side with the English.</p> <p><strong>Which novels inspired you?</strong><br>Evelyn Waugh’s <em>Sword of Honour</em> trilogy influenced me a lot; even though the characters had a completely different background to mine, I found the psychology of male schadenfreude and competitiveness really well observed. A background pulse [to wanting to write] came from the big Scottish books that made everyone go, whoa, this is great: William McIlvanney’s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/11/william-mcillvanney-tartan-noir\">Laidlaw</a></em>, Kelman’s <em>The Busconductor Hines</em>, Alasdair Gray’s <em>Lanark</em>, Janice Galloway’s <em>The Trick Is to Keep Breathing</em>. But a lot of my stuff just comes from listening to people shouting at each other in queues, in pubs, on buses; I don’t drive, so public transport is a really fabulous place for me to pick up references. When I was taking the elevated subway to baseball games in Chicago, you’d hear people rapping with each other and I’d be translating it into Scottish, thinking, well, this is how people would be talking if they were going to Tynecastle or Easter Road or whatever.</p> <p><strong>Are you ever tempted to write an autobiography?</strong><br>I’ve got two documentary crews following me around, so the last thing I need is an autobiography. To some extent you have to be an egotist to be any kind of artist at all, but I’m not really interested in looking at myself from the outside. My wife says: “You’re just weird; you’re an alien, basically” and I don’t really want to show the world my fucking weirdness, you know? These things sneak up on you, though. Like, you’d always think <em>Trainspotting</em> would be a very autobiographical novel and that something like <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/27/irvine-welsh-sex-lives-of-siamese-twins-review\">The Sex Lives of Siamese Twins</a></em>, with these two much younger female American narrators, would be different. Then when my ex-wife read it, she said: “These characters are more like you than any other character you’ve ever written in your life.” You don’t realise that when you write you’re always bizarrely outing yourself.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Long Knives </em>by Irvine Welsh is published by Jonathan Cape (£18.99).

He likes to talk and he is generous with his time. When I interviewed him a few years ago, we had lunch together – somewhat ironically, it seems to me now – at the restaurant at Tate Britain, a venue long since closed on account of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/07/future-of-tate-britains-offensive-rex-whistler-mural-under-review\" title=\"\">Rex Whistler mural</a> on its walls (in 2020, the gallery’s ethics committee called it “unequivocally offensive”). What I remember most, though, isn’t what happened there, but the fact that when we were finished, Rushdie insisted he would rather walk with me to Pimlico underground than pile into a taxi.</p> <p>I think I was surprised. One of my very first jobs as a young journalist involved attending an event where Rushdie, then still in hiding, was rumoured to be going to appear (memory tells me that he did, emerging from behind a curtain like a stage magician). But I was also amused. He didn’t – it was obvious – quite know the best way to the station and in his outsize puffer jacket he rather meekly followed me, looking about happily as he strolled.

But my affection for <em>The Secret Garden</em>, Frances Hodgson Burnett’s beloved novel of 1911, will surely never die. Even now, whenever I walk or drive across moorland, I inevitably hear the voice of its orphaned heroine, Mary Lennox, newly arrived in Yorkshire from India, asking of the mile upon mile of purple-brown she can see from the window of her carriage: “It’s not the sea, is it?” (No, it’s not the sea, but it is, to the human eye, every bit as vast and wild and beautiful.)</p> <p>The cover of my old Puffin edition doesn’t feature in <a href=\"https://gardenmuseum.org.uk/exhibitions/the-secret-garden/\" title=\"\">an exhibition</a> celebrating the novel at the Garden Museum in Lambeth, south London. But never mind. Illustrations by Charles Robinson (1911), EH Shepard (1956) and Inga Moore (2007) are all on display, as well as several first editions of the book.</p> <p>And to whom could these exquisite volumes possibly belong? You might well ask. On the day I visited, there were audible gasps in the gallery as two extremely hip-looking young women nearby read the name of the lender. “Alan Titchmarsh!” one said to the other, in a voice that might – I’m only guessing – have been a touch sarcastic in any other circumstance.</p> <h2>Painfully well read</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c44297350c1d71202c5cc01188d8f8eae864972\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c44297350c1d71202c5cc01188d8f8eae864972/0_431_6469_3882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I read as I water the garden, and wait for the kettle to boil.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I read as I water the garden, and wait for the kettle to boil.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photographer, Basak Gurbuz Derman/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reading is my oldest habit, which is just as well given that I’m one of the judges of this year’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/baillie-gifford-prize-for-nonfiction\" title=\"\">Baillie Gifford prize</a> for nonfiction.

After all, they still scored the runs they did muster at a none-too-sluggish 3.8 per over.</p> \n<p>But much as with the backing of Zak Crawley, a player who in normal circumstances might have been humanely whipped out of the firing line by now, McCullum sees things differently: those numbers are simplistic and do not reflect certain passages where in his mind England retreated from their stated desire to take the positive option.</p> \n<p>“I guess one of the messages we will be talking about is did we go hard enough with our approach?” said McCullum, when asked about the discussions to be had before Thursday’s second Test at Old Trafford. “Could we maybe go a little harder and try to turn some pressure back on the opposition as well?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ab9922724b85b13c8192586fdd077c54c4ab61d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ab9922724b85b13c8192586fdd077c54c4ab61d/0_8_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brendon McCullum is interviewed after England’s defeat by South Africa at Lord’s on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brendon McCullum is interviewed after England’s defeat by South Africa at Lord’s on Friday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Whitley/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“When the game was in the balance and a couple of spells from their boys were testing, we could maybe have been a little braver to be able to turn some pressure back on the opposition – in both innings.</p> \n<p>“For us, we’ve got an idea of how we want to play. And the skipper and myself are very strong with our belief and what we think will give this English side the greatest opportunity to become a very good cricket team and win more games of Test cricket.”</p> \n<p>McCullum dislikes the term Bazball, believing it to be far too reductive, but whatever the name of the project it is clear the tenets will not be changing. After all, a ledger that read one win from 17 in Test cricket not long ago now reads four wins from five this summer, even if he claimed results are not a topic of dressing-room conversation.</p> \n<p>“I know we’re judged by them and ultimately we live and die by them when it comes to your jobs and things,” said McCullum. “But we don’t think like that. For us it’s about the approach and it’s about the language we use in the dressing room, and it’s about how we try to ensure we’ve got total buy-in from the guys.”</p> \n<p>In fairness, only a couple of dismissals could be attributed to misplaced aggression while the game was still live as a contest. It may simply be that until the support cast are able to post healthy totals when Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow miss out – the Yorkshire pairing were kept quiet at Lord’s – consistency will remain elusive.</p> \n<p>McCullum also wondered whether England’s collective “bravery” was affected by batting first: when they chased down targets of 275, 298, 296 and 378 against New Zealand and India, the equations, if not the task, were straightforward. If nothing else, this slightly odd shortcoming sets up another intriguing toss at Old Trafford.</p> \n<p>There will be no additional practice before then despite two extra days off and, going by McCullum’s early thoughts, changes to the XI will be minimal. Ollie Robinson is pushing hard for a return after taking five South African wickets for the Lions but it sounded as if Crawley, averaging 16.4 this summer and fresh from a scratchy second-innings 13 that ended with a premeditated sweep, will go again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bbf9852985864ba29a670816def0719de705e75\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bbf9852985864ba29a670816def0719de705e75/0_4_4628_2778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zak Crawley walks off after he was out lbw for 13.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zak Crawley walks off after he was out lbw for 13.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>McCullum said: “After a loss, you always sit there and go: ‘Can we replace this person? Or that person?’ But you have got to think about the overall package as well.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/england-south-africa-first-test-day-three-match-report-cricket\">Sorry England slump to innings defeat inside three days against South Africa</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I look at a guy like Zak and his skillset is not to be a consistent cricketer. He’s not that type of player, but he is put in that situation because he has a game which means, when he gets going, he can win matches for England. We have got to be really positive around the language we use with him and be really consistent with the selections around that as well, and keep giving guys opportunities.</p> \n<p>“He’s a tough fella, Zak. Selection loyalty is important because not only does it build loyalty with the guys in the side, it builds loyalty for the guys on the outside knowing that when their time does come, they are going to be afforded the same.”</p> \n<p>The dogmatic thinking applies to the bowling tactics also, chiefly the short-ball plan to the tail that was so impressively handled by South Africa’s lower order and added 116 runs for their last four wickets. “You want opposition sides around the world to know when the tail comes in you’re going to go after them,” said McCullum.</p> \n<p>One issue here is that with Jofra Archer and Mark Wood long-term absentees, England do not possess the raw pace to return fire against opponents such as Anrich Nortje. Stokes has the ability to bring some extra grunt but continues to grimace more than Albert Steptoe because of his chronic left knee problem.</p> \n<p>McCullum fancied his captain would keep charging “through brick walls” in spite of this. Much like the project as a whole, one that has delivered four thrilling wins but will test the patience of onlookers, it remains a case of running towards the danger.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/live/2022/aug/20/premier-league-clockwatch-everton-forest-leicester-southampton-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T16:57:44Z","webTitle":"Everton

On TikTok, where videos of him were widely pushed to young users by the algorithm, content tagged with Tate’s name has been watched more than 12bn times.</p> <p>The closure of the affiliate programme signifies the loss of a key revenue stream for Tate and comes as membership statistics for Hustler’s University, which costs £36 a month, show it currently has about 109,000 members, down from 127,000 two weeks ago. A post in the Hustler’s Community online forum told members not to worry about the closure of the affiliate scheme, adding that an “exciting” update to the platform was coming soon.</p> <p>Social media firms have taken action to reduce the spread of Tate’s content in recent weeks. TikTok users say they are now being shown fewer videos of him, and many accounts have been banned. TikTok said: “Misogyny is a hateful ideology that is not tolerated on TikTok. We’ve been removing violative videos and accounts for weeks, and we welcome the news that other platforms are also taking action against this individual.”</p> <p>Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/19/andrew-tate-instagram-facebook-removed\" title=\"\">said on Friday it had removed Tate’s official accounts</a> for violating its policies on dangerous organisations and individuals. Tate had 4.7 million Instagram followers at the time his account was removed, up from about 1 million in June.</p> <p>The action by the social platforms has sparked allegations of censorship from fans, with Tate saying: “Banning me only inspires more internet hate mobs and more division.

Joe Mulhall, director of research at Hope Not Hate, a UK advocacy group, said: “Tate poses a genuine threat to young men, radicalising them towards extremism misogyny, racism and homophobia.” In a post in the Discord server for Hustler’s University on 15 August, a community leader told members that a decision had been taken to close the affiliate marketing scheme, saying that “although it was very successful it had a few issues”.</p> <p>The post claimed a reason for its closure was that Tate content had been “used out of context and in bad taste by many students desperate to get attention to their profiles”, leading to social media platforms taking action.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/06/andrew-tate-violent-misogynistic-world-of-tiktok-new-star\">Inside the violent, misogynistic world of TikTok’s new star, Andrew Tate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, instructions for members, which have since been deleted, show they were explicitly advised to post controversial content to get high views and engagement.</p> <p>One guide for students said attracting “comments and controversy” was the key to success on TikTok, adding: “What you ideally want is a mix of 60-70% fans and 40-30% haters.

His players’ post-match reaction was another sign of his team’s rapid progress. The raucous Forest faithful were in the midst of telling the ex-Derby manager Frank Lampard he was getting sacked in the morning when their other target, the former Leicester winger Demarai Gray, pounced on a superb Jordan Pickford pass to rescue Everton’s first point of the season in the 88th minute. Brennan Johnson had put the visitors on the cusp of a second successive league win seven minutes earlier and, but for a late defensive lapse, they would have condemned Everton to a damaging third consecutive defeat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/20/crystal-palace-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Wilfried Zaha double inspires Crystal Palace comeback against Aston Villa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amid Forest’s disappointment, however, was an encouraging performance in which the club’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/18/nottingham-forest-35m-fee-wolves-morgan-gibbs-white\" title=\"\">record signing</a>, Morgan Gibbs-White, impressed as a second half substitute. Cooper rightly embraced the positives.</p> <p>“We should have won, we were the better team,” the Forest manager said. “It was a poor goal to concede, we shouldn’t concede a goal like that at this level, but let’s not lose sight of all the good things we did. It is a disappointed dressing room, the players feel we should have won and missed an opportunity but at the same time it is a first away point. I won’t be narrow-minded not to see our team has grown again this week.”</p> <p>Everton cannot grow without the striker needed to replace Richarlison – sold 51 days ago – or the injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Lampard’s team had 19 shots but, Gray’s equaliser apart, none carried the precision or quality to truly extend Dean Henderson in the Forest goal.</p> <p>“When you have 19 shots at home you expect to score more than one goal,” said Lampard. “It is hard when you have a lot of opportunities and periods of control and don’t score to sustain that confidence but we showed good spirit to come back.”</p> <p>Everton started brightly, with Alex Iwobi shining on his 100th appearance for the club and the driving runs of Anthony Gordon and Gray putting Forest on the back foot. Their first-half threat petered out once the visitors improved in possession, however. Lampard’s team dropped deeper and, with Salomón Rondón isolated, had no outlet.</p> <p>Gordon received a warm ovation at the end of a week in which Everton had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/16/everton-reject-45m-bid-from-chelsea-for-anthony-gordon\" title=\"\">rejected</a> two bids from Chelsea for the homegrown talent. The 21-year-old forced the first save of the game from Henderson although it was Gray’s set-piece delivery that provided Everton’s best hope. Tom Davies, selected ahead of the new £33m signing Amadou Onana, just failed to connect with Gray’s first in-swinging free-kick. The midfielder was again left unmarked when Gray repeated the routine. This time Davies did connect but scuffed his volley when he should have at least tested Henderson. Gray tried a different approach with his third free-kick from the left, sweeping hard and low to the near post, but the Forest keeper reacted well to save with his legs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5d50f25a830c76cdba7adb07ceb6f937a1155a5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d50f25a830c76cdba7adb07ceb6f937a1155a5b/0_72_2171_1303/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nottingham Forest’s Brennan Johnson fires past Jordan Pickford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nottingham Forest’s Brennan Johnson fires past Jordan Pickford to give his side the lead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Forest, with 13 summer signings in their matchday squad, understandably needed time to settle. Their confidence, understanding and threat increased throughout the contest, particularly when the one-time Everton target Gibbs-White injected greater menace and pace into the attack. Cooper’s team took the lead when the previously anonymous Jesse Lingard teed up Ryan Yates for a 25-yard shot. Pickford pushed away the substitute’s shot but straight into the path of Johnson, who dispatched an immaculate finish into the far corner.</p> <p>Everton were staring at another loss until Pickford played the pass of the game, picking out Gray’s run behind the Forest defence with a superb long-range ball. The winger beat the exposed Henderson with a confident strike. Lampard said: “You watch Liverpool and Manchester City, they all play that pass. If you have a goalkeeper that can hit it hard and flat like Jordan can you have to use it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/20/crystal-palace-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T16:08:20Z","webTitle":"Wilfried Zaha double inspires Crystal Palace comeback against Aston Villa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/20/crystal-palace-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/20/crystal-palace-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Wilfried Zaha double inspires Crystal Palace comeback against Aston Villa","trailText":"Having cancelled out Ollie Watkins’ early opener, Wilfried Zaha had a penalty saved only to score on the follow-up before Jean-Philippe Mateta sealed a 3-1 win for the hosts","byline":"Simon Mail at Selhurst Park","body":"<p>Wilfried Zaha remains integral to Crystal Palace’s future and the irrepressible forward struck twice to fire his team to their first win of the season.

Vieira, who preferred to focus on their collective strength despite several standout individuals, said: “I’m really happy. From the first minute to the last we played with a lot of intensity. I would say it’s one of the most consistent performances from the start to the end.”</p> <p>A home victory did not look likely after Villa opened the scoring with their first attack. Leon Bailey neatly flicked a long ball from Tyrone Mings into the path of Watkins and the forward swept his low strike beyond the Crystal Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita.

Their delight was swiftly curtailed when VAR ruled Édouard had strayed offside. Eberechi Eze offered a significant threat for the hosts and the gifted attacker launched several rampaging runs which left Villa toiling. Palace again went close to taking the lead after Zaha set up Jordan Ayew, but his low shot was parried to safety by the Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martínez.</p> <p>Palace were in the ascendancy again early in the second half and a long pass from Joachim Andersen found Ayew, but Martínez reacted quickly to smother the ball. Villa still carried an occasional threat, though, and were denied a second goal when Bailey cut inside and curled a sumptuous strike from the edge of the area that cannoned off the crossbar. Palace responded and Ayew played the ball into the path of Édouard but he dragged his effort past the post to the frustration of the home supporters.</p> <p>Villa conceded a penalty after 58 minutes when Lucas Digne was adjudged to have handled the ball from a header by Marc Guéhi. The referee, Andy Madley, checked the monitor, after a VAR recommendation, before pointing to the spot. The Villa head coach, Steven Gerrard, said: “A big moment goes against us with the penalty. For me, it’s harsh. I’m not sure what Lucas can do. He tries to jump naturally and it’s a complete accident.</p> <p>“The players are trying but obviously the momentum swung with the penalty. It’s not the reason we lost the game but it’s certainly a big turning point.” Gerrard bemoaned Villa’s lack of consistency after last weekend’s win over Everton and he will be concerned by back-to-back away defeats to start the season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/20/leicester-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Double from Adams secures comeback win for Southampton against Leicester</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Zaha stepped up and his penalty was saved by Martínez, but he reacted sharpest to bury the rebound for his third goal of the season.

The bad news for him is that next up is a potentially awkward Carabao Cup trip to Stockport on Tuesday before a visit to Chelsea, whose pursuit of Wesley Fofana led Rodgers to omit the Frenchman from his matchday squad.</p> <p>Rodgers said the 21-year-old defender was “not quite in the right frame of mind” to feature. “There is a lot going on behind the scenes, which I understand,” he said.</p> <p>“He’s a good kid, he’s been great for us while he has been here and at this moment it’s a difficult one. You can’t afford to be around your teammates and playing in a Premier League game if you’re not 100% focused. This situation was pretty straightforward because there is so much going on in his mind.”</p> <p>Leicester have rejected two bids from Chelsea for Fofana, who has made clear of his wish to move, and are braced for a third. Leicester want a fee of about £80m. Fofana was in the stands, happily posing for photos with fans and signing autographs.</p> <p>He applauded Maddison’s curled free-kick, which flew in at the near post of Gavin Bazunu, one of four summer signings aged 20 or under to feature in Southampton’s starting lineup.</p> <p>Hasenhüttl was pleased Maddison’s strike did not prove decisive given Bazunu’s lopsided wall allowed the Leicester midfielder to take advantage, but praised his team’s spirit. On the final day of last season they folded in a 4-1 defeat.</p> <p>“We didn’t accept that we cannot take something here,” he said. “We had a very young team on the pitch and with the back four and goalkeeper we are super-young. I have to give them the biggest of respect for what they have done. The rest of the team was also fighting really hard. We were super-believing in what we were doing.”</p> <p>Harvey Barnes returned on the left flank after a knee injury as Rodgers shifted to the 4-3-3 he trialled in pre-season and Jamie Vardy led the line after signing a two-year contract extension that will take him to the age of 37.</p> <p>Leicester had their moments.

Outrage greeted the “euthanisation” of Freya in the Oslo fjord – she was shot in order to protect swimmers who had defied warnings not to approach her – follows a bad summer for animal interlopers from the sea. Freya’s death came only weeks after another walrus, named Mursu, ended up on the grass in someone’s garden in southern Finland. Mursu’s sudden demise last month was blamed by some observers on the botched and belated attempt to rescue the animal from its plight.</p> <p>Days later, three Sowerby’s beaked whales – among the deepest-diving and most enigmatic of all cetaceans – swam onto a Netherlands beach. The scene was almost medieval: as some beachgoers tried to guide the whales back out to sea, a topless female sunbather climbed onto one of the animals <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6s5ApdpnuY\" title=\"\">and tried to ride it</a>. In the past 12 days, seven of the same species have been found dead in the Moray Firth, in County Durham, Denmark, Belgium and on the Dutch island of Texel, raising serious concerns that military sonar exercises may be to blame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8e9a99ac29e47afb4d7a00ddc9dd650ffef6836\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8e9a99ac29e47afb4d7a00ddc9dd650ffef6836/0_0_6500_4521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albrecht Dürer’s the Head of a Walrus, 1521.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albrecht Dürer’s the Head of a Walrus, 1521.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Artefact/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this month a four-metre-long beluga whale was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/10/beluga-whale-that-strayed-into-river-seine-dies-during-rescue-operation\" title=\"\">fished out of the Seine in Normandy</a>. The emaciated whale, its pale skin blotched as a sign of its failing immune system, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/10/beluga-whale-that-strayed-into-river-seine-dies-during-rescue-operation\" title=\"\">was euthanised while being moved to the coast</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at the end of last month, 99 bottlenose dolphins were driven into a bay in the Faroe Islands and slaughtered for their meat. It was the largest such hunt for 120 years: distressing images showed the animals sliced open like so much sushi. And this summer Iceland resumed hunting fin whales, the second-largest animals on earth. Norway has never stopped hunting whales, despite the international moratorium on whaling implemented in 1986.</p> <p>The decline of modern tastes for whale meat may herald the demise of whaling, but the evidence indicates that we simply do not know how to deal with these errant animals, living or dead. Euthanising marine mammals is often done with pentobarbital, a chemical that renders the carcasses toxic: in 2011 in the US, a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21660622/\" title=\"\">dog fell into a coma</a> after digging up bits of buried whale.</p> <p>Now modern ecologists plead with authorities not to drag dead whales off to landfill but leave them on the shore to sustain foraging animals and thereby complete a natural cycle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cedd985ca599cc46220adb550bad783dfa1ab678\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cedd985ca599cc46220adb550bad783dfa1ab678/0_0_1901_1315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Engraving by Jan Saenredam of crowds around a beached whale in 1601 in the Netherlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"692\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engraving by Jan Saenredam of crowds around a beached whale in 1601 in the Netherlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a recent and revealing <a href=\"https://nautil.us/humans-are-overzealous-whale-morticians-22850/\" title=\"\">article for </a><em><a href=\"https://nautil.us/humans-are-overzealous-whale-morticians-22850/\" title=\"\">Nautilus</a></em><a href=\"https://nautil.us/humans-are-overzealous-whale-morticians-22850/\" title=\"\"> magazine</a>, US environmentalist Ben Goldfarb notes that a minke whale washed on to a Dutch islet was visited by 57 species of beetle. In Russia, scientists documented 180 polar bears feeding off a bowhead whale carcass. Such resources can mean life or death for animals whose environments are increasingly stressed by the climate emergency.</p> <p>At sea, whales are highly efficient sequesters of carbon: alive, their faeces fertilises phytoplankton; in death, their bodies sustain colonies of organisms on the sea bed. Yet on land we deny them that service by treating their remains as noisome litter. Dead whales certainly stink; after an encounter with a deceased minke on Skegness beach, I had to throw away most of the clothes I had been wearing.</p> <p>But while a mass of rotting blubber wouldn’t go down well on Bournemouth’s golden sands, remote beaches are a different matter. “We are removing what is natural from a natural place,” said Martina Quaggiotto, an ecologist at Stirling University. “We jettison dead whales not just because they’re smelly,” Goldfarb adds, “but to escape the evidence of our sins.”</p> <p>Human hubris goes ahead of itself when it comes to our interactions with the natural world. It always has. Dürer himself died of an infection caught in the Netherlands when he attempted to draw a stranded whale in 1521. It was probably malaria, from the swamps of Zeeland; but the artist himself felt he had paid the price for his impossible arrogance in trying to capture the leviathan.</p> <p>In 1803, William Blake, who revered Dürer, would declare of a world already out of kilter with nature: “We are led to Believe a lie/When we see not Thro the Eye.” Sometimes just bearing witness and leaving well alone is the best we can do. Perhaps Freya should have been warned once her human name was bestowed upon her. Freya was not only the mythological Scandinavian goddess of love. She was also the goddess of the dead.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 21 August 2022 to remove a reference to Freya visiting Ireland.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/20/angola-election-young-voters-call-for-change-mpla","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T16:00:44Z","webTitle":"Angola’s young voters prepare to call for change in ‘existential’ election ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/angola-election-young-voters-call-for-change-mpla","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/20/angola-election-young-voters-call-for-change-mpla","fields":{"headline":"Angola’s young voters prepare to call for change in ‘existential’ election ","trailText":"A new generation could end decades of MPLA rule this week and serve notice on Africa’s veteran leaders in polls seen as test of democracy","byline":"Jason Burke, Africa Correspondent","body":"<p>Millions of Angolans will vote this week in a landmark election described as an “existential moment” for the key oil-rich central African state, and a test for democracy across a swath of the continent.</p> <p>The poll on Wednesday pits veteran politicians against a generation of young voters just beginning to grasp that they can bring about a radical change and escape from the shadow of the cold war.</p> <p>Observers say discontent with the rule of the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), in power since Angola declared independence from Portugal in 1975, has reached a point where the party will only now secure another five years in power through rigging and repression.</p> <p>“It is an existential election, and it is going to be very tight race.

So when the family gets together, it’s like an army assault: women plan the food like an attack. They’re going to go in with a starter to ease you in and then just loads and loads and loads and loads of food. And if you haven’t been completely annihilated by the end of the main course, the dessert will definitely finish you off.</p> <p><strong>The rule of thumb for TV</strong> is shit food, sadly. If I’m on the road with <em>Countryfile</em>, you eat what’s available. Thank God for Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer at service stations. A lot of people working in telly will be nodding along to that.</p> <p><strong>If you came round tomorrow,</strong> my mum would sit you down and cook you a meal. My mum and dad’s next-door neighbours had builders in and my mum cooked them pakora – so not even for <em>their</em> builders. She said: “You’re working hard, you need some sustenance.” Food is not something that is scrimped or saved or kept to yourself. You’re opening your heart to people when you share your food. That’s a fundamental of the culture.</p> <p><strong>Baking isn’t really part of my upbringing.</strong> The oven was an extra storage unit for my mum, and many Indian mums, because ovens aren’t really used. So baking wasn’t really something I did.</p> <p><strong>I don’t believe in dieting.</strong> I believe in making your own food, eating a balanced meal, and regular exercise – that’s it.

Better lay off the salt and vinegar Chipsticks!”</p> <p><strong>Growing up in Bradford in the 1980s,</strong> my Indian life and my out-of-home life were two very different worlds. Often, when they collided, there was never a good result for me. Once, at an ice-cream van, kids on my streetI played with every day saw me in Indian clothes for the first time. One of them said: “We didn’t think you were one of those.” It was a complicated time. We were taught to assimilate, so nobody knew about other cultures. No one was told that you had to respect or understand other cultures. But there was a big turnaround moment for me on the platinum jubilee, where I wore a sari to present for the first time. So that story has a nice little ending.</p> <p><strong>When you’d go to birthday parties</strong> of your English friends as a kid, your mum would feed you before you’d go because you’d know you wouldn’t get fed that much.

For seven decades the UK and most other Commonwealth realms treated questions about ditching the monarchy or what to expect of her successor more as thought experiments than urgent business. Her eldest son, by contrast, has long wrestled with both propositions, recognising in his mother’s unmatchable popularity a phenomenon that simultaneously secures his path to the throne and complicates his singular destiny. Born to preserve the crown and pass it on, Prince Charles at times doubts he will achieve either of these things.</p> <p>He is, as a result and by nature, anxious, seeing existential threats behind every arras. Excitable aides can encourage this tendency. In 2015, I published a biography examining his strange existence; his character, by turns engaging and peevish; and the startling beliefs that have driven his lifelong interventionism and reckless fundraising for the charities he felt compelled to found. Spooked by press coverage of some of the book’s revelations, unnamed palace sources went on the attack, issuing false denials about the unusually generous access to Charles, his friends and staff that underpinned my research.</p> <p>This misjudgment – nobody in Clarence House had yet read the book and the reaction publicised it more effectively than ever I could – is minor but telling. The royal family inhabits a parallel universe, reliant on aides and allies to explain us to them and them to us. The arrangement has kept most members shielded from close scrutiny, but also detached from reality and protected as much by public lack of interest as active support. Courts are accidents waiting to happen, medieval structures only partially adapted for the modern age and headed by people who have never, in the ordinary sense, held a job. The penalty of missteps was lower in a less communicative age and before a recent wrenching run of disasters plunged wider swaths of the population into precarity. The public eye is grown more unforgiving, its gaze, like its judgments, more relentless. Even so, if the Windsors wish to see the biggest dangers to the survival of the monarchy, they need only look in the mirror.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3768b37ec79aab28795865a9b65ffd7307bd9b7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3768b37ec79aab28795865a9b65ffd7307bd9b7d/0_211_2478_1487/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Happier times: a family portrait to mark Prince Charles’s 70th birthday in late 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Happier times: a family portrait to mark Prince Charles’s 70th birthday in late 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clarence House/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The past years – the Meghan-and-Harry years, the Andrew-and-Jeffrey-Epstein years, the cash-for-honours-and-access years, the fragmenting-and-fracturing-of-family years – have hit the institution like a wrecking ball. Consider the trio of threats Charles’s advisers regarded, until this spate of self-inflicted injuries, as a “nightmare scenario” for the successful start of his reign. They gnawed their knuckles at the possibility that the Commonwealth of Nations might choose someone other than him as the organisation’s next leader. They worried that failure to agree his second wife’s future title ahead of his accession – Princess or Queen Consort – would raise the ghost of his first wife. They feared that a restive Caribbean realm might seize the moment of transition to become a republic.</p> <p>How petty those first two concerns, both swiftly resolved, now seem – and how sorely those royal aides underestimated the third. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/30/at-the-stroke-of-midnight-barbados-becomes-the-worlds-newest-republic\" title=\"\">Barbados didn’t bother to wait for a new sovereign</a>, breaking with the crown last year.

The painful progress of the Cambridges, William and Kate, across the region in March prompted dismay in the royal palaces, but too little understanding to change the jarring choreography of a similar expedition by the Wessexes – Prince Edward and wife Sophie – the following month. Protesters at every stage pointed to the ways in which the royals are beneficiaries in economic and social terms of empire and inequality, enslavement and exploitation. None of the palace officials involved in planning either trip seemed to have grasped how this heritage twines with Windrush and other fresher narratives of injustice, whether of Black lives extinguished by the police supposed to protect them or of a woman of colour crushed and cold-shouldered by the institution in whose service her in-laws travelled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"717604c9cd68ce51f02b6c5c195d3e37047ab4f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/717604c9cd68ce51f02b6c5c195d3e37047ab4f1/0_43_2971_1783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex leaving St Paul's Cathedral, London, in early June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, making a now rare public appearance in the UK in early June. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meghan, like Diana, has not gone quietly, but the remaining royals appear not to comprehend the scale of the fallout from the Sussexes’ departure, instead still squabbling over recollections that do indeed differ. In writing a substantial new section of my biography of Charles, it seemed important to unpick the claims and counterclaims of this conflict, but not at the expense of the bigger picture. Whosesoever truth you come to believe, the damage, personal and institutional, is profound.</p> <p>People who know Harry report that the breach with his family has floored him, and he is not the only one hurting. His brother, William, is wound tight, says one of these sources, his distress expressing itself, as it has done since the loss of his mother, as fury. Another source speaks of Charles’s “deep, deep pain”.</p> <p>Before the Netflix series <em>The Crown</em> turned earlier royal ructions into drama, many people already mistook the Windsors for reality TV stars, tabloid fodder, but not much more. Yet although it unfurls in palaces, theirs is a human story, and monarchy matters whether or not you think it should, wielding far more power and influence than is widely understood. Its members are also symbols and as such easily co-opted. These days the Cambridges and the Sussexes are proxies in culture wars that rage across social media and in banner headlines, with William and Kate standing for a stodgy status quo and Harry and Meghan for progressive ideals.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Polls indicate a rapidly growing disaffection with the royals among the young. Who is left in the Windsors to connect with them?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Neither characterisation is full or fully accurate. Those fighting the Cambridges’ corner assume the Sussexes must be losing the battle for hearts and minds, as UK-based polls show Harry’s popularity plummeting and Meghan’s, never high, slip further into net negative. Once again, this misses the point. A YouGov survey taken in the wake of the Sussexes’ allegations, in their interview with Oprah Winfrey, of racism by an unnamed senior royal and William’s riposte (“we are very much not a racist family”) showed that 20% of respondents believed the royal family was in fact racist. That figure rose to 43% among respondents of colour, with 40% in favour of Britain switching the monarch for an elected head of state.</p> <p>Weeks later, a second poll indicated a similar, and rapidly growing, disaffection with the royals among the young – and who is left among the Windsors to connect with them? (The eldest of the Cambridge children is only nine. Andrew’s reputed suggestion that his daughters be elevated to the front ranks of working royals is only slightly more brain-stretching than the idea that the Wessexes could fill a Meghan-and-Harry-shaped hole.)</p> <p>William and Kate appear irretrievably tainted in the eyes of significant sections of their potential future subjects in the UK as well as the overseas realms, and that’s by no means the only legacy of the split. Who knows what wounds Harry’s memoir, expected later this year, will inflict – and his father has much to fear. Charles’s obvious affection for his boys and glowing happiness with Camilla had begun to endear him to the public. That image is under pressure just as older scandals are coming home to roost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eed834b2fcde27222576e1c3b7dd1c0559031609\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eed834b2fcde27222576e1c3b7dd1c0559031609/279_159_3210_1927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Andrew (right) being interviewed by the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, at Buckingham Palace in November 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Andrew’s interview with the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, in November 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Harrison/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His brother Andrew’s interview with the BBC’s Emily Maitlis wasn’t just a gobsmacking own goal. It revealed the complicity of the royals in continuing to provide uncritical harbour despite Andrew’s association with a convicted paedophile and in the teeth of allegations against him of sexual assault by Virginia Giuffre. At Prince Philip’s funeral, the Queen sat hunched alone in her pew for a service scaled down by Covid precautions from stateliness to mortal dimensions, an icon of grief and dignity. By the time of her husband’s larger memorial, attention focused on Andrew’s jarring presence at her side and the damaging implications of affording him such prominence.</p> <p>In settling the civil suit brought by Giuffre, Andrew made no admission of guilt, but raised another neuralgic issue for the royal family: money. The Treasury denied UK taxpayers were footing the bill, but a public sandbagged by the soaring cost of living isn’t easily mollified. Royal finances are anyway opaque, deliberately so, derived from a mixture of estate incomes, grants and investments. To the outside world, the family appears to be rolling in it – so why have there been so many stories over the years of members borrowing or tin-rattling among the super-rich? “The royals have relatively little private money,” says a former palace insider. “That’s why they’re always trying to get money… There is also the question about where [their money] comes from since they cannot own anything they are given in their public roles.”</p> <p>This definition of “relatively little” is open to challenge, but the former insider cites an interesting example: “Whenever the Saudis give the Prince of Wales a horse, he views it as a bill, not a present. He can’t sell it. He has to house it and feed it for the rest of its life.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The danger for Prince Charles – and the monarchy – is that his history is studded with unexploded ordnance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As king, Charles is likely to receive many more burdensome gifts, but he will also benefit directly from the annual sovereign grant, earmarked for the fulfilment of head of state duties. Such duties will be his focus. His days of trying to coax funding for his charitable empire from the wealthy donors his staff dub “Bond villains” should be over. “Clearly, I won’t be able to do the same things I’ve done as heir, so of course you operate within the constitutional parameters,” he declared in a BBC documentary marking his 70th birthday.</p> <p>The danger for him – and the monarchy; these things are indivisible – is that his history is studded with unexploded ordnance. In the new edition of my Charles biography, I revisit a small, private, fundraising dinner I attended in 2013 at Dumfries House, a stately home in Scotland rescued by him from redevelopment and turned into a base for his charities and initiatives. Seven of his and Camilla’s guests that night, existing or potential backers, would subsequently find themselves embroiled in news stories involving misdemeanours, criminal or otherwise, from money laundering to, in the case of Camilla’s nephew Ben Elliot, now co-chairman of the Conservative party, and David – now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/27/lord-david-brownlow-tory-donor-paid-no-10-refurbishment-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Lord – Brownlow</a>, an arrangement to fund golden wallpaper and other furbelows as part of Boris Johnson’s renovation of his Downing Street residence.</p> <p>This is not to suggest the guests themselves have been guilty of impropriety, but rather that King Charles will be judged not only on his future decisions but past associations and actions. These include his determination to reappoint and promote his former valet, Michael Fawcett, to ever higher positions despite two resignations and serial controversies. As then chief executive of Dumfries House, Fawcett presided at the 2013 dinner. Late last year he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/12/prince-charless-former-aide-quits-as-charity-boss-amid-cash-for-honours-claims\" title=\"\">resigned from all his royal roles</a>, this time amid allegations that he solicited a charitable donation against the promise of a knighthood. In February, Scotland Yard launched an investigation under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925.</p> <p>Charles has weathered more than a few scandals and won over more than a few sceptics. His environmentalism, once widely derided, resonates more widely than it did. He remains, however, a polarising figure trying to navigate an increasingly polarised world. The primary role of a head of state is to unify. This could be a bumpy ride.</p> <p><em>Extracted from </em><em>Charles: The Heart of a King </em><em>by </em><em>Catherine Mayer</em><em>, new edition published by </em><em>WH Allen</em><em> on </em><em>25 August 2022</em><em>, </em><em>£10.99</em><em>.</em><em> </em></p> <p><em>© Catherine Mayer 2015, 2022</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/20/game-over-the-ritz-takes-grouse-off-the-menu-in-victory-for-environment-campaigners","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T15:29:06Z","webTitle":"Game over – the Ritz takes grouse off the menu in victory for environment campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/20/game-over-the-ritz-takes-grouse-off-the-menu-in-victory-for-environment-campaigners","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/20/game-over-the-ritz-takes-grouse-off-the-menu-in-victory-for-environment-campaigners","fields":{"headline":"Game over – the Ritz takes grouse off the menu in victory for environment campaigners","trailText":"Some restaurants are listening, with Corrigan’s not sourcing from intensive shoots and the Ritz not serving a Glorious Twelfth dish","byline":"Helena Horton","body":"<p>From 12 August to early December, it’s usually possible to walk into old-fashioned fine dining establishments across the country and order the rare British delicacy that is grouse, frequently served with bread sauce and game chips.</p> <p>But those hoping to eat the tiny game bird in the gilded Ritz dining room in London will be out of luck this year, as the world-famous hotel has quietly removed it from the menu after an outcry from environmental campaigners.</p> <p>Luke Steele, executive director of wildlife campaign group Wild Moors, celebrated the news: “Behind every shot grouse on a restaurant menu is a moorland where foxes, stoats and weasels have suffered in traps and snares, and carbon-rich peatlands has been set ablaze.

Large driven shoots – it doesn’t sit easy with me any more.</p> <p>“We are doing a little grouse pie, which is two breasts of grouse. I put some duck liver in the middle and it’s wrapped in pastry.

It is a dish built for pure gluttony.”</p> <p>In fact, the shooting community has celebrated a good year of demand for the bird, with restaurants buying about the same supplies as normal.</p> <p>Adrian Blackmore, director of shooting at the Countryside Alliance, said: “Sadly, because of insufficient stocks, some moors aren’t shooting, mainly in the Peak District and on the western fringes of the North Pennines and Yorkshire Dales, but many other moors in other areas are seeing very healthy stocks of grouse, with some good bags being recorded, especially now the weather has become cooler.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/britains-national-parks-dominated-by-driven-grouse-moors-says-study\">Britain’s national parks dominated by driven grouse moors, says study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This is clearly really good news for many communities in our uplands for whom grouse shooting is so important economically, environmentally and socially.

The RSPB’s Duncan Orr-Ewing said: “We take no issue with shooting of red grouse, provided it is carried out legally and sustainably. However, the most intensive form of ‘driven’ grouse shooting, which involves shooting large numbers of grouse by sporting clients, can be associated with illegal killing of birds of prey and burning on deep peatland soils, which damages vital carbon stores, as well as use of lead ammunition toxic to wildlife and humans.</p> <p>“We encourage all restaurants that serve red grouse to check that the birds are supplied from environmentally reputable sources.”</p> <p>The Ritz declined to comment but confirmed that grouse is not currently on the menu.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/20/frankie-dettori-goes-his-own-way-to-take-ebor-aboard-trawlerman","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T15:21:38Z","webTitle":"Frankie Dettori goes his own way to take Ebor aboard Trawlerman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/20/frankie-dettori-goes-his-own-way-to-take-ebor-aboard-trawlerman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/20/frankie-dettori-goes-his-own-way-to-take-ebor-aboard-trawlerman","fields":{"headline":"Frankie Dettori goes his own way to take Ebor aboard Trawlerman","trailText":"John Gosden and Frankie Dettori, who had a falling-out in June, teamed up to win the Ebor Handicap at York with Trawlerman pipping Alfred Boucher","byline":"Greg Wood","body":"<p>John Gosden compared his brief falling-out with Frankie Dettori this year to a football manager benching a star player after trainer and jockey combined to win the £500,000 Ebor Handicap at York on Saturday, and Dettori’s memorable ride on Trawlerman was the rough equivalent of a solo run and strike by a centre-forward whose confidence is restored after a lean spell.</p> \n<p>Dettori took a bold approach to Trawlerman’s wide draw in stall 20, galloping alone and in a clear lead towards the far rail as his 19 opponents sorted themselves out on the inside.

Close!’”</p> \n<p>Perhaps recalling his narrow defeat on Lady Aurelia in the 2017 Nunthorpe Stakes, when the rider celebrated victory only to be denied when the judge called Marsha the winner, Dettori remained impassive until the result was confirmed, but he had a short-head to spare at the line.</p> \n<p>Gosden recalled Golden Horn’s victory in Paris afterwards and his Ebor win with Muntahaa in 2018, also from an outside draw. “When we went and walked the course before the Arc with GH, we saw how wide his draw was and Frankie said, ‘I’m just going to stay out there, I’m going to stay out there until the last moment,’” Gosden said.</p> \n<p>“We did it here with Muntahaa and Jim Crowley, in fact, he thought I was mad but I said: ‘No, it’s a Baldrick plan that can work.’ And today, as soon as we saw the draw, I said, I know what we’re doing.”</p> \n<p>With diplomatic relations between the trainer and his stable jockey now fully restored, Gosden also suggested that their initial falling-out after several setbacks at Royal Ascot in June had ultimately had a positive effect. “The only reason it ever happened is that I couldn’t get his attention,” Gosden said. “I couldn’t get him to concentrate, that’s all, and in the end, it required a bit of a public warning and that’s the way it is.</p> \n<p>“What do you call it, ‘left on the bench’ if you’re a football manager? And he’s just ridden two fantastic races today, won the hugely valuable City of York Stakes and this, so when our man’s in the zone, he’s absolutely top class.

There is no suggestion it has been misused or participants’ privacy compromised.</p> <p>Biobank said data was only given to bona fide researchers, who must agree to store it securely and use it for a specified purpose, adding that it has “stringent controls” in place including “rigorous access and ethics checks”.</p> <p>The data-sharing is facing scrutiny amid a shift in geopolitical relations, with analysts raising concerns about the challenges of monitoring usage beyond UK borders and a lack of reciprocal data-sharing by China.</p> <p>Biobank said researchers accessing its data were bound by agreements dictating how it could be used and that usage and outputs were “regularly monitored”. But it said relationships relied on trust and that it was not feasible for projects to be overseen closely. Some projects involve the transfer of data to China for projects conducted without UK collaboration.</p> <p>Professor Jonathan Adams, from the Policy Institute at King’s College London, and co-author of a report analysing UK-China research collaborations, said the data-sharing was “problematic” and questioned how Biobank could police usage.</p> <p>He said there were “huge potential returns from having a good, positive, open relationship” with China but that current relationships relied “far too much on things like formal agreements, which we believe will protect things in a way they would if we were working with conventional partners”. “China is different. It’s transformed into a public research culture over a very short period, and the norms we expect are not necessarily universally adopted. My concern is that what gets published in English would be the bit above water that you can see,” he said.</p> <p>Professor Yves Moreau, a geneticist who has worked on projects using data from UK Biobank, described the resource as “world-class” and said scientists had a “moral duty” to share knowledge, but raised concerns about the potential for misuse – such as researchers linking the data with other datasets – or for the authorities to interfere.</p> <p>“We are totally unprepared for a situation where an institution and national authorities would support the misconduct of the scientist,” he said. “It’s about being watchful, and looking into the issue to find a proper balance, so we don’t wake up in 10 years and realise, ‘Oh, what did we do?’”</p> <p>Launched in 2006 with the goal of furthering open science, the UK Biobank project, partly funded by the Department of Health, stores in-depth genetic and health information on about 500,000 people.</p> <p>Since 2012, approved researchers from around the world have been able to pay £3,000 to £9,000 for access to datasets, including questionnaires and physical measurements; linked health records; and whole genome sequence data. The resulting research has produced key insights into diseases including cancer and heart disease, as well as crucial data on Covid-19.</p> <p>In 2012, the UK government actively encouraged partnerships with China, resulting in a “golden age” of collaborations between 2014 and 2019 that led to initiatives by <a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-12-08-china-vice-premier-oxford-signing-research-collaboration\" title=\"\">universities including Oxford</a>.</p> <p>But Beijing’s relationship with the west has soured, with concerns over human rights abuses and aggression in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Last month, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/06/fbi-mi5-china-spying-cyberattacks-business-economy\" title=\"\">heads of MI5 and the FBI warned</a> of a “game-changing threat” from China’s efforts to steal technology. China denied the claims and said the security services were “spreading all kinds of China-related lies”.</p> <p>Guidance from the UK’s Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, published in March, meanwhile, warned that China’s National Intelligence Law – which allows intelligence agencies to force businesses and individuals to hand over data and assets on request – could “affect the level of control” UK researchers have over information shared with Chinese universities.</p> <p>The Chinese government has explicitly highlighted health tech, including genomics, as an area of strategic focus, identifying it as a priority in its Made in China 2025 plan. In the US, intelligence officials have claimed that China is collecting genetic data from around the world in an effort to develop the world’s largest bio-database. At the same time, the Chinese health ministry has tightened access to data on its own citizens by international researchers, citing national security. Dr Joy Zhang, a reader in sociology and expert in China’s science policies at the University of Kent, said: “China is tightening its regulations and it seems to be so hard to get data from China, when we’re generously sharing ours. That is a legitimate concern in terms of scientific advancement.”</p> <p>Many of the studies using Biobank data were paid for by the Chinese state-funded National Natural Science Foundation, which aims to “promote progress in science and technology” and “the harmonious socio-economic development of the nation”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/02/investors-flock-to-life-science-as-uk-firms-break-funding-record\">Investors flock to life sciences as UK sector breaks funding record</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK Biobank said it shared data with researchers from more than 100 countries under its “equitable, transparent and non-discriminatory” open-access policy, and that it was no surprise researchers from China were included in this.</p> <p>It added that those receiving data are prohibited from using it to re-identify individuals and are required to report breaches, with no such incidents reported to date. While genetic data derived from DNA has been shared with researchers in China, physical samples have not been, a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Mark Effingham, deputy chief executive of Biobank, added that it had not been contacted directly about the data-sharing by the government but kept its policies under review. “We actively monitor national security concerns and welcome dialogue with the government on this, while remaining committed to open science and the promotion of global public health,” he said. “The more scientific research we enable, the more insight is gained into the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease.”</p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said it wanted to enable “collaborative research” while ensuring national security and data protection, and had published guidance on collaborating with international partners to help researchers “manage risks”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/20/afghan-female-judge-fleeing-taliban-appeals-after-home-office-refuse-uk-entry","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T15:04:15Z","webTitle":"Afghan female judge fleeing Taliban appeals after Home Office refuses UK entry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/20/afghan-female-judge-fleeing-taliban-appeals-after-home-office-refuse-uk-entry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/20/afghan-female-judge-fleeing-taliban-appeals-after-home-office-refuse-uk-entry","fields":{"headline":"Afghan female judge fleeing Taliban appeals after Home Office refuses UK entry","trailText":"Lawyers say the woman, who is in hiding in Pakistan with her son, will be killed if sent back to Afghanistan","byline":"Miranda Bryant","body":"<p>A female former senior judge from Afghanistan who is in hiding from the Taliban with her son has filed an appeal to the Home Office after her application to enter the UK was denied.</p> <p>Lawyers for the woman – who is named as “Y” – said on Saturday they had submitted an appeal on behalf of their client and her son at the Immigration Tribunal, saying she had been left in a “gravely vulnerable position” by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/07/shameful-afghans-who-helped-uk-abandoned-to-a-life-of-fear-under-the-taliban\">withdrawal of British and other western troops</a>.</p> <p>They said the British government’s decision has stopped them from joining British and settled family members in the UK who said they are “very afraid she will take her own life”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/15/uk-treatment-of-afghan-refugees-continues-to-be-source-of-shame\">UK treatment of Afghan refugees ‘continues to be source of shame’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The woman, 52, and her son, 24, fled Afghanistan and are in hiding in Pakistan after their home in Kabul was attacked and several of her former colleagues assassinated, her lawyers said in a statement.</p> <p>There are believed to be about 70 Afghan women judges in Afghanistan, and about 70 more who have escaped but are in similar conditions to Y.</p> <p>Katie Newbury, a partner at Kingsley Napley, the firm representing her, said the mother and son “are not safe or secure where they are now and they have close family in the UK eager to support them”.</p> <p>“Since November we have repeatedly chased the Home Office for a decision given the precarious situation,” she wrote on<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatieNewburyKN/status/1560899844528607232?s=20&amp;t=Yx_DGieVsO5wtuVeDc9U-A\"> Twitter</a>, adding that the Home Office had “dragged their feet”.</p> <p>At one point, she said they were told that the delays were due to resources being redirected to Ukraine.

Instead of digging down it has been built upward, using only the tools and methods available in the Middle Ages and, wherever possible, locally sourced materials. Now, in an unforeseen twist of fate, Guédelon is playing a vital role in restoring the structure and soul of Notre Dame cathedral.</p> <p>Paris’s imposing 13th-century cathedral, a world heritage site, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/16/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-a-visual-guide-and-timeline\" title=\"\">consumed by fire</a> in April 2019, destroying its complex roof structure, known as <em>La Forêt </em>because of the large number of trees used in its construction. The widespread view was that it would be impossible to rebuild it as it was.</p> <p>“The roof frame was extremely sophisticated, using techniques that were advanced for the 12th and 13th centuries,” Frédéric Épaud, a medieval wood specialist, tells the<em> Observer.</em></p> <p>“After the fire, there were a lot of people saying it would take thousands of trees, and we didn’t have enough of the right ones, and the wood would have to be dried for years, and nobody even knew anything about how to produce beams like they did in the Middle Ages.

Boudy, 51, trained as a baker, then an electrician, until discovering his vocation at Guédelon. He explains how hand-hewing each beam – a single piece from a single tree – respects the “heart” of the green wood that gives it its strength and resistance.</p> <p>“We have 25 years’ experience of cutting, squaring and hewing wood by hand,” he says. “It’s what we [have done] every day for 25 years. There are people outside of here who can do it now, but I tell you they all came here to learn how. If this place didn’t exist, perhaps the experts would have said: no it’s not possible to reproduce the roof of Notre Dame. We [have shown that] it is.</p> <p>“This isn’t just nostalgia. If Notre Dame’s roof lasted 800 years, it is because of this. There’s no heart in sawmill wood,” he says.</p> <p>Maryline Martin is co-founder of the Guédelon project that attracts around 300,000 paying visitors every year and was featured in a 2014 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04sv5nc\" title=\"\">BBC documentary series, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04sv5nc\" title=\"\">Secrets of the Castle</a></em>.

We are a private enterprise lost in our forest that receives no public money. We work with many state research bodies, but some people wrote us off as a theme park,” she says.</p> <p>“Now, after 25 years, we are the only ones who can understand and are able to do what has to be done, and they discover we have not sold our soul to the devil. Our people will be working on Notre Dame one way or another, but why would we want to go to Paris? We will continue our 13th-century work here.”</p> <p>Florian Renucci, the Guédelon site manager and a philosopher turned master mason, has already been asked to oversee training of artisans expected to work on Notre Dame.</p> <p>“All we heard over and again after Notre Dame burned was that it was not possible to reconstruct the roof as before. There was no wood, no <em>savoir faire</em> – it was an argument used by those who wanted to modernise. We showed that it can be done and we know how to do it,” he says.</p> <p>Épaud is on the scientific committee at Guédelon and the committee overseeing the reconstruction of Notre Dame, as well as a member of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), France’s national research body. He says that going back to build the future is not just nostalgia.</p> <p>“I have studied the 13th-century technique for many years and, if we respect the internal form of the tree, the beams will last for 800 years. Guédelon is the only place in France, and I believe in Europe, where they build this kind of roof structure in wood. All those who didn’t think it was possible didn’t know about Guédelon.”</p> <p>He adds: “But it shouldn’t be rushed. Macron’s insistence that the cathedral be open by 2024 is idiotic. We are talking about a cathedral, we’re not in a hurry and we have the money to do it the right way. If we rush it, there’s a risk it [will] be done badly and something is missed. Sadly, I fear Macron doesn’t understand that.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2022/aug/20/south-korea-culture-fine-art-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T15:00:44Z","webTitle":"K-boom!

But they are still using the artefacts and objects and mannerisms from their own traditions,” she said.</p> <p>Much of the work showcased in the Coronet’s month-long season might be described as “avant garde”, except that both Korean street food and popular mass entertainment have already served as an advance guard, paving the way for a more sophisticated influx of leading Korean artists. In fact, two years ago, BTS, the superstar K-pop boy band, deliberately made a link with the fine art world by sponsoring 22 art installations in London, Buenos Aires, Berlin, New York and Seoul called Connect, BTS.

Things did not turn out as planned. “It was just so difficult to ask people who were in different stages of grief and vulnerability if I could photograph them, so much so that I began to question not just my original idea but my integrity.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I diavoli dance through the streets in nightmarish masks, frightening children and mock-threatening adults</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Out of that moment of self-doubt grew another, very different idea, which has come to fruition 15 years later. Initially, Tomlinson turned her attention to the religious festivals that take place in Venice during Holy Week and on saints’ days<em> </em>but her curiosity was steadily drawn to more remote places where the ritual celebrations were more atavistic and mysterious. Most of<strong> </strong>the portraits and landscapes that comprise <em>Gli Isolani (The Islanders)</em>, her new <a href=\"https://gostbooks.com/product/gli-isolani-the-islanders/\">book</a><em>,</em> and <a href=\"https://hackelbury.co.uk/alys-tomlinson-gli-isolani-the-islanders/\">exhibition</a>, were made in the mountainous towns and villages of Sardinia and Sicily, where the participants often don animal hides and grotesque masks as they parade though the streets. Their costumes hark back centuries to the fantastical creatures of local fairytales and further back still to pre-Christian rituals that marked the changing of the seasons or acknowledged the power of the natural landscape and the animals therein – oxen, stags and devilish goats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c97a968c96de3c89b1502a619af34b9905b4c93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c97a968c96de3c89b1502a619af34b9905b4c93/0_0_2834_3543/800.jpg\" alt=\"One man wearing rough woolly skins with two rows of bells; another with his back covered in giant bells\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is Sonaggiaos, Ortueri, Sardinia, from Gli Isolani.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alys Tomlinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Even among the villages themselves, there is no real agreement on the origins of the festivals,” says Tomlinson, who spent two years travelling back and forth to Sicily and Sardinia. “But the different rituals and traditions are all very specific to the villages in which they take place. They draw hundreds of people on to the streets and there is an obvious dichotomy between the religious context and the often raucous and boozy celebrations.”</p> <p>That wildly communal dynamic, though, is nowhere to be seen in Tomlinson’s portraits. Instead, she isolated her subjects on empty village streets and in rural landscapes and photographed them in stark monochrome using a large format plate camera mounted on a tripod. The results are, if anything, even more ominous and unsettling: young men covered in animal hides, their faces concealed by wooden masks; women draped head to toe in funereal black; squat figures bedecked in rough woolly skins, their backs arrayed with rows of giant bells that usually hang from the necks of livestock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b98b468ef2f61de260a2013b3d57f5ee479e37eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b98b468ef2f61de260a2013b3d57f5ee479e37eb/0_0_2834_3543/800.jpg\" alt=\"Masked man with a lariat in one hand sitting on a hillside\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Issohadore, Mamoiada, Sardinia, from Gli Isolani.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alys Tomlinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These last are known as <em>is sonaggiaos</em> and represent flocks of sheep in a Sardinian festival that also features <em>s’urtzu</em>, the boar-demon that causes havoc by attacking onlookers and clambering up trees and buildings. In the mountain town of Prizzi in Sicily, the collision of the pagan and the Christian is even more dramatic as devils dance through the streets in nightmarish masks, frightening children and mock-threatening the adults, before surrendering to Jesus and the Virgin Mary. “With their gaping teeth and raggedy manes (crowned by two horns),” writes the art critic Sabrina Mandanici in her essay in the book, “they look more like the Wild Things in search of their jungle.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3fed483ccc26c69db99d345b1b84732e00d5780\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3fed483ccc26c69db99d345b1b84732e00d5780/0_0_2834_3543/800.jpg\" alt=\"Man with outstretched arms wearing a huge devil mask\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Il Diavolo, Prizzi, Sicily, from Gli Isolani.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alys Tomlinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tomlinson balances the otherness with moments of calm beauty, not just elemental landscapes but portraits of striking young women in more traditional dress, like the nun-like black damask and intricate white lace costumes of Tempio Pausania in the Gallura region of northern Sardinia.

That came after a strong year in the previous 12 months when pre-tax profits soared 60% to £9.6m and the company paid out more than £1m to its shareholders – who still include the founder, Andrew Ritchie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/27/how-we-made-the-brompton-folding-bicycle\" title=\"\">who designed</a> the bike in his shed in 1975.</p> <p>The group now employs 800 people worldwide, including 650 at its UK manufacturing base in Greenford, up from about 400 five years ago.

He is so passionate about the need to encourage others to work on solving real-world problems such as climate change that he has written a book, <em>The Brompton: Engineering for Change</em>, about his philosophy and the development of the folding bike.</p> <p>They are not cheap. Starting from £850 for a basic model and rising to £3,970 for a four-speed, super-lightweight titanium version, one might expect such luxuries to be set aside amid a probable recession and cost of living crisis. But Butler-Adams insists his bikes remain affordable – in the same way as a car – as they can last decades, save time and money, and improve health.</p> <p>“If it adds value to your life it is a good investment and lasts 15 to 30 years. How many products can do that? It is good value not because it is cheap but because it is so bloody good,” he says.</p> <p>“[Elon Musk’s] SpaceX may be doing amazing things with rockets but the bicycle is by a long chalk the most efficient mode of transport.”</p> <p>China is Brompton’s fastest growing market, as the country turns <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/22/bike-wars-dockless-china-millions-bicycles-hangzhou\" title=\"\">back to bicycles</a> in its cities, with Shanghai building new cycle lanes. “We are in it to change how people live in a city. If the bike is not relevant now then when is it?” says Butler-Adams.</p> <p>“You can see what’s happening on a global scale. Even in the US, [which is used to] gas guzzling, they are shifting and the younger generation are not getting a driving licence.</p> <p>“Cities are facing up to the need to change and put humans and families at their heart. Think how many cars are taking up space, how much that real estate is worth to people.”</p> <p>He says that the popularity of electric scooters may well be paving the way for younger people to embrace cycling in a way their parents have found harder. “From scooter to bike you are 90% of the way there. Getting someone out of the bus or car is a much bigger step,” he says.</p> <p>Still, the short term may feel like an uphill slog for Brompton after some free-wheeling sales and profit rises for a couple of years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92563e5ac1d48688b5445782cc6bfa7e6308c671\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92563e5ac1d48688b5445782cc6bfa7e6308c671/0_17_4781_2870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A passenger carries a Brompton on the platform at Munich Central Station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A passenger carries a Brompton on the platform at Munich Central Station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tobias Hase/dpa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Costs are up about 10% across the board – from steel to labour – and not all of this can be passed on to customers, putting pressure on profit margins. Sales of its electric bikes are also rather slower than hoped after hold-ups on key parts, such as motors and batteries, at the height of the pandemic.</p> <p>While sales of the ebikes have doubled to 12,000 since the launch year in 2019, Butler-Adams admits they are likely to make up less than 40% of sales, from hopes of half, as the extra weight of the battery-operated version has cancelled out Brompton’s USP – the ease of carrying the bike on public transport.</p> <p>Brompton has meanwhile invested £700,000 in robotics to try to make its UK manufacturing even more efficient and piled more into research and innovation. For example, the company is developing super-light titanium bikes – just 2,500 of which will be made this year – in partnership with the Sheffield-based specialist CW Fletcher. That has put the company into debt for the first time in 20 years, just as interest rates are on the rise.</p> <p>Butler-Adams adds that Brexit has also been “across the board negative” for Brompton, adding costs and bureaucracy and generally reducing efficiency. This year is the first time that workers have not seen their pay rise in line with the cost of living as Butler-Adams tries to avoid embedding inflation.</p> <p>The price of Brompton’s bikes is set to rise by about 5% in October, following a similar increase last year. Butler-Adams says the company is sharing the pain of cost rises with its customers.</p> <p>But he sees Brompton’s focus on quality, producing an item which will last decades with a bit of love and tinkering, as playing to a general shift towards buying fewer but better goods that will last.</p> <p>Butler-Adams says: “We have got to buy less stuff and we need it to be more efficient. The bicycle is the way forward.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/20/watkins-family-hour-vol-ii-review-a-great-night-out-with-ringside-seats","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T15:00:43Z","webTitle":"Watkins Family Hour: Vol II review – a great night out with ringside seats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/20/watkins-family-hour-vol-ii-review-a-great-night-out-with-ringside-seats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/20/watkins-family-hour-vol-ii-review-a-great-night-out-with-ringside-seats","fields":{"headline":"Watkins Family Hour: Vol II review – a great night out with ringside seats","trailText":"US siblings Sara and Sean Watkins are joined by Fiona Apple, Jackson Browne and more on another set of old classics and new favourites in Nashville form","byline":"Neil Spencer","body":"<p>It takes a special chemistry for any residency to endure for 20 years.

The Yellow river and the Yangtze river will not flow backward,” Li said, striking an upbeat tone while visiting Yantian Port, a gateway to Europe and North America, two of China’s biggest markets.</p> <p>“The waters of Yantian Port will also flow incessantly, and not only will continue to maintain your advantages, but also expand your advantages,” Li added. Yet last year, the traffic was far from incessant: Covid rules shut the port, delaying deliveries over Christmas. This spring, similar restrictions forced vessels to queue to enter.</p> <p>Since the start of this year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/23/china-covid-lockdown-shanghai-economy\" title=\"\">China’s insistence on a zero-Covid policy </a>has caused much inconvenience and uncertainty for its people and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/china-economy-slows-unexpectedly-as-covid-and-property-crisis-bite\" title=\"\">the struggling economy</a>, prompting grave concerns inside the country about what comes next.</p> <p>“The property sector is ailing, investments are all falling, and people are saving rather than spending,” says Hong Hao, a prominent market analyst whose social media account was censored this year after downbeat remarks about the economic outlook.</p> <p>Hong highlights three big headaches for Beijing policymakers: Covid, property and troubling relations with major western countries. “But there are obstacles all over the place really, and it’s hard to discern which one is the biggest.”</p> <p>These stumbling blocks will almost certainly lead to China missing its own economic growth target of “around 5.5%” this year, which Li set in March. In another worrying development, the July unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds reached a record 19.9%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.</p> <p>So much so, a recent politburo meeting chaired by the president, Xi Jinping, omitted any mention of a GDP goal, instead suggesting the country should “stabilise employment and prices, maintain economic operations within a reasonable range, and strive to achieve the best possible results”.</p> <p>The worries expressed inside China are palpable, though there is also consensus that if its growth model does not reform, the economy will soon run out of the steam. But any change – for example through Beijing’s tough policies for the property sector announced in 2020 – would result in major disruption, at least in the short-to-near term. In other words, Beijing is facing a real policy dilemma.</p> <p>“The two fundamental problems for China are a natural growth slowdown and improving its regulatory environment,” says Nancy Qian, an economics professor at Northwestern University in Chicago. “Both are standard growing pains as the economy grows from a low-income to a higher-middle-income one.”</p> <p>Qian says China’s growth is slowing and will plateau because it has reached limits set by its fundamentals. “One cannot reduce unemployment without creating new jobs. But how can there be new jobs if existing firms don’t make more money? And many firms, like the real-estate firms and construction industry in trouble today, have been doing much worse than we thought.”</p> <p>The bad economic performance may be unavoidable, but it has real social – and potentially political – consequences. This is particularly the case for a system without the safety valve of elections.</p> <p>Last month, it emerged that hundreds of homebuyers across the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/19/mortgage-strikes-threaten-chinas-economic-and-political-stability\" title=\"\">were huddling together to refuse payments on mortgages on homes</a> left unfinished by developers. On social media, angry buyers discussed ways to attract the government’s attention in order to put pressure on “greedy and dishonest developers”.</p> <p>Sensing a social crisis in the making, Beijing quickly came up with measures to smooth out the tensions and aid the property sector – which accounts for 25% of the Chinese economy. Some local officials produced novel ideas, such as encouraging party members to lead the buying spree.</p> <p>“I hope that today all comrades will take the lead in buying property,” Deng Bibo, a county party secretary in Hunan province, urged in a viral video this week. “Buy one property, then buy a second one. If you purchased a second one already, then buy a third. Bought a third? Then buy your fourth.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptYtiPu4pOM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ptYtiPu4pOM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Deng Bibo, a county party secretary of China’s Hunan province, encouraged everyone to buy several homes during his opening speech for a real estate exhibition fair in Shimen, a county of Hunan.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Qian says the real-estate crisis is one example of the difficulty of maturing the regulatory system for a rapidly growing economy.

It worked as long as the economy was growing. But at some point the music stops.</p> <p>Now China is stuck in a vicious circle. “The faster the slowdown, the bigger the problem,” says Qian. “The less trust consumers have in the economy, the less willing they are to keep paying for incomplete housing, and the bigger the problem. The faster the slowdown, the less trust consumers have.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/billionaire-xiao-jianhua-jailed-china\">Billionaire Xiao Jianhua jailed for 13 years in China</a> </p> </aside>  <p>China’s domestic trouble also has an international dimension.

The red lights of recession are flashing.</p> <p>The eurozone’s big four economies – Germany, France, Italy and Spain – have all had their growth forecasts for 2023 downgraded by the International Monetary Fund, as a combination of the war and higher interest rates put a brake on activity.</p> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis-recession-looms\" title=\"\">inflation is above 10%</a> for the first time in 40 years as households struggle with rising energy bills. The Bank of England forecasts inflation will peak above 13% in autumn after a fresh increase in energy costs, while the economy will fall into a lengthy recession.</p> <p>While Britain is contending with additional pressures from Brexit, the impact of soaring energy prices, supply chain disruption, shortages of workers and drought are also hitting the rest of Europe. Analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit say the pain could go on for some time, because countries must wean themselves off Russian hydrocarbons, and building up renewables as an alternative will take time.</p> <p>“In the near term we expect a recession in Europe in the winter of 2022-23 as a result of energy shortages and sustained elevated inflation”, the EIU said. “The winter of 2023-24 will also be challenging, and so we expect high inflation and sluggish growth until at least 2024.”</p> <p>Here we assess the chances of recession in the EU – and Russia. </p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>Europe’s largest economy is in the centre of the storm, as the energy crisis, months without rainfall, and a breakdown in global trade batter its manufacturing base. Economic growth slowed to stall speed in the second quarter and is likely to turn negative in the coming months.</p> <p>“It will need an economic miracle for Germany not to fall into recession in the second half of the year,” said Carsten Brzeski of the Dutch bank ING. “The fact that the entire German economic business model is currently up for renovation will also weigh on growth prospects in the coming years.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-19-04:50:44/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph showing inflation rising fast in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-19-04:50:44/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Russia supplied more than half of Germany’s gas in 2020 and about a third of all oil. Since the outbreak of war, the Kremlin has throttled supplies, blaming technical problems for a fall in volume through the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline.</p> <p>Drought and scorching temperatures have caused a sharp fall in water levels on the Rhine, a key transport route for Germany’s dominant industrial sector. Water levels have fallen below the critical 40cm mark, preventing barges from being loaded to full capacity. Some routes have been cancelled, causing delays for chemicals firms and other manufacturers in industrial heartlands. Factories along the shores of the Rhine dependent on water for cooling have also faced problems, while coal shipments to power plants – which had been earmarked for keeping the lights on – are likely to be disrupted.</p> <p>In response to the energy crisis, Berlin will impose a gas levy for households, due to come into effect from October and lasting until April 2024, which is designed to spread the higher wholesale cost between households and industry.</p> <p>The government has put in place an energy support package worth more than €30bn (£26bn), including a €300 lump sum for workers, extra support for those on welfare, cuts to petrol and diesel taxes and discounted €9 bus and train tickets.</p> <p>The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has also promised a fresh package of financial support.</p> <p><strong>Chances of recession (out of five) • • • • </strong> </p> <h2>France</h2> <p>France should be better insulated than many other European nations, thanks to its large nuclear energy sector, which accounts for just over 70% of its electricity generation, but it has been struggling with serious faults at ageing reactors. Although in a less parlous position than Germany, the eurozone’s second-biggest economy could still face damaging power cuts this winter.</p> <p>GDP rose in France by 0.5% in the second quarter, lower than in other nations across the continent, with domestic consumption notably weak. The government has put in place an emergency support package worth €20bn, including tax cuts at petrol pumps, while capping an increase in regulated electricity prices at 4%, a policy helped by state ownership of the energy giant EDF.</p> <p><strong>Chances of recession • •</strong></p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p>The Italian economy has performed much more strongly recently than its big eurozone rivals, notching up growth of 1% in the second quarter. But like Germany, Italy is heavily dependent on Russian gas and has the added complication of being thrown into a fresh bout of political uncertainty after the resignation of Mario Draghi as prime minister earlier this summer.</p> <p>Opinion polls point to a change of direction from Draghi’s technocratic approach following forthcoming elections. A rightwing coalition government that has been campaigning on a strongly nationalistic and protectionist economic platform is expected to win.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-19-04:25:46/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph comparing expected growth in 2022 with expecetd growth in 2023, which is much lower, for Spain, France, Germany, Italy and the UK\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-19-04:25:46/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Financial markets and the European Central Bank are already alive to the risks of investors demanding a higher interest-rate premium for buying Italian bonds.

A tax cut on petrol and diesel, which had been due to expire this month, has also been extended to 20 September.</p> <p>Since the creation of the single currency almost a quarter of a century ago, Italy has been the weakest performing of the “big four”, with living standards barely higher than at the end of the 1990s. It is benefiting this year from a boost to tourism, which accounted for 13% of its GDP before the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>Chances of recession • • • </strong></p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p>Like every other country in Europe, Spain is affected by the war in Russia but of the big four it has the best chance of avoiding recession, despite soaring inflation.</p> <p>There are a number of reasons for this. Its economy went into the crisis in reasonably good shape and – like Italy – has been given an added boost by the surge in tourism after the pandemic. Tourism accounted for 12% of Spain’s GDP before Covid and an even bigger share of employment.</p> <p>But Spain is much less reliant on Russian energy than Italy, and is already a big importer of liquefied natural gas from around the world. GDP rose by 1.1% in the second quarter and the IMF expects it to be the fastest growing of the big four next year.</p> <p>The government has put in place €16bn of financial aid and loans to help companies and households with soaring energy costs.</p> <p><strong>Chances of recession • </strong></p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Russia has suffered under the west’s sanctions, plunging its economy into a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/russian-central-bank-says-economic-downturn-deepen-q3-2022-08-01/\" title=\"\">deep recession</a> and forcing the Kremlin to default on its foreign debts for the first time since 1918, though soaring energy prices have helped blunt some of the impact.</p> <p>Researchers from Yale University said last month that the west was crippling the Russian economy, although other experts disagree.

What could possibly go wrong?","byline":"John Naughton","body":"<p>It all started with the headline over an entry in Charlie Warzel’s <a href=\"https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/62f28a6bbcbd490021af2db4/where-does-alex-jones-go-from-here/\">Galaxy Brain newsletter</a> in the <em>Atlantic</em>: “Where Does Alex Jones Go From Here?” This is an interesting question because Jones is an internet troll so extreme that he makes Donald Trump look like Spinoza. For many years, he has parlayed a radio talkshow and a website into a comfortable multimillion-dollar business peddling nonsense, conspiracy theories, falsehoods and weird merchandise to a huge tribe of adherents. And until 4 August he had got away with it. On that day, though, he lost an epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/04/alex-jones-defamation-trial-verdict-sandy-hook\">defamation case</a> brought against him by parents of children who died in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting\">2012 Sandy Hook massacre</a> – a tragedy that he had consistently ridiculed as a staged hoax; a Texas jury decided that he should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/05/alex-jones-punitive-damages-sandy-hook-family\">pay nearly $50m in damages</a> for publishing this sadistic nonsense.</p> <p>Warzel’s newsletter consisted of an interview with someone who had worked for the Jones media empire in its heyday and, as such, was interesting. But what really caught my eye was the striking illustration that headed the piece. It showed a cartoonish image of a dishevelled Jones in some kind of cavern surrounded by papers, banknotes, prescriptions and other kinds of documents. Rather good, I thought, and then inspected the caption to see who the artist was. The answer: “AI art by Midjourney”.</p> <p>Ah! Midjourney is a research lab and also the name of its program that creates images from textual descriptions using a machine-learning system similar to OpenAI’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E\">Dall-E system</a>. So someone on the <em>Atlantic</em> had simply typed “Alex Jones inside an American office under fluorescent lights” into a text box and – bingo! – the illustration that had caught my attention was one of the images it had generated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You could, say, ask for a portrait of Shrek in the style of the Mona Lisa or Jane Austen as an astronaut</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It turns out that the <em>Atlantic</em> is not the only established publication in which the Midjourney tool’s work has appeared. The normally staid <em>Economist</em>, for example, deployed it recently to produce its <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/2022/06/11/how-a-computer-designed-this-weeks-cover\">11 June cover</a>. This is significant because it illustrates how rapidly digital technologies can make the transition from leading edge to commodification. And as they do so, new fears and hopes rapidly emerge.</p> <p>Dall-E (the name is a geeky combination of the Pixar character Wall-E and Salvador Dalí) was derived from OpenAI’s pioneering <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3\">GPT language models</a>, which can generate vaguely plausible English text. Dall-E basically swaps pixels for text and was trained on 400m pairs of images with text captions that were “scraped” from the internet. (The carbon footprint of the computation involved in this process is unconscionable, but that’s for another day.)</p> <p>When GPT-3 appeared, it sparked a new instalment of the “augmentation v replacement” debate. Was the technology just the thin edge of a sinister wedge? GPT-3 could be used to “write” boring but useful text – stock market reports, say - but it could also generate noxious and apparently credible disinformation that would slip through the moderation systems of social media platforms. It could be used to <em>augment</em> the capacities of busy and overworked journalists or to <em>dispense with them entirely</em>. And so on.</p> <p>In the event, though, some of the steam has gone out of the GPT-3 controversy (though not out of the question of the environmental costs of such extravagant computing). However much sceptics and critics might ridicule human hacks, the crooked timber of humanity will continue to outwit mere machines for the foreseeable future. Journalism schools can relax.</p> <p>Dall-E might turn out to be a less straightforward case, though. As with GPT-3, its appearance generated intense interest, perhaps because while most people can write text, many of us cannot draw to save our lives. So having a tool that could enable us to overcome this disability would be quite a boon. You could, say, ask for a portrait of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-04/dall-e-art-generator-begins-new-stage-in-ai-development\">Shrek in the style of the Mona Lisa</a> or Jane Austen as an astronaut and again it would do its best. So one can view it as a welcome augmentation of human capability.</p> <p>But there is also the “replacement” question. It turns out that it was Warzel <em>himself</em> who had used Midjourney’s bot to create an illustration rather than getting one from a copyrighted image bank or commissioning an artist to create an image. Big mistake: an artist spotted the caption and tweeted their shock that a national magazine such as the<em> Atlantic</em> was using a computer program to illustrate stories instead of paying an artist to do that work, thereby giving other publications the idea of doing the same. Before you could say “AI”, Warzel <a href=\"https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/62fc502abcbd490021afea1e/twitter-viral-outrage-ai-art/\">found himself </a>playing the villain in a viral tweetstorm. Which was painful for him, but maybe also a salutary warning that publishers who give work to machines rather than creative artists deserve everything they get.</p> <h2>What I’ve been reading</h2> <p><strong>Smooth running</strong><br>Electric Vehicles Are Way, Way More Energy-Efficient Than Internal Combustion Vehicles is <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/evs-more-efficient-than-internal-combustion-engines/\">a sobering summary</a> from the Yale Climate Connections project.</p> <p><strong>Getting better</strong><br>The Efficiency Movement is a <a href=\"https://robm.me.uk/2022/08/efficiency-movement/\">marvellous essay by Rob Miller</a> on how all modern societies have been shaped by their worship of efficiency.</p> <p><strong>Biological clock</strong><strong> </strong><br>The Nautilus site has a fascinating article about the <a href=\"https://nautil.us/the-evolutionary-mystery-of-menopause-22825/\">evolutionary mysteries of the menopause</a>.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/20/people-round-to-eat-again-learned-perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T15:00:42Z","webTitle":"I’ve started having friends round to eat again and have learned this: perfect is the enemy of good","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/20/people-round-to-eat-again-learned-perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/20/people-round-to-eat-again-learned-perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good","fields":{"headline":"I’ve started having friends round to eat again and have learned this: perfect is the enemy of good","trailText":"If you’ve lost the habit of entertaining people at home, liberate yourself from perfection in the kitchen with ‘scruffy hospitality’","byline":"Rachel Cooke","body":"<p>Email newsletters aren’t really my thing.

Sometimes, I get as far as drawing up a list of names, and looking in my diary for a date. But like icing that refuses to set, things never get … concrete. Thoughts whirl, as if in a food processor. Will everyone be disappointed if I serve pasta? Will they consider my tomato sauce infra dig? And what about the pudding?

What is scruffy hospitality? For a moment, I pictured Pig Pen in <em>Peanuts</em>, trailing a cloud of dust. But, no. Scruffy hospitality is, in essence, a welcome that involves no fuss.</p> <p>It prioritises people and jokes, warmth and connection, over performance and whatever it is you usually serve with drinks (salt and vinegar crisps from now on!). It is impulsive, reflexive and generous, and in the end it will make everyone very happy, and no one more so than you, the host. To sum up: don’t worry if things aren’t perfect. The best is the enemy of the good. You are not starring in <em>MasterChef</em>, and Gregg Wallace is not (thank God) among your friends.</p> <p>Something about this advice hit home for me, and in recent days I’ve acted on it more than once. J came for supper, and I gave her pasta, and she liked it. G happily stayed on after the final of the women’s Euros, and ate two portions of the previous night’s chickpeas (she’s a vegetarian; we were having roast chicken). S came for a drink that turned into a long and slightly tipsy dinner, food I’d cooked for two feeding three with perfect ease. Spontaneity! It makes life so much better: richer, fuller, less costive and clenched. King and, by extension, Burkeman are absolutely right: no one is going to look under your fridge for crumbs; a meal cooked by another hand is (with certain dishonourable exceptions) nearly always delicious; ice-cream or a Tunnock’s caramel wafer will do perfectly well for pudding.</p> <p>Now I’ve started this, I can’t stop. Or at any rate, I don’t feel like stopping. I’m dying to see people – ‘What about tonight? Is tonight good?’ – and I’m hell bent on making sure that, when I do, things are pared down. Yesterday, for instance, I was looking through a new favourite cookbook, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/notes-from-a-small-kitchen-island-9780241504673\" title=\"\">Notes </a></em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/notes-from-a-small-kitchen-island-9780241504673\" title=\"\">From a Small Kitchen Island</a></em> by Debora Robertson, in search of ideas for something chic to give people with drinks (OK, I admit it: I’m not yet quite scruffy enough for crisps). A recipe appeared before me for gruyere and anchovy puffs, which sounded right up my strasse, until I realised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/sep/16/the-classic-recipe-i-can-never-get-right-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">it involved making bechamel</a>. Sigh. I turned a few more pages. Ah, this was more like it. Anchovy butter. A cinch! I pictured a wooden tray. On it was a bowl of this gorgeously umami butter, another of radishes, and one of my granny’s bone-handled knives. Perfect, but not – if you see what I mean – too perfect.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 21 August 2022 because an earlier version misspelled Gregg Wallace’s first name as “Greg”. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/20/un-seeks-plan-to-beat-plastic-nurdles-the-tiny-scourges-of-the-oceans","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T14:51:20Z","webTitle":"UN seeks plan to beat plastic nurdles, the tiny scourges of the oceans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/20/un-seeks-plan-to-beat-plastic-nurdles-the-tiny-scourges-of-the-oceans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/20/un-seeks-plan-to-beat-plastic-nurdles-the-tiny-scourges-of-the-oceans","fields":{"headline":"UN seeks plan to beat plastic nurdles, the tiny scourges of the oceans","trailText":"Billions of the pellets end up in the sea, killing turtles, whales and dolphins, and are washed up on beaches around the world","byline":"Jon Ungoed-Thomas","body":"<p>Maritime authorities are considering stricter controls on the ocean transport of billions of plastic pellets known as nurdles after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/29/nurdles-plastic-pellets-environmental-ocean-spills-toxic-waste-not-classified-hazardous?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=74bfa404-a9ba-46f1-bff4-eda6e8f81780\" title=\"\">series of spillages</a> around the world.</p> <p>Campaigners warn that nurdles are one of the most common <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/07/microplastic-pollution-revealed-absolutely-everywhere-by-new-research\" title=\"\">micro-plastic pollutants</a> in the seas, washing up on beaches from New Zealand to Cornwall.

But, as the new school year looms, are fears of a crisis justified?","byline":"Anna Fazackerley","body":"<p>Vic Goddard, principal of Passmores secondary academy school in Essex, has no desire to get caught up in a culture war. Instead he has spent the summer planning how to cope with a £320,000 deficit as a result of spiralling energy bills and a national teacher pay rise with no additional cash to pay for it.</p> <p>“Why do politicians have an opinion on my school toilets? On our uniform policy?” he said. “Sort out the rocketing electricity bills and the cost of living. Don’t get involved in small decisions you don’t add value to.”</p> <p>Goddard is referring to what many schools up and down the country describe as the apparent politicisation of an increasingly incendiary issue that they are being forced to deal with on a regular basis: gender. Everything from toilets (single sex or unisex) and uniforms (skirts or trousers) to reading material and pupils’ pronouns is the subject of hostile debate in a way not witnessed previously, headteachers say.</p> <p>In Goddard’s case, as well as changes in pronouns the school has had to navigate issues such as gender-questioning pupils not feeling comfortable using the same single-sex changing room any more. The school is relatively new so it has more flexibility than schools in 50-year-old buildings. “We can just offer a compromise and say: ‘Change in here instead,’” Goddard explained. “Problem solved.” His point is that without interference from outsiders who do not have a stake in the school, these issues have traditionally been quietly resolved between the head, parents and pupils.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8bbe7b8ed07650391233116c75745abc0d6722cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bbe7b8ed07650391233116c75745abc0d6722cd/1611_127_1984_3590/553.jpg\" alt=\"Attorney general Suella Braverman, sunglasses in hand, smiles as she’s out walking\" width=\"553\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attorney general Suella Braverman, whose comments on trans issues provoked praise and anger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/REX/ Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Suella Braverman, the government’s attorney general, this summer entered the debate on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/27/attorney-general-says-schools-do-not-have-to-accommodate-childrens-gender-wishes\" title=\"\">how schools deal with gender issues</a>. In a speech to the thinktank Policy Exchange earlier this month the Tory MP sparked controversy by stating that schools had no legal obligation to comply with the gender preference of their pupils, that they could refuse to allow transgender children to wear the uniform or use the toilet of their stated gender and that schools which no longer provided single-sex toilets were breaking the law.</p> <p>It’s not a new narrative under the current government, according to a former employee for the Department for Education (DfE), but it is one that some claim is in danger of taking over more pressing issues for schools. “There was very much the sense, across cabinet and from No 10, that you had to raise the profile of this issue,” said the insider, who worked in the department during Nadhim Zahawi’s time as education secretary. “And the narrative was that this is a growing crisis in schools. But there was no evidence for that.”</p> <p>The adviser said all the evidence they saw in the department showed that transgender issues were a concern for schools, but apart from some “small isolated situations” where there was a serious problem, schools were “dealing with it themselves like other issues”. “There is no crisis,” the source added.</p> <p>Goddard’s experience backs this. His school has had unisex toilets for some years and he says they are better than the traditional setup, which can encourage bullying. “Our old loos were closed-off spaces and there was never an adult in them. Pupils told us they felt isolated and didn’t know who would be in there. The reality is our unisex loos feel safe.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2049b224b9ee3e149004f9d8cc2eb02217ff4c1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2049b224b9ee3e149004f9d8cc2eb02217ff4c1b/168_494_5730_3438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vic Goddard, in a shirt and tie, half-smiles as he raises his glasses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Our old loos were closed-off spaces.

Girls were worried about boys putting cameraphones under the door, so the doors don’t have gaps that make that possible.</p> <p>They were installed before it became commonplace for the rightwing media to expose a school for supposedly being too “woke”, Goddard said. In a community which ranges from “extreme left to extreme right”, some parents inevitably had strong views. “But it’s about listening and being prepared to compromise,” he said.</p> <p>Braverman’s comments unleashed a storm of both approbation and anger on Twitter. The mother of a child who was born a girl but for the past year has chosen to be addressed as “they/them”, tweeted that she was “boiling with rage”. The mother, who spoke to the <em>Observer</em> anonymously to avoid identifying her child, said: “This is about whipping up fear and hatred. The fact that the government is deliberately stoking fear around children and young people is disgusting.”</p> <p>Her child was upset because two boys were deliberately using the wrong name at school, and she said teachers took it very seriously, explaining to them why that wasn’t acceptable. “If the government tries to make this law, some children would feel they have every right to make individuals like my child feel small and to call them whatever they want.”</p> <p>But a second mother, who feels fearful about her teenage daughter wanting to become a boy, said she was “overjoyed” to hear Braverman “trying to lay out clear rules”. She added: “If you take away party politics, what she said was very sound.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/30/school-leaders-criticise-attorney-generals-advice-on-trans-pupils\">School leaders criticise attorney general’s advice on trans pupils </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some education lawyers have disputed the legality of Braverman’s comments, arguing that her advice could leave schools open to discrimination claims. Esther Maxwell, legal director at Shakespeare Martineau law firm, who advises schools on issues around transgender, says the law in this area is complex and Braverman hasn’t really clarified the situation for schools.</p> <p>“There are some question marks over some of the comments she made and the interpretation of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/a-guide-to-the-new-equality-act\" title=\"\">Equality Act</a>,” she said. “It is hard to think what the legitimate aim of a mixed school having a blanket policy of not agreeing to allow trans pupils to be referred to by a different pronoun or name could be,” she added.</p> <p>As well as becoming the focus of politicians, individual schools are increasingly coming under scrutiny in the media about any policies that appear to involve gender issues.</p> <p>Several schools are facing anger from parents after announcing that they will have a trousers-only gender-neutral uniform from September. Tiverton High School in Devon has been under attack on social media after the <em>Telegraph</em> revealed that from September the school would “ditch their skirts” and all pupils would wear trousers or shorts. As well as wanting the uniform to be “more gender neutral”, the school’s head, Sammy Crook, told the newspaper that it had become “frustrating” and “time consuming” trying to enforce the school’s skirt-length policy.</p> <p>The newspaper reported that a number of parents had objected to the change. Frankie Rufolo criticised the move on Twitter. He told the <em>Observer</em>: “Schools must be careful not to pander to a minority and put ideas into kids’ heads,” adding the parents cared more about holes in the school roof than what the uniform looked like.</p> <p>But another parent said he was “amazed” that a uniform policy had caused so much controversy and blamed people jumping on “a rightwing bandwagon”.</p> <p>“This decision is nothing to do with being woke,” he said. “The skirts are being banned because they are becoming shorter and shorter, which is breaking the dress code.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea of a gender-neutral uniform polarises people, but it doesn’t need to.

Girls can already choose to wear skirts or trousers.</p> <p>She said: “The idea of a gender-neutral uniform polarises people, as though it is really controversial, but it doesn’t need to be. It’s about equality.”</p> <p>She explained that her school had more girls than boys questioning their gender identity, and rather than being drawn into either of the two camps prevalent on Twitter, it tried to treat every child as an individual.</p> <p>“Sometimes it can be girls rejecting everything they are bombarded with about what a female should look like,” she said. “We try to create an environment where no one is pressured by gender stereotypes.

If I’d known about it I would have had a conversation with her about these issues.”</p> <p>Some months later the school started to send communications home referring to Newton’s son with a boy’s name she had no idea they were using in school. “They didn’t ask us about this. We have to sign a form for a kid to go on a theatre trip or to be given a paracetamol, but this happened with no discussion with me,” she said.</p> <p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders union, said that the DfE had still not consulted on or published any guidance for schools on these issues, despite talking about doing so, and Braverman’s comments had only “muddied the waters”.</p> <p>He added: “Schools have been navigating this difficult territory on their own for years, making decisions which serve the best interests of all their pupils.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the DfE declined to comment on claims the government is politicising trans issues in schools.

I’ve been particularly satisfied with a recent haul of salsa from Colombia and hard-to-find rap, R&amp;B and disco records from this place. My friend Ron, a Brooklyn native, told me about a black-owned record store, brand new, and therefore, in the mythos of record collecting, a site of pilgrimage. It was beautiful: not too much stock, not too little; somewhere comfortable to sit; and shelves with a lovely rolling mechanism that I keep thinking about recreating in my house.</p> <h2>2.

Feeling itchy for an activity that got me out of the house, I bought a film camera on a whim and returned to something I used to do as a kid: taking photographs on film cameras. As a form that insists on slowness, attention to detail and, above all, patience, it is the kind of mindful practice I’ve been missing for years. These days I rarely leave the house without at least one of my cameras.</p> <h2>3.

If you ask me, it’s one of the best recent examples of that hybrid space between the pop song, R&amp;B crooning and hip-hop. The insistent drum groove, ethereal vocals and a focus, in the lyrics, on that perennial of perennials: love lost and the quest to reclaim it. In the sweet, pure voice of <a href=\"https://www.bennysings.com/\">Benny Sings</a> a well-worn theme is transformed into something refreshing. I had been looking for this on vinyl (at a reasonable price) for ages. Imagine my delight when it was <a href=\"https://bennysings.bandcamp.com/album/art-2022-remastered-deluxe\">rereleased by Benny Sings himself</a>.</p> <h2>4.

The canvas is bright, dominated by a powerful feminine figure gesturing towards the lives of the ancestors and tribal lore, as well as complicating notions of contemporary artistic style. I absolutely love this painting and 37d more generally – I haven’t stopped thinking about the light hitting the tree that grows in the courtyard, which spills onto a cafe, since I saw it.</p> <h2>5.

It’s difficult to know where to begin. But, by chance, my colleague [Chingonyi is a poetry editor at Bloomsbury] Alexis Kirschbaum sent me this collection of essays by Ann Patchett. Two articles utterly captivated my imagination: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/08/how-to-practice\">one about getting rid of things</a> – something I sorely need to do – and a piece about the author’s three fathers.

The festival, run by a team dedicated to creating a context of kinship, crystallised this love. Poets from across the Latinx world read alongside poets from Europe and the African continent, building the sense of a global village – small and yet, through imagination, endlessly expanding. There is something arcane and profoundly human about gathering to test the limits of language in this time-honoured way.

Daniel Podence and Matheus Nunes both snatched at first half chances, while Nunes also went close with a glancing header that bounced inches wide.

For that we probably had Antonio Conte to thank and a half-time team talk one suspects was thick on invective and thin on instruction. Tottenham remain undefeated and underwhelming but Harry Kane’s second-half goal gave them all three points and a win that in tone and toughness felt like a comeback.</p> <p>The pieces are not quite fitting yet. Son Heung-min looks undercooked and a little short of form; the midfield is still vulnerable to being outnumbered; the team as a whole still looks a little more comfortable counterattacking than genuinely controlling games. But there is spirit and resilience, as well as the quality and depth to make it count. Eric Dier and Ivan Perisic were excellent.

Bruno Lage’s side is rich in talent and fight but above all one gets the sense they are utterly horrible to play against: a swarm of wrought, chiselled midfielders all snapping and swearing at you in Portuguese.</p> <p>“For sure in the first half we struggled a bit for many reasons,” Conte said. “We suffered. In the second half, I tried to fix some situations but also we had to have a lot of energy.”</p> <p>Wolves arrived with a smart plan and a fresh pair of legs: the £38m midfielder Matheus Nunes, the newest and shiniest asset in the Jorge Mendes portfolio, signed from Sporting this week and thrown straight in for his debut.</p> <p>Quite a player he is, too: a big deadly spider of a man, all poise and precision and scuttling legs and eyes in the back of his head. He had a good chance with a glancing header, the dangerous Rúben Neves had a couple of strikes from distance and, as Spurs continued to launch it aimlessly, the home crowd began to grouse a little, as if trapped in a very long and very hot airport queue.</p> <p>Anyway, that was the first half. The second was a different flavour of milk altogether: Tottenham screaming out of the blocks and moving the ball with purpose and substance. Kane hit the bar with a header. The maladroit Son hit the post. Perisic began to gain in influence. The volume ticked up a few bars. Tottenham won a corner. Son took it.</p> <p>Almost from the moment the ball left Son’s foot the corner looked a disappointment: short, low and dying away towards the near post. Except – surprise – Perisic had been stationed there for this scenario, and flicked the ball on for an unmarked Kane to head in at the far post.</p> <p>A set-piece routine that felt like a throwback to the Mauricio Pochettino days and a Premier League milestone for Kane: his 185th goal, beating Sergio Agüero’s post-1992 record for the most at one club. Dixie Dean’s all-time top-flight record of 310 remains well out of reach for now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ebc7ef4c3825e7a2261cd0c7970aa6e176f01a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ebc7ef4c3825e7a2261cd0c7970aa6e176f01a4/0_0_4371_2693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kane nods past José Sá.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kane nods past José Sá.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what had changed? Certainly nothing significant tactically. No substitutions were made until the 76th minute. The only real shift was in ambition, intensity, bravery: the bravery to play the difficult pass, to weather the shin-crunching challenge, to hold the ball under pressure rather than get rid of it. Further proof of this arrived when Kane, stung by an earlier challenge from Neves, gave him a little off-the-ball bump.</p> <p>Nathan Collins returned the favour and quickly the situation had generated into the sort of mass, finger-waggling, multinational squabble that everyone likes to see.</p> <p>Ultimately Wolves’ best chance of winning came in the first half and for all the good vibes around Molineux after a lavish transfer window, there remains a slight gap between expectation and delivery, between the ability to neuter games and the ability to grab them and kill them off.</p> <p>“We controlled the game, but in the end we don’t have any points,” Lage said. “So we go home with frustration and confidence.”</p> <p>Which feels like a pretty good summation of Wolves: three games, no wins, and yet for all that a certain cautious optimism.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/20/anrich-nortje-jonny-bairstow-england-south-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T13:48:18Z","webTitle":"‘I tried to rev it up a bit’: Nortje says slow start spurred him on against England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/20/anrich-nortje-jonny-bairstow-england-south-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/20/anrich-nortje-jonny-bairstow-england-south-africa","fields":{"headline":"‘I tried to rev it up a bit’: Nortje says slow start spurred him on against England","trailText":"Anrich Nortje has said he wasn’t happy with the start of his performance against England in the first Test, despite inspiring South Africa to victory","byline":"Simon Burnton","body":"<p>Not long after his fast bowlers had cleared away the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/england-south-africa-first-test-day-three-match-report-cricket\" title=\"\">final scraps</a> of England’s second innings on Friday afternoon, Dean Elgar was asked to explain the success South Africa have enjoyed – eight wins in 10 attempts – since his appointment as captain last year. “I always felt that the core of the group has had the basic fundamentals of one day becoming a world-known Test side,” he said.</p> <p>“I would like to think that what we’ve laid down as a foundation has been pretty true and pretty solid. It hasn’t been fake, it’s been pretty unique, it’s been real. It hasn’t been something that I feel is far-fetched.”</p> <p>He spoke with complete earnestness. There was no snark, no smirk, absolutely no suggestion he had in his mind anything except the merits of his own team. But his words were also chosen in a very particular context: that of having emphatically bested a side whose new captain and coach are attempting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/ben-stokes-praises-relentless-south-africa-but-refuses-to-panic-after-defeat\" title=\"\">power a transformation</a> on little more than attitude. A transformation that for all the riotous success of early summer still seems on occasion – and none more than this – an act of theatre, a conjurer’s illusion.</p> <p>There was no doubt who the magicians had been on this occasion. South Africa’s seam quartet took 18 of England’s 20 wickets and certainly plenty of batters appeared enchanted. Lungi Ngidi took the fewest wickets but was the most economical; the towering Marco Jansen took three of his four wickets by bowling tailenders – demonstrating to England, who seem to prefer to pitch it short on these occasions, the wisdom of aiming at the stumps – and the brilliant Kagiso Rabada took seven wickets including his 250th in Tests and was named player of the match.</p> <p>But it was Anrich Nortje who produced the moment that defined the Test, a few minutes after noon on Wednesday. The clouds hung pregnant over Lord’s and the air seemed thick with humidity and promise and then, suddenly, had to make room for Jonny Bairstow’s middle stump.</p> <p>Bairstow has seemed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jul/03/jonny-bairstow-indispensable-to-england-after-so-long-as-spare-part\" title=\"\">have the answer to every question</a> this Test summer, but what made this question particularly difficult was that it was travelling at 93mph.</p> <p>On Friday, Nortje said there was something about his best performances that defies even his own explanation – “when the rhythm is there sometimes it feels a lot slower but the speed gun says something different” – but the fundamentals of his technique are built on the more prosaic foundations of “lots of pain medication” and a great deal of work.</p> <p>Nortje had not played a first-class game for 14 months, much of it spent battling a persistent hip injury, making his refusal to get carried away by his successful return almost as remarkable as the performance itself. “I wasn’t happy with the start so I tried to rev it up a bit later on,” he said of England’s second innings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c574ebd35bdb5bd6af49adaafab5fe190720067\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c574ebd35bdb5bd6af49adaafab5fe190720067/0_277_6401_3841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonny Bairstow’s stump is knocked over by Anrich Nortje.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonny Bairstow’s stump is knocked over by Anrich Nortje.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier García/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Fortunately I got the nick and the wicket [of Bairstow], so I got some momentum going.

Yet as Australia trailed the Americans with two legs remaining in the opening race of the evening – the mixed 4x100m medley relay – the roar from the crowd said it all.</p> <p>A 3,500-odd crowd willed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jul/31/emma-mckeon-nearly-quit-swimming-now-she-is-on-the-brink-of-all-time-greatness\">Olympic superstar Emma McKeon</a> and 18-year-old freestyle sensation Mollie O’Callaghan home for Australia to claim a first victory of the night. There are no gold medals on offer this weekend but the Dolphins mean business all the same. “The energy and the environment is just outstanding,” O’Callaghan said.</p> <p>The passion might have been infectious but the complex rules perplexed many observers. The second race of the night, the women’s broken 400m freestyle, saw six swimmers (three from each nation) race a 200m leg, followed by a short break, then a 100m leg, another break and a final 100m sprint. Points were awarded for the winner of each leg plus the overall winner based on cumulative time. The Americans won – although many in the crowd did not realise. “I think we might need a PhD to understand this,” offered one observer.</p> <p>The women’s 3x50m butterfly “skins” event was another atypical format. A field of six competitors was slimmed to four after the first race, and then again to two after the second (with a minute or so between each). McKeon looked unusually slow in the final, up against American Beata Nelson. But it had all been a ruse – Australia played its “double dip”, meaning the pair had to swim one final 50m lap to decide the race, which McKeon won comfortably. Two events later the Americans got their revenge, deploying the same tactic to similar effect as Kaitlyn Dobler won the “double dip” fourth leg of the 3x50m breaststroke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc3e6a5fb068a16c73fd56c286dd20be5803bd56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc3e6a5fb068a16c73fd56c286dd20be5803bd56/0_0_3719_2479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kaitlyn Dobler in the 3x50m breaststroke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kaitlyn Dobler in the 3x50m breaststroke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt King/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After winning the women’s 50m freestyle midway through the night, Australian Meg Harris summed up her experience of the multi-format meet. “You don’t know what’s happening,” she said. She wasn’t the only one. “They explained [the rules] multiple times to me,” offered O’Callaghan. “I just sit there and it goes in one ear and out.”</p> <p>These weren’t criticisms – swimmers and fans alike took a shine to the unusual rules and unlikely match-ups. As if to underscore the point that this was a swimming event like no other, the Dolphins head coach Rohan Taylor strutted the pool deck with a wireless microphone, chiming into the live television coverage. Big Bash cricket eat your heart out.</p> <p>Yet another odd event was the men’s mystery 200m individual medley. Each swimmer was only told the stroke order just before the race, and each had their own, random order. Australia’s Se-Bom Lee built an early lead but was always going to be vulnerable with breaststroke as his last leg. He battled valiantly but was mowed down by American Trenton Julian, swimming butterfly, in the final metres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2975946be36c7337a956860e60b53daf6d597b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2975946be36c7337a956860e60b53daf6d597b9/0_0_5123_3415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Se-Bom Lee of Australia in the mystery medley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Se-Bom Lee of Australia in the mystery medley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Australia hit back in the very next event – the women’s 100m backstroke – with the Dolphins throwing down their “flag” for a “frenzy” round midway through the race (the winning team earns double points). It was a safe bet, with Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion Kaylee McKeown an unstoppable force. A late charge by compatriot O’Callaghan, finishing second, added to Australia’s points haul.</p> <p>The night concluded with a random, mixed 4x50m freestyle relay – with the teams spinning pre-race to determine the format. The spin landed on medley and an exhilarating evening of racing ended much as it began. McKeon and O’Callaghan, the golden girl of the Australian swim team and her successor, leading Australia in yet another relay. It was not to be – McKeon, Australia’s anchor swimmer, unable to reel in Linnea Mack in a dash to the wall. It had been an unlucky spin; Australia would have won comfortably in a freestyle relay. But such is the way of this weird, wacky and wonderful event.</p> <p>The United States has never lost a Duel in the Pool across the event’s seven prior editions (the first three against Australia, followed by four against a composite European team). But as the Duel returns for the first time since 2015 – the first on Australian soil since 2007 – the Americans’ undefeated run is on the line. The Dolphins were just two gold medals shy of the United States in Tokyo, a resurgent effort after a fallow decade in the pool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e31f684e156330dacb47dee6f9e8cb43ac32031b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e31f684e156330dacb47dee6f9e8cb43ac32031b/0_0_3691_2461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Held of the USA dives in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Held of the USA dives in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Lewins/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end of the penultimate night, the Americans hold a narrow lead on the scoreboard, 159 points to 148. It would be a heroic achievement if the Dolphins can finally knock the Americans off their perch and, with such a slender deficit, it remains all to swim for between the two heavyweight nations.</p> <p>“If you look at the history, the Duels have normally been a blow-out,” said Taylor. “But we’re hanging in there.” If the Dolphins can triumph on Sunday, they might even find themselves added to that illustrious hall of fame.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/20/boris-johnson-way-to-work-jobs-scheme-failure","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T13:17:42Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson’s flagship jobs scheme was a failure, new figures reveal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/20/boris-johnson-way-to-work-jobs-scheme-failure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/20/boris-johnson-way-to-work-jobs-scheme-failure","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson’s flagship jobs scheme was a failure, new figures reveal","trailText":"Fewer people found jobs under Way to Work despite triumphant claim that it helped 500,000","byline":"James Tapper","body":"<p>Boris Johnson’s flagship jobs scheme appears to have failed, despite his claim that it helped half a million people into work.</p> <p>The Way to Work scheme set a target to support 500,000 people into employment by cutting jobseekers’ benefits after four weeks unless they applied for work outside their normal occupation.</p> <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics released last week show that the number of unemployed people finding work actually fell by 148,000 compared with the six months before Way to Work began, despite record numbers of job vacancies.</p> <p>The government is also facing questions about why it set a target of 500,000 when, on average, nearly 1 million unemployed people have found work during similar periods each year since 2001.</p> <p>On 28 July, the official statistics watchdog challenged the Department for Work and Pensions on why it had not explained how its target was set or measured, a month after the government’s triumphant claims.</p> <p>Ed Humpherson, director general of the Office for Statistics Regulation, wrote: “There is no clear explanation of how the Way to Work target was defined, how it would be measured, and the methods used to support claims … that the target has been reached.</p> <p>“It is difficult to attribute and quantify publicly the impact of a campaign like Way to Work in the absence of a clearly defined and published target, and details about how the target will be measured and reported, at the start.</p> <p>“Measuring government programmes in a robust and transparent way is important, and the statistics/data underpinning any measurement should uphold principles of being trustworthy, of high quality and offer public value. The way the Department has communicated information in this case does not uphold these principles.”</p> <p>At the end of January, Johnson announced that a “Way to Work drive” would help 500,000 into employment from Universal Credit intensive work search or jobseeker’s allowance, at a time when there were a record 1.2 million vacancies.</p> <p>Five months later, the DWP tweeted: “We did it!”, and Johnson listed his achievements to the House of Commons on 6 July, the day before he announced his resignation, as including “helping half a million people into work, through the Way to Work scheme”.</p> <p>Analysis by the <em>Observer</em> of seasonally adjusted figures from the ONS Labour Force Survey shows that 867,310 people moved from unemployment to employment from January to June, with the majority of them finding work before March. In the previous six months, 1,015,954 people moved into work. The average figure for January to June since records began in 2001 is 948,000.</p> <p>The ONS figures include “people who are not claimants – for instance many married women moving into work – and have no contact with the Jobcentre. Having said that, there is obviously a big overlap [with unemployment benefit claimants],” said Dr David Webster, of the University of Glasgow.</p> <p>He added that the DWP had never published any data on people getting jobs after being in the Universal Credit intensive work search group, which accounts for most unemployed people.</p> <p>Way to Work had no separate budget and its central policy change was to cut jobseekers’ benefits within four weeks rather than three months if they were not judged to be trying hard enough to find work by putting themselves forward for jobs outside their normal occupation.</p> <p>A five-year study published in January suggested that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/22/benefit-sanctions-found-to-be-ineffective-and-damaging\">benefit sanctions are counter-productive</a>, and Therese Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, has blocked research assessing their effectiveness – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/14/british-minister-accused-of-trying-to-hide-reports-on-impact-of-tory-welfare-reforms\">one of many reports on welfare the government has been accused of concealing</a>.</p> <p>Stephen Timms, Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said it would be looking at the figures as part of an inquiry when MPs return in the autumn. “The refusal to set out the evidence behind the claim, unfortunately, is par for the course at the moment,” he said. “We will try and get to the bottom of this in our inquiry on the government’s plan for jobs, which will be starting when parliament returns next month.</p> <p>“To claim that their policy has been a success seems like business as usual. There might be something more that we’re missing. If there is, they need to tell us what it is.”</p> <p>The DWP said it would respond in due course to the statistics regulator, and that unemployment had been low, so there were fewer people to find work.</p> <p>A DWP spokesperson said:<strong> </strong>“Way to Work successfully supported half a million people into work, helping employers fill the vacancies the economy needed to recover, and lifting incomes as people can be up to £6,000 better off in full-time work than out of work on benefits.<br><br>“When there are fewer unemployed people overall in the labour market, the amount of people moving from unemployed to employed is understandably lower. Ahead of the Way to Work campaign, the unemployment rate had fallen to below pre-pandemic levels, meaning 500,000 was a stretching and ambitious target.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/20/further-rail-strikes-very-likely-warns-rmt-union-leader-mick-lynch","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK

between us at this time,” he told BBC Breakfast on Saturday, when asked if the union could take more action at a later date on top of what was already scheduled.</p> \n<p>In a letter which he tweeted, Shapps later accused the RMT of doing “lasting damage” to the rail sector and said that Network Rail, which manages the railway network across Great Britain, had tabled “a fair, legitimate pay offer” which he said amounted to an 8% pay rise over two years.</p> \n<p>“Employers have a pay rise on the table for RMT members in the train operating companies,” said Shapps, adding that the pay rise would

But a community group is hoping to transform the east London plot – currently used by Thames Water – into what is believed to be the capital’s first new wild swimming ponds since Hampstead Ponds were created in 1777.</p> <p>Under the proposed plans, residents want to buy the government-owned 5.68-hectare site on the polluted River Lea in Waltham Forest and turn it into a “brownfield rainforest”, featuring two free-to-use pools, community spaces, an anaerobic digester, a cafe and a make-and-repair hub.</p> <p>East London Waterworks Park’s two ponds, measuring around 1,600 sq metres and 1,400 sq metres, would be fed by rainwater cleaned by reed beds and aquatic plants, and the site would run on hydro and solar power, and have a capacity of 1,000 people a day. “There’s a real desire to swim in open water to reconnect with nature, and there just isn’t enough capacity at the moment to respond to that desire,” said the chair of the project, Abigail Woodman, who works in educational publishing.</p> <p>The idea came from members of the community after government plans to build two free schools on the site, which they purchased from Thames Water, fell through. Following a public meeting three years ago, swimming fast became a popular idea. “For the community, this is about embodying hope, because it can feel pretty bleak what’s going on at the moment,”<strong> </strong>said Woodman.</p> <p>“This is about saying we can make things better, we do have the capacity and the power to do that if we come together and work hard.”</p> <p>Amid record temperatures and drought, this summer has seen demand for wild swimming continue to soar following rising interest during the pandemic.

The ponds were originally created in the 17th and 18th centuries as reservoirs before some were later turned into bathing pools.</p> <p>Other wild swimming sites, West Reservoir in Hackney and Beckenham Place Park lake in Lewisham, have since opened, but the new project believes its ponds will be the first created in centuries.</p> <p>So far, residents have raised more than £210,000 in crowdfunding in just a few weeks. The target is £500,000 by 28 October if the project is to progress to the next stage. Providing the purchase goes through and relevant planning permission is given, it is hoped the ponds will open to volunteers in 2027 and to the public two years later.</p> <p>With a child poverty rate of more than 42% in Waltham Forest, making the facility free to use is a vital aspect of the project.</p> <p>“We will divorce our ability to bring income and make sure that we can sustain the site from its usage so that it is open and inclusive to all,” said Woodman. “So a world run for people and nature.”</p> <p>As well as bringing positive associations with physical and mental health, the ponds would also draw attention to water use at a time of dwindling supplies by displaying real-time data on how they use water.</p> <p>“It’s very easy when you live in a city to be divorced from what is going on with our water supply,” said Woodman. “The water companies are saying we’re low on water. but it’s still coming out of the tap.” </p> <p>Ed Accura, co-founder of the Black Swimming Association (BSA) and producer of the <em>Blacks Can’t Swim</em> documentaries, said the project would be a positive addition to the area, but that to many people, swimming does not feel “relatable”.

When he first got into a pool he felt fear. “Since then, I’ve been learning how to swim, getting more accustomed to getting into water. I feel relieved.”</p> <p>Woodman said the project plans to work with young people to create a water safety campaign targeted at their peers.

One of the core messages of <em>Music of the Spheres</em>, Coldplay’s ninth album, released last year, is: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6_nRqIz_9o\">Everyone is an alien somewhere</a>.” And while it’s hard not to applaud the band’s stance, it’s boggling to imagine what Martin (presumably) had to say to his fellow talented multimillionaires to persuade them to carry on like demented football club mascots <em>and</em> play their instruments at the same time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Martin is arguably at his greatest armed with just a piano and a bruised heart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Did no one balk at the embrace of puppetry, innovative as it is? <em>Music of the Spheres</em> is set in space (sort of) and co-stars the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utm8SQn2rRY\">non-human Angel Moon</a>, who “sings” a couple of tracks. Sure, everyone loves a Muppet – Angel Moon is the work of the Jim Henson studio. Martin duets with her (operated by a puppeteer) on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raHLFg6bkNI\">Biutyful</a>, a gentle love song about the redemptive powers of love in the face of everything going to hell in a handcart (even if handcarts are green modes of transport).</p> <p>But while puppetry has an arty history, all this just feels like an appeal to an audience so young we’ve run out of alphabet to describe it. While Coldplay’s hook-up with BTS, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YqPKLZF_WU\">My Universe</a>, crossed over with Gen Z, and their song with Selena Gomez, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWCMGIG1Y54\">Let Somebody Go</a>, made hay with millennials, here Coldplay appear to be courting the under-10s. And did no one notice that Angel Moon looks like an unfortunate caricature of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grimes\">Grimes</a>, the long-tressed, often winged, often alien-looking electronic artist whose own ventures draw far more knowledgeably on the history of sci-fi?</p> <p>The problem is not some minor cringe. Coldplay have long since opted out of tiresome binaries such as cool v uncool; it’s the height of uncool to go on about how uncool they are. Biggest band in the world for some years. End of conversation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b13737e2a7e294a96d7d2c017a72af099ac8948\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b13737e2a7e294a96d7d2c017a72af099ac8948/0_0_5072_3381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Martin in the middle of ‘90,000 bouncing souls’ at Wembley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Martin in the middle of ‘90,000 bouncing souls’ at Wembley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Dyson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But their move away from rock into actual light entertainment is sealed tonight. Three evenings into the residency, Natalie Imbruglia replaces previous guest Craig David and performs her 1993 earworm Torn – not in itself the issue, so much as the massive singalong of Summer Nights from <em>Grease</em>. It’s in memory of the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/08/olivia-newton-john-obituary\">Olivia Newton-John</a>, who, Martin explains, he and his dad got to know in Australia some years ago in the company of Imbruglia. But doing songs from musicals, crowd-pleasing as they are? Coldplay seem to have thrown much to the wind in pursuit of the mass euphoric singalong, borrowing greedily from everyone in dance music, especially those with headgear, with the aim of building ever more vast audiences.</p> <p>In 2014, Coldplay released <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPRjCeoBqrI\">A Sky Full of Stars</a>, a collaboration with the late producer Avicii, a mile-marker where Martin et al became particularly enamoured of the euphoria of superstar DJ raves. Other forays followed, such as with Stargate (2015) and Something Just Like This, their hit with the Chainsmokers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ee6833151b5f7a4c4095f1824b91d552bcc1433\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ee6833151b5f7a4c4095f1824b91d552bcc1433/0_0_4812_3208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coldplay’s Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland at Wembley stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coldplay’s Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland at Wembley stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coldplay have always had a pop reach – the product of strong melodies, frontman charisma and songs about universals. They landed upon the “woah oh oh” as a form of Esperanto that allowed them to commune as effectively in Taipei as they do in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZvsGmYKhcU\">São Paulo</a>. But somewhere along the line, they began to actively expand into a kind of borderless, tune-mongering phenomenon. <em>Music of the Spheres</em> bears the hallmark of the biggest of them all, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/blank-space-what-kind-of-genius-is-max-martin\">Max Martin</a>, whose production style continues to shape the charts even now, 22 years after his signature smash, Britney Spears’s …Baby One More Time.</p> <p>A missionary hellbent on increasing his flock, Martin’s expansionist drive is perplexing. Coldplay don’t seem like the kinds of guys to get caught up in macho pissing contests. Anyone with a passing grasp of environmental issues knows that exponential growth is a hubristic chimera, the core principle of capitalism responsible for the planet’s imminent breakdown. Also: does size matter? Martin is arguably at his greatest armed with just a piano and a bruised heart.</p> <p>It is, categorically, a lot of fun to witness 90,000 people wig out to a band they love. People come to a stadium show for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSgbaoMfEN4\">absurd audio-visual lunacy</a>. Yes, of course bands need to evolve. But Martin is perfectly capable of nailing the human condition without this massive outreach programme.</p> <p>“Nobody said it was easy,” he sings on The Scientist, with 90,000 backing vocalists tonight, a lyric applicable to solving the climate crisis as it is to maintaining one’s art nearly a quarter of a century into the game. “No one ever said it would be so hard.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuYj9D8TfwU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FuYj9D8TfwU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuYj9D8TfwU\">Watch Coldplay perform The Scientist in the Radio 1 Live Lounge, 2021.</a></figcaption> </figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/20/week-in-patriarchy-saudi-arabia-joe-biden","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T13:00:40Z","webTitle":"A student was jailed for her tweets – thank the Saudi regime’s enablers | Arwa Mahdawi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/20/week-in-patriarchy-saudi-arabia-joe-biden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/20/week-in-patriarchy-saudi-arabia-joe-biden","fields":{"headline":"A student was jailed for her tweets – thank the Saudi regime’s enablers","trailText":"Joe Biden promised consequences for the government – then he fist-bumped the crown prince","byline":"Arwa Mahdawi","body":"<h2>I hope fist-bumping a tyrant was worth it, Biden!</h2> <p>Salma al-Shehab is sitting in prison because of a retweet. The 34-year-old Leeds University student and mother of two young boys was travelling home to Saudi Arabia for a holiday when she found herself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/saudi-woman-given-34-year-prison-sentence-for-using-twitter\">summoned to a special terrorism court and charged</a> with using a website to “cause public unrest and destabilize civil and national security”. What does that mean in plain English? She had a Twitter account and retweeted some dissidents. For that “crime”, she has been sentenced to 34 years in prison and, just to make sure she really learns her lesson, has also been given a 34-year travel ban.</p> <p>It’s not exactly a secret that Saudi Arabia is touchy about criticism and tends to deal with dissidents via bone saws or jail time. What makes this case extra chilling, however, is that Shehab is not some high-profile activist-in-exile with millions of followers; she has 159 followers on Instagram and just over 2,500 followers on Twitter. She’s not someone who was constantly in the public eye. She’s just an ordinary person with a Twitter account who, amongst tweets about her sons, occasionally retweeted people critical of Saudi Arabia and expressed support for the women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, also thrown in jail by the regime. The message from the oil-rich, rights-poor kingdom here is very clear: it doesn’t matter who you are – if you criticize the regime, you will regret it.</p> <p>Shehab has been detained since January 2021 and has said she has been in solitary confinement for 285 days. God knows how she has been treated during this time but I think it’s fairly well established that Saudi jails are not pleasant places to be, particularly for women. Shamefully, her case only got mainstream attention in the west this week when <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/16/salma-al-shehab-prison-sentence-saudi-arabia/\">the Washington Post</a> picked it up and published an editorial demanding that Joe Biden speak out forcefully on the issue. It’s not surprising that the Post led the charge on this: Post Opinions contributor Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, was brutally assassinated nearly four years ago and a US <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56213528\">intelligence report</a> found that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, approved his killing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/13/mar-a-lago-search-ivanka-trump-week-in-patriarchy\">The Mar-a-Lago search prompts a big question: who snitched? | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you murder a prominent dissident on foreign soil and cut up their body with a bone saw there really ought to be consequences, don’t you think? Joe Biden promised at one point that there would be; he vowed to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state. And then, a few months ago, he went crawling over to Saudi Arabia to beg for oil and greeted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/15/fist-bumps-as-joe-biden-arrives-to-reset-ties-with-pariah-saudi-arabia\">Prince Mohammed with a fist bump</a>. While that may look pathetic on the surface, Biden assured us he was tough behind the scenes. The White House said Biden had “raised specific cases of concern” about human rights – which must have left the prince really terrified, really quaking in his boots. In response to these concerns, Biden apparently received a few commitments with “respect to reforms and institutional safeguards in place to guard against any such conduct in the future”. “Any such conduct” being a very sanitary way of saying “sawing journalists to bits with a bone saw”. As the Washington Post noted in its scathing editorial, the “commitments” Biden received on reforms were very clearly “a farce”.</p> <p>Of course they were a farce! Any idiot could see that Prince Mohammed wasn’t suddenly going to get passionate about human rights just because Biden told him to stop with the murder malarkey. I’m sure Biden himself knew the commitments were a farce. But here’s the thing: Saudi Arabia is a useful ally that buys a lot of expensive weapons, provides a lot of oil, and spends a lot of money with <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/mckinseys-work-for-saudi-arabia-highlights-its-history-of-unsavory-entanglements\">companies like McKinsey</a>, so it is convenient for the west to go along with that farce. Indeed, for the past few years, large swathes of the western media have been falling over their feet trying to portray Prince Mohammed as some sort of amazing “reformer”. In 2018, for example, after Saudi Arabia lifted the world’s only ban on women driving, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/saudi-arabia-is-not-driving-change-it-is-trying-to-hoodwink-the-west\">dozens of puff pieces</a> came out about how amazing the crown prince was. CBS interviewed him and announced that he was “emancipating women”; the New York Times Thomas Friedman wrote a complimentary piece titled “Saudi Arabia’s Arab Spring, at Last”. The fact that Saudi Arabia was simultaneously jailing women’s rights activists and bombing Yemen to smithereens, creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, got rather less play. Shame on every single person who played along with MBS’s narrative and helped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/saudi-arabia-expands-its-sportswashing-ambitions-to-the-world-of-gaming\">sportwash</a> and sanitize Saudi Arabia’s human rights abuses. Autocrats don’t have any power without enablers and Prince Mohammed has no end of them.</p> <h2>Utah school secretly investigated whether winning female student athlete is transgender</h2> <p>A girl in Utah trounced her peers at a state-level school sports competition. Instead of congratulating the kid, the parents of the girls she beat immediately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/utah-school-investigates-student-transgender?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=fb_us&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR1_Fq_jxENF5bOBcijghwj-8cdr6kTlpiutNCtwPcP6c0iATS5Gu1B9j3o#Echobox=1660911840\">demanded an investigation into her gender</a>. And they got one: the gender police rummaged through the girl’s school records dating back to kindergarten to ascertain that she was assigned female at birth. This isn’t an isolated incident: the Utah High School Activities Association has reportedly looked into other complaints about athletes who don’t “look feminine enough”. This is a chilling reminder, for those who need to be reminded, that assaults on trans rights affect us all. “We warned about this being a possibility,” one transgender activist noted, “that everyone would accuse everyone who is successful of being transgender … It becomes about judging women’s bodies. And no body is safe.”</p> <h2>Florida court rules 16-year-old is not ‘sufficiently mature’ for abortion</h2> <p>But she is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/08/17/florida-teen-abortion-denied-mature/\">mature enough</a> to have a baby!

How did the cat (Coco) feel about the intruder? Coco wasn’t available for comment but as she fled the property and ran to a neighbor’s house, we can only surmise she wasn’t a fan of the seal. Apparently this sort of thing isn’t entirely unusual in New Zealand: young seals like roaming around. As the owner of the house noted: “I guess, like all teenagers, they don’t necessarily make sensible decisions.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 21 August 2022 because an earlier version, in one instance in the text, referred to a girl “in Iowa”.

My dad worked for British Airways. I was born in Hong Kong, lived in Zambia and Borneo, and was evacuated when the war started in Beirut.There are photos of me in Abu Dhabi in a little cotton dress made by my mother, watching the camel races with all these women in veils and long black dresses.</p> <p><strong>When I got to Oxford,</strong> my mind exploded. I remember the dangerous sports society abseiling down to rescue a pig’s head from outside the Dean’s room. I was in a one-woman show – <em>The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy</em> – in which she gives herself stigmata. I said: “Can I have real blood?” so the stage manager went to the abattoir, got a bucket of sheep’s blood and poured it all over me. It stank and turned me vegetarian for quite a while.</p> <p><strong>I was quite a swot. </strong>I thought: “If I do well in my finals, I’ll do a PhD. If I don’t, I’ll be an actor.” I’d seen a talk at the BFI on Italian cinema and was quite taken with sword and sandal movies and spaghetti westerns and thought I could do my PhD on them. Then I thought: “Why do I want to watch people being dragged through dirt and lassoed for four years?” So it made much more sense to me – but devastating for my parents – to run away to clown school.</p> <p><strong>When actors talk</strong> about process and comedians talk about jokes, they’re always a failure. That is one thing I’ve learned: never try to explain your process, because you will sound like a wanker.</p> <p><strong>The absurd makes </strong>me laugh. People still come up to me in cinema toilets and ask me to sign photos of Renée Zellweger, because there was a period when I looked a bit like her.</p> <p><strong>When my husband left</strong> me [in 2017], I was in a massive panic and decided to do a singing show at the Palladium with Michael Crawford. My list went: go to Sainsbury’s, get meatballs, buy socks, go to Palladium, school run… I think I’m recovering from my divorce because I’m no longer crying at Christmas adverts or swans who mate for life.</p> <p><strong>I don’t really mind </strong>what I see in the mirror. I feel relatively attractive and friendly. But I find it completely horrifying when I see myself on screen. I just see a fat old lady.</p> <p><strong>My son Olly </strong>was born with Down’s syndrome. Your consciousness is changed by whatever flavour of disability you have in your family. Mums with autistic children know everything; they’re just amazing. Families with Down’s syndrome children tend to be quite relaxed, because there’s no point planning ahead.</p> <p><strong>I spent nine</strong> Edinburgh festivals playing prostitutes who died from syphilis. It was quite hard to get an agent to see me dying of syphilis, but far easier when I was guesting in other people’s comedy.</p> <p><strong>For my first telly job,</strong> I was in bed with Mel Smith. He says: “I’m terribly sorry, love, it must have been the drink” and it pans over to me covered in vomit, which was cold, chunky vegetable soup that gave me a skin rash.</p> <p><strong>How would I survive</strong> a zombie attack? I would probably go into deep denial and get another puppy.

How many costume changes do we still have time for on a burning planet? Though there have always been political shows at the fringe, just as there are leaves on a forest floor, this year’s crop displays a heightened awareness around how art-making and power intersect.</p> <p>Take, for instance, <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/this-is-not-a-show-about-hong-kong\">This is Not a Show About Hong Kong</a></strong> (Underbelly, <strong>★★★★</strong>). In a harrowing feat of physical theatre, four actors perform a series of vignettes about the psychological realities of living under an oppressive state, as well as Hong Kong’s long, contested history in the shadow of great powers. A couple scream at each other over a false pregnancy; bodies become oysters to be shucked for pearls. The show’s use of the allegorical veil is a masterstroke, sharpening the focus without blunting the pain.</p> <p>The denial in the title is a posture, of course, which on one hand is a recognition of the danger that the performers place themselves in to perform this play, and on the other echoes the Chinese government’s attempts to suppress whatever it considers aberrant to its official narrative.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There’s an admirable refusal to indulge in the unproductive doomism that often plagues climate narratives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is a country, after all, if not a story some of us have decided to tell together?

This is the question asked by Paines Plough’s <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/sudden-violent-burst-of-rain\">A Sudden Violent Burst of Rain</a></strong> (Roundabout, ★★★★), a poetic fable that centres on Elif, a sheep shearer in an unnamed kingdom who struggles for years to obtain full subjecthood for herself and her daughter, Lily.</p> <p>Rather than expose Lily to the true peril of their situation, Elif spins more palatable tales for her daughter, though as Lily approaches the age of legal adulthood her story starts on a collision course with reality. This is a stunning, devastating excoriation of the Home Office’s hostile environment policy that never forgets the human lives at its core.</p> <p>Another necessary howl of rage comes from Chalk Line Theatre’s <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/blanket-ban\">Blanket Ban</a> </strong>(Underbelly, ★★★),<strong> </strong>which sees Davinia Hamilton and Marta Vella examine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/19/the-fight-for-abortion-in-malta\">Malta’s draconian abortion ban</a>. The pair weave together years’ worth of interviews with journalists, activists and people affected by the law, combined with their own deep affection for their homeland, to present a rich, complex consideration of Malta’s cultural history. Though certain abstract sections, including a shrieking dramatisation of the Mediterranean , feel unnecessary and overlong, the ambitious scope of <em>Blanket Ban</em> proves a powerful call-to-arms in the fight for women’s reproductive rights everywhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"18ce17b5a490e58b072cc28fe737788b7744ab7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18ce17b5a490e58b072cc28fe737788b7744ab7f/0_311_5472_3337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Finnigan in You’re Safe ’Til 2024: Deep History.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"610\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Finnigan in You’re Safe ’Til 2024: Deep History.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, I find myself sitting, rather aptly, in a hothouse of a tent, while David Finnigan looks to the past to see what lessons we might adopt to cope with the climate emergency. From volcanic explosions to devastating waves of pestilence, our species has been through a lot, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we’re prepared for what comes next. To call <strong><a href=\"https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/youre-safe-til-2024-deep-history#overview\">You’re Safe Til 2024: Deep History</a></strong> (Pleasance Courtyard, ★★★★) a hopeful story feels reductive, yet there’s an admirable refusal to indulge in the unproductive doomism that often plagues climate narratives. Come for the earnest reflection on our limitless potential for creativity, kindness and destruction; stay for the most unsettling mashup of Steal My Sunshine by Len and Justin Bieber’s Sorry you’ll ever hear.</p> <p>But as the pressures pile on, why not just switch off and tune out? A student production written and directed by Savannah Acquah, <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/i-don-t-feel-anything\">i don’t feel anything</a></strong> (theSpace on North Bridge, ★★★) sees three young people reflect upon the numbing effect of racism, homophobia and abuse upon their everyday lives. Though the scenes they perform as a cast lack the confidence of their monologues, this remains a work of striking maturity and style and an honest self-portrait of youth on the edge. All three performers are excellent, though Letitia Rhoden-Thomas in particular stands out as one to watch.</p> <p>Rosie Holt has made much hay out of the past few months of political carnage, with her Tory MP persona becoming a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RosieisaHolt\">viral hit on Twitter</a>. In her new show <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/rosie-holt-the-woman-s-hour\">The Woman’s Hour</a></strong> (Pleasance Courtyard, ★★), she expands her character roster to include a rightwing broadcaster, Russell Brand and a Margaret Thatcher-shaped anchor named Liz Truss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"347ca96ff84a0aad76562c9b6cd7aaf74f017e71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/347ca96ff84a0aad76562c9b6cd7aaf74f017e71/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosie Holt in The Woman’s Hour at the Pleasance Courtyard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A mixed bag’: Rosie Holt in The Woman’s Hour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The results are, unfortunately, a mixed bag.

But when she ventures beyond the soundbite, <em>The Woman’s Hour</em> has its flashes of brilliance: her turn as Kirstie Allsopp, leaping through a “pre-immigration kitchen” to the <em>Downton Abbey</em> theme tune, is absurdist perfection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c56cf0b40a8f203ed79c239ff519bace4d753f2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c56cf0b40a8f203ed79c239ff519bace4d753f2e/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Man Who Thought He Knew Too Much.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voloz Collective’s ‘rollicking’ The Man Who Thought He Knew Too Much.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lest you think the fringe this year is all existential despair, Voloz Collective’s <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/man-who-thought-he-knew-too-much\">The Man Who Thought He Knew Too Much</a></strong> (Pleasance Dome, ★★★) offers up a dose of pure escapist pleasure. A homage to classic Hollywood capers, the show follows New York-based Frenchman Roger, whose orderly life is one day rudely blown apart by a band of shadowy assassins. Though the rollicking pace does flag at points, this four-hander magics up delight in every creative contortion and every rattle of the snare drum as Roger’s pursuit for answers takes him across continents and into the heady outer reaches of our atmosphere.</p> <p>Sophie Duker takes us on a less literally explosive but equally enlightening journey around the world in her latest hour, <strong><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/sophie-duker-hag\">Hag</a></strong> (Pleasance Courtyard, ★★★).

Then it’s all about the crystal witches she fell in with on a lesbian cruise, then the labour-saving benefits of threesomes. Despite <em>Hag</em>’s scattershot direction, the audience trots gamely along, such is the power of Duker’s charisma, which has us leaning in with every conspiratorial drop in her voice.

But some dude steals my junk and pimps it for 120K+ in 2019. Plagiarism…?”</p> <p>Both artists taped their bananas at an angle. Morford also taped an orange horizontally to another panel.</p> <p>While Cattelan’s buyers were paying for instructions on how to install and display a banana, he has reportedly argued that, unlike his own banana,<em> </em>the fruit in <em>Banana &amp; Orange</em> is synthetic, so Morford “cannot own the idea of a real banana duct-taped to a wall”.</p> <p>But US district judge Robert N Scola Jr has ruled that Morford can proceed with his case because “the alleged infringement of Morford’s banana is sufficient, quantitatively and qualitatively, to state a claim”.</p> <p>He acknowledged, while not stating whether or not he agreed with it, Morford’s argument that Cattelan had access to <em>Banana &amp; Orange</em> as it was on his personal website, as well as on YouTube and Facebook, for years.</p> <p>In his ruling, Scola wrote: “Can a banana taped to a wall be art? Must art be beautiful? Creative? Emotive? A banana taped to a wall may not embody human creativity, but it may evoke some feelings, good or bad. In any event, a banana taped to a wall recalls [philosopher] Marshall McLuhan’s definition of art: ‘anything you can get away with’.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/08/banana-artwork-that-fetched-120000-is-eaten-by-hungry-artist\">Banana artwork that fetched $120,000 is eaten by ‘hungry’ artist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He continued: “No one can claim a copyright in ideas, so Morford cannot claim a copyright in the idea of affixing a banana to a vertical plane using duct tape. Nor can Morford claim a copyright in bananas or duct tape.”</p> <p>But he concluded: “While using silver duct tape to affix a banana to a wall may not espouse the highest degree of creativity, its absurd and farcical nature meets the ‘minimal degree of creativity’ needed to qualify as original.”</p> <p>Scola acknowledged that “there are only so many choices an artist can make in colours, positioning and angling when expressing the idea of a banana taped to a wall”, adding: “In both works, a single piece of silver duct tape runs upward from left to right at an angle, affixing a centered yellow banana, angled downward left to right, against a wall. In both works, the banana and the duct tape intersect at roughly the midpoints of each, although the duct tape is less centered on the banana in Morford’s work than in <em>Comedian</em>.”</p> <p>Michael Daley, director of ArtWatch UK, the art world watchdog, said: “Lord Goodman famously advised that the best defence against a charge of theft is a flat denial – ‘I did not take the apple’ – and that anything added – ‘I do not like apples’, ‘I had just eaten’ – weakens the case. Cattelan’s lawyers protest that the original taped banana was accompanied by a taped orange and Cattelan adds – possibly with a touch of sour grapes? – that the original taped banana was synthetic, not real. Judge Scola rightly sees that while taping real or synthetic fruit to walls singly or in pairs may be of minuscule artistic value, the law is the law. This is a very ripe dispute indeed.”</p> <p>Cattelan is no stranger to controversy. His works include an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/16/maurizio-cattelan-solid-gold-toilet-america-stolen-blenheim-palace\">18-carat gold toilet</a> entitled <em>America</em>.

It was chilly; rain pelted down. “It was not so fun to be there. It was so cold and everything was wet,” De Mahieu, 26,<strong> </strong>says from her home in Brussels, laughing.</p> <p>Tourists came and took portraits of themselves against the view. De Mahieu noticed that, as soon as someone stepped in front of the camera, they would shed their layers in defiance of the cold to convey the image of a blissful summer. In front of the camera: T-shirts, floaty dresses. Behind it: swathes of padded jackets. It was Instagram versus reality.</p> <p>De Mahieu’s photo series, which she calls Theatre of Authenticity, explores the link between tourism and spectacle, and how we perform when we travel, particularly when we think no one is watching. The photos make up the graduation project for her masters degree in documentary photography, and bring together the three issues that most preoccupy her: tourism, social media and climate change.</p> <p>“I love to travel,” De Mahieu says, recalling a trip to Bolivia when she was 18 as the moment she became interested in photography. “I’m also very curious about why we love travelling, and our motivations.” And, she adds: “I spend too much time on social media.” Scrolling through Instagram, De Mahieu started to have “the feeling that everyone is going to the same places, using the same photographic compositions, the same colours”. It sparked a very generation Z artist’s dilemma. Surrounded by endless digital content, she began to wonder if she would ever make something truly unique.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It is a commentary on how social media can transform places into must-see destinations – an influencer’s Instagram post can open the floodgates</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And so De Mahieu took that concern about uniqueness, and gave it a twist. She would take precisely the sort of photo that tens of thousands had already taken. But rather than do what many a camera-wielding tourist has done when faced with a crowded destination – block out the other people in view and deliver an image that suggests it is them alone surrounded by natural splendour – she would add more people.</p> <p>She began by identifying some of the most geotagged European tourist destinations on Instagram, including the lake at Obersee, Turkey’s romantic Cappadocia region (famous for its hot-air balloons), Spain’s Bardenas Reales desert, and the rocky <em>calanques</em> (coves) in Marseille. Travelling to these destinations in her campervan across the summer, she would usually spend two days in each place. The first day was set aside for scoping out the area and finding the best angle to shoot from. The next day, she would set up her camera on a tripod and take photos at intervals for an hour, documenting tourists coming and going. When editing, she would use Photoshop to produce a time-lapse collage that showed all the people who had visited the area over 60 minutes. One finished image can take up to a week to perfect.</p> <p>There is a version of this project that would take on some of the most popular landmarks around the world: walkers atop the Great Wall of China; hundreds pretending to prop up the Leaning Tower of Pisa. But De Mahieu deliberately chose off-the-beaten-track destinations. “I wanted to show the impact of that kind of ‘invisible tourism’ on these places. When I say invisible, I mean that when you’re there you have a feeling that you are alone. But over an hour, or an afternoon, there are a lot of people going there.”</p> <p>It is a commentary on how social media is able to quickly transform somewhere into a must-see destination – an Instagram post by an influencer can open the floodgates – and also how this fame can have harmful environmental effects (in June this year, Marseille’s Calanques national park capped visitor numbers for the first time to protect the rock formations). “Climate change is very real and very obvious,” De Mahieu says; it was “quite natural” that her work would respond to those concerns.</p> <p>She does not see herself as exempt from the culture depicted in her photos. De Mahieu loves to travel, and admits that she spends too much time on social media; even in her own photography, she feels the pervasive influence of the Instagram aesthetic (soft pastel colours, a tidy composition that suits the default square shape – “I’m like: no! I don’t want it!”). Her photographs, rather than standing in judgment, are a playful invitation to think: about what we are searching for when we leave home; how our everyday decisions are influenced by the allure of a beautiful image, and why, in a culture that prizes individuality, we all seem to crave that shot of ourselves standing in front of a little wooden house on the lake in our summer best, surrounded by the mountains and trees and open waters – and absolutely nobody else. </p> <h2><strong>Cappadocia</strong><strong>, Turkey, November 2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Tagged 2.2m</strong><strong> times on Instagram </strong>(<em>based on images tagged to location at time of </em><em>publication)</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8882edaadb3f31a6f82564d1c99b430acd39f3ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8882edaadb3f31a6f82564d1c99b430acd39f3ca/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cappadocia, Turkey, October 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All composite photographs: Natacha de Mahieu</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natacha de Mahieu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Every day at sunrise, hot-air balloons filled with tourists fly over the mountain ridges of the Cappadocia region in central Turkey,” says Natacha de Mahieu. “Here, travellers take selfies, while a couple stages a proposal on a vintage car in front of a professional photographer.

By last weekend, for whatever fickle reasons, it had burst into life. The Usher Hall was full, the foyers buzzing before the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra’s concert performance of Richard Strauss’s <strong>Salome</strong>, with its British chief conductor Edward Gardner.</p> <p>Their account of Britten’s <em>Peter Grimes</em> five years ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/18/peter-grimes-bergen-philharmonic-stuart-skelton-usher-hall-edinburgh-rene-pape\">was unforgettable</a>. Now, with a star cast led by two Swedish sopranos – <a href=\"https://malinbystrom.com/\">Malin Byström</a> in the title role of the biblical dancing girl and Katarina Dalayman as her manipulative and screechy mother, Herodias – hopes were high. (These two, both excellent, will reprise their roles at the Royal Opera House in London <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/salome-by-david-mcvicar-details\">next month</a>. More on their interpretations then.) In the German tenor <a href=\"https://gerhardsiegel.com/en/home-english/\">Gerhard Siegel</a>, the cast had the finest of Herods, the most slithery and reptilian and repulsive and feckless, sung with conniving subtlety (sorry Gerhard, nothing personal). Johan Reuter’s Jokanaan, Bror Magnus Tødenes’s Narraboth and Hanna Hipp’s Page each added lustre.</p> <p>In any version of <em>Salome</em>, the tale offers cold comfort. Post #MeToo, post Jeffrey Epstein, where do we stand? A teenager, abused by her stepfather, abuses in return by demanding the murder of a prophet, whose head – in Strauss’s opera – she kisses on its silver platter. Some feast. Beyond a few hand gestures and facial expressions, easy and natural from singers so experienced in their roles, there was no attempt at a semi-staging. Byström entered, dressed in white and virginal as the moon to which she is compared (the opera is closely based on Oscar Wilde’s play), later adding a billowing scarlet silk overskirt to convey blood, corruption, obsession. For the dance of the seven veils, she departed, leaving the orchestra to strip off all its lingering inhibitions and let rip.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The audience was won over, as was the volunteer who agreed to toss gummy bears into the singer’s open mouth on high notes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This was the right decision. To hear Strauss’s meticulous orchestration, so controlled and precise while achieving so voluptuous and often grotesque an impression, was more revelatory, call me odd, than a striptease squeezed on to the Usher Hall stage. He writes with absolute punctiliousness, so that the percussionist can softly rattle a tambourine, or click the castanets, in a way that resounds, sinister and unholy, above a huge orchestra playing full tilt. The contrabassoon, which has one of the opera’s limelight solos, curdles and creeps like the serpent itself. It was a chance to witness the mix of tone colour and dynamics, the use of vibrato or not – all part of the player’s tool kit that, in the distractions of a full staging, too often goes unnoticed.</p> <p>The <strong><a href=\"https://harmonien.no/en/\">Bergen Philharmonic</a></strong> and Gardner gave a second concert on Monday, further proof of this orchestra’s quality. They were joined by <a href=\"https://vikingurolafsson.com/\">Víkingur Ólafsson</a> for Schumann’s Piano Concerto. The Icelandic pianist, a regular collaborator with these players, prefers rigour to flamboyance, and brought out the dialogue between the contrasting inner voices, always keeping a clear route through the work’s hybrid structure. This concerto has its own knots and puzzles, which the performers embraced rather than smoothed out. Two orchestral showpieces, Ravel’s <em>La Valse</em> and Rachmaninov’s <em>Symphonic Dances</em>, completed the programme. The final chord sounded, with the tam-tam still vibrating, but the crowd was already whooping and cheering.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76e79b5676b439d85ba9fdf994a724a7426c0f16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76e79b5676b439d85ba9fdf994a724a7426c0f16/0_0_2048_1365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pianist Víkingur Ólafsson’s Edinburgh festival debut with the Bergen Philharmonic, conductor Edward Gardner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Knots and puzzles’: pianist Víkingur Ólafsson with conductor Edward Gardner and the Bergen Philharmonic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Buchanan/EIF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the Queen’s Hall on Monday (all its morning concerts are broadcast live on Radio 3), the <strong><a href=\"https://www.takacsquartet.com/biography\">Takács Quartet</a></strong> played Haydn’s String Quartet, Op 77 No 2, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s student work, the 5 Fantasiestücke, Op 5, and Ravel’s Quartet in F major.

At Sainsbury’s the 500g and 1kg packs were £1.30 and £1.75 respectively.</p> <p>A 420g jar of Sharwood’s tikka masala cooking sauce with a best-before date of 28 February 2023 was £1.19, down from a stated RRP of £1.70.</p> <p>What appeared to be the same item was priced at £1.80 at Asda and £2 at Tesco.</p> <p>At Low Price Foods, shoppers could pick up three boxes of Cadbury’s peanut protein brunch bars (with a best-before of 2 November 2022) for £3.50 instead of the stated £6, and two packs of Ben’s Original microwave rice golden vegetable (with a best-before of 1 September 2022) for £1.75, down from £2.98.</p> <p>It was £1.50 for one box of the brunch bars at Morrisons, meaning three packs would cost £4.50, but only £1 at Sainsbury’s, adding up to £3 for three.</p> <p>Crucially, as the discounted shops typically sell branded food, shoppers will often be able to get cheaper own-brand options by visiting a traditional supermarket, where you can also sometimes pick up some great “yellow sticker” bargains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f25e6e9737c211dfb8d24271193598e9f9504bca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f25e6e9737c211dfb8d24271193598e9f9504bca/62_112_5837_3502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cardboard box at a front door\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Remember to factor in delivery costs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 9gifts Kevalee/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we looked, Asda own-brand versions of 500g spaghetti and tikka masala cooking sauce cost 23p and 90p respectively, while Tesco own-brand versions were 23p and 95p respectively.</p> <p>Consumers also need to factor in delivery costs. For example, a basket of shopping worth £29 at Approved Food will typically cost £3 to deliver to a London postcode (it offers free delivery when you spend more than £55), while the delivery fees at Low Price Foods start at £4.95. Also bear in mind how long it might take for the stuff to come. For example, when we looked, the Low Price Foods site mentioned three to five working days but also four to seven working days.</p> <p>As the stock is limited, there may also be restrictions on how much of each item shoppers are allowed to buy.</p> <p>Oli Townsend, a deals expert at MoneySavingExpert, says buying food that is discounted because it is approaching or beyond its best-before date “can be a useful way of helping to combat the rising cost of groceries”.</p> <p>He adds: “Grocery clearance sites such as Approved Food and Motatos are best used for bagging heavily discounted kitchen cupboard essentials that you regularly buy. The downside to these is there’s often a hefty minimum spend, and delivery generally isn’t cheap, so it’s only worth it if you’re willing to bulk-buy.”</p> <p>Townsend says that while use-by dates are a health warning and shouldn’t be exceeded, “best-before dates are just a manufacturer’s guidance on optimum quality, and so food that’s past its best is still safe to eat”.</p> <p>Concerns have also been raised in some quarters about the health implications of eating discounted food items, which are often packaged and processed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7697422d58c6f09506c6aba9923a2a5003f2c73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7697422d58c6f09506c6aba9923a2a5003f2c73/0_0_1407_1639/858.jpg\" alt=\"Fruit and vegetables in Waitrose\" width=\"858\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waitrose, Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer have scrapped best-before dates on certain products to reduce food waste.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ben Reynolds, the deputy chief executive of the food charity Sustain, says: “With more and more people on the breadline, it’s understandable to see a rise in shops specialising in cheap produce. But people want to have a healthy, balanced diet rather than little other choice than highly processed unhealthy food and drink.”</p> <p>Supermarkets including Waitrose, Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer have been scrapping best-before dates on certain products to reduce food waste in stores and prevent households from throwing away food that is fine to eat.</p> <p>Laura Rettie, the editor of Finance.co.uk, says it is “ultimately a positive move”<em> </em>for shoppers.</p> <p>The difference between a best-before and a use-by date can easily be mistaken, and decent food often goes to waste, costing consumers money to replace perfectly good food, she says.</p> <p>“I empathise with shoppers who may fear this move will mean they might end up with food that won’t keep for as long without the guidance of a best-before date. I urge supermarkets not to take advantage of shoppers by selling fresh goods close to or past their best-before dates to prove this move is a positive one.”</p> <p>Apps such as Too Good To Go and Olio have gained popularity in recent years, allowing users to pick up leftover food from shops and cafes in their local area at a discounted price.</p> <p>There are also organisations such as FareShare that distribute unwanted food from shops to charities and food banks.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/20/sarah-willis-mozart-y-mambo-cuban-dances-review-alison-balsom-quiet-city-britten-sinfonia","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T11:00:38Z","webTitle":"Classical home listening: Sarah Willis: Mozart y Mambo: Cuban Dances; Alison Balsom: Quiet City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/20/sarah-willis-mozart-y-mambo-cuban-dances-review-alison-balsom-quiet-city-britten-sinfonia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/20/sarah-willis-mozart-y-mambo-cuban-dances-review-alison-balsom-quiet-city-britten-sinfonia","fields":{"headline":"Classical home listening: Sarah Willis: Mozart y Mambo: Cuban Dances; Alison Balsom: Quiet City","trailText":"Horn player Sarah Willis returns to Cuba for more sizzling collaborations, while trumpet virtuoso Alison Balsom captivates in Copland, Bernstein and more","byline":"Fiona Maddocks","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e330f005a91353380c3f7e72bb5ec67a7518ff8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e330f005a91353380c3f7e72bb5ec67a7518ff8e/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ALPHA878 COVER\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>• <strong><a href=\"https://sarah-willis.com/\">Sarah Willis</a></strong>, a member of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 2001 and the orchestra’s first female brass player, has triumphed variously in many directions, as TV presenter and chamber musician, as well as being a persuasive champion of the french horn. Two years ago she teamed up with musicians in Havana. The result was their joyful collaboration, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/25/mozart-y-mambo-sarah-willis-review-alwyn-miss-julie-bbc-symphony-oramo-roman-trilogy-london-sinfonia-john-wilson\">Mozart y Mambo</a></em>, in which she and the band played Mozart alongside traditional Cuban music. Now a second disc is out: <strong><a href=\"https://outhere-music.com/en/albums/mozart-y-mambo-cuban-dances\">Mozart y Mambo: Cuban Dances</a></strong> (Alpha Classics), with the Havana Lyceum Orchestra and conductor José Antonio Méndez Padrón.</p> <p>Willis is the first-class soloist in Mozart’s Horn Concerto No 1 in D and No 2 in E flat. A seven-strong ensemble, enchantingly called Sarahbanda, perform Pa Pa Pa by Edgar Olivero, inspired by the Papageno/Papagena duet from Mozart’s <em>The Magic Flute</em>. The fizzing Havana Lyceum Orchestra plays traditional Cuban dances, for solo horn, strings and percussion, with a difference: all have been commissioned by Willis, from six young Cuban composers. Enrique Lazaga (güiro), a member of the original Buena Vista Social Club, makes a guest appearance. With a suave rumba (with chirping cricket), bolero and cha-cha-cha – Sarahchá – this is perfect hot weather music. </p> <p>This star player is put through her hornist paces and comes out dancing. Some of the proceeds will go to buying instruments for the young Havana musicians.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPxcfXTdWjo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LPxcfXTdWjo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPxcfXTdWjo\">Watch a clip of Sarahchá, performed by Sarah Willis and co.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eb31dba5c6310cf14d1b1a44a6e891b9c7581dcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb31dba5c6310cf14d1b1a44a6e891b9c7581dcd/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warner Alison Balsom Quiet City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>• The starting point for trumpeter <strong><a href=\"https://www.alisonbalsom.com/\">Alison Balsom</a></strong>’s latest solo album was a concert in 2017 at London’s Barbican with the Britten Sinfonia. <strong><a href=\"https://www.warnerclassics.com/release/quiet-city\">Quiet City</a></strong> (Warner Classics), conducted by Scott Stroman, is the result. The mix of mid-20th-century repertoire in the seven tracks is predominantly American, from Aaron Copland’s Quiet City to Charles Ives’s The Unanswered Question, and the Lonely Town Pas de deux from Leonard Bernstein’s <em>On the Town</em>.</p> <p>As an entity it creates a varied album in every kind of mood. It will delight anyone, not only the trumpet expert, who admires Balsom’s eclecticism and musical brilliance. She is joined by oboist Nicholas Daniel, playing cor anglais on Quiet City, and the pianist Tom Poster in Simon Wright’s skilful arrangement of Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue. Balsom’s virtuosity is spellbinding throughout.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odEp_QI5Cj8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/odEp_QI5Cj8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Alison Balsom plays Bernstein: Lonely Town.
