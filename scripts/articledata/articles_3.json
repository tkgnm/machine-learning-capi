Sadly, the deeper questions about what caused them go untackled","byline":"Rebecca Nicholson","body":"<p>In 2019, the wreckage of the now notorious failed Fyre festival was the subject of an entertaining Netflix documentary. But while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/14/fyre-netflix-documentary-festival-disaster-review\">Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened</a> was an exercise in schadenfreude, the three-part series Trainwreck: Woodstock 99 (Netflix), which depicts the doomed revival of the 1969 peace-and-love festival, is a much darker portrait of mob rule, exploitation and misogyny.</p> <p>A brisk and often horrifying watch, Trainwreck is effective at ramping up the tension and building a sense of dread and impending disaster. Each episode follows a day of the festival, from an optimistic start on Friday through to the apocalyptic scenes in the early hours of Monday morning, using a ticking clock to count down to each fresh catastrophe. From the start, its organisers freely admit that their intention was to make as much money as they could. In 1994, there had been another Woodstock revival, but the fences were breached and it didn’t turn a profit. By the time the 1999 event was pulled together, an eight-mile perimeter fence was erected around a decommissioned airbase, many of the crucial infrastructure tasks had been cheaply outsourced, and independent food and drink vendors were allowed to charge as much as they wanted for water and sustenance. It was hot, there was minimal shade and 250,000 punters grew increasingly irate.</p> <p>There were omens of an ill-tempered weekend from the start. The crowd was – by many accounts and from the plentiful footage of the time – macho and aggressive, a “frat boy” culture dominating the event. A cardboard sign saying “show us your tits” – which someone had taken the time to make – is waved at female artists from the crowd. Sheryl Crow bats away sexist heckles with more patience than the audience deserve. Teenage girls talk about being groped and molested as they crowdsurf. It isn’t until the final few minutes of the last episode that its most notorious and terrible legacy – reports of multiple rapes, including in the moshpit – is fully addressed, to the clear distress of some of those who worked in the team, and the frankly appalling defensiveness of others.</p> <p>There are obvious villains here, though their shocking lack of self-awareness makes it debatable whether they would see themselves that way. There is a lot of finger-pointing and blame-shifting, from one organiser to another, from the organisers to the crowd, from the crowd to the organisers. Was it the fault of the nu-metal acts who stirred everyone up, or the bookers who didn’t vary the tempo of the acts on the stage? Was it the kids who interpreted those old 60s notions of free love as a licence to maraud, or the profiteering managers who failed to provide even the most basic infrastructure that might have placated 250,000 “high as balls” attenders? Was it the culture, or the environment? Was it greed, or naivety? One of the most telling slogans, sprayed on what barricades were left standing, reads: “Down with Profitstock”.</p> <p>This is where Trainwreck, though largely enthralling, reaches its limits. It does an impeccable job of laying out the story, but doesn’t venture far below the surface. As Fatboy Slim’s set in the rave hangar ends under hideous circumstances, and he, like many other acts, gets out of there as quickly as he possibly can, you can feel the fear and the nascent panic. By the end, it is like a disaster movie. But surely there is more to be explored than that. The biggest questions are why it turned, and why in such a particular and grotesque way. Why did a music festival that was meant to stand as a statement against gun violence, in the aftermath of the Columbine school shooting, collapse into such violence and misogyny? In the end, it doesn’t have the heart to go there in any depth, following the adrenaline-inducing spectacle of the fires and the riots instead.</p> <p>I was a teenager when Woodstock 99 took place, reading the music press for the first time. Reading about what had happened to women and girls at a music festival – one of the things I wanted to do most in the whole world, as soon as I was old enough – was a formative experience. One of the few light moments here comes from one of the festival’s attenders, Heather, who was 14 at the time. She says that now, at least, “we don’t accept what happened any more … I’m glad that my daughters will never have to see that and think that is just the way it is.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/03/premier-league-players-to-look-out-for-aaronson-malacia","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T12:00:26Z","webTitle":"Fresh faces: six Premier League players to look out for in the 2022-23 season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/03/premier-league-players-to-look-out-for-aaronson-malacia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/03/premier-league-players-to-look-out-for-aaronson-malacia","fields":{"headline":"Fresh faces: six Premier League players to look out for in the 2022-23 season","trailText":"From Brendan Aaronson to Tyrell Malacia we profile half a dozen new arrivals to the division","byline":"Will Unwin and John Brewin","body":"<h2>Brenden Aaronson (Leeds)</h2> <p>In an ideal world, Aaronson would have arrived at Elland Road in January, but Leeds had two offers rejected for the attacking midfielder. Jesse Marsch was keen for Leeds to revisit the deal, having seen his compatriot progress in Major League Soccer and having coached him at Red Bull Salzburg. Aaronson made the decision to go from the MLS to Salzburg despite more lucrative offers from elsewhere because he thought it would be the ideal way to progress his career. Aaronson’s creativity and versatility will be a useful asset to a team that has lost Raphinha to Barcelona. Leeds were very reliant on the Brazilian to create chances out of nothing but with Aaronson and Luis Sinisterra joining the club, they should have more ways to open up opponents. The 21-year-old is clever off the ball and can spot a gap in the defence in order to find valuable space in dangerous positions. <strong>WU</strong></p> <h2>Flynn Downes (West Ham)</h2> <p>Mark Noble’s retirement left a vacancy for a boyhood West Ham fan in the club’s midfield, though unlike Canning Town’s profoundly working-class “Nobes”, Downes is an Essex boy who attended the same private Brentwood School as Frank Lampard Jr, the boxing promoter, Eddie Hearn, and Noel Edmonds. Downes finally arrived at West Ham this summer after 14 years at Ipswich and, last season, at Swansea, where the 23-year-old was the metronome of Russell Martin’s attractive side – his pass-completion rate of 92.6% was the highest of any player in England’s top four divisions. The expectation is that Downes will complement and perhaps eventually supplant Declan Rice in midfield, as well as follow in the footsteps of Jarrod Bowen in being a lower-league gem polished up by David Moyes. “The manager’s track record of bringing players through was a big motivation,” said Downes on signing for West Ham. <strong>JB</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4d6117601e4d60c55e57d17cc35b1a5bfe0bb1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4d6117601e4d60c55e57d17cc35b1a5bfe0bb1e/0_0_7478_4871/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flynn Downes is interviewed following his signing for the Hammers in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flynn Downes is interviewed following his signing in July. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dael/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2022/jun/21/transfer-window-players-europe-premier-league-clubs-manchester-united-chelsea-tottenham-arsenal\">Transfer targets: players linked with Premier League moves this summer</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Moussa Niakhaté (Nottingham Forest)</h2> <p>Having made a number of youthful signings this summer, Nottingham Forest were keen to add leadership and experience to their ranks before the club’s first top-flight campaign in 23 years. Niakhaté fits the bill given the former France Under-21 international defender was club captain at Mainz. He also brings with him speed and ability on the ball. Niakhaté, 26, started his career with Valenciennes and Metz before spending four seasons in the Bundesliga. He is left-footed and is the ideal man to play on the left side of a back three in Steve Cooper’s preferred 3-4-2-1 formation, all of which may well have been discussed when Niakhaté travelled to Greece in order to meet Cooper to discuss the project at the City Ground and how he would fit in before making the move to Nottingham. <strong>WU</strong></p> <h2>Sven Botman (Newcastle)</h2> <p>Despite the expectations of a fair few Toon Army foot soldiers upon the completion of last October’s Saudi-led takeover, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar are yet to arrive on Tyneside. Newcastle’s recruitment has instead targeted players who are taking a step up in heading to the Premier League and can share the journey to the top. Like key January addition Bruno Guimarães, Botman, signed for £32m from Lille, arrives from Ligue 1. Still only 22, the Ajax youth product was a key man in Lille’s 2020-21 title triumph, which brought him to the attention of many of Europe’s leading lights. Newcastle tried and failed to sign the player in January but finally got their man, and he should prove a notable upgrade within Eddie Howe’s defence. Tall and dominant in the air yet comfortable bringing the ball from defence, in the words of Howe, “he’s a presence”. <strong>JB</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"310974655502adb39f4e990323ac38252d69a604\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/310974655502adb39f4e990323ac38252d69a604/0_376_4250_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sven Botman on Newcastle’s pre-season tour in Austria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sven Botman on Newcastle’s pre-season tour in Austria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Julián Álvarez (Manchester City)</h2> <p>Erling Haaland’s arrival in east Manchester has allowed Álvarez to sneak under the radar, which is not a bad thing for a young man moving to a new continent. Understandably, the Argentinian sought advice from City legend Sergio Agüero before committing to the move. The 22-year-old is seen as one of the best talents to come out of South America in recent years – the forward was wanted by a number of clubs in Europe, including Barcelona – and although City Football Group has numerous options to send him on loan, Pep Guardiola wanted him to be part of his squad immediately. Álvarez is happy to get the ball into feet but will also be keen to make runs into space. His time down the middle might be limited due to Haaland but he will get plenty of chances to show what he can do within a front three; he often operated on the right for River Plate. <strong>WU</strong></p> <h2>Tyrell Malacia (Manchester United)</h2> <p>A list of the first signings made by David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjær as Manchester United manager is undistinguished. Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera, Eric Bailly and Daniel James do not set a high bar for Malacia, a 22-year-old left-back from Rotterdam. His arrival suggests Erik ten Hag is dissatisfied with Luke Shaw and Alex Telles, United’s existing left-backs, and in the new man the new manager has a player whose standout attributes include energy, physique and speed. The Eredivisie offers a less-than-exacting examination of defensive positioning, and timing of tackling, about which the signing from Feyenoord is noticeably exuberant. He’s confident, too. “My defence is good, my attacking, my technique is good,” Malacia declared during United’s pre-season tour. <strong>JB</strong></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2022/aug/03/wiradjuri-designer-denni-francisco-wins-top-prize-for-second-year-at-2022-national-indigenous-fashion-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T12:00:26Z","webTitle":"Wiradjuri designer Denni Francisco wins top prize for second year at 2022 National Indigenous Fashion Awards ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/aug/03/wiradjuri-designer-denni-francisco-wins-top-prize-for-second-year-at-2022-national-indigenous-fashion-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2022/aug/03/wiradjuri-designer-denni-francisco-wins-top-prize-for-second-year-at-2022-national-indigenous-fashion-awards","fields":{"headline":"Wiradjuri designer Denni Francisco wins top prize for second year at 2022 National Indigenous Fashion Awards ","trailText":"Francisco scoops fashion designer award for elegant womenswear collection, while bark skirts and statement streetwear also celebrated at Darwin event","byline":"Lorena Allam and Alyx Gorman","body":"<p>A Wiradjuri designer whose philosophy of “Yindyamarra” – fashion that shows “respect, is polite, considered, gentle to Country” – has won designer of the year at the National Indigenous Fashion Awards.</p> <p>For the second year running, Denni Francisco of Ngali won the fashion designer award for her elegant, tailoring-focused womenswear which features digital prints and hand-embellished details adapted from the works of First Nations artists from across the country.</p> <p>Francisco’s latest collection, presented in May at Australian fashion week, featured the works of Gija artist Lindsay Malay from the north-western Kimberly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2022/aug/03/country-to-couture-2022-indigenous-fashion-hits-the-runway-in-pictures\">Country to Couture 2022: Indigenous fashion hits the runway – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A Wiradjuri woman, Francisco describes her design philosophy as “Yindyamarra” or “fashion that shows respect, is polite, considered, gentle to Country and shows honour to the cross country collaborations with other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander creatives.”</p> <p>Francisco has become a key figure in the Australian fashion industry, consulting on projects such as the establishment of an Australian Fashion trademark.</p> <p>From a hand-knotted mókko (bark skirt) to statement-making streetwear, the breadth of Indigenous design excellence was celebrated at the National Indigenous Fashion Awards (Nifa) on a warm dry-season evening in Darwin on Wednesday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ddfd27efcfa45d1ae93c044b75966dfc5ea5c68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ddfd27efcfa45d1ae93c044b75966dfc5ea5c68/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esther Yarllarlla, standing by Djomi with nja-djéngka (dilly bags), mókko pubic covering, and fabric design, 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artist Esther Yarllarlla with nja-djéngka (dilly bags), mókko pubic covering and fabric design.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Stalenberg/Bábbarra Women’s Centre</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Held on Larrakia Country in Darwin as part of the <a href=\"https://daaf.com.au/\">Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair</a>, the awards recognised outstanding contributions in six fields: from traditional adornment, textile design, fashion design and wearable art to community collaboration and business achievement.</p> <p>Esther Yarllarlla won the traditional adornment award for a mókko (bark skirt) commissioned by Bábbarra Women’s Centre.

But the ending is deeply moving – proof of sorts that master technicians are at work.</p> <p>Directed by Trevor Nunn, with music and lyrics by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe respectively, Identical is based on Erich Kästner’s novel Das Doppelte Lottchen, in which twin girls separated as children meet at a summer camp and switch places when returning to their respective homes. Screen adaptations paid dividends for director Nancy Meyers in 1998 and for Disney in 1961, both using the name The Parent Trap.</p> <p>The obvious obstacle to putting the story on stage is the necessity for twin actors. At the Nottingham Playhouse premiere, Eden and Emme Patrick, one of three sets of twins cast for this production, took the spotlight (and shared the curtain call with Kyla and Nicole Fox and Savannah and Sienna Robinson, all of whom will play the roles).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5df86e442175f0a4adb17d0d46823d609dc7893a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5df86e442175f0a4adb17d0d46823d609dc7893a/198_252_2387_1456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Darch, Emily Tierney, Emme Patrick and Eden Patrick in Identical.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"610\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Darch, Emily Tierney, Emme Patrick and Eden Patrick in Identical.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pamela Raith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The production is blessed with the Patrick sisters, who are comfortable on stage and, importantly, likable; the first half has little conflict, inoffensive songs and lashings of sincerity. When we meet a cast of pre-teens in the opening number, audiences will think of Matilda, but there the similarity ends. While that show is subversive, Identical is earnest and played with the straightest of bats.</p> <p>It all pays off in the second half, when Nunn, Stiles and Drew begin to push the buttons they have so skilfully put in place. Nunn’s affinity with Shakespeare’s plays about twins is plain to see: he mines the emotional connection to give a satisfying, almost Shakespearean denouement. There is also an echo of another story of twins separated at birth when Emily Tierney, as the mother of the girls, has a showstopper of a moment with a song called Identical, which evokes Blood Brothers’ Tell Me It’s Not True.</p> <p>It takes a while to get the engine going, but once it’s at full speed, you relax knowing the best in the business have built this machine. This will surely transfer, tighten and become a firm family favourite. </p> <ul> <li><p>At <a href=\"https://nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/\">Nottingham Playhouse</a> until 14 August</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/03/her-review-enigmatic-star-rocks-and-sensuously-rolls","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T11:23:18Z","webTitle":"HER review – enigmatic star rocks, and sensuously rolls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/03/her-review-enigmatic-star-rocks-and-sensuously-rolls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/03/her-review-enigmatic-star-rocks-and-sensuously-rolls","fields":{"headline":"HER review – enigmatic star rocks, and sensuously rolls","trailText":"The singer and multi-instrumentalist showcases her talents with terrific R&amp;B songs as well as shredding Prince-style guitar solos","byline":"Fergal Kinney","body":"<p>HER is the alias of 25-year-old R&amp;B vocalist Gabriella Wilson, a US child star mentored by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/aliciakeys\">Alicia Keys</a> who made her first TV appearances aged 10. In the six years since anonymously dropping her Grammy-nominated debut single, Focus, enigma has been her hard currency.

It complements her other hard currency; Prince comparisons, something underlined by plenty of purple lighting.</p> <p>HER’s discography is a pot-pourri of collaborations that may provide streaming ubiquity, but have left her studio releases uneven.

HER’s most ambitious track, it features the singer rapping while playing drums, then centre-stage in diva soul mode, before seeing out the song’s thrilling climax on her knees, shredding the kind of gnarly guitar solo that’s been out of pop favour her entire lifetime.

But she lost other claims including that her dismissal was related to race, religion or belief.</p> <p>Cohen had accused Mahmood of sacking her after she raised concerns with him under whistleblowing regulations about allegations of criminal behaviour by a fellow staffer.</p> <p>Mahmood maintained that Cohen was dismissed for breaking protocols of parliamentary office and sending him “derogatory” and “offensive” emails, one of which described him as a “first-class idiot”, which was forwarded to the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer.</p> <p>In his letter dismissing Cohen he accused her of repeatedly disrespecting him, calling him names and copying in additional people to intimidate him.</p> <p>The tribunal heard, over a six-day hearing in May, that Cohen’s nickname for Mahmood in WhatsApp messages was “catfish”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/62e9337ed3bf7f75b61f8bca/Ms_E_Cohen_vs_Mr_K_Mahmood_MP.pdf\">This week the tribunal published its findings</a>, agreeing that Cohen was unfairly dismissed.</p> <p>A claim of detriment because of a protected disclosure also succeeded because she had been “marginalised and isolated” from January 2020 until her dismissal a year later.</p> <p>Cohen started to work in Mahmood’s MP office in 2003 and they were, in the early days, in a romantic relationship, which came to an end before the events leading to her dismissal. The tribunal heard evidence that their relationship had been strained and “dysfunctional for many years”.</p> <p>On 11 October 2020, the pair spent a Sunday afternoon “duelling” over emails, which led to Mahmood forwarding their correspondence – including the “first-class idiot” comment – to Starmer.</p> <p>A month later, the hearing heard, Cohen sent Mahmood a “crass and insensitive” email after the death of his father-in-law, and later sent him an “inappropriate and unnecessary” email, with a constituent copied in, which called him several names including being a “cold-hearted liar,” a “womanising con merchant” and “jealous”.</p> <p>“This was in short something akin to a ‘poison pen’ email, which was calculated by the claimant to be offensive to the respondent,” the ruling by a panel led by Judge Tim Adkin stated.</p> <p>A formal disciplinary case was then launched in January 2021 by Mahmood, who listed five allegations against Cohen. She was dismissed on 27 January that year.</p> <p>The panel concluded that while three out of the five allegations listed by Mahmood were “ample reasonable grounds for belief in misconduct”, the way her dismissal had been carried out was “outside of the range of reasonable responses”.</p> <p>The panel added it accepted one claim of detriment after Mahmood did not contact her during 2020.</p> <p>“The tribunal accepts the claimant’s evidence that she did feel marginalised and isolated from January 2020 until her dismissal,” it said. “We find that the respondent, who had in recent years been in a fairly dysfunctional relationship with the claimant, offered very little by way of contact or support during the course of 2020. This was potentially detrimental treatment.”</p> <p>Following the judgment Mahmood said in a statement that he was pleased with a judgment “that the principal reason that the claimant was dismissed was her conduct”. He also pointed to the dismissal of claims that the sacking was related to race, religion or belief.</p> <p>A two-day remedy hearing is due to be heard on 29 and 30 September.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/03/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-16-nottingham-forest","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T11:01:25Z","webTitle":"Premier League 2022-23 preview No 16: Nottingham Forest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/03/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-16-nottingham-forest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/03/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-16-nottingham-forest","fields":{"headline":"Premier League 2022-23 preview No 16: Nottingham Forest","trailText":"The euphoria of their playoff triumph has subsided and now Steve Cooper can concentrate on keeping the club where their fans believe they belong","byline":"Will Unwin","body":"<p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted position</strong> 15th (NB: this is not necessarily Will Unwin’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)</p> \n<p><strong>Last season’s position </strong>4th (Championship)</p> \n<p><strong>Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) </strong>1,000-1</p> \n<h2>Prospects</h2> \n<p>The owners have big ambitions, especially after shelling out heftily on players over the summer, but the reality is that the Premier League is a huge jump for any club, regardless of investment levels. Evangelos Marinakis spoke of going for trophies after securing promotion but the club will, ultimately, be happy if they finish 17th.</p> \n<p>They certainly have the players to go a few places higher but it could take a little while for the team to gel into a unit considering the overturn in playing staff.

Few could have anticipated going from one point in seven matches to beating Huddersfield in the playoff final but that was the effect the former Swansea head coach had on the team. Within the club, the main thing Cooper brought to the squad was “belief”, as Joe Worrall confirmed at Wembley. The team became more aggressive under his stewardship and was finally a cohesive unit. He turned Brennan Johnson from a forward on the periphery of the team to their most-lauded asset in the space of a couple of months. He knows what he is doing with young players thanks to a background working in academies and with England youth teams. He will relish his first season as a Premier League manager.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0646f9202ecbc53fc28cb0c020a4b8b389071db1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0646f9202ecbc53fc28cb0c020a4b8b389071db1/0_98_5237_3142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Henderson (left) has joined for the season on loan from Manchester United and will contest the No 1 shirt with Wayne Hennessey (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Henderson (left) has joined for the season on loan from Manchester United and will contest the No 1 shirt with Wayne Hennessey (right).</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>It has been another smart summer in the transfer market for Forest. The Bundesliga has been a key target for the club where they know they can get value for money. They broke their transfer record to make Taiwo Awoniyi their first arrival of the summer for £17.5m from Union Berlin. The Nigeria international began his career with Liverpool but spent his time there out on loan before moving to Union last summer. He scored 15 goals to help his team to fifth in the table and European football but decided to give it up for a shot at the Premier League. He met Cooper and, despite interest from elsewhere, decided the project at the City Ground was the one for him.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>It should be a month off for most of the players. Dean Henderson will be hoping first-team football will get him into the England squad, while Neco Williams and Brennan Johnson are certainties to be part of the Wales setup, barring injuries. The other player likely to be in Qatar is Canada’s Richie Laryea but he is earmarked to spend the season out on loan.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:49:58/embed.html\" data-alt=\"g\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:49:58/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p>There is no shortage of attractions in Nottingham.

Left impotent by a childhood trauma, Ajo (Marthino Lio) can’t get it up, but he can certainly raise his fists, earning a reputation as a daredevil who chases death just to prove his virility.</p> <p>Paved with hair-raising motorcycle duels and even murder plots, Ajo’s path towards self-destruction is cut short by his encounter with Iteung (Ladya Cheryl), a girl hired as the bodyguard for one of the young man’s intimidation targets.

Street food, hog roasts and “bowl foods” were all gaining traction even before the pandemic, which further fuelled the need for alfresco alternatives.</p> <p>It is little surprise, then, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/carrie-symonds\">Carrie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> reportedly opted for a braai – South Africa’s answer to the barbecue – at their belated wedding celebrations last weekend. The event was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/07/30/boris-carrie-johnson-celebrate-wedding-festival-style-party/\">said to be catered by Corby-based business Smoke &amp; Braai</a>, run by Zimbabwean chef Simon Chiremba, with beef braai boerewors rolls (sausages), masa corn tortilla tacos and smoked barbacoa lamb on the menu. It’s a far cry from the bangers and burgers of a traditional British barbecue – but if you’re thinking of branching out and hosting your own braai, then where is best to start?</p> <p>One you have the braai itself – which is, in essence, the same as a regular barbecue – it’s important to “be as prepared as you can”, according to Patrick Williams, the South African chef behind <a href=\"https://www.kuducollective.com/kudu-grill/\">Kudu Grill</a>, which centres on a custom-built braai, in south London. He too planned to have a braai at his wedding celebrations in 2020, but was scuppered by lockdowns. “It’s a long process, you tend to only start the fire once the guests arrive. You can’t just bang out burger patties or use gas like you might on a barbecue – it’s not the same flavour. A braai is more of a social occasion: friends, family and neighbours might come over. It’s all about the meat, the fire and the vibe,” Williams says.</p> <p>While Williams uses wood and charcoal to give his food “nice, smokey flavours”, fellow South African Dan van Straaten, owner of the Coventry-based <a href=\"https://letsbraai.co.uk/\">Let’s Braai</a>, which specialises in selling stainless steel braais, always opts for wood. “We cook over the embers, rather than the flame, which is why we use African hard wood – you can’t do that with British wood,” he says. “It’s extremely dense and heavy, the moisture level is pretty much zero and it smells unbelievably nice.” Let’s Braai sells rooikrans, sekelbos and kameeldoring woods which are “derived from sustainable resources”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b467b01b5f28c63043810b801c5d3943aa0186bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b467b01b5f28c63043810b801c5d3943aa0186bc/0_7_5200_3121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘A braai is a social occasion: friends, family and neighbours might come over.

Sweetcorn is a popular go-to, but Williams likes to braai hispi cabbage. “I cut it in half, and cook it on the low embers until it is nice and caramelised, then turn it over and put the meat on the top, so that all the juices seep into it,” he says.</p> <p>It was not mentioned on the Johnson menu, but Williams and Van Straaten rave about braaibroodjies, likening them to grilled toasties: cheese, chutney, tomato and onion is the most common filling. “You snack on them with a beer in your hand while you’re waiting for the meat to cook,” says Williams. “They’re also a great brunch option.”</p> <p>Van Straaten also advocates using a braai to cook potjiekos – a traditional South African stew – in a cast iron pot. “Something like oxtail potjiekos can be left cooking all day. Not everywhere in South Africa has access to gas for cooking, so a braai is a solution for preparing food,” he says. “You can basically cook anything on a braai.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/03/how-to-make-caponata-recipe-felicity-cloake-masterclass","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T11:00:25Z","webTitle":"How to make caponata – recipe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/03/how-to-make-caponata-recipe-felicity-cloake-masterclass","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/03/how-to-make-caponata-recipe-felicity-cloake-masterclass","fields":{"headline":"How to make caponata – recipe","trailText":"Sicily’s famous sweet and sour stew offers plenty of scope to adapt to your own taste … while paying heed to the basics","byline":"Felicity Cloake","body":"<p>As Matthew Fort explains in his bookabout Sicily, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/apr/27/travelfoodanddrink.sicily\">Sweet Honey, Bitter Lemons</a>: “Sicilian cooking embraces contrast, discord … the dishes are as bold and baroque as any flamboyant building” – and this sweet and sour aubergine stew is a textbook example.

Aubergine is always the mainstay of a caponata, but you can replace the courgette with more aubergine, peppers or fennel if that takes your fancy – fry the latter two with the onion and celery until soft rather than salting with the aubergine.</p> <h2><strong>2 Tasting note</strong></h2> <p>If you happen to have a glut of ripe tomatoes, you can replace the passata with those whizzed into a puree – but as we’re in Britain, I’ve played it safe, and added some extra sugar to boost the sweetness.

Hard to be hopeful. Hard to persist in the face of cacophonous, institutionalised untruth. Hard to explain this profound failure to people who deserved better. Hard to believe in progress. But Wednesday was a good day because enough democratic representatives resolved that moving forward is always better than standing still.</p> \n<p>The Albanese government has been flat out for weeks pretending this first climate bill – the legislation enshrining emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 – didn’t actually matter, because the new government would get about making the transition anyway.</p> \n<p>This latter point might be technically true. Labor has continued to show up for climate action, even when these folks have lost elections as a consequence of this persistence, so it’s reasonable to assume Anthony Albanese and Chris Bowen would have kept plugging away.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e15747e9-4183-4478-b969-84d0d8c29a19\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UWBxi1UuHNc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Global capital has also finally deemed the transition inexorable, so perhaps an updated nationally determined contribution lodged with the United Nations could have substituted for clear legislation enshrining targets passed in the Australian parliament. But I doubt it, frankly.</p> \n<p>This legislation absolutely matters, and Albanese finally conceded that reality during chamber debate on Wednesday. Shortly after the prime minister was certain he had the numbers to pass the legislation, weeks of bluster and bravado was replaced by a gust of candour. Albanese told parliament “this is as important a piece of legislation that will come before this parliament”.</p> \n<p>“We have a great responsibility to this beautiful island continent that we live in, to make sure that we act on climate change,” the prime minister said. “This government will. We can tell our children that we stepped up, we took responsibility and we met the moment”.</p> \n<p>Meeting the moment is terrific, but it does require unvarnished truth.</p> \n<p>Climate science tells us Labor’s 43% cut in emissions by 2030 isn’t ambitious enough. It is also an incontrovertible fact that Australia is continuing to contribute to global heating by exporting polluting fossil fuels.</p> \n<p>But we can acknowledge these facts and still be entirely clear that passing this legislation matters.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It matters because the last decade tells us any concrete action to address the climate crisis is not only very hard to achieve in Australia, but also extremely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/23/the-best-way-to-dutton-proof-climate-legislation-is-to-get-it-into-parliament-and-get-it-passed\">difficult, if not impossible, to future proof</a>.</p> \n<p>Given that history, a history that can’t be wished away, Adam Bandt as Greens leader was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/greens-give-crucial-support-to-labors-climate-bill-for-43-emissions-reduction-by-2030\">intelligent enough to grab the opportunity of forward motion</a>. Bandt accepted that responsibility.

But it sets the rules of the road, and establishing rules and norms is the only path to ending the unconscionable decade of lies, inertia, regression and confusion.</p> \n<p>The legislation matters because it accelerates the trajectory of domestic emissions reduction, and it creates an accountability framework attempting to safeguard an existential objective. These are foundational steps. This isn’t symbolism.</p> \n<p>Wednesday also matters because of what this step forward represents as a moment in time. It demonstrates that Australian politics isn’t broken.

Partly inspired by the US civil rights movement, and the successful bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, in which Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, the group marshalled the city’s 3,000-strong Caribbean community into action.</p> \n<p>The boycott, which campaigners announced at a press conference on 29 April 1963, is thought to be the first of its kind in Britain.</p> \n<p>Hackett went on to co-found the Commonwealth Coordinated Committee, which set up Bristol’s St Pauls Carnival in 1968. The group’s campaigns applied pressure on the local council to act on housing and employment. The committee still runs today as the Bristol West Indian Parents and Friends Association.</p> \n<p>In 1959, Hackett married his childhood sweetheart Ena, who arrived in Bristol in 1958. He leaves behind three children.</p> \n<p>George Ferguson, a former mayor of Bristol, also sent his condolences, saying: “Bristol honours brave 1960s civil rights campaigner who influenced UK racial discrimination legislation.”</p> \n<p>The deputy mayor of Bristol, Asher Craig, said: “The transition of Mr Hackett has hit many of us really hard. A humble, principled, freedom fighter – Bristol bus boycott, St Pauls Carnival, Bristol West Indian Parents &amp; Friends Association, Bristol Race Equality Council – his legacy will live on.”</p> \n<p>Kehinde Andrews, a professor of Black studies at Birmingham City University and author who interviewed Hackett in 2020, said: “Hackett’s life is a testament to the strong history of Black activism in Britain and how we much do much better at remembering it. He was a powerful, thoughtful and funny man. His force of will came through even when I spoke to him in his 90s. We have lost a legend.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Organisations also paid tribute, with the race equality thinktank Runnymede Trust tweeting it was “deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Roy Hackett, a UK civil rights icon”, while the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said: “Very sad news.

In that time, one point I’ve always stuck to is simple: don’t listen to me for investment advice. Today, I want to quantify why.</p> <p>Bitcoin was created in 2009, while I was in my first year at university. As an economics student – and massive nerd – it sat squarely at the intersection of my interests. By my final year of uni in 2011, the original cryptocurrency was experiencing its first boom and bust cycle. It rose from a low of $0.30 to a high of $32.34 that summer, before crashing back down to less than $3 when Mt. Gox, the original bitcoin exchange, was hacked. (This will become a theme.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for our weekly technology newsletter, TechScape.\">  <iframe id=\"tech-scape\" name=\"tech-scape\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/tech-scape\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--tech-scape\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for our weekly technology newsletter, TechScape.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>That was also the year the Guardian first covered the currency, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/12/bitcoin-online-currency-us-government\">Ruth Whippman warning</a>: “Its critics in the political sphere fear that it could give rise to an online Wild West of gambling, prostitution and global bazaars for contraband.”</p> <p>I was very much on the outside looking in, though. Not being a regular drug user (cf “massive nerd”), the mainstream use of bitcoin – getting pills or weed delivered by post from the Silk Road – passed me by, so I found it more of an intellectual curiosity than anything else.</p> <p>This is perhaps in part because the first thing I remember hearing about bitcoin was a tale, probably apocryphal, of someone using their gaming PC to mine the currency in their dorm room in a heatwave. The air conditioning failed, the user reported in a forum post, and heatstroke left them with mild brain damage. You can see why I was unimpressed.</p> <p>By the second major boom, I was covering economics for the New Statesman. And that’s where the trouble starts.</p> <p>In my first published piece using the word “bitcoin” – the first time the New Statesman had covered the topic – <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/business/economics/2013/03/bitcoin-what-bubble-looks\">I confidently declared</a>: “This is what a bubble looks like.” At the time, bitcoin was trading at around $40 a coin.</p> <p>It has never gotten that low again.</p> <p>I was right that there was a bubble in the offing: the price of bitcoin had doubled in two months, and would double twice more before it popped less than a month later. But the crash, which would have been huge for any other normal asset, was a reduction of around half, taking bitcoin to the lows of … three weeks prior.</p> <p>A decade on, the memory of this bold claim still haunts me, and I refuse to make predictions about the future of any cryptocurrency. In fact, I’ve taken to joking that the best way to make money, historically, is to do the opposite of what I say.</p> <p>So I put it to the test.</p> <p><strong>The Alex Hern bitcoin investment strategy</strong></p> <p>Obviously, I don’t give actual investment advice. So I reviewed every article I’ve ever written that mentions “bitcoin”, and sorted them based on whether or not a reader would think they were good news for the crypto, or bad news. There’s an element of value judgment to this, of course: you might disagree with my decision that a story about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/20/winklevoss-twins-facebook-launch-winkdex-bitcoin-price-tracker\">Winklevii launching a bitcoin price tracker</a> in 2014 is broadly positive; or that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/18/mtgox-bitcoin-exchange-reopens-so-users-can-stare-listlessly-at-their-loss\">a story about Mt. Gox reopening after a hack (another hack)</a> is broadly negative. My hope is that the disagreements average out.</p> <p>Then, I paired the stories against the price of bitcoin on the day they were written, and asked a simple question: if you’d bought $10 of bitcoin every time I wrote something that seemed like bad news, and sold $10 of bitcoin every time I wrote something that seemed like good news, how would your investment have performed?</p> <p>The bottom line: you would have spent a net of $420 on bitcoin, and have a crypto wallet containing around 1.1 bitcoin as a result – worth, at today’s market value, a little over $22,000.</p> <p>Oof.</p> <p>Going over the specifics, though, gives me a bit of cheer. Well over half that gain comes from a total of just seven pieces written in 2013: six negative and one positive. At the end of that run, you’d have spent $50, and own 0.7 bitcoin. Those articles have an outsized influence on the over-calculation, due to how much bitcoin’s value has increased in the nine years since they were published.</p> <p>Bitcoin had two boom and bust cycles in 2013. The first, in April, took it to a high of $266. The second, in December was bigger – much bigger. The price of a coin spiked at $1,238, and fell to a low of $687. The rush of pieces I wrote about the currency when I started at the Guardian, through late 2013 and the first half of 2014, contribute much less to the bottom line, even though there were more of them.</p> <p>It was also the period with the most positive stories for bitcoin. In 2014, the potential of the currency was still untapped: the idea that bitcoin or the blockchain might prove revolutionary wasn’t a hackneyed promise, but something that might be just around the corner. In that boom, I wrote as many positive stories as negative.</p> <p>For every article about bitcoin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/06/bitcoin-price-hits-all-time-high-of-269\">hitting an “all-time high” of $269</a>, there was another about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/08/hackers-steal-1m-from-bitcoin-tradefortress-site\">a £1m hack of a payment processor</a>. For every long feature asking if bitcoin was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/25/is-bitcoin-about-to-change-the-world-peer-to-peer-cryptocurrency-virtual-wallet\">about to change the world</a>, there was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/04/bitcoin-bubble-tulip-dutch-banker\">warning from a Dutch central banker</a> that the hype was “worse than tulip mania” (and he should know).</p> <p>The timing of the pieces didn’t quite balance out, though, and by the end of that boom you would have turned your 0.7 bitcoin into 0.9 while cashing out as many dollars as you put in. And in that period, those bitcoin would have gone from $100 to more than $500.</p> <p>From 2014 to the most recent boom, however, the money you put in would start being drowned out by the bitcoin you already own. $10 at the beginning of 2014 bought you around 0.01 bitcoin, and so 10 negative pieces from me would have sizeably increased your position.</p> <p>Three years later, it would take 30 negative pieces for you to acquire the same amount of bitcoin. That meant the impact of the ICO boom – the first of the great expansions of the sector from a handful of cryptocurrencies to a whole ecosystem of shitcoins – was muted compared to what came before, despite stories about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/13/how-iceland-became-the-bitcoin-miners-paradise\">Iceland becoming a miner’s paradise</a> and Kodak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/11/kodak-companies-bitcoin-buzz-cryptocurrencies-share-price\">bringing out a branded cryptominer</a>, leading to a flurry of buying and selling.</p> <p>And three years after that, at the beginning of 2020, a $10 investment in the cryptocurrency would get you just 0.001 BTC. That’s good news for our theoretical investor, because 2020 marked my most positive reporting on the currency. Stories such as the US government seizing bitcoins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/06/us-seizes-1bn-in-bitcoin-linked-to-silk-road-site\">used in the Silk Road</a> were a sign of the growing professionalism of the sector and, for the first time, bitcoin was enough of a fixture of the tech scene that even in a comparative slump the Guardian was still covering it.</p> <p>On to the latest boom and bust cycle, where – finally – the investor starts to lose out and I claw back some of my reputation. From its peak at $69,000 earlier this year, bitcoin has fallen by a third. I’ve diligently covered the collapse, which has been by far the most brutal the sector has faced. That means the tracker has sunk almost $200 into bitcoin, and even as the overall value of the holdings has plummeted from a high of $50,000 in March to its present number.</p> <p><strong>Wh</strong><strong>at next?</strong></p> <p>The question going forward, of course, is whether the pattern holds up. Will you continue to make money if you buy when I’m grumpy about crypto, and sell when I’m optimistic? Obviously – see above – I’m not about to make any strong predictions, but I doubt we’ll ever again see as sharp an increase in price as we saw in the last decade, which means I’ll never make a call that plays out as badly as the ones in those initial pieces from 2013.</p> <p>Which is not to say I can’t make other terrible calls. Remember Dejitaru Tsuka, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/01/cryptocurrency-tsuka-alex-hern\">the shitcoin that was sold with my name</a>? I broke my rules, and warned readers: “I do not think you should buy this shitcoin, nor any others.” Well, if you’d bought £10 worth of Tsuka when I said that, you’d now have … £4,000.</p> <p><em>If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2021/jun/25/techscape-sign-up\">please subscribe</a> to receive TechScape in your inbox every Wednesday.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/03/nature-friendly-farming-does-not-reduce-productivity-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T10:44:54Z","webTitle":"Nature-friendly farming does not reduce productivity, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/03/nature-friendly-farming-does-not-reduce-productivity-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/03/nature-friendly-farming-does-not-reduce-productivity-study-finds","fields":{"headline":"Nature-friendly farming does not reduce productivity, study finds","trailText":"Results of 10-year project reveal that rewilding areas can boost biodiversity and crop yields","byline":"Helena Horton Environment reporter","body":"<p>Putting farmland aside for nature does not have a negative effect on food security, a study has found.</p> <p>A 10-year project by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology revealed that nature-friendly farming methods boost biodiversity without reducing average yields.</p> <p>Scientists spent a decade intensively monitoring the impacts of a large government-funded experiment at Hillesden, a 1,000-hectare commercial arable farm in Buckinghamshire. Beginning in 2005, this involved creating several wildlife habitats, including seed-bearing plants for birds, wildflowers for pollinators and tussocky grass margins to support a range of birds, insects and small mammals.</p> <p>In the longest-running study of its kind, researchers succeeded in boosting numbers of wildlife essential for agricultural production such as pollinators and predators of crop pests. Numbers of some butterfly species including the gatekeeper and green-veined white doubled, and birds that usually feed on insects benefited from the shelter provided by hedges and grass margins, including the great tit, up 88%, and blue tit, up 73%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/22/ben-goldsmith-next-pm-back-plan-farm-subsidies-protect-nature\">Ben Goldsmith: next PM must back plan for farm subsidies to protect nature</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They also found that overall yields at Hillesden were maintained – and enhanced for some crops – despite the loss of agricultural land for habitat creation. The areas taken out of production were difficult and unproductive to farm, and the other areas benefited from boosted pollinator numbers and pest-eating birds and insects.</p> <p>This runs contrary to claims made by many politicians that new post-Brexit agri-environment schemes would be “paying farmers to produce less food” and would damage food security. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor currently running to be prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.fwi.co.uk/news/farm-policy/truss-and-sunak-set-out-their-plans-for-farming\">recently said</a> he would “protect” farmers from rewilding their land for nature.</p> <p>Jake Fiennes, the head of conservation at the Holkham estate in Norfolk and author of nature-friendly farming book <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/442697/land-healer-by-fiennes-jake/9781785947308\">Land Healer</a>, said he was unsurprised by the results of the report.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: “Historic policies in England tried to get us to produce food everywhere. But now we are realising that we can increase our average yield by stopping growing food in areas of land that aren’t productive, and in these areas we can make space for nature.

If on the southern edge of that field you have a woodland, invariably the first 15 to 20 metres of that edge won’t produce the average yield, it’ll produce anything up to 50% of average. But when you have all the species that would benefit from that edge of woodland, it’s a no-brainer to give it to nature. This is the poorest land for food production, and when you are not focusing on that area you increase your average yield in the rest of the field.</p> <p>“We know we have a biodiversity crisis, we know we have a climate crisis, we know the two are linked, and this is an opportunity to increase our yields as well as providing for nature.”</p> <p>Dr John Redhead of the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology and lead author of <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.14246\">the research published in the Journal of Applied Ecology</a>, said: “Investigating changes in populations over a significant period of time, and comparing these with other sites, means we can be confident that agri-environment options can bring long-term term benefits for bird and butterfly populations.</p> <p>“Hillesden is a typical, large arable farm with conventional agricultural practices, in an ordinary landscape with no large patches of natural habitat.

Ruthlessly cutting your losses is how executives demonstrate their virility. It’s what Rupert Murdoch did by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/07/news-of-the-world-rupert-murdoch\">closing the News of the World</a> and it’s what Wayne Enterprises did in the DC Comics world by discarding the old merchant branches of its business in the 19th century.</p> <p>But does that – should that – apply to movies?</p> <p>Clearly, David Zaslav thinks so: the new CEO of the merged Warner Bros Discovery conglomerate has spectacularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/03/irredeemable-batgirl-movie-unexpectedly-cancelled-despite-being-in-final-stages\">pulled the plug on the $90m new Batgirl film</a> during post-production. Even though “shelving” movie projects is common enough at early stages, actually throwing a finished film into the vault is rare. Zeslav had publicly made it his business to reverse Warner Bros’ existing strategy of prioritising streaming services, focusing instead on premiering prestige movies in movie theatres – only to find that Batgirl was not big enough to justify the additional promotional cost for a cinema rollout, yet somehow too big to dump on to the small screen. It’s a new iteration of the classic “mid-budget” nightmare that has been a perennial Hollywood problem. What to do with the mid-range movie that was once a solid bread-and-butter performer in 1970s and 80s cinemas, and still cleans up at awards season, but now falls between the two stools of blockbuster and indie?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"03ff7fa3c7f12c6f26cd67ea0b91aa55143181a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03ff7fa3c7f12c6f26cd67ea0b91aa55143181a6/0_229_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sienna Miller in 2020.

Do we hear the ghostly sound of laughter from those legendary producers Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom …?</p> <p>This is what happens when studios treat movies as pure, undifferentiated corporate “content”, a Gazprom pipeline of superhero mush which can be turned off when the accountants say that it makes sense to do so. Yet it can happen to even the most well-regarded and prestigious-seeming indie films. The industry still whispers about the disappearance of Hippie Hippie Shake, the indie British movie about the 60s counterculture and the Oz trial with Sienna Miller as Louise Ferrier, Richard Neville’s girlfriend – a film that became mired in legal and contractual disputes and has still not been seen aside from test screenings.</p> <p>Batgirl may well finally emerge on precisely those screening services that Warner Bros Discovery had disavowed: like the much-discussed “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/15/zack-snyder-cut-justice-league-review\">Snyder Cut</a>” of DC’s Justice League, it will probably emerge, after the lawsuits have been settled, to great fan excitement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/jun/02/not-coming-soon-david-o-russell-accidental-love\">Not coming soon: the films still stuck in purgatory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cynics may smile at this latest demonstration of corporate philistinism and heartlessness with regard to the work of directors, writers, actors, cinematographers and other artists.

We must accelerate a fair energy transition","byline":"Tzeporah Berman","body":"<p>This week, major oil and gas companies reported 11-figure profits in the second quarter. At the same time, inflation has reached 40-year highs around the world and recessions loom. The obscene profits of the fossil fuel industry are jarring when set against the many households currently struggling to afford basic heating, cooling and food needs.</p> <p>Today, high energy prices are one of the leading factors driving inflation, and those prices are getting embedded into every facet of daily life, most obviously at the gas pump but also in delivery costs that affect everything from produce to paper towels.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ExxonMobil quadrupled last year’s figures with $17.85bn. Shell beat its previous quarterly high with $11.5bn. Chevron rolled in with $11.62bn in reported profit. This comes in the wake of new analysis last week that calculated $2.8bn a day in pure profit for the oil and gas industry for the last 50 years.</p> <p>These companies have tried to temper criticisms that these profits are at the expense of consumers. In a statement, Chevron’s chief executive, Mike Wirth, said: “We more than doubled investment compared to last year to grow both traditional and new energy business lines … Chevron is increasing energy supplies to help meet the challenges facing global markets.”</p> <p>Wherever that doubling in investment is going, it is not being put toward renewable energy that would alleviate the global disruption the world sees today from high energy prices and decarbonize the energy grids, which are critical for meeting climate goals. In 2018, fossil fuel companies spent <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-renewables/big-oil-spent-1-percent-on-green-energy-in-2018-idUSKCN1NH004\">only 1%</a> of their budgets on green energy.</p> <p>We need a rapid deployment of renewables. Solar and wind power technologies are already market-ready and cost-competitive. Even when taking into account environmental safeguards, land constraints and technical feasibility, solar and wind energy alone could power the world more than 50 times over, meeting the energy demands of every person in every region of the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fossil fuel companies spend nearly $200m a year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Energy prices alone won’t be enough to drive the kind of decarbonization needed to meet climate goals. For decades climate policy has been designed based on a theory that we can reduce demand for fossil fuels and increase the price of carbon and that the market – turbocharged by alternatives such as wind and solar that are now cheaper than fossil fuels – will respond by constraining supply. But that’s not happening fast enough because there is currently no mechanism to counteract the tax breaks, fossil fuel subsidies and delay tactics that are distorting the markets.</p> <p>These record profits are salt in the wound when we’ve seen that fossil fuel companies have successfully lobbied G20 governments for $151bn within Covid-19 recovery packages on top of their profit. They also spend nearly $200m a year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change. In Canada alone, the oil and gas industry is currently lobbying for $50m in government largesse for carbon capture on its own projects, a false solution in the urgent need for climate action.</p> <p>We can’t rely on the fossil fuel industry to break business as usual, especially one that delivers unthinkable profits for the industry while the rest of us reel from the ripple effects of high fuel prices. That’s why there is an urgent need for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty to end the expansion of oil, gas and coal, phase out existing production to limit warming to manageable levels and accelerate a fair energy transition where wealthy, fossil fuel-producing nations lead and support other countries so there is affordable, clean energy from sun, wind and water for everyone.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tzeporah Berman is the international program director at Stand.earth and the chair of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/03/3d-mermaids-cobragator-and-louis-ck-the-never-released-films-batgirl-will-join-in-hollywoods-vault-of-shame","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T10:19:47Z","webTitle":"3D mermaids, CobraGator and Louis CK: the never-released films Batgirl will join in Hollywood’s vault of shame","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/03/3d-mermaids-cobragator-and-louis-ck-the-never-released-films-batgirl-will-join-in-hollywoods-vault-of-shame","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/03/3d-mermaids-cobragator-and-louis-ck-the-never-released-films-batgirl-will-join-in-hollywoods-vault-of-shame","fields":{"headline":"3D mermaids, CobraGator and Louis CK: the never-released films Batgirl will join in Hollywood’s vault of shame","trailText":"Warner Bros is not the first studio to bury a film six feet deep. Here are a few more of the worst movies you’ll never see","byline":"Stuart Heritage","body":"<p>Until this week, it was hard to look upon the imminent Batgirl movie with anything but a wearied sigh. By all accounts the movie, starring Leslie Grace and directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, looked like another flailing Warner Bros attempt to expand the DCEU in every possible direction without any sort of overarching plan. It was destined to be quickly forgotten, in other words.</p> \n<p>But not this quickly. Because this week Warner Bros Discovery revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/03/irredeemable-batgirl-movie-unexpectedly-cancelled-despite-being-in-final-stages\">nobody was ever going to see Batgirl</a>. Not in cinemas, not on streaming, not anywhere. And this isn’t because it was scrapped during development, either. The thing is finished. It was shot in Glasgow over four months at the start of the year. It had a budget of $90m. But apparently, according to insiders, the whole thing is so terrible that the studio would rather lock it away than let anyone see it. And this is a studio that just released DC League of Superpets, so it has to really stink.</p> \n<p>This might not be the end of Batgirl, of course. If the last few years have been any indication, then it’ll only take a handful of frothing fanboys and their supporting army of bots to pressure Warner Bros into releasing the Batgirl cut. But if this really is it – if Batgirl really is destined to be locked in a vault unseen until the end of time – then at least it finds itself in decent company. Here are some other notorious movies that have never been allowed to see the light of day.</p> \n<h2>The Day the Clown Cried</h2> \n<p>Arguably the most notorious example of film left unseen, The Day the Clown Cried was Jerry Lewis’s attempt to fuse a clown movie with a Holocaust movie. Almost unrelentingly bleak – the film ends with Lewis’s clown leading a young Jewish girl by the hand into a gas chamber – the film clattered into a number of problems during production. First it ran out of money and then, after Lewis had spent $2m of his own money to complete it, one of the scriptwriters declared that it was a “disaster”, and blocked Lewis from releasing it. Lewis himself eventually came around to this view, telling Entertainment Weekly in 2013: “No one will ever see it, because I am embarrassed at the poor work.”. Jerry Lewis died in 2017, and the film remains unreleased.</p> \n<h2>I Love You, Daddy</h2> \n<p>This arrived out of the blue in 2017, when it was revealed that comedian Louis CK had written, directed and financed the entire thing in secret following the collapse of the previously announced project I’m a Cop. The film premiered at the Toronto international film festival in September, and a release was set for that November. However, the release was pulled with a week’s notice when the New York Times published a damaging report about CK’s sexual misconduct with women. Exacerbating the problem was the film’s plot, about an ageing director who seduces a 17-year-old girl. The film still has not been officially released, but it isn’t hard to find a copy online. By all accounts, it isn’t very good.</p> \n<h2>CobraGator</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSrf5bfUF4E\"> \n <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OSrf5bfUF4E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Now this one really is intriguing. CobraGator is a Syfy movie, directed by Jim Wynorski for Roger Corman, about an insane scientist who fuses the DNA of a king cobra and an alligator, and watches in dismay as the resulting creature goes on a murderous rampage. The film was shot in two weeks in 2014, and starred Michael Madsen. A trailer was released, and yet the film itself never made it to television. We can only speculate as to why this was, although perhaps it failed to live up to the high quality of other Syfy work such as 5-Headed Shark Attack or Mansquito. Still, if nothing else, CobraGator left us with <a href=\"https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/11/sales-art-roger-cormans-cobragator-starring-michael-madsen/\">an incredible poster</a>.</p> \n<h2>Empires of the Deep</h2> \n<p>A $130m underwater 3D fantasy starring Olga Kurylenko as the queen of the mermaids sounds like the best film of 2011. And that’s when Empires of the Deep was set to be released. The brainchild of billionaire businessman Jon Jiang, the production hired James Cameron collaborator Randall Frakes to develop the story, and 10 other screenwriters to write it. However, as a Chinese-American co-production, the film quickly ran into a number of cultural and communication problems. The crew complained about late payments. An actor complained about unsafe working conditions and walked off set; producers retaliated by withholding her passport. By all reports a terrible film, Empires of the Deep failed to find distribution in 2014, and a 2016 crowdfunding campaign failed to help get it on to screens.</p> \n<h2>Blackbird</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a093b37e-2c48-49dd-be0c-3385b38c15a6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lwVyYyltdDc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And now a happy ending. In 2018 it was announced that Michael Flatley – yes, that Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance Michael Flatley – had written, directed, financed and starred in a globetrotting spy thriller called Blackbird. Not much was known about the film, other than that most of it seemed to feature Flatley wearing a fedora and gazing into the middle distance. It was first screened at London’s Raindance film festival in September 2018, but resulted in zero reviews or Twitter reactions, and – despite Flatley’s insistence that Blackbird 2 was in pre-production – promptly disappeared from view. But miracles do happen. Last month Flatley announced that Blackbird would be released into Irish cinemas in September. Enterprisingly, a group of fans have also <a href=\"https://bristolbadfilmclub.co.uk/category/upcoming-screenings/\">secured a screening on 2 September</a>, on an Imax screen no less.

But will Sinema go along?</p> <p>It’s been joked that the word “politics” is derived from the Latin “poli”, meaning “many”, and “ticks”, meaning small blood-sucking insects. I don’t hold such a cynical view. But I do know from 50 years’ experience in and around Washington that most of the people who serve in our nation’s capital have very, very large – shall we say? – egos.</p> <p>On Sunday, Manchin made the rounds of all five Sunday morning talkshows. He thereby achieved what’s known as a “full Ginsburg”, after William Ginsburg, the lawyer for Monica Lewinsky, who was the first to appear on all Sunday talkshows, on 1 February 1998.</p> <p>Manchin treated it as a victory lap. He took credit for his newly named “Inflation Reduction Act”. (He refused to allow it to be named “Build Back Better” because he’s still smarting over what he viewed as the Biden administration’s criticism of him for blocking the original BBB.)</p> <p>When Manchin was asked by the Meet the Press host, Chuck Todd, whether he wanted Democrats to keep control of the House and Senate after the midterms, Manchin declined to answer. (Does he want to hold out the possibility of becoming a Republican kingmaker if the Dems lose?)</p> <p>Tellingly, Manchin wouldn’t even use the pronoun “we” when talking about the Democrats.</p> <p>I’ve always made it a point to listen to the pronouns politicians use. The use of pronouns tells you a lot about a politician’s loyalties. Manchin almost never uses “we” when he refers to Democrats. Sometimes, it’s “they”. When Trump was president, he used “we” to refer to the people who voted for him, and “they” for everyone else.</p> <p>Which brings me to Kyrsten Sinema – who uses the pronoun “I” perhaps more frequently than any other contemporary politician. (“I’m always surprised when people say, ‘Oh, she’s an enigma,’” said Sinema in an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/11/19/sinema-inflation-spending-interview/\">interview</a> with the Washington Post<em>.</em> “I’m, like, not at all, actually. I’m very straightforward about what I believe in and why I’m doing what I do.”)</p> <p>Yet Sinema appears to be absent when it comes to moral principle. Although not up for re-election until 2024, she is one of the Senate’s major recipients of Wall Street cash. The finance industry has donated <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/kyrsten-sinema/summary?cid=N00033983\">$2.2m</a> to her since she took office in 2017.</p> <p>Sinema has obliged by, among other things, refusing to close the so-called “carried interest” tax loophole that mostly benefits private-equity investors and hedge fund managers by treating their pay as capital gains (at a tax rate of 24%) rather than as ordinary income (37%) – even though their pay<em> is </em>ordinary income, since they risk none of their own capital.</p> <p>By contrast, Manchin wants to close the loophole – or nearly so. (Manchin’s bill would lengthen the amount of time private-equity and hedge-fund managers must hold their investments to qualify them for capital gains.)</p> <p>“The only thing I was adamant about was the carried interest,” Manchin told reporters last Thursday. Manchin’s aversion to the loophole isn’t new. Last year he joined two other Senate Democrats in <a href=\"https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/news/press-releases/carried-interest-fairness-act-2021\">sponsoring a bill</a> to close it.</p> <p>Closing the carried-interest loophole is the <em>only</em> tax increase on rich individuals in Manchin’s compromise bill. The rest of the tax hikes are on corporations.</p> <p>The carried-interest loophole is a blatant giveaway to the super-rich. It has no redeeming social value. Even <em>Trump </em>promised to eliminate it, as did Barack Obama and Joe Biden.</p> <p>Yet carried interest is still in the tax code. That’s because lobbyists for the private-equity and hedge fund industries care about little else and pour lots of money into the campaigns of both Democratic and Republican members of Congress to maintain it. (The Democratic House ways and means committee chair, Richard Neal, is a powerful supporter of the loophole. The private equity industry is one of Neal’s biggest <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/richard-e-neal/summary?cid=N00000153&amp;cycle=2020\">donors</a>.)</p> <p>Sinema’s office says she’s still reviewing Manchin’s bill. How long will Democrats have to wait until she breaks her silence on it?</p> <p>If there’s one thing Sinema loves more than Wall Street dollars, it’s national media attention.

Blackbirds, robins and song thrushes need regular summer rainfall, as this creates the damp conditions that bring earthworms and other soil-dwelling invertebrates to the surface of garden lawns.</p> <p>Droughts mean that the worms stay down in the damper earth, meaning that the birds cannot catch enough to feed themselves or their chicks. This can lead to desperate measures: during the very dry spring and summer of 2011, hungry blackbirds <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/8579702/Starving-blackbirds-turn-cannibal-due-to-dry-weather.html\">even resorted to cannibalism</a>, feeding on their own offspring.

And while hot and sunny days may be better than wet and rainy ones for adult butterflies, as they fly from plant to plant to lay their eggs, they are bad news for caterpillars, which need plenty of foliage on their host plants if they are to feed and grow. <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2016.0144\">A recent study showed</a> that in the years following prolonged summer droughts, when plants die off early because of the heat, butterfly populations tend to fall.</p> <p>Other insects find it hard to cope in hot weather, too, but for different reasons. Prof Dave Goulson of the University of Sussex <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/25/falling-birds-and-dehydrated-hedgehogs-heatwave-takes-its-toll-on-wildlife-aoe\">points out</a> that because bumblebees have furry coats – an adaptation to flying and feeding in cool conditions – they are unable to forage in very high temperatures.</p> <p>As temperatures hit record levels, young house martins, swallows and swifts risk fatally overheating. In London recently, young swifts that had been forced to leave their nests before they were fully fledged were seen falling out of the sky. House martins are also unable to find enough mud to build or repair their nests.</p> <p>Prolonged dry weather increases the chances of wildfires, which spread very rapidly, especially on heathland and moorland. As early as April this year, 17 hectares (42 acres) of valuable wildlife habitat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/wildfire-canford-heath-nature-reserve-dorset-fire\">was destroyed at Canford Heath in Dorset</a>, threatening the breeding success of rare species such as Dartford warblers, sand lizards and smooth snakes. And in July, <a href=\"https://community.rspb.org.uk/placestovisit/titchwellmarsh/b/titchwellmarsh-blog/posts/plovers-in-peril-an-update-following-the-devastating-coastal-park-fires\">a fire raged through the coastal scrub and reedbeds</a> at Wild Ken Hill in Norfolk, home to the BBC’s Springwatch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d76307cd3c0ef562c37f0296f312aafb457296c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d76307cd3c0ef562c37f0296f312aafb457296c2/0_59_2280_1368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Dartford warbler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Dartford warbler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: D Middleton/South Downs Centre/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere in East Anglia, wetlands such as the Ouse Washes are beginning to dry out. If enough rain does not fall soon, the BTO fears that the young of some wader species, including the avocet, may not be able to find food. Other waders that nest on peatlands may also struggle if the peat dries out, as this would mean that the larvae of craneflies – food for the dunlin and golden plover – are unable to survive.</p> <p>For all these species, a single bad summer, with resulting low breeding success, may not be a total disaster. But if summer droughts become the norm, because of the cumulative effects of the climate crisis, then breeding populations can decline very rapidly indeed.</p> <p>This is not the first time a summer drought has caused problems for wildlife. Anyone who lived through the summer of 1976 will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35603972\">recall the “plague of ladybirds”</a> that appeared from July onwards, forcing holidaymakers to flee from beaches covered with thousands of these black-and-red beetles. Ladybirds had initially benefited from the dry weather, which produced an early glut of their favourite food, aphids. But as the drought continued, and plants began to wither and die, the aphid population collapsed, and the ladybirds swarmed in search of alternative food sources.</p> <p>In the decades since, warming temperatures have allowed several exotic species of bird to expand their range northwards. The BTO suggests that the current drought in southern Europe may be hastening that process, allowing black-winged stilts and <a href=\"https://www.birdguides.com/news/bee-eaters-nest-in-norfolk-for-first-time/\">bee-eaters to breed more frequently in the UK</a>. While that may be good news for birders, this is also a clear sign that climate change is causing problems for these Mediterranean species, and a timely warning to us.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/03/china-us-taiwan-nancy-pelosi-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T10:11:26Z","webTitle":"China and the US are facing off – and in Taiwan we are caught between them | Brian Hioe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/03/china-us-taiwan-nancy-pelosi-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/03/china-us-taiwan-nancy-pelosi-visit","fields":{"headline":"China and the US are facing off – and in Taiwan we are caught between them","trailText":"Nancy Pelosi’s visit has put the world on edge.

As speaker of the US House of Representatives, she is in direct succession to the presidency after the vice-president. No comparable visit by a US official has taken place for 25 years. On the eve of the visit, there was talk of a possible fourth crisis in the Taiwan Strait; Xi Jinping warned the US that it was “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/xi-jinping-tells-joe-biden-not-to-play-with-fire-over-taiwan-in-two-hour-call\">play[ing] with fire</a>”. Some commentators have been hyperbolic enough to invoke the prospect of world war.</p> <p>But for people in Taiwan, for now at least, life carries on as usual. Such is the nature of living in a nation that has long been seen as a geopolitical pawn. What the Taiwanese actually want, or how we feel, is eclipsed by the “great power” showdown on our doorstep.</p> <p>China has announced it will be conducting live-fire exercises around Taiwan in the coming days in response to Pelosi’s visit.<strong> </strong>But there is also nothing new about Chinese military threats directed at Taiwan. Beijing considers the island to be sovereign Chinese territory, even though it is de facto independent; the US is Taiwan’s security guarantor in the event of a Chinese invasion. Taiwan believes China has had thousands of missiles pointed at us for decades. Meanwhile, in the past few weeks, the domestic news cycle in Taiwan has seemed more focused on celebrity gossip and <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202207050029\">plagiarism claims</a> involving a mayoral candidate than global affairs.</p> <p>Tensions certainly are on the rise. Last October, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58794094\">China sent a record number of warplanes</a> into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone. More recently, Chinese warships have been spotted off of outlying islands of Taiwan, such as Lanyu. But, still, these military threats often do not seem to register with the general public. Beijing has perhaps failed when it comes to establishing a narrative of escalating threats at Taiwan: for people here, the narrative is sometimes felt as one of endless repetition.</p> <p>China claims Taiwan to have been part of its integral territory since time immemorial. The history is more complex. It was only incorporated into China during the Qing dynasty in the 17th century – but the Qing empire only controlled part of the island and did not seem particularly interested in it, ceding Taiwan to Japan after the Sino-Japanese war in 1895. After the Chinese civil war, which led to the triumph of the communists, control of Taiwan fell to the losing side, the Kuomintang (KMT), who brought a new wave of migrants but also subjected Taiwan to the period of authoritarianism known as the <a href=\"https://www.nhrm.gov.tw/w/nhrmEN/White_Terror_Period\">White Terror</a>.</p> <p>Flash forward several decades and Taiwan is now a flourishing democracy. The Democratic Progressive party, which emerged from Taiwan’s democracy movement, holds power. It currently <a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/no-taiwans-president-isnt-pro-independence/\">advocates</a> for maintaining the status quo, (which means the ambiguous position where Taiwan is de facto but not de jure independent). The KMT continues to be a political party, having reinvented itself as a political advocate of unification, though it has suffered a beating in recent elections and is <a href=\"https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2022/06/07/2003779492\">trying to change its pro-China image.</a> Most Taiwanese people seem to support the status quo too, with only <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/taiwan-china-politics-identity-independence-unification-public-opinion-polling-1724546\">tiny minorities</a> wanting full independence or unification with China as soon as possible. The full picture is hard to ascertain since there are arguments that the Taiwanese would be more firmly pro-independence if there were no threats from China.</p> <p>When news of Pelosi’s expected visit broke, I happened to be in Hualien, on the rural eastern seaboard, where the mountainous terrain that characterises central Taiwan meets the beach. As host to a number of military bases, Hualien is also where Taiwanese fighter jets would probably be deployed from, to conduct interceptions of Chinese planes in the event of a conflict or air intrusions.</p> <p>I was there to observe the Qataban harvest festival of the indigenous Kebalan people. I had looked forward to learning more about how the Kebalan have kept their culture alive after centuries of colonialism from Han and other groups. Unverified disinformation circulated, meanwhile, on social media, such as the claim that all Taiwanese soldiers had their holidays called off and were being recalled to active duty. One of the community members I met was actually a soldier who had taken time off to participate in the festivities.</p> <p>Some of the people I spoke to reflected on the effects tourism has on their ability to preserve their culture – Chinese tour groups having been a common sight in Taiwan before the pandemic. The issue points to part of Taiwan’s conundrum, in that it is deeply economically interlinked with China.</p> <p>Immediately prior to the expected Pelosi visit, China announced import bans on <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/cross-strait/202208020014\">100 Taiwanese food products.</a> Previous bans by China were aimed at pressuring <a href=\"https://newbloommag.net/2021/09/27/custard-wax-apple-ban/\">farmers,</a> <a href=\"https://newbloommag.net/2022/06/16/grouper-dispute-tw-china/\">fishers</a> and other economically precarious groups into political compliance, for fear of being shut out of the Chinese market. China has also sought to use <a href=\"https://time.com/4574290/china-taiwan-tourism-tourists/\">tourism for similar reasons.</a></p> <p>Either way, I instead found myself on the fringes of the traditional ceremonies taking calls in the car park from international media. At one point, someone wandered over and asked what I was doing.

At the time, Zuckerberg said the role would put Clegg “at the level” of himself and Sheryl Sandberg, who has since announced she is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/01/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-chief-operating-officer-resigns\">stepping down</a> as the company’s chief operating officer.</p> <p>Before his promotion, Clegg played a prominent role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/25/facebook-revelations-from-misinformation-to-mental-health\">addressing revelations last year</a> from the whistleblower Frances Haugen, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/05/facebook-harms-children-damaging-democracy-claims-whistleblower\">accused Facebook’s owner</a> of putting “astronomical profits before people”, harming children and destabilising democracies.</p> <p>Clegg denied Haugen’s claim, based on internal documents, that Facebook promoted divisive content, saying advertisers would shun a company that promoted such material. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/03/democracy-at-risk-if-facebook-does-not-change-says-former-zuckerberg-adviser\">Speaking at a conference in November</a>, he added that Facebook’s content was largely “babies, barbecues and barmitzvahs”, although documents disclosed by Haugen showed that researchers warned of “piecemeal” attempts to stop the spreading of falsehoods about the 2020 US presidential election.</p> <p>Clegg has also taken on a prominent role in explaining Meta’s shift to focusing on the metaverse, the concept of virtual space where digital representations of people – avatars – interact at work and play, including announcing the establishment of a <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/building-the-metaverse-responsibly/\">$50m (£41m) investment programme</a> to ensure the metaverse is built “responsibly”.</p> <p>Meta faces a number of regulatory challenges in Europe, with government relations and policy firmly part of Clegg’s remit. The UK government is preparing to introduce a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/13/online-safety-bill-tories-free-speech-david-davis\">sweeping online safety bill</a> while the EU is adopting tough regulation in the shape of the digital services act and the digital markets act.</p> <p>Clegg’s decision comes as the head of Meta’s Instagram platform also prepares to move to London. Adam Mosseri is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/02/instagram-boss-moves-london-backlash-app-changes-adam-mosseri-tiktok-kim-kardashian\">temporarily relocating to the UK</a>, where Meta employs 4,000 people across London, including a new office in the King’s Cross area. Meta’s chief marketing officer, Alex Schultz, has also relocated to the UK.</p> <p>Other executives have loosened their physical ties with Meta’s Menlo Park headquarters in California. In March, the Wall Street Journal reported that Naomi Gleit, Meta’s head of product, had moved to New York and that its chief information security officer, Guy Rosen, was moving to Israel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, was a prominent backer of flexible working during the coronavirus pandemic, saying that half of the company’s 70,000 employees could be working from home within a decade.</p> <p>Meta declined to comment on the Clegg story.

She is only 18, but she has spent most of her life wishing for this to happen,” begins The Rabbit Hutch. “The mystics call this experience the Transverberation of the Heart, or the Seraph’s Assault, but no angel appears to Blandine. There is, however, a bioluminescent man in his 50s.”</p> <p>So whatever happens next, you know that debut author Tess Gunty can nail an opening. What happens next is the gradual, chronology-hopping revelation of who Blandine is, what the mystics have to do with anything, how a glowing middle-aged male got himself involved in all this, and why so many human lives (and one goat) have converged on this one horrible moment.</p> <p>The main setting is the Rabbit Hutch itself, the apartment block where Blandine exits her body. Its proper name is La Lapinière Affordable Housing Complex in the city of Vacca Vale, Indiana – a rust-belt relic of a place that, having outlived its usefulness to the motor industry, has been left to decay. Nothing but a scattering of incongruously grand buildings and a poisoned water table remain as testimony to the glory days of the Zorn automobile company.</p> <p>Zorn is an invention, and so is Vacca Vale, but the broad details are recognisable to anyone who knows a little about the malaise of America’s post-industrial heartlands, and especially to anyone who has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michaelmoore\" title=\"\">Michael Moore</a>’s 1989 documentary Roger &amp; Me, about the degradation of Flint, Michigan, after the withdrawal of General Motors. And to underline the parallel, Gunty opens her novel with an epigraph from that film.</p> <p>The epigraph she chooses isn’t about economic decline, though, or the iniquities of capitalism. At least, not directly. It’s about rabbits, and it was spoken by Rhonda Britton, who was nicknamed “the bunny lady” after her appearance in the film. “If you don’t sell them as pets, you got to get rid of them as meat … If you don’t have 10 separate cages for them, then they start fighting. Then the males castrate the other males … They chew their balls right off.”</p> <p>If that’s what happens to rabbits in a rabbit hutch, what’s going to be the result when you pack a bunch of humans into one? Gunty travels through the fraught consciousnesses that occupy the housing complex. The elderly bickering couple; the sadsack sixtysomething man who resents women with “an anger unique to those who have committed themselves to a losing argument”; the young mother who is terrified by her baby’s eyes, with their “shrewd, telepathic, adult accusation” of her failure to bond.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a novel that is almost over-blessed with ideas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These are lives lived too close for comfort and too remotely for care, and it’s a model for everyone’s problem in this novel, which is populated by people like the young mother who both seek love and feel it as a terrible imposition on their own psyches. “People are dangerous because they are contagious,” thinks one man. “They infect you with or without your consent.”</p> <p>That’s even more the case when you’re a woman, with the kind of body that’s made to be occupied. A pregnant woman imagines herself as a building and the foetus inside her as a developer: “Room by room, he demolished her body and rebuilt it into his own.” Blandine rails against the female condition: “Her body contains goods and services, and people will try to extract those goods and services without her permission.” Of course she dreams of making her escape.</p> <p>This is a novel that is almost over-blessed with ideas. Gunty doesn’t quite balance the pieces of her story – she has a winning impulse for digression, but she also seems anxious that you might forget about Blandine, and so never quite settles into her sidebars. The insistent nudges back to the main arc stop her novel from creating the sense of invisible clockwork that would make it perfectly satisfying.</p> <p>At its best, though, The Rabbit Hutch balances the banal and the ecstatic in a way that made me think of prime David Foster Wallace. It’s a story of love, told without sentimentality; a story of cruelty, told without gratuitousness. Gunty is a captivating writer, and if she learns to trust her own talent, whatever comes next will be even better. </p> <p>• The Rabbit Hutch by Tess Gunty is published by Oneworld (£16.99).

She argued she would have liked to see a better sick policy so workers could afford to take a day off for rest and recuperation amid the stressful working environments they found themselves in.</p> <p>“There’s a misconception that if you’re pro-union, you’re anti-company.

Delta is the first major US airline to pay flight attendants during boarding. Usually, flight attendants are paid starting when the aircraft doors close.</p> <p>Tiffany, a flight attendant in Detroit who started working for Delta in 2010, argued it became evident after the Northwest union contract expired in 2012 what workers were missing.</p> <p>“Delta told us back then: give us a year, we promise you won’t want your union back. And we realized really quickly how badly we needed our union back and wanted a contract. Every year it’s been, it’s just been more and more broken promises, and it’s gotten progressively worse,” she said.</p> <p>She said inequity issues have risen without a union contract, as disciplinary actions vary based on the discretion of managers, and that company work policies are often disregarded or changed based on operational needs of Delta, such as scheduling.</p> <p>“All of those work rules and policies go out the window and they literally do what they want,” she said. “They’re making close to record profits again, and our chief executive is <a href=\"https://skift.com/2022/06/23/the-highest-paid-u-s-airline-ceos/\">making over $2.5m</a> more than our closest competitors.

It said renters could miss out on the energy rebate and other support like the warm home discount, if they are not the bill payer, because they are paid to the landlord.</p> <p>Polly Neate, the chief executive of the housing charity Shelter, said<strong> </strong>tenants whose energy bills were included in their rent or service charge “will be at the mercy of their landlord passing on this much-needed support”.</p> <p>“There’s no specific legal obligation for landlords to pass on this support but they aren’t allowed to overcharge tenants for the energy they’ve used or make a profit on it. This could be the case if they pocket the government support and continue to charge the same rate for utilities. Landlords can only charge for energy used, the standing charge and VAT. So, it’s worth making a note of how much energy you’re using to make sure you’re not paying more than you should.</p> <p>“It is unfair that those at the very sharp end of this crisis could miss out on this much-needed support. The government is looking into this as they’ve acknowledged it’s not right. We urge them to make sure this support goes straight to the people who need it the most, not their landlords.”</p> <p>The National Residential Landlords Association said: “Where rents include the cost of utilities, and tenants incur the cost of increased energy bills, the savings from the support scheme should be passed on to them.</p> <p>“However, there will be instances where all-inclusive rents have been set without reflecting higher energy prices. The government needs to ensure that its scheme recognises such cases where it is the landlord who is ultimately paying the cost of increased bills, rather than the tenant.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/03/nancy-pelosi-in-taiwan-calls-for-calm-in-asia-as-us-china-tensions-rise-north-korea-south-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T09:46:44Z","webTitle":"Nancy Pelosi in Taiwan: calls for calm in Asia as US-China tensions rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/nancy-pelosi-in-taiwan-calls-for-calm-in-asia-as-us-china-tensions-rise-north-korea-south-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/03/nancy-pelosi-in-taiwan-calls-for-calm-in-asia-as-us-china-tensions-rise-north-korea-south-korea","fields":{"headline":"Nancy Pelosi in Taiwan: calls for calm in Asia as US-China tensions rise","trailText":"South Korea calls for dialogue and Japan conveys concerns over drills, while North Korea praises China","byline":"Guardian staff and agencies","body":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/nancy-pelosi-lands-in-taiwan-amid-soaring-tensions-with-china\">historic visit to Taiwan</a> of the US House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has provoked a furious response from China, and heightened fears of a crisis in the Taiwan strait. In Asia and beyond, the visit has put governments on edge.</p> \n<h2>South Korea</h2> \n<p>South Korea called for dialogue to maintain regional peace. “Our government’s stance is to maintain close communication with relevant parties … on the basis that peace and stability in the region through dialogue and cooperation are important,” an official from the presidential office told reporters.</p> \n<p>Pelosi is expected to arrive in Seoul late on Wednesday, though there is little information regarding her schedule; her only confirmed meeting in South Korea so far is with the national assembly speaker, Kim Jin-pyo, on Thursday.</p> \n<p>“We welcome Speaker Pelosi’s visit to Korea,” the official said, adding the presidential office was hoping for “many achievements” at Thursday’s meeting.</p> \n<p>President Yoon Suk-yeol will not be meeting with Pelosi as he is on holiday, the official added.</p> \n<h2>Japan</h2> \n<p>Japan’s government expressed concern over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit-speaker-pledges-us-solidarity-tsai-in-wen-china-military-drills\">China’s planned military activity around Taiwan</a>, with the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, stating the area hosting the exercises overlaps with Japan’s exclusive economic zone.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has heightened fears of Chinese aggression in Taiwan.</p> \n<h2>North Korea</h2> \n<p>North Korea has criticised what it called US “imprudent interference” in China’s internal affairs, according to Reuters, which cited the state news agency KCNA.</p> \n<p>A North Korean foreign ministry spokesperson said they “vehemently denounce” any external force’s interference in the issue of Taiwan and “fully support” China, its major ally and economic lifeline.</p> \n<h2>Australia</h2> \n<p>The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the country would “continue to work with partners to promote peace and stability across the Taiwan strait”.</p> \n<p>He told reporters in Canberra: “We don’t want to see any unilateral change to the status quo.”</p> \n<p>New Zealand</p> \n<p>New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, declined to comment on Pelosi’s visit, but called for “diplomacy and dialogue”. “We have long been a nation that in the face of tensions like these, that we’ll call for dialogue,” Ardern said.<br><br>She added: “I’m pleased to see that … presidents from China and the United States <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/xi-jinping-tells-joe-biden-not-to-play-with-fire-over-taiwan-in-two-hour-call\">have recently had lengthy calls</a>. That is positive. Dialogue and diplomacy is what we need in these tense times.”</p> \n<h2>European Union</h2> \n<p>The European Union said it encouraged “a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues”. “Tensions should be resolved through dialogue. Appropriate channels of communication should be maintained to reduce risks of miscalculation,” a spokesperson for the 27-nation bloc said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The European Commission spokesperson said the EU had “a clear One China Policy”, recognising the government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China while also pursuing “friendly relations and close cooperation with Taiwan”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2022/aug/03/gertrude-levitt-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T09:30:04Z","webTitle":"Gertrude Levitt obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/03/gertrude-levitt-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2022/aug/03/gertrude-levitt-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Gertrude Levitt obituary","trailText":"<strong>Other lives</strong>: Teacher who continued to give lessons as a private tutor until she was 101","byline":"Jonathan Levitt","body":"<p>My mother, Gertrude Levitt, who has died aged 107, became a teacher in her 50s after she emigrated from South Africa to Britain, and remained working in one sort of classroom or another until she finally retired at the age of 101.</p> <p>Gertrude was born in Johannesburg to Gretl (nee Pereles), a governess, and Camil Sterne, a bookkeeper. She left Durban girls’ high school in 1930 at the age of 15 and worked as a secretary in Johannesburg until her marriage in 1942 to Nathan Levitt, a lawyer and businessman.</p> <p>After their first child, Peter, died at the age of 19 months in 1945, she busied herself as a volunteer, helping to trace Holocaust victims on behalf of their relatives. Then three more children – Michael, Ruth and me – came along, taking up much of the next 20 years with childcare duties.</p> <p>When we children were old enough, and after her marriage had ended in divorce in 1960, with a friend Gertrude set up and ran a house construction company, teaching herself the skills needed to buy land, design homes and oversee building sites.</p> <p>Increasingly disturbed by apartheid and especially upset by the death in police custody of the African National Congress politician Looksmart Ngudle in 1963, Gertrude decided to move to England with her children in 1964 and lived in London for the rest of her life.</p> <p>In 1968, at the age of 53, she completed teacher training at Gypsy Hill college in Kingston upon Thames and then taught at Ellerslie infants school, Shepherd’s Bush, rising to be headteacher there. As Ellerslie was a state school she was compelled, against her wishes, to retire at the age of 60, after which she worked first as a private tutor and then as headteacher of the independent Manor House prep school in Hanwell.</p> <p>In 1983 Gertrude set up a small school, with me, in the lounge of the flat that we shared in Ealing, catering for up to 11 pupils, most of whom were not achieving their potential in mainstream schools.</p> <p>When that venture ended in 1998 she returned to being a private tutor, keeping up that work for many years until forced by failing eyesight to retire in 2017. During that final period as a tutor, Gertrude had also studied for a degree in education with applied linguistics from the Open University, which she completed at the age of 92, only four years younger than the <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-graduate\">oldest person ever to complete a degree</a>.</p> <p>Outside work she enjoyed travelling, looking at the sea, hillwalking, studying flowers, listening to music and being with family and friends. She was still going camping at the age of 94 and drove her car until she was 101. She went on her last holiday, to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, less than two months before her death.</p> <p>Gertrude is survived by Michael, Ruth and me, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/03/west-ham-have-bid-accepted-lille-amadou-onana","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T09:29:16Z","webTitle":"West Ham have bid of up to £33.5m accepted for Lille’s Amadou Onana","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/03/west-ham-have-bid-accepted-lille-amadou-onana","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/03/west-ham-have-bid-accepted-lille-amadou-onana","fields":{"headline":"West Ham have bid of up to £33.5m accepted for Lille’s Amadou Onana","trailText":"West Ham have agreed to pay an initial £29.3m for the Lille midfielder Amadou Onana, while Kasper Schmeichel’s move to Nice has been confirmed","byline":"Jacob Steinberg and Guardian sport","body":"<p>West Ham have had a bid worth up €40m (£33.5m) accepted for the Lille midfielder Amadou Onana.

flooding.</p> \n  <p>The jointly funded Back Home program provides one-off payments of $20,000 for owner-occupiers, $15,000 for landlords, and $5000 for renters. </p> \n  <p>People can use the cash grants to make structural repairs, move to a new home, reconnect gas, water and electricity and replace or repair damaged household goods such as fridges, ovens or washing machines.<br></p> \n  <p>The

we stand with the NSW government in helping victims of the recent devastating floods get their lives back on track,” he said in a statement. </p> \n  <p>The emergency management minister, Murray Watt, said the government’s priority was to return flood victims to a safe, dry home.</p> \n  <p>“This program will help their homes to become habitable again by contributing to the cost of replacing

the most severely impacted by last month’s floods: Blacktown, Camden, Canterbury-Bankstown, Central Coast, Cessnock, Fairfield, Hawkesbury, Hornsby, Liverpool, Maitland, Mid Coast, Penrith, Port

announcing the details tomorrow”.<br></p> \n  <p>Earlier on Wednesday, <strong>Mark Butler </strong>described supplies as “hotly contested” and did not guarantee enough for at-risk populations, which suggests the order might be limited in number.<br></p> \n  <p>The health minister told reporters in Canberra:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We’ve been working very hard with peak providers in this area, particularly groups like the Federation of AIDS Organisations ... the clinicians in this area and many others who have a particular interest in the monkeypox outbreak across the world. </p> \n   <p>Chief health officers have been in regular discussion about our response to that and we’ve been considering the recommendations from the World Health Organization. </p> \n   <p>I’ve announced previously that we’re in discussions to try to secure pretty hotly contested supplies of the third generation vaccine which can be used pre-exposure or post-exposure, and it’s certainly a much more moderate vaccine than the second generation vaccine, of which we do have substantial supplies now and it’s particularly useful for patients who have compromised immunity for example, potentially HIV. </p> \n   <p>So we’ve been working very hard on both of those in close dialogue with the peaks. And I’ll have more to say about that in the next 24 hours.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/monkeypox-declared-disease-of-national-significance-in-australia\">Guardian Australia reported</a> that health stakeholders believed an announcement of a supply deal for the newer vaccination was imminent.</p> \n  <p>The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advised that “limited supplies of<strong> </strong>… [MVA-BN Jynneos] have been secured by the commonwealth and some states and territories”.

The Greens would likely have the casting vote in any disallowance vote.</p> \n  <p>Babet told Guardian Australia that “full and frank disclosure of how superannuation funds are spent on behalf of members is essential”.</p> \n  <p>“It comes a question of ‘does a super member stand to benefit from funding advertising or donation to any political party?’.”</p> \n  <p>In Senate question time on Tuesday, Lambie said it was “basic common sense” that money be spent in members best interests, and questioned whether Labor cared if “directors spend Australians’ retirement money on stuff they don’t need”.</p> \n  <p>Lambie said super funds make donations that “many members do not know and which I do not like” but “at least they have to tell members who they’re donating to and how much they’re giving them”.</p> \n  <p>Lambie questioned whether the changes were “really just about hiding super money going to Labor and the unions”. The finance minister, <strong>Katy Gallagher</strong>, rejected that, but took other questions on notice.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday Lambie confirmed if the regulations are in line with the draft “we’ll move to disallow them”. “This is about making sure there’s transparency and accountability on all sides of politics,” she told Guardian Australia.</p> \n  <p>“If you only care about integrity and transparency when it’s applied to your opponents, you don’t care about integrity at all.”</p> \n  <p>A spokeswoman for Pocock told Guardian Australia he also has concerns about the regulation diluting transparency requirements. The Greens have not revealed their position.</p> \n  <p>Earlier on Wednesday, Robert told reporters in Canberra that Labor’s first move by treasury was “to water down transparency when it comes to superannuation”.</p> \n  <p>Robert said the Coalition changes ensure “full disclosure of donations, sponsorships, [and] payments for union picnics” due to concerns that $85m had been given by super funds in undisclosed payments.</p> \n  <p>Jones has defended the changes, arguing itemised statements “didn’t align with the accounting standards” and created a “red-tape nightmare”.</p> \n  <p>“If anyone thinks providing somebody with a 300-page document, line by line by line is providing greater accountability, that’s pretty out of touch with the way that most members interact with this,” Jones told The Australian.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T06:33:02.063Z\">at 7.33am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62ea124a8f08b58de97eb955\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T06:16:08.846Z\">7.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Greens senator </strong><strong>Barbara Pocock </strong><strong>to chair committee on work and care</strong></p> \n  <p>The South Australian senator said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need a work-care system built for the 21st century that assists working carers.</p> \n   <p>Establishing a parliamentary inquiry to examine the current work and care system and how we can create an economy that is care inclusive and narrows inequality, was a priority for me, and I’m pleased the senate has supported its establishment.</p> \n   <p>I have spent my life fighting for the rights of working people, women and low-income workers.

Initial supplies will be arriving in Australia later this week and given the relatively small size of the cohort to be vaccinated it is likely only a small number of practices will deliver this vaccine.</p> \n   <p>These clinics will be identified on the Vaccine Clinic Finder and bookings will open later this month, so please be patient and respectful towards general practice staff because even if they are one of the vaccination sites they won’t be able to accommodate your child right away. </p> \n   <p>In terms of children under five who aren’t yet eligible, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) will continue to monitor the evidence.</p> \n   <p>This latest announcement is yet another reminder that practices need more support from government. We are already flat out delivering Covid-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines as well as delivering care to people who have delayed consultations and screenings during the pandemic. </p> \n   <p>It is important to keep in mind too that delivering vaccines to children, particularly young children, is more time intensive and complicated compared to adults.</p> \n   <p>If we are to continue as the backbone of the vaccine rollout, we really need more support from the new government. Many practices are having enormous difficulty absorbing the cost of taking part in the rollout. We didn’t sign up to make money, but at the end of the day we must make ends meet because no one benefits when a practice has to shut up shop or drop out of the vaccine rollout.</p> \n   <p>That is why once again the RACGP urges the government to step up and provide more funding for practices. If that occurs, practices will be able to run more after-hours and weekend vaccination clinics and get more vaccines in arms as soon as possible for our kids.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T06:29:56.831Z\">at 7.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62ea0f1d8f0892e28b4aac96\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/christopher-knaus\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T06:01:25.542Z\">7.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australian activist <strong>Drew Pavlou</strong> has tweeted that he may leave the United Kingdom due to delays in a police investigation into a <strong>false </strong><strong>bomb threat against the Chinese embassy </strong>in London.

<p>The inquiry has turned to the appointment of <strong>Stephen Cartwright</strong> to the UK agent general and senior trade and investment commissioner role based in London.<br></p> \n  <p>Investment NSW head <strong>Amy Brown</strong> told the inquiry that there had been a different preferred candidate for the position before Cartwright was “added to the process late” after interviews had already

I thank the member for Mackellar for this important question. The World Health Organisation has described climate change as the greatest threat to public health in the 21st century. </p> \n   <p>They estimate that between 2030 and 2050, 250,000 people every year will lose their lives as a direct result of a warming planet. And the impact in Australia will be profound. In a climate that already pushes us right up against the limits of human tolerance, heat-related deaths will increase. </p> \n   <p>The health effects are more frequent and intense, extreme weather events will grow substantially and disease will start to creep southward. </p> \n   <p>The dengue fever exposure zone, for example, is expected to move as far south as Rockhampton by the middle of the century and as far south as northern New South Wales by the end of the century. Mr Speaker, we’re already seeing this. </p> \n   <p>Separate from the tragic fatalities caused by the Black Saturday bushfires more than a decade ago, that heatwave in Victoria caused 374 heat-related deaths, as well as a huge increase in callouts to the ambulance service. </p> \n   <p>Australia lags the rest of the world in climate and health after nine long years of denial and inaction. </p> \n   <p>But, Mr Speaker, that will change under this government. The first and the most important step obviously is to take real action on climate change. </p> \n   <p>And I congratulate my friend and colleague, the minister for climate change and energy, for the bill he’s brought before this House and for the constructive engagement by the member for Mackellar. </p> \n   <p><strong>On this side we know good climate policy is good public health policy. </strong></p> \n   <p>Renewable energy is not just good for the climate, it also removes dangerous particulate pollution from the atmosphere and improves public health, as do electric vehicles. </p> \n   <p>I’ve already commissioned advice from my department about the implementation of the election to which the member for Mackellar refers and I’ve had an early discussion with state and territory health ministers about how we can work together, Labor and Liberal alike, to reduce emissions from the health sector, as well as improving its capability to deal with the risks and the opportunities that come with climate change. </p> \n   <p>Mr Speaker, the legislation before the House today is an important first step in ending nine long years of denial and inaction. But alongside sectors like manufacturing and transport, energy, agriculture, and mining, the health sector also needs a focused plan to deal with climate change. And we are getting on with the job of making that plan.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T05:09:01.823Z\">at 6.09am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62ea00e68f08b58de97eb8cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T05:01:14.005Z\">6.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The next dixer has a a “what options have the government rejected” attached to it, which immediately causes an eye twitch, after three years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/23/a-sludge-of-grandstanding-does-question-time-finally-need-some-answers\">“alternate approaches”</a>.</p> \n  <p>Further proof everyone eventually becomes what they hate.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T05:04:43.681Z\">at 6.04am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62ea009f8f0892e28b4aac43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T04:59:49.692Z\">5.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In case you missed it, here is one of the reasons for Labor’s good mood – <strong>Adam Bandt’s</strong> press club speech:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e15747e9-4183-4478-b969-84d0d8c29a19\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UWBxi1UuHNc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62ea00658f08b58de97eb8ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T04:58:52.269Z\">5.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government side of the chamber looks like it needs a lay down after that.</p> \n  <p>To be fair, it doesn’t take much though, these days.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e9ff5c8f0878ca99e2009b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-03T04:58:03.349Z\">5.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Chalmers: Labor has been consistent on what it would do for cost of living</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Angus Taylor</strong> is up with a question for<strong> Jim Chalmers</strong>, and the government side of the house acts like Santa just announced the elves could unionise:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Can the treasurer name a single new initiative announced since coming to government that will address the rising cost of living pressures facing Australian households and businesses?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Chalmers:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for the call.

And it’s spent compiling a very thick report to tell members that they don’t make political donations. </p> \n   <p>At the heart of this, frankly, is this obsession by the Coalition government, which is impervious to evidence, that somehow industry and not-for-profit superannuation funds are making political donations. <strong>I’ve asked the funds. They say they don’t. I’ve asked the regulator are there political donations being made by the funds? They say no.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Pressed on that point, Jones says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They don’t make political donations. That is correct. They don’t make political donations. There are payments in relation to marketing and in relation to services that there are made and yes, if there and is a director or trustee who is a trustee of a superannuation fund, they receive the same trustee fees as anybody else on that fund. They don’t become ineligible to receive trustee fees because they happen to be a union official as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-02T22:48:33.587Z\">at 11.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e9a6128f0878ca99e1feb1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-02T22:33:53.694Z\">11.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Nuclear too expensive and too slow, Zali Steggall says</strong></p> \n  <p>What does <strong>Zali Steggall </strong>make of the Coalition’s sudden interest in nuclear, a technology it ignored while in government?</p> \n  <p><strong>Steggall:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I was part of the environment and energy inquiry on whether to lift the moratorium on nuclear technologies on this.

It is who I am’ | Chris Godfrey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Order out of chaos: this is the very essence of the Premier League, in many ways the very essence of football. You plan and you scheme and you train in the distant hope that after nine months, a little truth finally emerges from the melee. But it never quite turns out that way. There is always some eventuality or circumstance that has not been anticipated in advance, some untameable force that only becomes apparent in retrospect. Given a long enough timeline, chaos always wins.</p> <p>Everyone knew this season was coming for seven years. The decision to move the Qatar World Cup was announced by Fifa in 2015, but for most of the intervening period the colossal upheaval has simply been a vague blur on the horizon. Besides, of all the atrocities of Qatar 2022, fixture disruption was always some way down the list. Now the consequences can no longer be swerved. For the first time in the history of English football, a domestic campaign will be bisected by a men’s World Cup.<br><br>After we have accustomed ourselves to the weirdness of it all – a slightly easier task in the post-Covid world – comes the basic question of how it might play out. One school of thought goes that the biggest clubs, with a galaxy of top international stars slugging it out for a month in the desert heat, will suffer most. Manchester City lose their entire defence. Nottingham Forest, with the probable exception of Neco Williams, Brennan Johnson and Wayne Hennessey, get a lovely winter break. Alternatively, you could argue that the deepest squads will be able to cope best, abetted by the new rule allowing teams to use five substitutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6921ea5f8fd0d4ed388629c2abd7fb316ace62d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6921ea5f8fd0d4ed388629c2abd7fb316ace62d/13_379_5410_3246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester City are chasing a third successive Premier League title and a fifth in six seasons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester City are chasing a third successive Premier League title and a fifth in six seasons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a roundabout way of admitting that we really have no idea what’s coming next. Has there ever been a season with a greater volume of unknowns, of new and moving parts, teams in flux and teams in transition? Even the relegation battle feels wildly open, with Forest spending heavily, Bournemouth barely spending at all and Fulham both unrecognisable from the squad that was relegated in 2021 and still curiously made of entirely the same substance.</p> <p>Forest look the likeliest of the three to keep their heads above water, with a smart coach in Steve Cooper and a playing style full of energy and purpose, quick switches and lightning counter-attacks. Leeds have invested strongly after the loss of Raphinha and Kalvin Phillips but remain a brittle little thing: tight-knit and well-drilled but still prone to wild mood swings. Everton, despite a shambolic pre-season, can’t possibly be as bad as they were last year. But they will at some point require a functional midfield.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/03/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-15-newcastle\">Premier League 2022-23 preview No 15: Newcastle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Usually at least one established club gets dragged towards the basement. Southampton have been defying gravity for years now, an atrophying squad held together only by the vigour of Ralph Hasenhüttl and a miscellany of offcuts from big club academies. Brentford are still enjoying the view but will need everything to go their way this season. Brighton, Wolves and Crystal Palace should be well safe. West Ham will be a quietly thrilling prospect if they can add Filip Kostic at left wing-back to the signing of Gianluca Scamacca to thud home his crosses, although Kostic has so far been reluctant to join.</p> <p>Leicester have had rotten luck with injuries in the last couple of seasons and could again challenge the top six if they can keep their core squad fit. Aston Villa look appealing, with competition in all positions and a clutch of academy prospects on the cusp of maturity. Newcastle are perhaps the biggest unknown of all. A quiet summer on the transfer front suggests they are content with a season of mid-table consolidation, even if fans gorged on Saudi takeover money may expect much more.</p> <p>And so to the top six, where the sense of chaos is more acute than ever. How will Liverpool and Manchester City handle the transition to a more conventional setup based around a single target man? Is Erling Haaland a machine or a man? Can Darwin Núñez possibly be worth £85m? Are Tottenham an actual thing? Is Gabriel Jesus really going to get Arsenal 25 goals a season? Is it wise to try and play Ajax-ball with Cristiano Ronaldo up front? And what exactly <em>are</em> Chelsea these days?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6efb9a3740bbf2ecbb96bd3c3de98bc7d271f802\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6efb9a3740bbf2ecbb96bd3c3de98bc7d271f802/0_27_1858_1114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Antonio Conte and Harry Kane make Tottenham title contenders after their fourth-placed finish last season?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Antonio Conte and Harry Kane make Tottenham title contenders after their fourth-placed finish last season?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MB Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The post-Roman Abramovich era brings only discombobulation and discontent to SW6. New owner Todd Boehly has made the requisite A-list signings – Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly are serious players – but still you wonder where the goals are coming from. Manchester United have looked impressive in pre-season under Erik ten Hag. Ronaldo has been absent. These two facts may not be related. And yet a decade of accumulated dysfunction will take far more than one summer to roll back. For the 14th season in a row, meanwhile, Arsenal remain all potential.</p> <p>For the defending champions, the signing of Haaland is an unmitigated positive: City will still play in much the same way, only the chances that once fell to Sterling or Gabriel Jesus will now fall to Haaland, who will score them. Even a 90% City will win the Premier League this season. There are only really two notes of caution to be sounded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/03/when-was-the-term-striker-first-used-to-describe-a-football-forward\">The Knowledge | When was the term ‘striker’ first used to describe a football forward?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Firstly, Pep Guardiola’s side will lose around 16 players to the World Cup: pretty much their entire starting XI minus Haaland and Riyad Mahrez. Liverpool, by contrast, may escape with only nine or 10, with Mo Salah, Luis Díaz, Naby Keïta and Andy Robertson all getting a rest. In a tight season where mental as well as physical stamina will be a vital point of difference, that may just be enough to bridge the gap.</p> <p>The other unknown is Tottenham. As fanciful as it sounds describing Matt Doherty as a potential Premier League champion, Antonio Conte has made plenty of stranger things happen in his coaching career. Spurs have strengthened in all areas, from defence to attack to fitness. A midfield of Rodrigo Bentancur and Yves Bissouma feels genuinely exciting. Obviously it’s hard to see them actually winning the thing, because … Tottenham. But of the teams straining to break the duopoly, they currently look best placed.</p> <p>Feel free to come back in May and chuckle heartily at all of this, by the way. The point is that a league scarred by greed and inequality, by the same ruthless capitalistic impulses that have laid so much of our society to waste, should feel staid and predictable. That it does not is perhaps a testament to the Premier League’s enduring instinct for self-preservation, a league that for all its bloated grotesqueness will somehow find a way never to be boring. The floodlights are primed. The gantries have been measured out. The kit suppliers have been notified.

It was considered endangered and featured on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s<em><strong> </strong></em>red list of threatened species, and its discovery has sparked new hope for the potential rewilding of Haiti’s forests.</p> <p>As a result of the rapid decline of forest space – only 1% of the country’s original forest remains – many native plants now only grow in inaccessible mountains or ravines. Suspecting that the magnolia could survive in elevated habitats, a team from the Haiti National Trust travelled to Massif du Nord, Haiti’s longest mountain range, in search of the elusive plant.</p> <p>On the third day of the expedition, the team spotted one tree and took the first photos ever captured of the plant. They soon discovered 16 flowering trees in various stages of development, along with juvenile plants in the early phases of growth.</p> <p>These discoveries, they say, suggest that even more of the species could be found in the area. Once they had identified the trees, they collected samples for DNA analysis and plan to return in late autumn to collect seeds.</p> <p>The Haiti National Trust has successfully cultivated four other native magnolia types across the island of Hispaniola, which also includes the Dominican Republic. They hope to use their experience to help local communities contribute to restoration efforts and eventually start a nursery.</p> <p>Eladio Fernández, communications director for the Haiti National Trust and leader of the expedition, shared the optimism that the discovery of this once-lost species has ignited. He said: “Despite the bleak state of the country’s degraded forests, it still harbours species like this that are found nowhere else in the world, giving us the opportunity to save them.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/03/football-transfer-rumours-angelino-to-brighton-jamie-vardy-to-chelsea","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T09:14:53Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Angeliño to Brighton?

His house, located about 20 miles outside of Milwaukee, sits in a particularly bad spot for erosion, with wind and waves whittling away at the base of the bluff. Ten years ago, the house stood 50ft away from the bluff’s edge. Today it’s less than 10ft away.</p> <p>Spector knows it’s only a matter of time until the bluff gives way and his home will be gone.</p> <p>“It’s such a beautiful view, it makes up for some of the heartache,” he said.</p> <p>Spector and many of his neighbors say the erosion worsened after 2007, when Concordia University Wisconsin, a nearby private college, built a 2,700ft rock wall to protect its beach and bluff.</p> <p>Experts say the $12m project is one of the largest seawall structures on Lake Michigan, which is a part of the Great Lakes that hold 20% of the world’s surface fresh water.</p> <p>But while the university found protection behind its wall, almost immediately following the construction, neighbors say they<strong> </strong>saw their own beaches begin to wash away. The bluff, once a gentler slope, became a sheer vertical face as yards of their properties tumbled into the lake. Neighbors complained to the university, and <a href=\"https://archive.jsonline.com/news/ozwash/in-wake-of-concordia-university-project-beaches-and-bluffs-fade-away-b99424792z1-289255751.html\">two couples sued</a>. Spector’s home was one of the properties at the center of that lawsuit, though the case involved the prior owners, not Spector.</p> <p>A jury later agreed the Concordia’s construction caused “significant harm” to properties, but awarded no damages, leaving bitterness over the seawall to linger for some in the neighborhood. Concordia officials did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <h2>A cumulative effect</h2> <p>Battles over seawalls span the globe. In Hawaii, where the islands of Oahu, Maui and Kauai have lost an estimated 25% of their sandy beaches, seawall construction is<strong> </strong>blamed for <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/hawaii-beach-loss/\">fueling the losses</a>. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/as-australia-battles-wild-weather-and-coastal-erosion-we-should-learn-from-our-mistakes\">Australia</a>, the construction of a towering, 23ft wall to protect properties along the beach has been deemed a “total disaster”, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/collaroy-residents-decry-seawall-as-communities-brace-for-erosion-20211124-p59boc.html\">sparking pushback</a> from community members who argue it does more harm than good.</p> <p>Seawalls, often called revetments, are typically sloped, stacked rocks meant to buffer the beach against the impact of waves. But while they help shore up adjacent beaches, they also block the natural movement that would otherwise replenish them.</p> <p>Experts say at best, seawall construction is a short-term maneuver that benefits those who are fastest to build. At worst, they start a domino effect with consequences down the shoreline.</p> <p>Damage from one revetment can cause neighbors to armor their shoreline, which can damage the next beach, and so on, said Guy Meadows, a professor at Michigan Tech University and director of its Marine Engineering Laboratory.</p> <p>“That’s what we see happening here near Concordia,” Meadows said. “There’s a cumulative effect.”</p> <p>Chin Wu, a professor in University of Wisconsin-Madison’s department of civil and environmental engineering, has studied the issue for years. In 2014, Wu <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0380133014000021\">wrote an article published</a> in the Journal of Great Lakes Research that found Concordia’s revetment worsened bluff erosion on the south side of the project, the same direction the current travels.</p> <p>New evidence has shown the damage from the revetment may be even more widespread: Wu told the Guardian erosion has also been detected north of the project.</p> <p>It’s a natural response for residents to armor their property, Meadows said. But they are fighting a losing battle against nature. As waves hit revetments, the water pulls sand farther from the shoreline. Over time, the force scours away at the base of the seawall, causing it to fall forward or fail.</p> <p>Wu and some other experts advocate for the use of <a href=\"https://infosportwashington.cee.wisc.edu/NBCS_c.html\">nature-based solutions</a> – using materials such as sand, vegetation or logs to create natural barriers.</p> <p>But many property owners still opt for the quick-fix of seawall construction, a tactic Meadows and others describe as a Band-Aid solution.</p> <p>“Once we start building structures on the shoreline, armoring the shoreline, [creating] harbor structures, we change the shoreline dynamic,” Meadows said. “There’s many, many places where there is no beach any more. So going to the extreme, if these trends continue, there will be no beach or access for the general public.”</p> <h2>On the brink</h2> <p>For the moment, Spector’s house appears to be safe from toppling over the bluff’s edge. The same can’t be said for all his neighbors.</p> <p>In 2020, a three-bedroom house overlooking the lake was <a href=\"https://www.fox6now.com/weather/its-all-gone-bluff-erosion-worsened-by-heavy-rain-leaves-town-of-grafton-home-on-brink-of-collapse\">left on the brink of collapse</a> after heavy rains pummeled the area. At one point, the asking price for the house was about $1m. The house has since been demolished. Now, a bare patch of concrete sits where the house once stood.</p> <p>Spector said he believes there is a misperception that everyone in the area is extremely wealthy. There are many modest homes and retired residents – people who don’t necessarily have the money to make major repairs.</p> <p>He said he bought his house for around the cost of the land, knowing work needed to be done.</p> <p>The previous owners installed a $60,000 revetment to protect that bluff. To extend the house’s lifespan, Spector reinforced its basement and built a $25,000 retaining wall to keep the home in place. He and neighbors hired a contractor to cut a slope into his remaining yard, which can help stabilize the bluff. And they planted deep-rooted vegetation, which can help hold soil.</p> <p>“For me, it made sense to buy the house and put some work into it knowing I might only have it for 10 to 15 years,” he said. “But I think some people who are moving into these million-dollar homes without any kind of protection might be living in denial.”</p> <p>Spector is optimistic the work he has done to protect his property will keep the house upright for years to come.</p> <p>“I’d like to say it’s a success story, but it may be only a temporary success story,” he said.</p> <p><em>This story is co-published with <a href=\"https://wisconsinwatch.org/\">Wisconsin Watch</a>.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2022/aug/03/venba-a-video-game-about-the-emotional-resonance-of-food","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T09:00:23Z","webTitle":"Venba, a video game about the emotional resonance of food","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/aug/03/venba-a-video-game-about-the-emotional-resonance-of-food","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2022/aug/03/venba-a-video-game-about-the-emotional-resonance-of-food","fields":{"headline":"Venba, a video game about the emotional resonance of food","trailText":"Developer Visai Studio’s debut tells a story of how food bridges the gap between generations","byline":"Malindy Hetfeld","body":"<p>Food is much more than mere sustenance. It’s an expression of love; for a culture, and for those eating. Venba isn’t so much a cooking game as it is a game <em>about</em> cooking – a narrative puzzle about restoring an old cookbook that made its way into the titular character’s hands. Venba is a Tamil woman who left India for Canada with her husband to start over; they’re already thinking about leaving when she gets the news of her pregnancy. The very first dish you make in the game, a savoury rice cake called idli, becomes a way for Venba to break the news to her husband, a clever way to show how food can be part of any memory.</p> <p>“Regardless of what’s happening on any particular day, the kitchen is always busy in south Asian homes,” says the lead designer, who goes by the name Abhi. “When kids grow up and assimilate [into a new culture], they may forget their mother tongue, but they never forget the food that’s cooked.”</p> <p>Venba’s mother’s old cookbook is the key to each recipe you’ll try to recreate. Some instructions are smudged, or don’t make sense to someone unfamiliar with certain utensils or ingredients, so it’s on you to puzzle everything out. It’s an approach that fits the story Visai Games wanted to tell better than following a step-by-step recipe, says Abhi. “Venba feels a lot of guilt for moving away in the first place, and as her son grows up rapidly assimilated, she doubles down on her roots.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veW2qLKXjb4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/veW2qLKXjb4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The food in Venba will introduce a lot of players to Tamil culture, and so the recipes have to be representative, but still approachable even to people wholly unfamiliar with them. “We struggled with making a good puzzle out of these recipes quite a bit, initially,” Abhi says. “[South Asian] recipes are usually quite long and complicated and while it was technically possible to make puzzles out of them, it didn’t make for very fun gameplay. After a lot of research, I found that some recipes actually had puzzles built into them already – we just had to discover them and contextualise them properly.” Abhi uses the idlis as an example: in the game, Venba gets a few tools such as cloth and a steamer, as well as a drawing of what everything should look like once assembled correctly, but the correct order of the steps is left for players to figure out.</p> <p>For Abhi, the key to a good food puzzle is finding a balance between accurately rendering real recipes while making them easy enough to understand and fun to play for a wide audience. “Play-testing these puzzles is also very challenging, as people who’ve cooked these recipes before come in with knowledge that makes solving them trivial,” he says. “But if I design it so it’s hard even for them, it’s going to be much, much harder for players who’ve never cooked like this!”</p> <p>As much fun as these recipes are to figure out, Abhi stresses that cooking is work, and the juggling act between bringing up a child and the immigrant experience is core to Venba’s narrative. “Cooking in media is usually fun to watch, and in Venba too we’ve tried to really capture and impart how satisfying it can be to cook using art, sound and visual effects. But, sometimes, cooking is a chore and we also want players to feel that.”</p> <p>Visai Studios aims for an enriching experience that both chronicles its characters’ struggles and teaches players about Tamil culture. It’s a bit sweet, a bit sour, but full of flavour.</p> <ul> <li><p>Venba will be released later this year for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4.</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/03/what-josiah-saw-review-a-sharp-sleazy-slice-of-southern-gothic","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T09:00:23Z","webTitle":"What Josiah Saw review – a sharp, sleazy slice of southern gothic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/03/what-josiah-saw-review-a-sharp-sleazy-slice-of-southern-gothic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/03/what-josiah-saw-review-a-sharp-sleazy-slice-of-southern-gothic","fields":{"headline":"What Josiah Saw review – a sharp, sleazy slice of southern gothic","trailText":"Director Vincent Grashaw stitches together fragmented stories of grubby low-lives and festering family secrets to create an unsettling tapestry of sordid horror","byline":"Phil Hoad","body":"<p>The French Dispatch and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs have recently shown how the anthology film is often content to supply a carousel of curios to amuse the viewer. But when the individual episodes aren’t merely self-contained but converge into a single conclusion, the portmanteau can supply a narrative kick like no other. Vincent Grashaw’s hunk of American gothic What Josiah Saw isn’t quite as accomplished as Pulp Fiction, whose intersecting trajectories and penchant for petty criminal sleaze it shares. But it has a stubborn, almost literary feel for character that accumulates a baleful momentum by the time the finale hits.</p> <p>Josiah (Terminator 2’s Robert Patrick) is the shock-haired, blowhard patriarch of the Graham farm, which is being eyed up by local fracking companies. Supping his “morning tea” (read: hooch), he only has youngest son Thomas (Scott Haze) for company – though the pair are haunted by the suicide of the latter’s mother, Miriam. Meanwhile subsisting elsewhere on the white-trash fringes is another son Eli (Nick Stahl, another Terminator alumnus), a feckless sex offender who is strong-armed into a sketchy heist to obtain a cache of gold from the Roma at the local fairground.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ8vKfzewuk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RJ8vKfzewuk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Hovering over Josiah and Thomas’s bizarre dinner-table exchanges and Eli’s grubby encounters with low-lives and the law, Grashaw picks away at the family’s festering kernel. “There’s a hollow inside me – I can’t ever fill it,” says Josiah’s daughter, Mary (Kelli Garner), a mordant bourgeois pretender trying for a child. When the parties finally come together, over the oil-company offer, lurking psychological horror lurches into the full-blown physical kind. Slathering the climax with a crawling string section, the big reveal is straight out of the sordid southern-gothic closet, but the fragmented structure – clueing us in early as to how moral corruption seeps outwards – keeps the film sharp and contemporary. If only the depiction of the child-snatching Roma, which borders on racist, was that considered.</p> <p>That latter aspect is a shame, given the astute characterisation and performances elsewhere. The entire main cast are strong, but Stahl takes the prize as the sunken-faced, swivel-eyed piece of human flotsam who manages one last noble act before destiny catches up with him.</p> <p>• What Josiah Saw is available on Shudder on 4 August.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/03/alan-cumming-youd-be-shocked-by-the-messages-miriam-margolyes-and-i-leave-each-other","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T09:00:23Z","webTitle":"Alan Cumming: ‘You’d be shocked by the messages Miriam Margolyes and I leave each other!’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/03/alan-cumming-youd-be-shocked-by-the-messages-miriam-margolyes-and-i-leave-each-other","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/03/alan-cumming-youd-be-shocked-by-the-messages-miriam-margolyes-and-i-leave-each-other","fields":{"headline":"Alan Cumming: ‘You’d be shocked by the messages Miriam Margolyes and I leave each other!’","trailText":"As he brings his one-man show about ‘rockstar’ poet Robert Burns to the Edinburgh festival, the star talks about desire, debauchery and dancing in his 50s","byline":"Lyndsey Winship","body":"<p>There can’t be many people having more fun in their job than Alan Cumming.

The disconnect between a person’s public persona and the fuller story of their life is one that fascinates Cumming and it’s the trigger for his latest one-man show, <a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/events/burn\">Burn</a>, based on the life of poet Robert Burns, premiering at the Edinburgh international festival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4de86663d6da7dd616258a5a0e4a36a4691c7450\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4de86663d6da7dd616258a5a0e4a36a4691c7450/0_0_2338_3500/668.jpg\" alt=\"‘I was initially drawn to Burns when thinking about desire’ … Alan Cumming.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I think he was quite a tortured soul’ … Alan Cumming.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edinburgh International Festival/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In popular imagination we think of Burns as “romping in the hay and ploughing, and ‘Oh, here’s a poem!’” says Cumming. But the actor had “inklings” there was more to Burns than that. “And actually I think he was quite a tortured soul.” In writing his own autobiographies, Cumming thinks he’s changed his particular narrative – he is not only the boyish pansexual performer in circular specs with a mischievous grin that glints at me over Zoom, but also a man with a complicated past and a commitment to emotional frankness. He wanted to do some of the same for Burns, to undermine the sentimentality, the inclination “to biscuit-tin” him, as Cumming puts it. “To make someone into this figure that doesn’t reveal their wholeness and hides any chance of finding out the real person.”</p> <p>A lover of drink and women, Burns had numerous affairs and illegitimate children while married to Jean Armour. “I was initially drawn to him when thinking about desire,” says Cumming. “How we have to constantly battle with having the life that we want and controlling our desires. I thought it was interesting the way he lived his life: his sexuality and promiscuity and the mess he made.</p> <p>“He was a rock star,” Cumming adds, “but a rock star who had a huge hit – his first book of poems was massive – and then the difficult second album.” After success in his 20s, Burns dedicated himself to collecting and arranging folk songs and burned through his earnings, taking up a job as an excise officer to make a living, then dying in poor health at the age of 37.</p> <p>It was a tumultuous life, and delving into it brought plenty of surprises for Cumming. Discovering, for example, that his letters weren’t written in Scots like his poems. “Writing in Scots was a choice for him, like the Proclaimers coming along and singing in Scottish accents, it’s radical and amazing.” And finding out that it’s generally agreed Burns was bipolar. “It’s not a controversial thing any more in academic circles to say that,” says Cumming. “There are surveys where you can see the manic phases in both his output and his libido, and records of doctors’ visits and depressive times. He has this energy schism going on in his life.” Burns’s spirit may now preside over merry celebrations of haggis and Hogmanay, but having pored over his letters Cumming couldn’t help but ask: was he happy? “He never seems joyous,” says Cumming. “I don’t think he was as happy as we’d all like him to be, and that was a shock.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"278089fb4aa09ddb53bb1144c7a09a31d3784d61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/278089fb4aa09ddb53bb1144c7a09a31d3784d61/0_0_4992_3328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Cummings as Dionysus in The Bacchae at the Edinburgh international festival in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Cummings as Dionysus in The Bacchae at the Edinburgh international festival in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All these themes and more will weave their way into Burn, and just as the research offered up the unexpected for Cumming, the show itself comes in a surprising form, as a dance theatre piece. There’s some film, some text, but it’s mostly movement. “I’m 57, it’s not the time to be doing your first solo dance piece!” he chuckles at himself. But this is Cumming getting in touch with his true self. “I’ve always slightly regretted that I’m not a dancer,” he says.</p> <p>Cumming has danced on stage before, of course, and the roots of Burn go right back to Cabaret, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/25/cabaret-review-alan-cumming-sam-mendes-revival\">when he reprised his award-winning role</a> in 2014. “I was 50 and I remember thinking: I’m never going to be this fit again, dancer-fit. I felt sad that something I’d really enjoyed was over. And then I thought, maybe I’ve got one more thing in me, and I put that out into the universe, thinking it might be another musical, or I might dance a bit in a play. I didn’t expect this.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76be1ee0faca8696cc7eeae23b47526e1c113e02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76be1ee0faca8696cc7eeae23b47526e1c113e02/0_0_3666_2651/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Cumming with Jane Horrocks in Cabaret at the Donmar Warehouse, London, in 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Cumming with Jane Horrocks in Cabaret at the Donmar Warehouse, London, in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The universe answered him – or rather Cumming’s network of friends, producers, choreographers, directors and festivals nudged the idea along, including movement director Steven Hoggett, with whom he’d worked on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/aug/13/edinburghfestival2007.edinburghfestival3\">The Bacchae</a> for National Theatre of Scotland. At some point the dance idea collided with his “inklings” about Burns and the two combined to become Burn, Hoggett co-creating with another choreographer, Vicki Manderson, and featuring music by Anna Meredith.</p> <p>Making the show is definitely pushing Cumming physically. “The last workshop, I was exhausted,” he says. “I had to go home and lie in baths of various salts.” He had to switch his digs because one place he was staying had no bath for his aching body. (He lives ordinarily in New York, with illustrator husband <a href=\"http://grantshaffer.com/\">Grant Shaffer</a>, although you get the sense there’s not much “ordinary” in his hectic schedule.) But he’s delighted to be dancing. “I tell stories with writing, I use my face in my acting, but to tell it completely with your body is a great thing,” he says. “And I don’t think it necessarily ends when your body isn’t capable of doing everything it could do.”</p> <p>By which he means, bodies beyond their 20s and 30s have something to offer too. “I love seeing older people dance and move.” Cumming also loves how dance can make you loosen your grip on linear storytelling. “You’re forced into letting things go, the normal way you interpret narrative.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96026027e0e64bce3e43fb35ab73127f74b83c51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96026027e0e64bce3e43fb35ab73127f74b83c51/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Cumming Sings Sappy Songs at the Edinburgh international festival in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Cumming Sings Sappy Songs at the Edinburgh international festival in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here’s a fact: Cumming actually made his dance debut in Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake – the famous gender-switched version where all the swans were danced by men – playing one of the autograph hunters. He shared a flat with Bourne and hung out with the dancers. “I knew a few swans intimately,” he says with a little dreamy smile. “That was magical.”</p> <p>He has a few dance people in his circle, including Mikhail Baryshnikov (whom Cumming says is “hilarious”, telling a tale about surprising the ballet legend in a dressing room wearing some indecently tight shorts that “needed to be pixelated”). A protege of Baryshnikov’s, Aszure Barton, choreographed Cumming in The Threepenny Opera. “She said, ‘Oh, I want to choreograph something for you and Misha’ but I was too shy.” He felt he wasn’t enough of a dancer, but now thinks the strict expectation that a dancer is someone with a particular technique and physique only stymies the art form. “In other art forms you are allowed to be raw and real and to tell your own story and I think dance has been remiss in that and basically says: these are the confines, you have to be able to do these things, otherwise your story’s not valid here.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/06/edinburgh-festival-2022-50-shows-to-see-comedy-theatre-dance\">Edinburgh festival 2022: 50 shows to see</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cumming laughs in the face of boundaries generally, as he continues his omnivorous career. There’s a role in the new Marlowe film starring Liam Neeson as the private detective; there’s a second series of Schmigadoon! that he’s filming in Vancouver when we speak, spoofing the musicals of the 60s and 70s; and there’s another jaunt with Margolyes, extending the tour from Scotland to California. Having known each other a little, the idea to pair up came after being on the Graham Norton show together and they’ve since become close chums.</p> <p>“We leave little WhatsApps for each other all the time, you’d be shocked by some of them,” he laughs. “There’s zero filter. She’ll say, ‘Darling, now I’m sitting on the loo so if there’s strange noises you’ll know what it is.’” Filming with Margolyes is like a Carry On movie, he says. “She always manages to top me in the naughtiness.” It’s a motley mix of projects that keeps him happy, and feeds all the aspects of a multifaceted performer. “I want to do good work, I want to do interesting things that challenge me,” he says. “But I do want to have fun.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Burn is at <a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/events/burn\">King’s theatre, Edinburgh</a>, 4-10 August</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/03/we-called-the-mums-about-an-hour-after-the-ceremony-the-rise-of-secret-weddings","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T09:00:22Z","webTitle":"‘We called the mums about an hour after the ceremony’: the rise of secret weddings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/03/we-called-the-mums-about-an-hour-after-the-ceremony-the-rise-of-secret-weddings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/03/we-called-the-mums-about-an-hour-after-the-ceremony-the-rise-of-secret-weddings","fields":{"headline":"‘We called the mums about an hour after the ceremony’: the rise of secret weddings","trailText":"It is not just celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck who are arranging private nuptials.

But instead of expanding the guest list and adding an extra tier to the cake, many couples are opting to have not just small but almost entirely secret ceremonies.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/22/covid-levels-still-rising-england-scotland\">Covid case numbers remaining high</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/cost-of-living-crisis\">the UK’s cost of living crisis</a> meaning that many couples are feeling the pinch, it’s no wonder that some are less than eager to send out save-the-dates. Plus, it can’t hurt that in celebrity circles – where sizeable weddings documented by glossy magazine shoots were once the norm – getting married in secret is all the rage.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Jennifer Lopez <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2022/07/17/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-married-vegas/\">surprised fans by unexpectedly sharing photos of her wedding to Ben Affleck</a> at the Little White Chapel in Las Vegas, with reportedly no guests in attendance other than their respective children. Just days later, the Queen’s Gambit actor <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2022/07/anya-taylor-joy-secret-wedding.html\">Anya Taylor-Joy was also reported to have had a secret ceremony</a>, marrying the musician Malcolm McRae in an “intimate courthouse wedding”, hot on the tails of the actor <a href=\"https://en.vogue.me/weddings/lindsay-lohan-married-secret-wedding-bader-shammas-announcement-details/\">Lindsay Lohan’s secret wedding</a> to the financier Bader Shammas.</p> <p>So what is the appeal of keeping stumm when it comes to tying the knot? “For us, it was just a really relaxed and enjoyable day,” says Jess Rudwick, 29, a skills development coach who married her partner Gerald Davies, 37, a logistics coordinator, on their 10-year anniversary in Brighton last March. They told just four people – which didn’t include their parents – and headed to the beach for ice-cream and champagne after the ceremony.</p> <p>“I’ve been to friends’ weddings where they’ve been mega-stressed and everything cost a fortune,” she says. “We didn’t have to worry about who would get on with who or if people liked the food. Plus, I got really nervous standing up in front of just four people – I don’t think I could have handled any more!”</p> <p>Easing the anxiety and pressure of having a “big day” is part of the appeal for many couples who marry in secret. “I would definitely say that secret weddings are becoming more common,” says Landis Bejar, the founder of the boutique therapy practice <a href=\"https://www.aisle-talk.com/\">AisleTalk</a>, which specialises in helping brides and grooms manage wedding stress. “People are looking for ways to get out of the spotlight and avoid the pomp and circumstance of weddings. They just want to get to the part where they are married.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06b6104302d048a823f649ae3271da9e858ceff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06b6104302d048a823f649ae3271da9e858ceff4/0_670_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mursh and Tash on their wedding day in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mursh and Tash on their wedding day in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angie Silvy Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Ian Walker, 55, who married Ceri Nunn, 48, in 2016, a secret wedding also felt more genuine. “We got married for practical reasons and so asking people to travel to a wedding felt deceptive,” he says, “but it ended up being a lovely, romantic thing.”</p> <p>The couple had been together for about 20 years when they decided to get hitched (prompted, in part, by a job offer that meant Ceri would be working in Munich post-Brexit), and only told their children in the car on the way to the ceremony at Brancepeth Castle near Durham. “Another reason we didn’t tell anyone was that we didn’t want them to think that either of us was ill, or that we were fishing for presents. We did have a photographer, but my favourite photos are just the ones we took on our phones.”</p> <p>Although money might be no object for some A-listers, the often astronomical cost of a formal wedding – <a href=\"https://www.hitched.co.uk/wedding-planning/organising-and-planning/the-average-wedding-cost-in-the-uk-revealed/\">which averaged £17,300 last year</a> – can be an added source of stress. Even J-Lo opted not to have ​​an Elvis officiate at her nuptials because “that cost extra”. In 2018, when Mursh Haque travelled from Sheffield to San Francisco to marry Tash (both 34 and teachers) without telling any of their friends, they followed it with a month-long honeymoon touring the US – and still spent less than they might have done on a more traditional ceremony. “I’ve got a really big family and Bengali people invite hundreds of guests to their weddings,” he says. “It would have cost each side £30-35k and it seemed like a lot of stress, hassle and appeasing people.”</p> <p>Tash agrees: “Any money that I would have had for it, I’d already spent on a house. Also, I get bored by having the same conversations over and over and I felt that I would get that all the time: ‘Have you got the flowers? Have you done this and that?’ Having a secret wedding meant I didn’t have to have that conversation at all.”</p> <p>Forty-three-year-old Kerry Thompson’s 2014 secret wedding to Nicky, 38, in Norfolk took less than three months to plan, and cost them less than £600. “I got my dress from Tesco – it was a wedding dress, but it was reduced from £79 to £45,” says the support officer. “I didn’t wear any shoes, because it was 32 degrees and my feet were swollen. Neither of us are showboaty people; it was very relaxed and it was perfect for us.”</p> <p>Another big contributor to the stress of wedding planning – especially while trying to keep the costs down – is the guest list. “People struggle with the invite list for a small wedding, and when you factor in people with complex family relationships, sometimes it can feel easier to get married in secret and tell people later, and not rock the boat,” says Bejar.</p> <p>Davies agrees that “you can end up inviting a lot of people who you don’t actually ever speak to”. For Mursh, getting married in secret offered an easy solution: “Instead of leaving anyone out, we were leaving everyone out.”</p> <p>There has already long been a move away from religious ceremonies, with <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/marriagecohabitationandcivilpartnerships/bulletins/marriagesinenglandandwalesprovisional/2017\">civil marriages outnumbering religious marriages every year since 1992</a>. This turning away from tradition could soon be further aided by recommendations from the Law Commission that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/19/marriage-plans-relax-wedding-rules-england-wales\">restrictions on where weddings can be held should be scrapped</a>, meaning couples would not need to find a licensed venue. Could clandestine ceremonies be another way in which couples seek to make their wedding stand out – and can having a secret between you actually be quite fun?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"495894a1790e1fbb80312d584a512367ecf83729\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/495894a1790e1fbb80312d584a512367ecf83729/37_64_898_539/500.jpg\" alt=\"Kerry and Nicky Thompson on their big day.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I got my dress from Tesco’: Kerry and Nicky Thompson on their big day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“A secret wedding is different from a small wedding: having secrets for (not within) your relationship can feel exciting,” says Bejar. “It has to do with novelty and intimacy – if you’re working on a project, just the two of you, and no one else knows about it, there’s something really enticing, even sexy, about that.”</p> <p>Of course, even if the couple in question enjoy keeping their plans under wraps, there’s no guarantee that those who might have expected a wedding invitation will be quite so thrilled about it. “It did upset some people,” says Thompson. “We had booked a space for 146 people and there were only five of us, so, the night before, I said [to Nicky]: ‘We’ve still got time; if you don’t want it to be just us, we’ll just phone everyone and tell them it’s short notice but we’re getting married tomorrow.’ But he said no, let’s leave it as it is.” Like all the couples I spoke to, she has no regrets.</p> <p>“It’s worth remembering that, if you have a secret wedding, some people will be hurt,” says Bejar. “They will have had expectations that they would be there, and they will feel left out. It’s good to consider ways to navigate that reaction. Think about how to say, ‘This was right for us,’ and owning your position.”</p> <p>For most, however, the reaction from friends and family was positive – if sometimes a little surprised. “We called the mums about an hour after the ceremony – Gerald’s mum thought he was joking!” says Rudwick. “But everyone was happy and supportive.”</p> <p>“The only people who were shocked or taken aback were people we don’t know very well,” says Tash. “Although keeping it secret did mean that I forgot the date. On the day we were due to get married, I accidentally booked to go to a baseball game!”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/03/rapper-pa-salieu-dropped-from-commonwealth-games-closing-ceremony","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T08:59:47Z","webTitle":"Rapper Pa Salieu ‘dropped’ from Commonwealth Games closing ceremony","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/03/rapper-pa-salieu-dropped-from-commonwealth-games-closing-ceremony","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/03/rapper-pa-salieu-dropped-from-commonwealth-games-closing-ceremony","fields":{"headline":"Rapper Pa Salieu ‘dropped’ from Commonwealth Games closing ceremony","trailText":"Musician, 24, from Coventry, blames ‘failed background check’ after conviction relating to mass brawl","byline":"Jessica Murray Midlands correspondent","body":"<p>The British rapper Pa Salieu has said he has been blocked from performing at the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony because of a “failed background check”.</p> <p>The 24-year-old musician from Coventry was acquitted in March of engaging in violent disorder during a mass brawl, in which his friend Fidel Glasgow was knifed to death.</p> <p>However, the singer was convicted of possessing a bottle as an offensive weapon and had previously admitted a second count of violent disorder relating to an attack on a man shortly after the brawl.</p> <p>The trial concluded in March and his final sentencing date was due to be in May but has been postponed.</p> <p>Sharing video footage from rehearsals of his Games performance on Instagram, he wrote: “Yesterday I received a call to say that I’m being removed from the show because I ‘failed a background check’.</p> <p>“I can’t keep being silent about this stuff.”</p> <p>Salieu said he had already “had to cancel 90% of my shows this year” as the Home Office would not process the paperwork needed for him to travel abroad until the court case was finished.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He continued: “I have fully cooperated with the process.

But the industry says in the past two weeks there have been days when it has been unable to get any fish into France.</p> <p>Before Brexit, hauliers could transport their product across the Channel without any checks. Now all food has to be accompanied by customs and health and safety documentation, with fish directed to Boulogne-sur-Mer, near Calais, where mandatory controls, including checking veterinary certificates, are conducted.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Salmon Scotland said the fishing industry sector was selling fresh fish on “day one for consumption on day three”. But the disruption on the Kent roads have meant delays of up to four days – and sometimes the loss of entire sales.</p> <p>“We had at least one day where we could not get any fresh salmon into France at all,” the spokesperson added. “These are perishable products.

I put it on my bookshelf and tried to forget about it, but, like great literature always does, it stayed with me.</p> <p>The story, set in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) during the turbulent 1960s and 70s, follows teenager Tambu’s desperate attempts to escape her family’s poverty and get an education. Motivated by the belief that if she works hard she will be able to realise her potential, she ends up both isolated from her family and rejected by the western millieu she is desperate to join. This state of affairs leads to her complete unravelling.

Black and Female is her first work of nonfiction, and represents a rallying cry for the transformative power of writing; not only to help us make sense of our place in the world, as Nervous Conditions did for me, but to lend us the imagination and courage to change it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/14/tsitsi-dangarembga-i-am-afraid-there-have-been-abductions\">Tsitsi Dangarembga: ‘I am afraid. There have been abductions’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first of the three essays, an examination of what it is like to write as a black woman, feels the most relevant for our times. During the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, demonstrators across the world held placards carrying the slogan “silence is violence”. Dangarembga similarly notes that it is through silence that the destructive legacy of empire is perpetuated. When the victim speaks, points to where they are in pain and indicates who has caused it, they find space for healing. “Through writing, I cultivate my being to bring forth forests that replenish our depleted humanity.”</p> <p>Dangarembga understood the power of words from a young age. When she and her brother were taken from Zimbabwe to England, they were forced to stay in a foster home while their parents worked and studied. It was an experience that “sliced her in two”, leaving her with a “never-ending emptiness”. In the midst of powerlessness, words were a way of regaining agency. She wrote a diary as a teenager, and gradually began to think more seriously about the narratives she wove. “With words I could do things. I could make good what was no more. Then perhaps I could bind the things that mattered to me with words and not experience their loss. I could beat the nameless things that sharpened the guillotine and came for me after I was tucked into bed.”</p> <p>Though writing helped her process what was happening to her, she initially struggled to place her own life at the centre of her work. There was no significant black female character in her first play. This changed once she became more involved in feminist activism at the University of Zimbabwe, at which she enrolled shortly after independence. It was then that she was able to recognise the pervasive “pressures on me to not be myself, but to stand in for something else”. Revolutionary literature that glorified the struggle for independence was the order of the day – few “were concerned with the individual personhood of young black Zimbabwean girls”. Nervous Conditions struggled to find a publisher in Zimbabwe and was eventually taken on by a small feminist press in the UK.</p> <p>At the time I read it, I remember thinking that simple representation was enough, but Dangarembga challenges these low expectations. Undistinguished writing merely “raises a scar, puffy, often suppurating, over the damage” of colonisation. She recalls black men encouraging dull work by aspiring female writers in the budding post-independence literary scene by failing to offer constructive criticism. Later, she came across the same modus operandi among white executives in the film industry, who celebrated “mediocre black narrative”. “The best writing opens the lesion again and again and cleanses,” she goes on to declare. When done right, the skin, in certain light, looks like it “was never lacerated”.</p> <p>The collection includes two other essays, one a sweeping sociopolitical history of Zimbabwean women, the other an examination of Zimbabwe’s project of decolonisation, which, she stresses, did not end with independence. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Dangarembga believes the challenges of climate change, immigration and inequality place the world at a crucial juncture</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the latter, she shows with painstaking clarity, how the political elite has betrayed her countrymen. She argues that activists must also decolonise how we produce and share knowledge, and how we see ourselves. “No melanated person’s capacity to function has escaped being affected in some disruptive way by the white-centred structures of the world they live in,” she writes, using a term that will still be unfamiliar to many but that, she asserts, “we black people increasingly call ourselves”. She describes blackness as “condition imposed on me, rather than being … experienced”. For Dangarembga, it is a political identity that has little to do with colour, but rather with the common experiences black people endure. She continues: “Other melanated people became complicit,” in upholding the structures of the empire. Such complicity may be conscious or unconscious … melanated people are often rewarded for their acquiescence to the demands of a white world with economic elevation, or with other things that are valued in that world, such as social stature.”</p> <p>For Dangarembga, this complicity may be a rational choice for black people, but it is ultimately a destructive one. “This is how I came not to be for many years, and how my coming into being, past and present, requires filling in a great chasm, which I constantly seek to do with words.”</p> <p>The final pages of the book are characterised by a fierce urgency. Dangarembga believes the challenges of climate change, immigration and inequality place the world at a crucial juncture. “If the logic of the Enlightenment was racism, slavery, genocide and colonisation, decolonisation is the only logic that offers hope of future,” she writes. The task – to uproot a half-a-millennium-old practice – is immense, but “the trajectory of current and future generations depends on that uprooting.”</p> <p>• Black and Female is published by Faber (£9.99).

Recent history shows this may go down well with Tory members, says Guardian columnist Rafael Behr","byline":"Rafael Behr","body":"<p>The Tory leadership contest is a three-way battle. Rishi Sunak campaigns against Liz Truss and Liz Truss campaigns against gravity. The former chancellor’s pitch is to renew a party weighed down by 12 years in power. The foreign secretary pretends that those years are a burden on some other party. She offers the fantasy of regime change.</p> <p>It is a difference of demeanour more than policy. Sunak performs in the earnest managerial style of a minister holding a line in a broadcast interview. Truss’s vibe is an opposition MP holding forth at a party conference fringe event. The foreign secretary doesn’t even pretend to be in the business of serious government, which, to be fair, she isn’t. She is playing by Boris Johnson’s rules in a game that was never won with seriousness.</p> <p>According to that playbook, a leader can announce a half-baked policy one day and, on meeting with a backlash, rescind it the day after. On Monday, Truss proposed a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/liz-truss-plan-to-cut-11bn-in-whitehall-waste-ludicrous\">war on Whitehall waste</a>”. Then Tory MPs who read the small print complained that the proposal meant docking the wages of teachers and nurses outside London. By Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/liz-truss-u-turns-plan-cut-public-sector-pay-outside-london-tory-leadership\">Truss was denying</a> she had ever had such a policy.</p> <p>Johnsonism is the technique of saying things to woo one audience without caring how they will be heard farther afield. At a hustings event on Monday, Truss was applauded for saying that her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/liz-truss-dismissal-of-attention-seeker-sturgeon-will-horrify-scots-says-snp\">approach to Nicola Sturgeon</a> would be to ignore her as “an attention-seeker”. The implication is that Sturgeon’s demands for a referendum are a tantrum and that the UK prime minister is the adult in the relationship. No sympathy with Scottish nationalism is needed to see how damaging that is for the unionist cause. It stirs the exact grievance Sturgeon needs to whip up support for a second referendum in the absence of momentum for independence. In case anyone thought things would ever change at Westminster, here is the same old English Tory arrogance as far as the eye can see.</p> <p>It is hard to get any other perspective when the mechanism for choosing a prime minister is a competition to satisfy the ideological fetishes of Conservative activists. It is harder still when the failings of the outgoing leader – estrangement from competence; allergy to truth – are forgotten so quickly that the favourite to succeed him is the one who mourns his departure.</p> <p>Truss’s frontrunner status is not certain. But it is supported by opinion polls and by a rush of opportunist MPs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/penny-mordaunt-backs-liz-truss-in-contest-to-be-next-tory-leader\">endorse the candidate</a> they think will win. If that bet pays off, the foreign secretary’s anti-gravity platform<strong> </strong>will be the reason. She denounces a failing economy and pledges a rupture from prevailing orthodoxy as if those things were properties of a government other than the one in which she serves. She seems to think Britain has been badly ruled for as long as anyone can remember, but also that Johnson has been a fine prime minister; maybe not beyond reproach, but not to be reproached by her.</p> <p>It would be a preposterous plan, defying all political logic, but for the recent precedent of a Tory prime minister taking over from another Tory prime minister and successfully pretending they had nothing in common. When Johnson replaced Theresa May, he cast his predecessor as a relic of the old politics. She was the last governor of Remainia – a country that was abolished by the Brexit revolution. May’s time in office was written off along with the previous six years when David Cameron had been prime minister.</p> <p>That was possible because Brexit was an epoch-defining upheaval. There was a seismic scale to Johnson’s landslide election victory that gave credence to his claim that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-takes-his-revenge-and-sacks-over-half-the-cabinet\">new era had begun</a>. Then the pandemic hit and whatever had once felt normal was swept into an even remoter past.</p> <p>Those conditions won’t pertain in September 2022. The part of Brexit that is done has failed and there is no mass clamour for the parts that the Tory party wants to do harder – purging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/22/bonfire-of-rights-truss-vows-to-scrap-remaining-eu-laws-by-end-2023\">legacy EU regulations</a>; fighting Brussels over Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, prices are rising, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jun/14/uk-pay-falling-inflation-energy-bills-unemployment\">real wages are shrinking</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/25/worst-nhs-staffing-crisis-in-its-history-is-putting-patients-at-serious-risk-mps-warn\">health service</a> is falling over. The prime minister will be new to the job but not to the country. The government will feel old. Gravity can be suspended during a leadership contest. It rarely stays absent for long in Downing Street.</p> <p>From the point of view of the Tory membership there is an obvious appeal in the pretence that none of what has come before is relevant to what can come next. Sunak is hardly assailing his party with hard truths, but there is something about his teetotal candidacy that feels like a spoilsport hand over the party’s glass while Truss uncorks another bottle.</p> <p>It must also be hard for voters in this particular contest to remember that they are just a tiny portion of the actual electorate. They all know it in theory, but in practice, when the Conservatives have been in power for so long, when they were in power more often than not in the 20th century, when they have already dominated this century despite Labour getting a head start, it is easy to imagine that, as a rule, British politics is English and English politics is Tory.</p> <p>Even in those febrile, convulsive years after the 2016 referendum, when the country was turned upside down by a supposedly anti-establishment revolution, the most establishment party on earth somehow landed back in government. With that record of revisionist chutzpah it is easy to see why Truss thinks she can wipe the slate clean. Declare Year One of the Trussian Age.</p> <p>And maybe she can. The same complacency that has some Tories thinking they are entitled to perpetual power infects the opposition with a neurotic fear that this is true. I detect a shift in Labour’s mood – from glee at the prospect of taking on the gaffe-prone crackpot Truss to wariness. Gaffes are only a liability if the candidate is embarrassed by them. Cracks can give the pot a valuable ring of authenticity in an election campaign.</p> <p>There is still every reason to think that gravity will win the undeclared next round of the Tory leadership contest. But, such is the perverse state of British politics that Truss may be the one who is better placed to face that challenger by flatly refusing to accept it exists.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/03/guardian-weekly-5-august","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T08:00:21Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly 5 August","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/guardian-weekly-5-august","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/03/guardian-weekly-5-august","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly 5 August","trailText":"Summer in Moscow.

But already its ability to serve as a springboard to international attention has helped make it extremely popular with players. As the second season gets under way on Wednesday with Southern Brave hosting Welsh Fire in Southampton, there will be plenty of players hoping to tread the same path as Mills.</p> <p>“From a players’ perspective the opportunity is massive,” Lintott says. “It’s a tournament that puts us on the global stage, whereas - no offence – but the T20 Blast is nowhere near that level. It can change people’s lives. It’s exciting, and it gives you an idea where you’re at, globally. It’s such an exceptional standard that anyone who does really well in this tournament has pretty much proved they can hack it at international level. I understand there’s frustration around the county game but ultimately I think it’s a good thing for English cricket and the only people who aren’t behind it are those who don’t like change, really.”</p> <p>For its duration Lintott will share a dressing room with South Africa’s Quinton de Kock and Marcus Stoinis, a T20 World Cup winner with Australia last year. It is quite an ascent for a 29-year-old who made his first-team debut only in 2017, playing a single game for Hampshire in the T20 Blast. It was a foot in the door. Gloucestershire took him on for the following summer but released him after three games. He moved to Warwickshire but played only at second XI level in 2019. And then, 2020.</p> <p>Lintott’s ascent happened, to borrow Ernest Hemingway’s phrase, gradually, then suddenly. He used the first Covid lockdown to hone his fitness and shed weight, some three stone in all, and returned transformed. In three summers since there have been 35 games and 47 wickets in the Blast, and a starring role in last year’s Hundred. Also last year he signed his first professional contract, forcing him to leave his job as head of cricket at his old school, Queen’s College in Taunton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1c859cd2484373713d09ab25c667f2de500ec0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1c859cd2484373713d09ab25c667f2de500ec0f/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jake Lintott \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jake Lintott signed his first professional contract in 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Hiscott/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Until I got to the age of 22 or 23 I think I wasn’t quite good enough,” he says. “I really hit my straps around 25 or 26. I made my debut in 2017 and I think I was ready then but it took another four years to find my professional contract. I’ve played a lot of cricket outside the professional game and I know there’s a lot of talent out there, and maybe I’m a reminder that it’s not as far away as you think. There’s no reason why you can’t do what I’ve done. It’s never too late.</p> <p>“I think I’m really lucky in that I’ve come in a bit later, a bit wiser, a bit more aware of what I’m doing. Now it’s just a bit surreal to me – I’m looking around the dressing room, I’m playing with some of the best players in the world, and just two years ago I wasn’t playing professionally.”</p> <p>Last week Eoin Morgan highlighted the opportunity for a spinner in particular to come through the Hundred and into England’s T20 squad, even if only as understudy to Adil Rashid. Lintott, whose left-arm wrist-spin is unusual enough to befuddle many batters, seems as well placed as anyone.</p> <p>“Anyone who plays in the Hundred is going to have ambitions,” he says. “It’s always got to be on your mind, to keep driving yourself to the next level. But you’re trying to stay focused on the task in hand, and then see where you end up.</p> <p>“It would be a dream come true but, if I can put in a really good tournament here and do the best I can, you never know.</p> <p>“But I know that professional sport is quite fickle.

A news article at the time of the 1972 miners’ strike called him: ‘The striker on strike.’”</p> <p>Sam Gee has another example from a similar period, involving a man who was the epitome of a striker. “In my dog-eared copy of Matt Busby’s memoir Soccer at the Top, published 1973, he writes of Denis Law, and his hesitation before signing him: ‘We did not seem in urgent need of a ‘striker’ (to use the with-it expression) ...’ The quotes around ‘striker’ are in the text. The use of ‘with-it’ also suggests it was a relatively new usage.”</p> <p>Sam, Gus Cooper and Justin Hopkins all remembered a different type of Striker: the slightly naff alternative to Subbuteo. <a href=\"http://www.peter-upton.co.uk/striker.htm\">This tribute to Striker</a> suggests the first set was produced in the early 1970s, though Justin Hopkins thinks he was playing it <em>in </em>1970.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4622d9c9f6772d334ca797d9dad594595aa8ebe7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4622d9c9f6772d334ca797d9dad594595aa8ebe7/0_0_4479_2986/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The tabletop football game, Striker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tabletop football game, Striker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Tielemans/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Either way it ties in with the feeling that the term was popularised during that decade. Popularised, but not invented. The first relevant reference we can find anywhere is in the Times report of England 2-3 Sweden from October 1959, which includes the observation that Bobby Charlton’s “real forte is as a striker in the forward areas”.</p> <p>Most of the early usage of “striker” is ambiguous – it can be read as a reference to a goalscorer or a forward player who put his laces through the ball; who literally struck it. A couple of weeks after the Sweden game, Charlton was described in the Times as a “striker and taker of goals in the forward areas”.</p> <p>The first example in the Guardian archive comes from Eric Todd’s match report of Leyton Orient v Leeds in November 1961. “Goals just would not come. For this the splendid Leyton defence was responsible as much as the Leeds’ forwards’ pathetic overeagerness. [Don] Revie himself distributed the ball as carefully as he did when he was the kingpin of Manchester City’s attack a few years back, but he is not the answer to the major problem. The side needs a striker not a stroker of the ball, and until one is obtained, the tremendous potential of such as Bremner and Hawksby will languish.”</p> <p>The meaning evolved quickly, and by 1963 Todd was drawing a clear distinction between a forward and a striker. He described Manchester United’s Law as “most effective as a striker, more dangerous as a destroyer than a creator”.</p> <p>The term was used occasionally throughout the 1960s before becoming an established part of the lexicon during the following decade.

It also causes a rash that may look like pimples, blisters, lesions or sores.</p> \n<p>The rash usually occurs on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. However, in this outbreak, it is being seen especially on the genital and perianal regions of affected people, Prof Kelly, said. People might only develop a couple of sores.</p> \n<p>Most cases of monkeypox in Australia have been among people aged 21 to 40 years. “The experience internationally and in Australia to date is most cases have been among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men,” Kelly said.</p> \n<p>Condoms are not effective at preventing the transmission of monkeypox.</p> \n<p>“Although monkeypox is not usually considered a sexually transmissible infection, physical contact with an infected person during sexual intercourse carries a significant risk of transmission. Intimate physical contact such as hugging, kissing and sexual activities represent a risk of infection, with infectious skin sores being the likely mode of transmission,” the chief medical officer said.</p> \n<p>It’s important to note that the risk of monkeypox is not limited to men who have sex with men. Anyone who has close contact with someone who is infectious is at risk.</p> \n<p>Kelly said: “It is far less harmful than Covid-19 and there have been no deaths reported during the current outbreak outside of countries where the virus is endemic.” Monkeypox is also “far less transmissible” than Covid, he said.</p> \n<h2>Is there a monkeypox vaccine?</h2> \n<p>Yes.

But we will see more numbers and that’s why we need to diagnose the cases quickly.”</p> \n<h2>When was monkeypox first identified?</h2> \n<p>The first case of monkeypox anywhere was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa, during intense efforts to find and eliminate smallpox.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>When the virus appears outside Africa, it is because someone travelled to an endemic region, became infected and returned home.

It’s one of the things that we embraced completely from the American occupation. Politicians know about this.” The large number of actors turned politicians in the Philippines, including the former president Joseph Estrada, is an indication of the sway movies hold with the public, he adds.</p> <p>Imee Marcos said Maid in Malacañang, which focuses on the family’s final 72 hours in power, would tell “the other side” of the EDSA People Power Revolution, when huge peaceful protests filled the Epifanio Delos Santos Avenue (EDSA), eventually ousting Marcos Sr. The family, forced to flee the country in shame, were dramatically airlifted from the Malacañang Palace in February 1986.</p> <p>“I am not trying to rewrite history or revise anybody’s version. For me the truth is that I’m not in EDSA. That’s why the truth is that I don’t have the right to talk about EDSA,” she told a talkshow. “I have the right [to talk about what happened] in Malacañang. They are not in Malacañang. I was in Malacañang.”</p> <p>The film was “by and large in spirit and in much of the dialogue almost verbatim”, Imee Marcos added, though she said there was some creative licence taken by the writer and director Darryl Yap, and it was not a re-enactment.</p> <p>Publicity surrounding the film has drawn criticism for trivialising or misrepresenting the past. A comment by its star Ella Cruz likening history to “<em>tsismis</em>” or gossip was widely condemned for appearing to downplay facts relating to the period – a time when tens of thousands were arrested, tortured or killed.</p> <p>The film’s trailer drew sharp criticism from the Carmelite nuns of Cebu, who in 1986 sheltered then opposition leader Corazon<em> “</em>Cory” Aquino after she ran against Marcos and believed her life was in danger. Less than three years earlier, her husband, Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino, had been assassinated after attempting to return from exile.</p> <p>Cabagnot says he does not believe people will flock to see the film, adding that cinemagoers are more discerning now than in previous years.</p> <p>Free tickets are reportedly being offered. One mayor, Francis Zamora of San Juan City, said he would hand out tickets to local government employees, while civic leader Teresita Ang-See claimed business groups had been asked by Imee Marcos to distribute large numbers of tickets to schools, according to the Philippine Daily Inquirer.</p> <p>Those who would rather watch a story about the people who struggled against the dictatorship can turn to Katips<em>, </em>a film based on a musical drama that follows the struggles of young activists. Last week, it won seven awards including best director, best actor, and best picture at the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences Awards (FAMAS).</p> <p>Its writer, director and producer, Vince Tañada, a lawyer, says he spent two decades’ worth of savings making the film. It is not intended as a political tool, but it does aim to educate people, especially younger audiences, about the atrocities of martial law, he says. Tañada was born two years after martial law was imposed in 1972, and was a young child when his grandfather, the activist and senator Lorenzo Tañada, was arrested under Marcos. “It’s painful as a child to experience this,” he said on Facebook, adding that it was not only those detained who were victims of the time.</p> <p>Katips is a story of young people’s struggle for democracy, Tañada says: “In the midst of uncertainty, there’s no other passion that can pull us back to freedom but the burning fire that hides within each of us. Katips is a tale of the young, in their fight for their ideals, how big can one get against a force too much bigger than yourself.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Guill Ramos</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2022/jul/15/covid-19-cases-australia-today-vaccine-data-tracker-booster-4th-dose-fourth-nsw-qld-vic-victoria-hospitalisations-coronavirus-variant-tracking-stats-live-update-by-state-how-many-people-vaccination-total-new-case-numbers-statistics-deaths-per-day-death-toll","type":"interactive","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T06:42:14Z","webTitle":"Covid-19 Australia data tracker: coronavirus cases today, deaths, hospitalisations and vaccination","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2022/aug/03/covid-19-daily-cases-australia-today-vaccine-data-tracker-deaths-per-day-hospitalisations-coronavirus-tracking-stats-live-update","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2022/jul/15/covid-19-cases-australia-today-vaccine-data-tracker-booster-4th-dose-fourth-nsw-qld-vic-victoria-hospitalisations-coronavirus-variant-tracking-stats-live-update-by-state-how-many-people-vaccination-total-new-case-numbers-statistics-deaths-per-day-death-toll","fields":{"headline":"Covid-19 Australia data tracker: coronavirus cases today, deaths, hospitalisations and vaccination","trailText":"Guardian Australia brings together all the latest on daily new Covid-19 cases, as well as stats, charts and live state by state data from NSW, Victoria, Queensland, SA, WA, Tasmania, ACT and NT.

The film stands repeated watching, the casting is excellent, and flits across Europe in a manner that sets up a fantastic denouement. Difficult to maintain the same value in its sequels, but this first outing is a stone cold classic. <strong><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4147195\">tommyscot</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>PTU</strong></h2> <p>Taking the outline of Kurosawa’s Stray Dog, the recovery of a handgun, PTU takes place in a tourist district in Hong Kong, spanning one night when all the shops are closed and all the familiar streets are eerily silent and empty. There are the usual violent scenes, as well as a marvelous comical scene involving mobile phones near the beginning of the film. PTU is a lyrical noir of the highest order. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157944922\">abkquan</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Mad Max: Fury Road</strong></h2> <p>Totally bonkers action from start to finish that lets you come up for air, briefly, before turning around and ploughing straight back into it again. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157943430\">Rednaught</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d25f4fbe49ddceca2e24ba8611770ddff8c7190c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d25f4fbe49ddceca2e24ba8611770ddff8c7190c/0_132_3856_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Mad: totally bonkers?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Mad: totally bonkers?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Village Roadshow/Kobal/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of purest adrenaline-inducing action, Mad Max Fury Road was the movie that most left me gasping “WTF was that?!” like I had just been through a Nasa G-force simulator. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157939406\">BenCaute</a></strong></p> <p>Mad Max: Fury Road is surely the best action movie of the last decade, if not the century so far. I notice a dearth of entries from the last 20 years or so. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157937993\">Deuce03</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Hard Target</strong></h2> <p>John Woo doing all his best slow-motion pigeon action. Jean-Claude Van Damme kicking lots of dudes. Wilford Brimley as an action hero. Lance Henriksen in ham-tastic villain mode. Plus, it’s a really good take on the “rich people pay to hunt poor people” trope.</p> <p>I don’t think it’s <em>the best</em> action movie of all time, but I do think it’s <em>one of</em> the best action movies of all time. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157942464\">UnstoppableSteve</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Predator</strong></h2> <p>I feel like Predator deserves a mention, for the way in which it rather slyly subverts action movies. It starts with a bunch of comically over-the-top, testosterone-oozing action heroes doing their thing and effortlessly wiping out a whole village; then the writer effectively says to the characters “OK, now let’s see how you like being on the receiving end of that”; from then on, the heroes take on the roles of the bad guys being taken out, one by one, by the alien, who is playing the role of the honorable but unstoppable action-movie guerrilla-hero. (Note, for example, the way it never shoots anyone who isn’t armed, and removes all of its armour and weaponry to duel Arnie hand to hand.) <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157942118\">Shasarak</a></strong></p> <p>I know this is subjective, but I have to point out objectively the best action movie ever made is Predator. I am not an Arnie fan, it took me nearly 20 years to actually understand “the devil who makes trophies of men” line, you can see Dutch’s arm. None of this matters, Predator is the best action movie ever made. I will die on this hill. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157941820\">cairnofmediocrity</a></strong></p> <p>Predator, which I consider science-fiction first, is also an action film, and a mighty one at that. Every scene flows like a musical ensemble. You can mute the film and still be glued to what is transpiring. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157936735\">Rishi8413</a></strong></p> <p>Arnie gives one of his best performances, accompanied by a stellar cast, up against a worthy opponent.

May even be one of the best Vietnam films. Works as a one-man-against-the-state film, young boys sent to war film, horror film, action film, tragedy. Masterpiece. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157940733\">AntZudan</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Drive</strong></h2> <p>Ryan Gosling is the unnamed Hollywood stunt/getaway car driver who falls in love with his pretty neighbour. But she has a husband, he was in jail, the bad guys want money from him, so he needs a getaway driver for this robbery he is forced to do.</p> <p>Fantastic action, a cool, nameless hero that almost never speaks and is extremely competent in one thing, great car chases, great villains. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157940003\">Iwan_Karamasow</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>District 13</strong></h2> <p>It’s almost constant action with no CGI and it introduced “parkour” to the world. It also has a great soundtrack – and it even has a social message (which while important can be safely ignored as it’s not even vaguely intrusive). <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157937588\">Troy_McClure</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Cop Secret</strong></h2> <p>Made on a shoestring by an ex-international footballer and his buddies, it’s a throwback to 1980s buddy-cop action movies: fast cars, explosions, fist fights, martial arts fights, gun fights, horribly scarred supermodels – you name it, all on the mean streets of – ummmm – Reykjavík. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157937578\">MikeRichards</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Seven Samurai</strong></h2> <p>Great excitement, great set pieces, great moral storytelling, and you can still see its influences decades later in LOTR and Mad Max, so it’s pretty hard to deny its quality and significance. Was it the first “modern” action movie? People will argue that, but if I had to choose just one, this would be it. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157936750\">CaligulaMcNutt</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecce4fe1fc48a22a65fff7691341b4a498d4606c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecce4fe1fc48a22a65fff7691341b4a498d4606c/0_0_2633_1580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toshiro Mifune in Seven Samurai.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toshiro Mifune in Seven Samurai.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leave aside the inspiration from and for westerns, or the art-house nature of Kurosawa; the second half is just brilliantly made, flat-out action. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157935268\">samfid</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Shooter</strong></h2> <p>I would argue this is the last great Hollywood action movie. Mark Wahlberg in his true pomp, a fantastic support actor in Michael Peña and a great villain in Danny Glover. The sniper scene near the end is amazing where Mark appears dressed as a yeti or extra from an ‘NSync music video. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157936232\">Robldn</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>The Long Kiss Goodnight</strong></h2> <p>Beautifully filmed non-CGI action scenes. An actual plot. Geena Davis in (sort of) two different roles. Samuel L Jackson. Brian Cox and Patrick Malahide. A kid who is genuinely endearing rather than cute and some killer and very funny lines. The complete antidote to the sexism of Die Hard but just a great film. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157936059\">aakoqon</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>True Lies</strong></h2> <p>Great action. Is using a Harrier jump jet too excessive? Nah. Arnie under the truth drug telling the bad guy what he’s going to do to him, then doing it. Nice romcom elements as well. <strong><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/157935621\">Malinowski</a></strong></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2022/aug/03/the-hiv-prevention-drug-that-could-save-millions-of-people-if-they-can-afford-it-cab-la-cabotegravir","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T06:15:19Z","webTitle":"The HIV prevention drug that could save millions of people – if they can afford it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/03/the-hiv-prevention-drug-that-could-save-millions-of-people-if-they-can-afford-it-cab-la-cabotegravir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/aug/03/the-hiv-prevention-drug-that-could-save-millions-of-people-if-they-can-afford-it-cab-la-cabotegravir","fields":{"headline":"The HIV prevention drug that could save millions of people – if they can afford it","trailText":"CAB-LA injections offer stigma-free protection for those at risk – particularly women in Africa.

The results have been spectacular. It’s a huge breakthrough. The World Health Organization has acted, producing guidelines at Montreal encouraging countries to get and use CAB-LA, as it has been dubbed, as soon as they can.</p> <p>A decade ago, oral <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/24/truvada-hiv-aids-you-tell-us\">PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) arrived</a>. These are daily pills that do the same job. There was demand in wealthy countries among uninfected men and women whose partners had HIV. At first, the pills were too expensive for low-income countries. Eventually the price came down, thanks to generic manufacturers, permitted to copy the formula. But fewer than 3 million people worldwide have started taking them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36556712c108097aebbd74900709f4e6819a77a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36556712c108097aebbd74900709f4e6819a77a5/0_0_6478_3887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty condom dispenser inside a brothel on 16 March 2022 in Bukakata, Uganda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty condom dispenser inside a brothel on 16 March 2022 in Bukakata, Uganda. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Dray/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pills have not solved one of the biggest problems: how to protect women and adolescent girls who, willingly or not, may have sex with those capable of giving them HIV.

The obvious comparison is with long-lasting injectable contraception. Young women may be able to get a jab every two months that will protect them from HIV, without anyone in their family or community knowing. PrEP in pill form has been targeted at sex workers and gay men, risking criminalisation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/03/ghana-anti-lgbtq-bill-blamed-for-rise-in-attacks\">countries with homophobic laws</a>. That inadvertently fed stigma, deterring young women from seeking it out.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/21/leading-figures-urge-drugs-firm-to-lower-price-of-game-changing-hiv-treatment\">the cost of CAB-LA is high</a>. ViiV has estimated a not-for-profit price of $240-$270 (£195-£220) for a year’s supply for one patient. Chai, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, calculated the actual cost of the ingredients might be $20-$40, a figure that the activists have thrown at ViiV ever since.</p> <p>“It [CAB-LA] is not a magic bullet but it is extraordinarily effective,” says Asia Russell of HealthGap. “And ViiV is pricing it out of reach of the exact communities who need it. A product that should be an option, as the people’s prevention shot frankly is, instead being treated like a luxury good.”</p> <p>Russell, who took to the stage in the protest, calls it “pandemic-altering science”, adding: “Our message is: it is evil to put profits before protection from HIV.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abca14e4fb58edefb974bb7fb7ef9b8ad2a7decf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abca14e4fb58edefb974bb7fb7ef9b8ad2a7decf/0_0_6209_4139/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Potential PrEP trial volunteers receive information at a community outreach session, Bukakata, Uganda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Potential PrEP trial volunteers receive information at a community outreach session, Bukakata, Uganda. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Dray/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ViiV’s head of government affairs and global public health, Helen McDowell, says the treatment involves a complex technology, and ViiV cannot offer it for the $50 to $60 per patient for a year that the daily pills cost. But, she says, they are collaborating with advocacy groups, funders and everyone else in the field, and if there is demand, they can bring the price down.</p> <p>In Montreal, the company announced an agreement with the <a href=\"https://medicinespatentpool.org/\">Medicines Patent Pool</a>, which will allow three generics companies to be licensed to produce cheap copies. But this could take up to five years, to give the generics time to invest in nano technology and skilled staff.

They want something discreet that they don’t have to disclose, and they are empowered and in control of it themselves.”</p> <p>Mitchell Warren, who runs the advocacy group Avac, is close to HealthGap, and collaborates – without taking funding – with ViiV. He says that Avac is part of a new coalition announced at the conference, with the WHO, Unitaid, UNAids and the Global Fund. The coalition will work out how to fund CAB-LA and get it to those who need it. He thinks they could talk out their differences.</p> <p>“I’m sad that we don’t find ways to the conversation more strategically. The activists raise really important issues,” he says. “I wish more people would engage with the conversation. I don’t think any of us are that far apart.”</p> <p>What’s needed now, he says, is to get the message out: “We need to think about how we market prevention. We are in a bubble.

And while Covid has taught many people about viruses, it has wiped HIV off the front pages. “It’s unrealistic to think we can go back to the visibility of 25 years ago,” she says.</p> <p>There is, however, a risk gains could be lost.

We will ... continue to hold the line of defence for democracy,” she said. She also thanked Pelosi for “taking concrete actions to show your staunch support for Taiwan at this critical moment”.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Taiwan</strong><strong>’s cabinet on Wednesday said the military has increased its alertness level </strong>and authorities will make plans to ensure safety and stability around the island.</li> \n   <li><strong>China said it will conduct military drills</strong> in areas near Taiwan from Thursday to Sunday, state media said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan’s government expressed concern over planned Chinese military activity around Taiwan</strong> in response to Pelosi’s visit to the self-governed island. Japan’s top spokesman, Hirokazu Matsuno, said Tokyo had conveyed its concerns to Beijing over the drills, which are due to start on Thursday. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>China summoned the US ambassador in Beijing on Tuesday to rebuke him over Pelosi’s “egregious” trip to Taiwan</strong>, state media reported. Vice foreign minister <strong>Xie Feng</strong> voiced “strong protests” over Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan during his talk with ambassador <strong>Nicholas Burns</strong>.</li> \n   <li><strong>China rolled out curbs on the import of fruit and fish from Taiwan while halting shipments of sand</strong> to the island in the wake of Pelosi’s visit</li> \n   <li><strong>In her speech to Taiwan parliament, Pelosi said she wants to increase parliamentary exchanges between the US and Taiwan. </strong>She called <strong>Taiwan</strong>“one of the freest societies in the world”</li> \n   <li><strong>Pelosi was awarded the Order of Propitious Cloud with Special Grand Cordon.</strong> Tsai draped a sash over the US House speaker as she bestowed the award and Tsai the honour “represented their gratitude to Pelosi and the wish to continue progressing US-Taiwan relations through more cooperation.”</li> \n   <li><strong>In 7-11 stores across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/taiwan\">Taiwan</a> on Wednesday the words “War Warmonger Pelosi Get Out of Taiwan” flashed across in-store TV screens.</strong> According to local reports some customers thought the message was a news chyron, or a forthright expression of the franchise-owner’s views.

We know some of the steps they tried to take after the strike to cover up the evidence of it. We’re mindful of it. But I’m not going to get ahead - policy decisions haven’t been made. We’re not going to take the Taliban at their word. They claim they want a relationship with the United States and the West. They claim they want to open up and be part of the international community.

We’re going to maintain this over-horizon capability.

We are prepared to manage what Beijing chooses to do. At the same time, we will not engage in sabre rattling.

For al-Qaeda’s continued desire to operate as a global organization, that could spell its death knell,” Lister writes.</p> \n  <p>Even before al-Zawahiri’s death, al-Qaida was becoming less the type of global network <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong> presided over and more a group of regional affiliates, Lister says. “Since at least 2009, the nature and proliferation of conflicts across much of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia has created conditions in which locally oriented jihadist efforts are far more likely to bear fruit than globally-oriented ones. The Arab Spring accelerated that trend, as did jihadists’ lessons learned from ISIS’s territorial defeat in Iraq and Syria between 2014 and 2019.

Though al-Qaida was known for its innovative empowerment of local cells, the man at the top of the hierarchy has real authority. An oath of loyalty is sworn not to the group, but to the individual.</p> \n  <p>When Zawahiri became leader after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jun/19/ayman-zawahiri-observer-profile\">Bin Laden’s death in a US special forces raid in Pakistan in 2011</a>, he turned al-Qaida away from spectacular long-range attacks, believing they were counterproductive. </p> \n  <p>Instead, links with groups around the world were reinforced and efforts made to expand through gradually winning support from communities on the ground. This did not always bring success, and al-Qaida suffered significant setbacks in Iraq and Syria during the 11 years Zawahiri was in charge. </p> \n  <p>The rise of a rival, Islamic State, which swept through these two countries and set up a new “caliphate”, led to a loss of profile and influence in a key region as well as competition elsewhere. The limited achievements of its affiliate in Yemen, once seen as a major potential threat to the region and the west, must have been a disappointment.</p> \n  <p>What will be the strategy of the new leader? Whoever takes over has multiple options – but no easy ones. He has to stay alive, communicate despite considerable logistic challenges, deal with regimes such as the Taliban and formulate a clear idea of what his subordinates should be doing.</p> \n  <p><strong>You can read more of Jason Burke’s analysis here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/ayman-al-zawahiri-killing-unlikely-to-significantly-weaken-al-qaida\">Zawahiri’s killing unlikely to weaken al-Qaida significantly</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/ayman-al-zawahiri-killing-unlikely-to-significantly-weaken-al-qaida\">Zawahiri’s killing unlikely to weaken al-Qaida significantly</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-02T11:04:43.097Z\">at 12.04pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e8fc788f08cbe8a2c31ed0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nicola-slawson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-02T10:32:34.133Z\">11.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>The other major foreign policy development today concerns relations between the US and China, which are being strained by the expected visit of Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.

This may include but is not limited to the name provided at the start of the quiz, the answers you provided, fill in the blank values entered, the time taken to answer each question, your final result and the quiz as a whole.</p> <p>“By taking a quiz on our website you acknowledge and agree that any information, including personally-identifiable information is collected and stored on behalf of the quiz creator and is made available to the quiz creator through their account, in real-time and in downloadable form.”</p> <p>This means that the creator of a quiz potentially has access to the names and answers provided by every person who has taken it.</p> <p>Which might not be that helpful in terms of mass data harvesting if people have entered a random name at the start of the quiz, but if they put in, say, their TikTok handle, or they have a profile on UQuiz already that contains personal information, well that’s a different box of frogs.</p> <p><strong>How much can they even tell about a person based on what Little Miss character they are?</strong></p> <p>For the sake of journalism, I have taken the most popular version of the quiz. There are questions about your taste in music, accessories, plush toys and booze; and about your long-term aspirations and humiliating life experiences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/19/is-armie-hammer-really-selling-timeshares-in-the-cayman-islands\">Is Armie Hammer really selling timeshares in the Cayman Islands?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So by the end of the quiz, if you answer honestly and give a name that can be matched to a social profile, it is entirely plausible that the quiz creator will know that I am a vape-addicted Grimes fan who loves hair clips and mojitos, and that my favourite colour is rainbow (only one of these statements is true).</p> <p><strong>That sounds pretty broad, but definitely enough to sell off to advertisers. We know Facebook’s parent company Meta is hurting (to the tune of $10bn) after Apple introduced that handy little function to stop advertisers tracking you across the internet. Do you think this might be a new way for companies to make user profiles </strong><strong> to then sell ads to?</strong></p> <p>This is purely in the realm of the hypothetical, but yes, it could be enough to create a customer fingerprint to sell to advertisers, provided you can match someone’s quiz name with other publicly available information about them. What is even more likely is that a quiz creator could potentially sell the results of their Little Miss quiz to someone like Squishmallow, whose products featured in a recent quiz, to tell them their most popular plush toy based on a survey of thousands of users.</p> <p>Once again, I’m not saying this <em>is </em>happening, just that based on UQuiz’s privacy policy, which doesn’t say anything about what a quiz maker can or cannot do with the data once it is presented to them “in downloadable form”, it definitely could happen.</p> <p><strong>Sounds like something people should think about before jumping in. This isn’t so different from those Facebook quizzes that parents do </strong><strong> to tell them what kind of Wine Mum they are, right?</strong></p> <p>It’s exactly the same. The only difference is one might assume TikTokers are tech-savvy enough to know better. But I guess personality quizzes are the inevitable evolutionary path all social platforms must go down.</p> <p><strong>It’s the circle of your online life, which apparently advertisers want to know all </strong><strong>about.

A small group of furious men, whipped up by the media and opportunist politicians, are seeking to turn quiet, practical attempts to protect local people into full-blown culture wars. The further from reality their beliefs diverge, the readier they are to resort to vandalism and violence.</p> <p>But this isn’t the US, and it’s not about textbooks. It’s playing out in the streets of Oxford. The angry men have resorted so far to arson, angle grinders and physical attacks on local people. What is the frightful cause of these reactions? The council’s efforts to ensure that through-traffic stays on main roads.</p> <p>There could scarcely be a more reasonable policy. Low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) seek to stop residential streets being used as escape valves for overloaded arterial roads. They replace a privilege exercised by a few – rat-running through local streets – with rights enjoyed by the many: cleaner air, less noise, safe passage for children, cyclists, users of wheelchairs and mobility scooters, stronger communities.</p> <p>The angry drivers insist that LTNs have been imposed on them. Well, whether they agree or not, there are consultations. But no one was consulted about their streets being used as short cuts. No one was consulted about facing a higher risk of <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w24970\">asthma and dementia</a> as a result of air pollution, or seeing their communities split by walls of traffic. No one was consulted about losing the places where neighbours could talk and children could play.</p> <p>The shift has happened at astonishing speed. Between 1995 and 2019, urban traffic in Great Britain rose significantly. But not on major roads, where it grew by just 1%. On minor roads, by contrast, it <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/916749/road-traffic-estimates-in-great-britain-2019.pdf\">rose by 36%</a>. You can see the fascinating, chilling trends in government statistics. Traffic on minor roads rises slowly until 2004, gradually declines to 2010, then suddenly surges.</p> <p>What happened? The general introduction of <a href=\"https://citymonitor.ai/community/neighbourhoods/google-maps-local-traffic\">satnavs</a>. Not only have they made urban driving easier, encouraging a wider trend, but they’ve directed all the extra traffic through rat-runs. In London, journeys on minor roads <a href=\"https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/regions/6\">increased by 63%</a> between 2009 and 2019.</p> <p>The problem compounds itself. Pedestrians are 17% more likely to be <a href=\"https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/full/10.1680/jmuen.16.00068\">killed or seriously injured</a> on minor roads for every mile a vehicle travels than on major roads. As the streets become more dangerous, fewer local people are prepared to walk or cycle so they, too, turn to their cars.</p> <p>Low traffic neighbourhoods use bollards or selective filters to make rat-running infeasible. Everyone can reach their home in a car or a van if they wish, but they might have to take a longer route to get there. In return, they get safety, quiet, and cleaner air. A study in one of the early LTNs (called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2018/jun/26/mini-holland-schemes-have-proved-their-worth-in-outer-london-boroughs\">mini-Holland schemes by the designers</a>) in Waltham Forest in London found that road injuries <a href=\"https://www.centreforlondon.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CFL-StreetShift-LTNs-Final.pdf\">fell threefold</a>. Partly as a result, people in mini-Holland streets walk or cycle, on average, 41 minutes a week more than those whose traffic has not been reduced.</p> <p>A remarkable feature of these schemes is how quickly people reoccupy their streets. Almost immediately, people start emerging from their houses to talk, their voices no longer drowned by engines. Children come out to play. Thoroughfares become communities.</p> <p>The more ambitious the plans are, the better they work. Traffic diversions should be accompanied by an expansion of community space – wider pavements, benches, trees, micro-parks – and schemes to encourage people to travel by different means, such as protected bike lanes, new bus routes, road charging, <a href=\"https://enjoywalthamforest.co.uk/blended-copenhagen-crossings/\">“Copenhagen crossings”</a> (where pedestrians have priority), and controlled parking zones. Rather than permitting large vans to deliver small packets, a <a href=\"https://www.centreforlondon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Worth_The_Weight_Report_Final.pdf\">delivery depot system</a> would allow the last part of the journey to be made by cargo bike.</p> <p>The way we talk about these changes is important. “Low traffic neighbourhood” is a cold, distancing term. I think they would better be named “streets for people”. Instead of announcing “road closures”, councils should herald “street revivals”.</p> <p>Oxford’s programme is arguably the <a href=\"https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/roads-and-transport/connecting-oxfordshire/core-transport-proposals\">most ambitious</a> in the country. Its LTN schemes are part of a wider transformation, which includes a city-wide workplace parking levy, a large zero-emission zone, new electric buses, an e-cargo bike fleet and electric scooter hire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca77232f47445b4df7d088fff94211f3dec85d6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca77232f47445b4df7d088fff94211f3dec85d6a/0_160_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LTN planters vandalised in Lambeth, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LTN planters vandalised in Lambeth, London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But certain men (CCTV footage suggests that all of them are men) find this transition intolerable. They began by spraying graffiti on the streets and flower planters. Before long, they started ripping out the new bollards. When local people, calling themselves “human bollards”, took the place of the vandalised fittings to defend their streets at peak times, these men resorted to threats, abuse and violence. In some cases, they left their vehicles to shove and punch the street defenders. In one case, recorded on film, a driver used his car to shunt a person out of the way. One man, using a powerful accelerant, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot/status/1543971739973156864\">torched two of the bollards</a>. In a separate incident last month, someone sawed one off and filled the hole with cement.</p> <p>The objectors spread powerful myths. They claim that LTNs merely displace traffic to other roads. But, as <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1007815/gear-change-one-year-on.pdf\">government figures show</a>, the majority of schemes reduce traffic everywhere. They claim LTNs impede emergency vehicles, but a <a href=\"https://findingspress.org/article/23568-the-impact-of-2020-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-on-fire-service-emergency-response-times-in-london-uk\">paper</a> in the journal Transport Findings, investigating the response times of fire engines, found no evidence of an effect. They claim that these changes favour middle-class areas, but an analysis revealed that people in highly deprived places are <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q87fu/\">2.7 times more likely</a> to benefit from an LTN. They claim the schemes are expensive, but all of Oxford’s, transforming the lives of 7,000 residents, cost just £165,000: 67 times less than expanding <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OxonCyclingNet/status/1542784728364974081\">one roundabout</a> on the ringroad.</p> <p>Public opinion follows a consistent trajectory: once these changes have bedded in, opposition collapses. For instance, in Waltham Forest, 44% of residents objected to their LTN before it was created. But five years on, <a href=\"https://www.livingstreets.org.uk/media/5886/the-urgent-case-for-more-walking-and-cycling-waca-report.pdf\">only 1.7%</a> wanted to see the change reversed. Unfortunately, some councils, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2020/oct/22/despite-a-loud-opposing-minority-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-are-increasingly-popular\">Lewisham</a>, Harrow and Wandsworth, lost their nerve before their schemes matured, and reversed them after a few difficult weeks. Not Oxford: two weeks ago, the county council voted to make its LTNs permanent.</p> <p>People are entitled to object to LTNs,<strong> </strong>but the hard-right politics that has crossed the Atlantic tells some people that they no longer need respect the facts, no longer need to listen to others, no longer need to reason or debate. They need only assert, threaten and attack. This new barbarism, combined with the lethal ways in which driving <a href=\"https://www.monbiot.com/2005/12/20/the-anti-social-bastards-in-our-midst/\">changes us</a>, encourages the worst tendencies and the worst people to come to the fore.

Today, I still dream of it","byline":"Colleen Hubbard","body":"<p>When I was a child, we lived in a 1980s mock-Tudor house in a working-class town in Connecticut. Already in my family there were signs of financial peril: my parents had divorced years earlier, and my mother struggled as a single parent of three. She had borrowed money from friends, and when repayment wasn’t possibile, one couple came to our home with a removal van to collect anything of value. They took furniture, the TV, the lawnmower and even my collection of dolls. The corner store my mother managed had collapsed, and around the house we had jumbo rubbish bags filled with the shop’s contents. For meals, my siblings and I would pick through the bags for dented boxes of cereal and chocolate bars in crinkly wrappers, as if we were in an apocalyptic movie. Outside, the unmown grass grew taller than knee height.</p> <p>But still, we had the house. Or so we thought.</p> <p>We found out it wasn’t so one evening in August, when my siblings and I returned from a two-week trip to California to visit our great-aunt. My older sister, 12 at the time, had chaperoned us through our connecting flights.</p> <p>We arrived back at the airport overtired, full of stories about the stopover at O’Hare, during which we saw another unaccompanied child – a king among children – eat not one but two personal-sized pizzas because his family had given him a crisp $20 to spend. During the flight, we had rotated among our laps a pink box that held a <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/cooking/article/Recipe-Blum-s-Coffee-Crunch-Cake-12619995.php\">Blum’s coffee crunch cake</a>, a treat my mother had requested we bring back for her in memory of a childhood trip of her own.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As we sped down the freeway, my mother told us we wouldn’t be going home</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We got into the back seat of the car, the cake box on my lap damp with handprints, streetlights flickering over it, as we sped down the freeway. Then my mother looked up into the rearview mirror and told us we wouldn’t be going home.</p> <p>Our home wasn’t ours any more – she had planned for us to be away while she arranged a foreclosure. Our belongings had been put into storage and my cat stowed at my grandmother’s apartment, and we were living in an emergency shelter for homeless families. We settled for the night on beds that were covered with rubber sheets to protect the mattresses from urine. One of my siblings cried and wanted to go home. I felt the same way, although I don’t think I cried because I was too angry. I focused my anger on the cake, which couldn’t talk back and therefore seemed more capable of introspection and remorse than some adults of my acquaintance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7e00e80f195484ec2a44751438489ddc699c96e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7e00e80f195484ec2a44751438489ddc699c96e/0_0_642_799/402.jpg\" alt=\"‘I focused my anger on the cake’ … Hubbard, age 10, with her grandmother – and the pink box containing the “Blum’s” gift for her mother.\" width=\"402\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I focused my anger on the cake’ … Hubbard, age 10, with her grandmother – and the pink box containing the “Blum’s” gift for her mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We stayed at the emergency shelter through the autumn and into December. I started the year in a new school, and tried to make friends without telling anyone what was actually happening in my life, and deal with our new financial limitations. When my shoes broke, I bought a pair of white canvas trainers for 99 cents from a craft store, but when my toes broke through that pair too, I just gave up and accepted that I was the kid with holey shoes.</p> <p>Throughout the school day, and during the nights in the emergency shelter, I thought about our house. To my young mind, it was the solution to our predicament and not the symptom of it. Life there would mean a return to normality, never mind that normal had been knee-high grass and Kraft macaroni &amp; cheese from the rubbish-bag buffet. I desired the appearance of respectability and stability without having any expectation that what went on inside would be respectable or stable, and I didn’t care, because to be in my own room with a library book and a door that closed on the chaos outside was enough for me.</p> <p>I never returned to my home. It was no longer mine. New families bought and sold it, and other children staked their claims to the sledding hill and the bushes that glittered with blackberries on humid July days.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As an adult, I understand how a passionate sentimentality for a place can feel obliterating</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My house was no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/29/pemberley-manderley-howards-end-real-building-fictional-houses\">Manderley</a>, and yet still sometimes I go there in my dreams. Down the hill and past the tyre swing in the tall oak tree. Past the spigot that I put my mouth to after eating a hot pepper from the garden. Through the kitchen, which caused my parents to disagree even years after their divorce about whether the sink had a garbage disposal. (It did not.) And up the stairs to my room and a window looking out over a red Japanese maple tree.</p> <p>An elderly relative, who was born in Northern Ireland, once said that she never wanted to return to her childhood home, which had been the place of many happy memories and a family she loved. She didn’t want to see the changes that would have rendered it unfamiliar. In her mind, she could always walk the stone floors, which would never be covered with carpet, and if she had an apple tree in her back garden, it would remain there always.</p> <p>As an adult, I understand how a certain sort of passionate sentimentality for a place can feel obliterating. Even if my house were on the market again, and I could visit, undercover, as a prospective buyer, I would choose not to, though for different reasons to those of my elderly relative.</p> <p>It was a place where I was happy, until I wasn’t, and then I had to learn to let it go.</p> <p><em>Housebreaking, by Colleen Hubbard, £16.99, is published by Corsair.

I soon received a £60 penalty charge notice (PCN) for driving in a bus lane in Aberdeen. Not only can I prove I wasn’t in Scotland, the photo on the PCN shows a completely different car. I’ve appealed against the fine, but Enterprise has already deducted a £35 administration fee for providing Aberdeen council with my details. The local branch can’t help, there’s no phone number for contesting the fee, and my email hasn’t been answered.<br></strong><em><strong>FF, Stoke-on-Trent, West Midlands</strong></em></p> <p>It doesn’t require a forensic mind to detect that you are blameless. The car pictured on the PCN is white. The car you hired was black. Aberdeen council has now admitted to me that it made an error in noting the registration. Enterprise refunded the fee after I contacted its press office. It says: “Where there is an alleged traffic violation we rely on the information being passed to us by the relevant authority being correct. Details received from the council gave the registration of the vehicle which the customer had hired.”</p> <p>The registered keeper of a vehicle is liable to pay any fines and car hire companies are the registered keepers of their fleet. But they can pass the responsibility to the relevant driver, provided the customer signs an agreement to accept responsibility for PCNs incurred while they are at the wheel. The complication is that the registered keeper has to appeal against any fine issued. Enterprise is now appealing on your behalf, but not all hire companies are willing to take on the hassle.</p> <p><strong>AW</strong> of Bristol was as startled as you to receive a PCN after driving on the Tyne tunnel toll road in a car hired from Europcar. He paid the £1.90 charge by phone and a month later was informed by Europcar that it had paid a £30 fine from Tyne Tunnels (TT2) on his behalf, and was debiting the sum, plus £40 admin fee from his card.</p> <p>“TT2 said that Europcar would have to appeal on my behalf as I was not the registered keeper. Europcar gave me a third-party authorisation letter which it said would allow me to deal with TT2 directly. But TT2 replied that it had stopped accepting such letters last December.”</p> <p>After I got in touch with TT2 it liaised with Europcar and refunded the fine, which was issued because you misread one digit of the car registration when paying the toll.</p> <p>Philip Smith, chief executive of TT2, says: “Tyne tunnels bylaws oblige us to issue fines to the hire car company, and appeals also need to be initiated by the hire company. However, we recently became aware that a small number of hire companies are not making it easy for customers to use this appeal process, so we have reviewed the process and would like to offer drivers of hire vehicles the option of appealing fines directly with TT2.”</p> <p>Europcar confirmed that it does not appeal against fines on behalf of customers, but offers written waivers so they can do it themselves.</p> <p><strong>MT</strong> of Chester says he and his wife lost their chance to appeal against a PCN because it was sent to the wrong person. Private parking firm CP Plus had issued a £60 PCN in his name, but at the time of the alleged parking infringement MT was in hospital.</p> <p>Moreover, he is not the registered keeper of the vehicle, which belongs to his wife. “When I eventually left hospital and went through my mail, I wrote to CP Plus, informing them my wife is the registered keeper and was in charge of the vehicle at the time,” he writes. “The fine was paid in December and we heard nothing more until March when I received a letter from a debt recovery firm demanding payment of £110 with no explanation.</p> <p>“My wife informed them by phone and email that she was the registered keeper, but they sent another letter to me threatening court action. A week later, CP Plus acknowledged my wife’s payment in December, but claimed it had been received after the 14-day early payment discount deadline had passed, and so a further payment was required. The demands keep coming and it’s affecting my rehabilitation.”</p> <p>If the initial invoice had been sent to your wife, as it should have been, it could have been paid in time. The root of the problem seems to be that the dealer from whom you bought the car erroneously registered you as the keeper. The mistake was swiftly corrected last September and the V5 duly shows your wife’s details, but it would appear that the DVLA has issued the wrong details to CP Plus.</p> <p>CP Plus denies receiving any communications from you. “We rely on the DVLA and motorists to keep their information up to date, and therefore cannot accept responsibility if these details are incorrect,” it says. “However, as a gesture of goodwill, we will accept the £60 already paid with no extra charge.”</p> <p>The DVLA was contacted for a comment.</p> <p><em>Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

Now, my journey from carefree youth to cranky middle-age has taken on a new element: I’ve started to watch TV with subtitles on. I don’t know whether it’s my ageing ear, sound mixing or modern acting techniques, but actors seem to mumble a lot these days. And the background noise is often way louder than the dialogue. Not as loud as the ads, though. Those are, by design, significantly louder than the shows.</p> <p>Turns out I’m not quite over the hill yet: my TV-watching habits are all the rage among kids these days. A study <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59259964\" title=\"\">last November</a> found that four out of five viewers aged between 18 and 25 said they use subtitles “all or part of the time” compared with only a quarter of those aged between 56 and 75. There are various reasons for this, including the fact that the likes of Netflix have opened up the availability of non-English-language programming (which is one of the best things about streaming services), and have helped normalise subtitles for people who aren’t hard of hearing.</p> <p>There is also, of course, the fact that many of us now watch television while simultaneously staring at our phones. As one young person stated, in a recent piece titled <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/how-generation-z-became-obsessed-subtitles/\" title=\"\">“How generation Z became obsessed with subtitles”</a>, captions allow people to “flick their eyes up and read ahead, then take in the whole scene quickly, and look back down at their phone”. I’m not a gen-Zer, but I’m guilty as charged.</p> <p>Subtitles are also starting to become a creative medium in themselves, as the <a href=\"https://www.getblend.com/blog/how-stranger-things-subtitles-went-viral/\" title=\"\">much-memed captions</a> for Netflix’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/01/stranger-things-season-4-finale-review-netflix\" title=\"\">Stranger Things</a> demonstrate. The team behind descriptors such as “tentacles undulating moistly”, “wet footsteps squelch” and “unearthly susurration”, have said they worked hard to give hearing-impaired audiences a more <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2022/07/stranger-things-subtitles-captions-team-interview.html\" title=\"\">immersive experience</a> – but they’ve also added a fun new dimension for everyone else.

Add to that deeply discounted online fares – or the <a href=\"https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/rail-fares-and-tickets/leap-card\">Leap Card</a>, which offers even heftier price cuts – and now’s the time to discover Ireland’s most rail scenic journeys. We pick six epic trips that cover all corners of the country, from the Atlantic coast to the sunny south-east – as far as Northern Ireland’s dramatic shore.</p> <h2><strong>Rosslare to Dublin</strong></h2> <p>Look out of the window, and the County Wexford countryside is flat, an endless sky stretching far out over the water and marshy plains. This entire area of south-east Ireland lies below sea level, and the landscape itself is a feat of 18th-century engineering, when the local mud flats and a sprinkling of islands were drained and harnessed to become productive land, known as the Sloblands. They now offer a winter sanctuary for geese and swans from Iceland, Greenland and Siberia. It’s also the starting point of a two- to three-hour journey on one of Europe’s most scenic rail routes, rolling off from Rosslare Europort, Ireland’s south-easterly French and British ferry hub.</p> <p>Within 15 minutes, the church spires of Wexford Town appear over its brown brick-and-plaster-rendered architecture – the urban layout feels it straddles water and land as the train cuts through the harbour like a tram, in front of a bow-shaped quay lined with handsome three-storey buildings. The sea is on both sides – a statue of Commodore John Barry, a local man who is often credited as the father of the US navy, presides over the peaceful scene. He appears to challenge the town’s past as Ireland’s first port of call for bloodthirsty Vikings and Cromwellian troops. As the train slinks out of town, it casts a shadow over the<a href=\"https://www.irishheritage.ie/\"> Irish National Heritage Park</a>, where that turbulent history and invasions are explored in detail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"474c17d0f0956dcbedaadb092c6457fd12d4b51c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/474c17d0f0956dcbedaadb092c6457fd12d4b51c/169_0_5066_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A train emerges from a tunnel on the coastal railway line on the cliffs between Bray and Greystones in County Wicklow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A train emerges from a tunnel on the coastal railway line on the cliffs between Bray and Greystones in County Wicklow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alasabyss/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The train moves north and inland, but remains close to water as it curves and twists along the contours of the River Slaney. It reaches Enniscorthy – a striking, ancient Norman settlement – through a series of tunnels and a minimalist rail bridge. It’s the hometown of novelist Colm Tóibín – and regularly features as a setting in his books or movie adaptations (along with Curracloe Beach, near Wexford Town, which also landed a role in Saving Private Ryan<em> </em>– as the blood-stained Normandy landing site for troops on D-day). Just outside Enniscorthy, at Vinegar Hill, local rebel forces resisted British infantry during the notorious 1798 rebellion. The standoff lasted for a month, and that brief glimmer of triumph is narrated at the <a href=\"http://1798centre.ie/\">National 1798 Rebellion Centre</a> on Parnell Road.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jul/23/ireland-six-national-parks-guide\">Emerald heart: a guide to Ireland’s six national parks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the track runs farther north, past Arklow in County Wicklow, the scenery becomes positively Alpine. We pass over gushing streams and the track hugs high conifers as the train climbs higher and higher. It snakes around bends of pine and over old dry stone bridges before entering the Vale of Avoca – a lush valley where the Avonmore and Avonbeg unite at the Meeting of the Waters to become the Avoca river – and eventually stopping at Rathdrum. Just a short walk from the village is <a href=\"https://www.coillte.ie/site/avondale-forest-park/\">Avondale Estate and Forest</a>, the birthplace of politician and Home Rule pioneer Charles Stewart Parnell. The house is currently under extensive renovations but the great expanse of gardens reopened to the public last month.</p> <p>Farther north, the train leaves Wicklow Town and veers east, trundling parallel with the pebbled coastline. To the left, marshlands are alive with kingfishers and egrets as far as the fertile, rolling hills that shape the horizon. On the approach to Greystones, lone figures walk the beach and, in town, charming restaurants like the<a href=\"https://thehappypear.ie/church-road-cafe/\"> Happy Pear</a>, a plant based cafe and bakery, line the streets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>As the track runs further north, past Arklow, the scenery becomes positively Alpine</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From Greystones, Bray Head approaches, a high rocky peninsula that juts into the Irish Sea. The train offers soaring views over crashing white-crested waves and sandy coves. It darts between tunnels, emerging into blinding sunlight that heralds yet another dramatic coastal view, more spectacular than the last, then grinds to a halt at Bray. From here, passengers can continue on to Dublin city centre with a handful of stops, or board the DART commuter service that meanders and halts at idyllic seaside towns such as Dalkey or Killiney.<br><em>Book at <a href=\"https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/\">Irish Rail</a>, from €7.49 single</em></p> <h2>Cork to Cobh</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2c875a47373b8ce52be52d557b47ae61c2423d2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c875a47373b8ce52be52d557b47ae61c2423d2e/0_0_5796_3479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cobh, County Cork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cobh, County Cork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joana Kruse/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This 24-minute train journey departs from Kent station in the city, but in that brief time the tracks offer spectacular seaside settings as far as Cobh, a very picturesque town on one of the world’s largest natural harbours.

On 7 April, Archie Battersbee was 12 years old, and uncomplicatedly alive. He was a talented gymnast, and an enthusiastic follower of mixed martial arts, and he wanted to be baptised. He had a pet rabbit called Simian. He was meant to be going to see Batman that evening.</p> <p>That day, Archie suffered a catastrophic brain injury. In the months since, whether he is alive has been a devastatingly difficult – and contested – question. His parents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, say that although he is not conscious he is still alive, and want him to be kept on a ventilator and a feeding tube until he dies a “natural” death.</p> <p>But doctors and courts have consistently taken a different view. Staff at the Royal London hospital say that because Archie has no prospect of consciousness, and cannot breathe for himself, he has died. A judge concluded that he died at noon on 31 May based on MRI scans that day, and on appeal, another ruled that continuing ventilation was not in his best interests. Yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/aug/02/archie-battersbee-parents-fail-to-stop-planned-withdrawal-of-life-support-treatment\">a last-minute appeal to the supreme court failed</a>. Now the Christian Legal Centre, which is supporting the family, says it is preparing an application to the European court of human rights. If it does not do so by 9am today, treatment will finally be withdrawn at 11am.</p> <p>Behind the disagreements and technicalities that led to this point are a set of profound questions about what constitutes life, how to decide when it is over, and who can best represent the interests of a child. For today’s newsletter, I’ve spoken to Prof Dominic Wilkinson, director of medical ethics at Oxford University’s Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, about how hard those questions are to resolve – and how best to handle them without diminishing the value of the life that everybody wishes could go on. First, here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Taiwan</strong></em> | China said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit-speaker-pledges-us-solidarity-tsai-in-wen-china-military-drills\">it will begin live fire drills close to Taiwan on Thursday</a> in response to a visit from US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said in a press conference with president Tsai Ing-wen that the US is “committed to the security” of the island.

Truss claimed there had been “wilful misrepresentation” after it emerged that her promise to save £8.8bn would mean deep cuts for teachers and nurses.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Energy </strong></em>| Bumper profits of nearly £50bn shared by the world’s five biggest oil companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/02/big-oil-profits-energy-bills-windfall-tax\">prompted calls for higher taxes on the sector</a>. BP was accused of “unfettered profiteering” after it said underlying profits had tripled to $8.5bn (£6.9bn) between April and June.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Anglicanism </strong></em>| Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the Anglican church, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/02/justin-welby-affirms-validity-of-1998-declaration-that-gay-sex-is-a-sin\">sought to mollify conservative bishops around the world</a> by “affirming the validity” of a 1998 declaration that gay sex is a sin. He also indicated he would not seek to discipline churches that conduct same-sex marriage.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Migration | </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/02/uk-asylum-seeker-plans-under-fire-as-record-numbers-cross-channel\">696 people tried to cross the channel</a> on Monday, a record high for the year. The total number of asylum seekers making this journey across the channel this year is believed to be more than 17,000.

Disagreements happen, serious disagreements are uncommon, and intractable disagreements are very rare.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>What should happen when there is disagreement?</p> <p>It isn’t surprising if parents find it hard to absorb such dreadful news. “These are the most difficult conversations anybody could ever have to have,” said Wilkinson. But there are some things that can help: “To have this conversation with somebody the parents know and trust, ideally. To have private space. To know what the parents’ existing understanding is. To compassionately explain the facts and any uncertainties. To understand from the parents what their priorities are, and what their fears are. And on the basis of all of that, to find a way forward.”</p> <p>If agreement still cannot be reached, mediators or the view of a clinical ethics committee may help. (The government is said to be considering an expanded role for mediation in the future.) Only when such avenues fail does a court become involved. By this point, there is a chance that relations between hospital and family will be difficult.</p> <p>“It may help to try to think about the courts not as adversarial, but as another way to try to resolve a very difficult impasse: ‘Because we can’t reach an agreement, we need somebody to help us,’” Wilkinson said. “This impartial third party will hear what you have to say, and what we have to say. We’ll hear experts that we can find, and if you would like experts that you find, we’ll hear them too. And then we’ll absolutely respect whatever the decision is.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>What is the court’s role?</p> <p>It’s difficult to read the various judgments in this case and not conclude that judges have tried very hard to keep the value of Archie’s life, and the perspective of his heartbroken parents, central to their thinking. </p> <p>In one passage, Mrs Justice Arbuthnot <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Archie-Batteresbee-judgment-2-1.pdf\">wrote of a visit to his bedside</a>. “A lovely looking young boy, Archie seemed very peaceful despite the fact that he was connected to a number of tubes and medical equipment,” she wrote. “From what I know, the mother has hardly left his side in the eight weeks since his accident. I saw the bedside chair which converts into a single bed which she has been sleeping on.” She says that “the devotion of the family is extraordinary, their dignity obvious”, and concludes: “The visit has allowed me to hold Archie in my mind’s eye … He has become much more real to me.”</p> <p>At the same time, the court is asked to consider Archie’s “best interests”. “It’s not a very helpful term, in some ways,” said Wilkinson. “What anybody is desperately trying to achieve is what’s <em>best</em> for the child. And it is very difficult to come to terms with when it might mean his death.”</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/01/archie-battersbee-another-tragedy-highlights-need-for-independent-mediation-in-cases-of-children?CMP=share_btn_tw\">this excellent analysis by the Guardian’s legal affairs correspondent Haroon Siddique</a> sets out, that may be harder still when third parties with their own agendas become involved in the legal process.</p> <p>Questions over what constitutes death can be complicated; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/02/archie-battersbee-ethical-decisions-experts-patients\">Mehrunisha Suleman writes</a> that they reveal “medicine more as an art than a science”. In this case, the usual test for “brain death” was impossible to conduct. But the evidence presented to the court by the doctors who have examined Archie is that he has no prospect of regaining consciousness or being able to breathe independently. Wilkinson wrote <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2022/06/archie-battersbee-how-the-court-reached-its-conclusion/\">in a blogpost</a> that there “is good reason to think that Archie has indeed died according to the UK code of practice”.</p> <p>The courts have agreed with Archie’s doctors that, although he is unable to feel pain, his continuing treatment is causing unjustifiable physical deterioration that ultimately threatens his dignity – and, since there is “no hope at all of recovery”, it is not in his best interests to continue. In other words, as Mr Justice Hayden said in the high court: treatment now “serves only to protract his death, whilst being unable to prolong his life”. </p> <p>His family continue to view this as an imposition of a concept of “dignity in death” which goes against their son’s burgeoning Christian beliefs. “Enforcing it on us and hastening his death for that purpose is profoundly cruel,” Hollie Dance said.</p> <p>***</p> <p>What happens now?</p> <p>Unlike other cases such as that of Charlie Gard, the issue here is not whether to attempt a new life-saving treatment, albeit with little chance of success, but whether to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, as the hospital says should happen, or maintain the current course until he dies, in Archie’s parents’ term, a “natural” death. (That word, says Wilkinson, does not have an agreed definition but appears to be “a way for their legal team to frame what the parents are asking for in a way the court might find acceptable.”)</p> <p>Yesterday, Archie’s life support was due to be withdrawn at midday. That was delayed when the family lodged a supreme court appeal; the family says it will make a last-minute application to the European court of human rights to stop it going ahead at 11am today. Such circumstances can place a considerable burden on the medical professionals involved, and while the court of appeal <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Dance-Battersbee-v-Barts-NHS-Trust-and-another.pdf\">noted in July</a> that Archie’s mother reported a “brilliant” relationship with nurses, the original June judgment said that those “who have 24-hour care of Archie who have found the recent weeks an ethical strain that they have struggled with”.</p> <p>In those circumstances, said Wilkinson, and however difficult it may be, “healthcare teams have to try very hard to maintain a compassionate, supportive relationship with parents”, whose suffering, in the end, vastly outweighs any other interests – except those of Archie himself. “I don’t think, in this case, there is any shred of doubt,” said Wilkinson. “There is no way of avoiding what lies ahead in this very sad process, and nothing to do except try to give him some dignity and peace at the end of his life.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p>With <strong>oil and gas profits</strong> still growing exponentially,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/02/oil-industry-record-profits-climate-crisis\"> Hamilton Nolan emphatically explains</a> that if we all don’t actively dismantle the oil industry, it will destroy us. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>“Are men 10 times better at painting than women?” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/02/painting-gender-pay-gap-recalculating-art\">asks Mary Ann Sieghart</a> – and while the question might seem like a rhetorical one, the <strong>art market</strong> implies that the answer is “yes”.

We’re also seeing a big rise in ‘corrective rape’.”</p> <p>She describes a recent case she worked on where three women in their 30s were raped and robbed by six men. In another incident, a 15-year-old girl was raped by men who said the girl was a lesbian. Many rapes are not reported, as they are committed by family members or people within their own community.</p> <p>“Just the introduction of the bill has meant a lot of ignorant people in the country act as though it has been passed,” she says. “And people see it as giving permission that LGBTQ+ people should now be killed, should be abused, should be stopped in any way they want to.”</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2021/08/03/anti-lgbt-bill-laid-in-ghana-parliament/\">“anti-LGBT bill” introduced in Ghana last August</a> and currently under review by a parliamentary committee, would be one of the harshest and most sweeping of such laws in Africa. </p> <p>The current draft of the bill, proposed by opposition MPs and publicly backed by officials in President Nana Akufo-Addo’s government and ruling New Patriotic party, criminalises gay and queer acts or identifying as a LGBTQ+ person, punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment.</p> <p>It also criminalises any form of advocacy for LGBTQ+ people with up to 10 years in prison. Anyone who hosts advocate groups or meetings on their premises or website would also be criminally liable. Anyone witness to or aware of acts made criminal in the bill would also be forced to report them, according to the bill.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a party where 30 people were arrested for being gay.

But the current content of the wide-ranging bill has itself sent a signal in Ghana. Public hysteria over LGBTQ+ people and those advocating for their rights has become intense over the past 18 months.</p> <p>In February last year, a community centre offering support for gay and queer people and a place for them to meet was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/25/lgbtq-ghanaians-under-threat-after-backlash-against-new-support-centre\">forced to close</a> amid attacks from politicians, civil and religious groups and the media. While it was not the first amenity of its kind, it was the most high profile, as it was announced without the usual discretion that LGBTQ+ rights groups typically use to operate within Ghana.</p> <p>The presence of foreign and European diplomats at the opening of the centre was also seen as provocative as it is often claimed that gay and queer identity is against African culture and is being promoted by the west.</p> <p>Alex Donkor, who founded the LGBT+ Rights Ghana group, which opened the centre, said reported attacks had increased, especially outside Accra, with regular raids on suspected gatherings of LGBTQ+ people.</p> <p>“There was a party last month where 30 people were arrested for being gay; they were detained and extorted by police,” he says. “It’s just an example of the kind of thing we are seeing often.”</p> <p>Leila was among 21 people arrested last March in the city of Ho, at a training event for paralegals helping minorities. They were detained for months, with some subject to abuse by officers before they were released.</p> <p>“It has been over a year but I’m still struggling to pick up the pieces of my life,” she says. “We came out, then we were hit with the anti-LBGTQ+ bill, and it feels like my life is on pause. If you’re a queer person, it’s like the bill is about erasing your existence.”</p> <p>The parliamentary review committee has been holding public hearings since late last year, from groups in favour and opposing the bill.</p> <p>Rita Nketiah, a researcher on women’s and LGBTQ+ rights at Human Rights Watch, says that while the bill is expected to pass, the hearings have been important in shaping what the bill would look like.</p> <p>“It has given advocacy groups a rare opportunity to make their case openly and directly to parliament,” she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jul/13/arrested-abused-and-accused-wave-of-repression-targets-lgbt-ghanaians\">Arrested, abused and accused: wave of repression targets LGBT+ Ghanaians</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It has been made clear by the parliamentary review committee that the bill itself will not be stopped, but what is up for debate is the content of the bill. They want to make sure it stands the test of time.”</p> <p>The bill showed the ignorance of MPs around issues of gender and sexuality, including about intersex people, whose vulnerability has come into sharper focus over the past year.</p> <p>Last year, police in Ho arrested an intersex woman, stripped her in public at the police station and questioned her gender. Officers accused her of denying being a man, and then detained her in male cells and encouraged the men in the cell to “rape her since she says she is a woman, and that perhaps that would clear the doubts from her sick mind”.</p> <p>Sam George, an MP and prominent advocate of the anti-LGBTQ+ bill in Ghanaian media, has defended the bill and the right of the state to force intersex people to undergo corrective surgery.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/jun/08/global-dispatch-sign-up-for-a-different-world-view\">Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter</a> – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4146\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Global Dispatch\" data-form-description=\"Get our fortnightly email of editors' picks and the biggest headlines\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email</figcaption> </figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2022/aug/03/explainer-what-makes-ghana-draft-anti-gay-lgbtq-bill-so-extreme","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T05:30:18Z","webTitle":"Explainer: what makes Ghana’s anti-gay bill so extreme?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/03/explainer-what-makes-ghana-draft-anti-gay-lgbtq-bill-so-extreme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/aug/03/explainer-what-makes-ghana-draft-anti-gay-lgbtq-bill-so-extreme","fields":{"headline":"Explainer: what makes Ghana’s anti-gay bill so extreme?","trailText":"A closer look at what exactly the proposed Promotion of proper human sexual rights and Ghanaian family values bill contains","byline":"Emmanuel Akinwotu west Africa correspondent","body":"<p>Same-sex “conduct” is already illegal in Ghana, but MPs introduced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/aug/02/will-ghana-introduce-some-of-the-harshest-anti-gay-laws-in-the-world\">sweeping new anti-LGBTQ+ draft bill</a> a year ago that would fully criminalisie LGBTQ+ people, along with rights groups and anyone coming out in their support.</p> <p>It comes amid an outcry around the very existence of LGBTQ+ people in the west African country, and any advocacy on their behalf.</p> <p>The bill is under review by a parliamentary committee and may yet be amended. If passed in its current form, rights groups say it could spark a witch-hunt of sexual minorities, advocacy groups and “allies”, forcing the public to report on their activities.</p> <p>Here are some of the main measures, with excerpts from the bill itself:</p> <h2><strong>A clampdown on LGBTQ+ identity</strong></h2> <p>The law would criminalise, with up to five years in prison, identifying as a LGBTQ+ person, having a gay relationship or intercourse.</p> <p>Marrying or intending to marry someone who has had gender reassignment surgery would also be criminalised, with up to five years in prison.</p> <p>The bill also addresses “gross indecency in public”. Any public show of affection between people of the same sex, or where one or some of the people involved identify as a gender different to their sex, or have had sex reassignment, would also be criminalised.</p> <p>It would also criminalise “cross-dressing”, enabling prosecution of anyone dressing in a way perceived as different from their biological sex.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Such acts mean a public show of amorous relations between or among persons of the same sex, or where one or more of the persons involved have undergone gender or sex reassignment and intentional cross-dressing to portray a gender different from a gender assigned at birth to the person, with intent to engage in an act prohibited under the bill … is liable on summary conviction to a term of imprisonment of not less than six months and not more than one year</em></p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Intersex corrective surgery</strong></h2> <p>A clause targets intersex people, and would allow the state to recommend “corrective therapy” or surgery. It is not clear whether this could be forced. A medical practitioner would judge what binary sex should be assigned.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The </em><em>government is empowered to liaise with an approved service provider to provide assistance in the form of therapy or any other assistance relevant to the circumstance, to persons who may be questioning their sex or for a parent whose child is intersex in order to, where necessary, assist the parent realign the child to the appropriate binary designation as determined by a medical practitioner</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Leila, a queer activist in Ghana, says the intersex clause is particularly chilling. “It is scary that they could force intersex people to do surgery. It shows they are ignorant around these issues. They see it all as a threat.”</p> <h2><strong>Allies and advocates</strong></h2> <p>Any LGBTQ+ “allies”, whether individuals or advocacy and support groups, could be prosecuted and face up to five years in prison.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>(A) person commits an offence if the person holds out as a lesbian, a gay, a transgender, a transsexual, a queer, a pansexual, an ally …</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Any person or group seen as “promoting” identities or acts prohibited in the bill, or campaigning to support the rights of LGBTQ+ people, could face even tougher terms of up to 10 years in prison.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>A person who</em><em> publishes or distributes a material for purposes of promoting an activity prohibited under the Bill</em><em> is liable on summary conviction to a term of imprisonment of not less than five years and not more than </em><em>10 years. Clause 12 also prohibits a person from engaging or participating in an activity that promotes, supports sympathy for or a change of public opinion</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Gideon Adjaka, director of <a href=\"https://hopealliancegh.org/\">Ghana’s Hope Alliance Foundation</a>, says the bill would criminalise any form of advocacy or aid for sexual minorities. “It’s very extreme. It would shut down the advocacy space, so that even providing assistance or even simply arguing for better treatment is illegal.” </p> <h2><strong>A duty to report</strong></h2> <p>Anyone made aware of gay acts who fails to report them could also be criminalised. This could also lead to witch-hunts, say rights groups.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Clause 5 imposes an obligation on a person in whose presence an offence specified in the </em><em>bill is committed to report the commission of the offences to the police, or in the absence of the police, political leaders, opinion leaders or customary leaders in the community</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Shone Apong, a paralegal and advocate for minorities in Ghana, says the bill is an attack on the existence of anyone believed to be gay or queer. “It is saying not only can you not exist, but we don’t want to hear about you in any way. Everywhere you show up, you can be found out. It makes all LGBTQ+ people targets, which we’re already seeing everywhere in Ghana.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/03/ghana-anti-lgbtq-bill-blamed-for-rise-in-attacks\">‘Erasing our existence’: Ghana’s anti-LGBTQ+ bill blamed for rise in attacks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The parliamentary committee reviewing the bill will send it back to MPs for amendments before a second reading in parliament and a vote.

At 44 years old, I am of the generation who knew about Aids before we even knew about sex; from childhood, I conflated sexuality and fear. PrEP was a gamechanger in taking that fear away.</p> <p>But last week, HIV was not much on my mind, and almost as soon as the physician’s assistant closed the door, I burst into tears.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From childhood, I conflated sexuality and fear</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My doctor’s office is staffed almost entirely by gay people seeing gay patients, and the PA, like everyone there, was very kind. I told him that I hadn’t had much sex lately because I was concerned about monkeypox. Even though I had no fever, and even though I often get heat rash in the summer, I was terrified that some skin bumps could be monkeypox.</p> <p>Because he was so nice, I blabbered on that I would <em>never</em> tell anyone <em>else</em> to feel bad if they contracted <em>any</em> infection. But my book was coming out the following week, and it was <em>about</em> viruses, and<em> what if I had to cancel my launch because I had contracted a virus?</em></p> <p>The PA very sweetly talked me through my feelings and told me that while he didn’t think I had monkeypox, we could do a test if I wanted. He also kindly, but very firmly, told me not to feel bad about feeling bad.</p> <p>“We are all on the edge,” he said – him, me, every gay man we both knew. “It’s been a lot, for all of us.”</p> <p>I realized in that moment how lucky I am to have a gay doctor’s office to take my body and my feelings seriously. And I realized how angry I was that, for the third time in my life, a viral pandemic was dictating my sex life, shaping my professional life, messing with my head, and keeping me from experiencing intimacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f80b39538966175f1a668925eebbade9799d443a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f80b39538966175f1a668925eebbade9799d443a/0_134_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sign says ‘release the vax’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest in San Francisco last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Haven Daley/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am, of course, not alone in this. HIV, Sars-CoV-2 and now hMPXV – the virus responsible for monkeypox in humans – have all upended people’s lives, but their effects have not been felt equally. In all three cases, LGBTQ+ people were <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/12/16/covid-lgbtq-people-feeling-disproportionate-impacts-pandemic/3889397001/\">disproportionately affected</a>.</p> <p>This is the result of a few related factors, all of them closely linked to societal stigma. One is that LGBTQ+ people are, on average, <a href=\"https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-poverty-us/\">more likely to be poor</a> than straight people and thus more likely to be subjected to the confluence of conditions (incarceration, unemployment, a lack of insurance) that produce a viral underclass. Second, queer people <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2021-05-26/few-states-require-lgbtq-inclusive-sex-education#:~:text=Few%20States%20Require%20LGBTQ%2DInclusive%20Sex%20Education%2C%20Report%20Finds,according%20to%20a%20new%20report.&amp;text=May%2026%2C%202021%2C%20at%204%3A57%20p.m.&amp;text=Reps.\">do not get</a> a good sexual health education, nor access to queer-specific health resources. And third, gay men have, on average, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3334840/\">more</a> sexual partners than straight people. Even when coupled, gay men are more likely to be <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2906147/\">openly non-monogamous</a>.</p> <p>This is nothing to be ashamed of; being trans or gay is <em>good, </em>and queer sex is good. But many people – even many queer people – have internalized the idea that contracting (or even talking about) STIs is bad, shameful and should be hidden.</p> <p>I’ve studied viruses as a journalist, social scientist, and professor of sexual health for more than a decade. Many viruses, including HIV, HPV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/default.htm\">categorized as STIs by the CDC</a> despite being transmitted in a variety of ways. In some places, a large percentage or outright majority of HIV cases now transmit via injection drug use. But a major way these pathogens still transmit is <em>sexually</em>, and it’s important to name that so that people having sex can know how to protect themselves and their partners.</p> <p>For the same reasons, the emerging monkeypox epidemic should be talked about as an STI, particularly in light of new <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-072410\">research</a> from the current London outbreak and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/07/28/1114183886/a-doctor-in-nigeria-tried-to-warn-the-world-that-monkeypox-had-become-a-global-t\">scandalously overlooked</a> research into the <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214229\">2017 outbreak</a> in Nigeria that suggests monkeypox may have mutated to allow for transmission through genital secretion. This does not mean that hMPXV can only be transmitted sexually, but it acknowledges that gay sex is a major way such pathogens move.</p> <p>Shame should not be a factor in these discussions. “Viruses are not conscious,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pedroalonsoserr/status/1551014015853371392\">said</a> Pedro Serrano, a public health researcher. “They simply follow the mechanistic drive to replicate.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27a715497988235e45beea1d2d77bb196a5dc269\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27a715497988235e45beea1d2d77bb196a5dc269/0_139_2853_1711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"people walk with banner that says san francisco aids fund\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A San Francisco march in 1983.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Viruses may not be conscious, but those who choose to punish us for contracting them certainly are. In America, an established (and currently ascendant) political movement exists to punish certain classes of people – trans people, women, gay people, those trying to prevent pregnancy – for having sex.</p> <p>While monkeypox is threatening to repeat the patterns of the past, it is worth remembering that for gay men, this is not our first rodeo. We have loved one another and formed connections even as police officers, bosses, educators, viruses and families of origin have tried to keep us apart. It is wearying having to ask ourselves, once again: are intimacy and sex worth the risk? Still, now is the time to remember or learn anew that queer men of all ages have been doing this for decades.</p> <h2>Gay sexual intimacy, interrupted</h2> <p>After the Stonewall Riots of 1969, there was a brief window of time when queer men could have a lot of sex with relatively little worry.</p> <p>But then, in the early 1980s, reports trickled in that young gay men were becoming marked by purple lesions and falling ill to an extremely rare form of cancer that usually only affected older men near the Mediterranean Sea. The era of Aids was upon us.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/26/monkeypox-gay-communities-vaccines-health-messages\">Saying monkeypox is tearing through communities of queer men isn’t stigmatising – being afraid to say it is | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To Ash Kotak, monkeypox lesions were reminiscent of those purple Kaposi sarcoma<em> </em>lesions that he saw on loved ones when the Aids pandemic began. A London-based playwright who leads the campaign for the Aids Memorial in London, Kotak lost a “boyfriend, ex-boyfriend and many friends” to Aids and has been living with HIV himself since 1993.</p> <p>“My friends and so many died due to a lack of an early response in the USA and the UK,” he told me. “The issue now is like then: the response is woefully inadequate with the same shaming of gay men, and blaming, too.”</p> <p>Gay men responded to HIV by beginning to use an old technology that had previously been limited to straight people seeking to prevent pregnancy: condoms. Through peer-to-peer education, gay people taught each other how to have sex and intimacy in a safer way, saving countless lives. They also saved millions of lives when, through activism by the group Act Up, they upended the process for drug trials, paving the way for antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for Aids and creating the medical architecture that was used to rapidly develop Covid-19 vaccines decades later.</p> <p>The development of those ARVs meant that by 1996, “you didn’t need to die of Aids”, says Thomas Strong, a friend of mine and a Dublin-based American anthropologist and HIV activist who has been living with HIV since 2006 without any health problems.</p> <p>“Then the question becomes, ‘How important is sex? Is it worth <em>any</em> risk?” Strong says, noting that the decline of nearly all Covid mitigation protocols suggests that, for our governments, “the economy is worth the risk”.</p> <p>“Is sexual intimacy worth the risk?” he asks. “It’s in this context of values that vice is structured.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4816409da3e42d437c7d339472e80ee9373781d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4816409da3e42d437c7d339472e80ee9373781d/0_85_4489_2693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"blue prep pills\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PrEP revolutionized the fight against HIV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPA-EFE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ARVs have been so effective that when properly medicated, people living with HIV cannot pass HIV onward to sex partners. And the medication has been tweaked so that HIV-negative people can proactively avoid the virus, too. In 2012, PrEP was approved by the FDA, allowing people like me to enjoy sex with more intimacy and less fear. And since people on PrEP are required to get tested every few months, the drug also created an architecture for detecting and treating other STIs.</p> <p>PrEP liberated younger gay men and other queer and trans people from the stress and fear around sex that remained even after the development of ARVs.</p> <p>Jafet, a 27-year-old graduate student from Los Angeles who asked not to be identified by his full name, told me that when he first moved to San Francisco for college, having sex without a condom would fill him with terror and anxiety. When sexual partners taught him about PrEP, which he has now taken for six years, he felt liberated.</p> <p>“I felt so privileged,” he said. “A generation before me didn’t have this freedom and luxury to enjoy sexuality without worry. And I felt lucky to be gay. I didn’t have to worry about a disease that is treatable but incurable, <em>and</em> I didn’t have to worry about pregnancy.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/23/i-literally-screamed-out-loud-in-pain-my-two-weeks-of-monkeypox-hell\">‘I literally screamed out loud in pain’: my two weeks of monkeypox hell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jarret, a 21-year-old from Idaho who also asked not to be identified by his full name, told me that he had never had sex without PrEP.

He had 50 lesions on his body. At times, it was so painful, he wanted to be hospitalized.</p> <p>Monkeypox has brought up a fear he once expressed to me about his HIV diagnosis: “I am terrified that no one will ever touch me again.” But in conversations he’s had on Grindr – “I’m still flirting and chatting, even though I’m quarantining” – he has been pleasantly surprised that some gay men have said: “Well, I’ll see you in a few weeks when you’re better.”</p> <p>“Our love of sex is going to save us,” he told me. “It’s going to teach us how to be human in an epidemic that wants to keep us apart”.</p> <h2>Refusing to be part of a viral underclass</h2> <p>The fight for our sexual freedoms is not without its enemies.

But in the specific case of Taiwan, the war is not being mongered by the United States. It’s acts of imperialist aggression from China. For those familiar with complexities of Taiwan situation, we understand US support as a deterrent to war.”</p> <p>The United States has long maintained a stance of “strategic ambiguity” regarding Taiwan. That policy, established in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, does not officially take a position on the status of Taiwan but offers it “substantial but non-diplomatic relations”, including military support. US officials rarely visit Taiwan – the last high-ranking official to step foot on the island was the then House speaker, Newt Gingrich, in 1997.</p> <p>The ambiguity is designed to prevent armed conflict between Chinese and Taiwanese authorities, whose predecessors fought over control of mainland China during the Chinese civil war until 1949, when Mao’s Chinese Communist party forced the ruling Kuomintang to retreat to Taiwan.</p> <p>Since then, authorities in Beijing have claimed ownership over Taiwan, despite never ruling the island. Meanwhile, Taiwan developed from a dictatorship into an advanced democracy, but decades of international pressure from Beijing has kept Taiwan out of international bodies like the UN and <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/world/taiwan-who-coronavirus-china/\">WHO</a>, and left just a handful of countries that officially recognize Taiwan.</p> <p>That ambiguity can be confusing even to Taiwanese Americans.</p> <p>“When I was growing up, I kept hearing that the US agrees with China’s position that Taiwan is a part of China,” says Jessica Drun, a non-resident fellow at the Global China Hub of the Atlantic Council, a pro-Nato thinktank. “It wasn’t until I came to DC that I was able to parse out the truth that fundamentally the US does not take a position on Taiwan’s status.”</p> <p>Drun warned that China would use Pelosi’s visit to “shift the blame of any escalation or actions they take against Taiwan on to the United States, for supposedly violating the [‘One China’ principle]”.</p> <p>“It’s important for us to push back on that narrative – we’ve never agreed.”</p> <p>Others hope that the Biden administration might be able to help create a new paradigm for the debate around Taiwan’s future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/02/pelosi-taiwan-trip-political-reaction-democrats-republicans\">Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan trip puts US analysts and Democrats on edge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Albert Wu, a Taiwanese American historian based in Taipei, believes Pelosi’s visit is a “huge deal symbolically”. But the framing of the story around US-China conflict repeats a common problem in western stories about Taiwan: it erases Taiwan’s perspective.</p> <p>“Even in the coverage of this Pelosi situation, which has brought so much attention to Taiwan, there’s just very little about what the actors in Taiwan are actually thinking. The narrative is, still, you need the US to come in and save Taiwan.”</p> <p>Instead, he would like to see a <a href=\"https://ampleroad.substack.com/p/on-pelosis-would-be-visit-to-taiwan\">rethinking of international relations</a> where Taiwan has a say in its future. “If the Biden administration could say, ‘OK, let’s try to get all of us on talking terms,’ or even try to broker some sort of conversation, I feel like that would be so much more exciting to people in Taiwan.”</p> <p>Still, Wu is wary of how supporters of Taiwanese independence have shown a willingness to ally with certain American politicians based on their hawkishness towards China.</p> <p>“I feel very uncomfortable that we have to rely on people like Mike Pompeo for security, and they have no qualms about it. They’re like, ‘Anybody who supports Taiwanese independence, or anybody who even is willing to toe the line and be a little bit more belligerent and in your face with China, that is an ally.’”</p> <p>Recent polling suggests the overwhelming majority of Taiwanese people support maintaining the status quo, a position shared by Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, who has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51104246\">said</a>: “We don’t have a need to declare ourselves an independent state. We are an independent country already.” Shiah, who grew up in Detroit and has lived in Taiwan and the US as an adult, generally agrees.</p> <p>Strategic ambiguity should not threaten China, Shiah said, as the policy helps keep lines of dialogue open on all sides. But in recent years, top officials in Beijing have grown hostile to ambiguity, declaring that China has “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/22/biden-suggests-us-would-defend-taiwan-against-china-forcing-fresh-white-house-clarification\">no room for concessions</a>” over its goal of taking over Taiwan. Shiah worries that American hysteria over Pelosi’s visit will only further vindicate China’s intolerance for ambiguity – which increases the risk of war.</p> <p>What makes things tricky is that non-Taiwanese people find it hard to understand how ambiguity could not only be desirable, but sustainable, Shiah said.</p> <p>“Many Americans – even a lot of Asian Americans – can’t imagine living in strategic ambiguity forever. I remember after the election of Donald Trump, a lot of people felt so much uncertainty about their political future and were experiencing really intense mental health problems and anxiety. But everyone I know in Taiwan has always lived in a place of political uncertainty about the future. Life has to go on.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/03/specieswatch-meadow-grasshopper-uk-flourishing-flightless-jumper","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T05:00:20Z","webTitle":"Specieswatch: meadow grasshopper – UK’s flourishing flightless jumper ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/03/specieswatch-meadow-grasshopper-uk-flourishing-flightless-jumper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/03/specieswatch-meadow-grasshopper-uk-flourishing-flightless-jumper","fields":{"headline":"Specieswatch: meadow grasshopper – UK’s flourishing flightless jumper ","trailText":"At this time of year, numbers peak for this amazing insect, which can leap to 20 times its height","byline":"Paul Brown","body":"<p>One of the delights of a dry summer is the proliferation of grasshoppers – or perhaps we are just more likely to see them.

They are generally green with a stripe, but sometimes brown and even purple. Numbers peak at this time of year. The slightly smaller males can be seen rubbing their legs against their useless wings to create a “song” to attract the females, which are up to an inch long.

I wait for him to peel off the droopy horseshoe moustache as well, but that turns out to be his.</p> <p>Rehab is Allen’s first musical, though his career has always been music-adjacent. In true punk style, his band the Atoms split up after their debut single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDztZqP8erg\">Max Bygraves Killed My Mother</a>. He co-wrote New Order’s soccer anthem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/01/david-squires-on-the-story-of-world-in-motion\">World in Motion</a>, as well as the rowdy Fat Les singalong <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va6nPu-1auE\">Vindaloo</a>, and cut a gay reggae record under the name <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5MmTub0Wik\">Sex Boots Dread</a>.

Why did the writers – Grant Black, Murray Lachlan Young and Elliot Davis – not set it today? “Do you know what? I don’t know. Why <em>is</em> it set in the 1990s?” I assumed it was because of Allen’s own associations with that decade. You can hardly include a show-stopper called Simply Everyone’s Taking Cocaine and not ask Keith Allen to perform it. “Don’t be mad!” he laughs. “It wasn’t written for me. I love the idea, though.”</p> <p>Allen snorted his first line in the late 1980s when he was pitching a script to UB40. He wanted the band to star in The Yob, a comedy he had written for the Comic Strip Presents… series on Channel 4 in which he played a pretentious, beret-wearing video director who accidentally merges, The Fly-style, with a soccer hooligan. “I’d never done coke before. I remember thinking, ‘Fuck, that’s expensive.’ I cut these lines out, then Ali Campbell snorted the lot and I panicked: ‘I’ll phone an ambulance!’ He said, ‘What you on about?’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2ecd25123128185c692afb20320575a1a14e0af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2ecd25123128185c692afb20320575a1a14e0af/0_1662_3866_2318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allen … ‘Was it worth it?

In Allen’s autobiography <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/sep/18/keith-allen-interview\">Grow Up</a>, he notes that the drug “introduced me to the hours between 4am and 10am.” He did a “massive” line before coming up with the “En-ger-land!” bit from World in Motion. Did coke help his creativity? “Nooo. That all goes out the window. Cocaine’s great for talking to yourself but it stops you listening.” Does he still take it? “Not so you’d notice. If I do it nowadays, it’s for the right reasons.” Which are? “Well, why not?” Being 68 makes a difference, he says. “As you get older, time rushes past. A hangover can cost you a day. It’s not worth it.”</p> <p>He is settled now in Stroud with the actor Tamzin Malleson, whom he met in 2004 on the medical drama Bodies, and their 15-year-old daughter. Is he prone to look back on his wild years with fondness? “I stop myself doing that because there’s always a voice going, ‘Was it worth it?’ In career terms, it probably wasn’t.”</p> <p>Allen claims not to even think of what he has as a career. “I’m amazed when people go, ‘I remember you in …’” It’s often the BBC’s Robin Hood, where he was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/robinhood/characters/sheriffofnottingham.shtml\">a lip-smacking Sheriff of Nottingham</a>, or The Comic Strip, for which he wrote a handful of uproarious episodes and starred in many others alongside Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Rik Mayall, Robbie Coltrane et al. But “most of the attention I get is from Vindaloo,” he says, rolling his eyes. “My reputation is bizarre and that didn’t help. Producers who don’t know me won’t touch me. They think I’m just this bloke marching down the street singing about curry.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"31865f9f57570dfd05e3a6d8ab0a83d7e7fd1170\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31865f9f57570dfd05e3a6d8ab0a83d7e7fd1170/0_56_3949_2369/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lairy pioneers … Allen, far right, with the Comic Strip gang.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lairy pioneers … Allen, far right, with the Comic Strip gang.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are no official figures for the number of children Allen has fathered, though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alfie-allen\">the actor Alfie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lilyallen\">the singer Lily</a> are among them. She has described him as a “self-saboteur” who “couldn’t channel his comedic gifts into a career”. It’s not an assessment he disputes. “That’s true, yeah. I couldn’t channel anything. You could say I wasted a lot of years. You could also say I had a fucking great time. I was in at the beginning for a lot of things. I presented one of the first ‘<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/history-of-80s-yoof-tv-janet-street-porter-magenta-devine-tracey-macloed\">yoof TV</a>’ shows. I was one of the first performers at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/24/comedy-store-don-ward-interview\">the Comedy Store</a>.”</p> <p>He left that rough-and-tumble venue when it became “more middle-class”, but stuck to live comedy for a while. He rarely knew what he was going to say until he was standing in front of the audience. He threw darts at hecklers. Often, he was naked. “Yeah. I’m not sure why.” One evening he walked to the front of the stage brandishing a mug of instant coffee granules, peed into it, and quaffed the lot. “Oh, I only did that because my parents and my auntie were in that night,” he says, as though anxious not to be misrepresented.</p> <p>Comedy was never a career path. “I saw myself becoming a David Niven figure. A national treasure. But I couldn’t commit. You have to focus, and I didn’t do that.” The die was cast early on. Born in Llanelli, Wales, Allen never settled anywhere long enough to put down roots. He lived in Malta briefly as a child, the family having moved there because of his father’s job as a submariner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"450b8de7126286ed04d5aea8eff133f4369edece\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/450b8de7126286ed04d5aea8eff133f4369edece/0_80_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I saw myself becoming a national treasure.

Either these upheavals genuinely didn’t bother him or else there was no one to complain to anyway (his father was not someone for whom affection came easily), so he learned to pipe down and press on. “I was always on the move,” he says. “That engenders a take-it-or-leave-it attitude to things.”</p> <p>Not least his career. He has built sets for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/18/bill-drummond-five-lessons-i-learned-from-ken-campbell\">Ken Campbell</a>, run a club night with the dancer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/aug/27/guide-dance-michael-clark\">Michael Clark</a>, been an opening act for the Clash and the Stranglers, curated the comedy tent at Latitude, and directed a pair of credulous documentaries – one a celebration of Mohamed al-Fayed and the other, funded by the former Harrods owner, advancing theories about the death of Princess Diana. </p> <p>Allen is like a hedonistic Zelig, forever popping up around prominent or formidable figures without ever quite becoming one himself. Take his carousing with Hirst and James. “People have said, ‘Oh there’s that guy who hung around with the others.’ I always liked to think <em>they</em> were hanging round with <em>me</em>.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ece039dfd6334a0d62438cb9cd6d1ed6e177809d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ece039dfd6334a0d62438cb9cd6d1ed6e177809d/0_80_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Harold liked me.

In 1991, he was in David Hare’s Murmuring Judges at the National. Soon after, he began a long association with Harold Pinter. “Harold liked me. It’s astonishing because I was just this lairy, loudmouthed twat.”</p> <p>If he had concentrated more on acting … “Yeah, what would have happened?” he wonders, finishing my sentence. It’s possible that he is only now reaching his peak. Earlier this year, he was masterful as the crabby patriarch Max in a savagely funny revival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/06/the-homecoming-review-theatre-royal-bath-harold-pinter\">Pinter’s The Homecoming</a>, while he showed mesmerising control as the killer and rapist John Cooper in the recent Bafta-winning ITV drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/11/the-pembrokeshire-murders-review-no-glory-for-violent-rotten-crimes\">The Pembrokeshire Murders</a>.</p> <p>“I’ve always known I was capable of that,” he says. “I didn’t think, ‘Fuck me how did I do it?’ But maybe I could’ve done it sooner.” It’s been a higgledy-piggledy life, so what does he want to be remembered for? “I think I was always good company,” he says softly.

Why aren’t politicians talking about it?","byline":"John Harris","body":"<p>When British politicians talk about Brexit and its consequences, they tend to adopt rictus grins and assure us that, by some miracle as yet unexplained, everything is going to be OK. The Labour leader Keir Starmer, who only a few years ago was a passionate advocate of a second referendum on our exit from the EU, now has a five-point plan to “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/04/how-keir-starmer-hopes-to-make-brexit-work\">make Brexit work</a>”. Meanwhile, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservative-leadership\">Tory leadership</a> contest grinds on, both the candidates are at pains to claim that life outside the EU is going wonderfully well, or soon will do.</p> \n<p>No matter that leaving the EU has tangled up businesses in form-filling, fees and a new world of unbelievable complexity: Rishi Sunak says he wants to “go further and faster in using the freedoms Brexit has given us to cut the mass of EU regulations and bureaucracy holding back our growth”. Liz Truss sounds even more zealous: she now wants to scrap all the regulations in UK law that are there as the legacy of our time in the EU by the end of next year, to “make the most of our newfound freedoms outside the EU”.</p> \n<p>Six years ago, Truss – unlike Sunak – enthusiastically campaigned for remain, but she is now more than happy to eat her words. “I was wrong and I am prepared to admit I was wrong,” she recently told the BBC. “Some of the portents of doom didn’t happen and instead we have actually unleashed new opportunities.”</p> \n<p>That “some” is a very telling use of language. The peace process in Northern Ireland and the power-sharing arrangement it created – perhaps the greatest achievement of post-Thatcher British politics – have been severely destabilised. The UK is an increasingly lonely, sometimes downright odd presence on the world stage. Most of Europe, indeed, seems to think we have gone collectively mad.</p> \n<p>And then there is the impact on our everyday lives. In the face of Westminster’s mixture of silence and forced optimism, Brexit is having a measurably dire effect on just about all of us. A recent survey done by the opinion pollsters Ipsos showed that the proportion of Britons who think the UK’s exit from the EU has made their daily life worse has gone up from 30% in June 2021 to 45% now, a figure that includes just under a quarter of people who voted leave. Amid the aftershocks of our national lockdowns, these mounting problems are becoming ever more obvious. And so, by way of filling the informational gap left by our politicians – and, indeed, most of the media – this strange, baking-hot summer seems like a good time to set out just some of Brexit’s apparently endless downsides.

Our shortage of workers extends from pubs to hospitals: one of the most worrying examples is what is happening to adult social care, which is already reeling from the pandemic.</p> \n<p>To state the blindingly obvious, despite its self-evident importance, care is a low-paid, low-status line of work, which tends to have high rates of staff turnover. As the number of older people increases, so does the prevalence of often chronic health conditions, which means we need more and more care workers. But Brexit has pulled an already struggling part of our social fabric into even greater crisis.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s been devastating. We’ve lost a lot of our European colleagues. They felt unwanted, unsafe and undervalued</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Nadra Ahmed, National Care Association</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“It’s been devastating,” says Nadra Ahmed, the chair of the National Care Association, which represents small and medium-sized care providers. “It’s made an already declining situation, much, much worse. We’ve lost a lot of our European colleagues. They decided they no longer wanted to stay. They felt unwanted, unsafe, undervalued.”</p> \n<p>Two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Adult-Social-Care-Workforce-Data/Workforce-intelligence/documents/State-of-the-adult-social-care-sector/The-State-of-the-Adult-Social-Care-Sector-and-Workforce-2021.pdf\">she tells me</a>, 5.2% of those starting new jobs in adult social care were foreign nationals; now, that figure is less than 2%. Under pressure from care employers, the government recently relaxed stringent restrictions on visas for care workers, but staffing problems continue to mount.</p> \n<p>To make things even worse, Brexit-related labour shortages in other fields of work are pulling people away from care in increasing numbers, with obvious consequences. In May 2021, the vacancy rate in adult social care was 5.9%. In April this year, it reached 10%.</p> \n<p>For people who need residential care, the effects can be grim. “A lot of providers have stopped taking people from hospitals who are high-need, because they don’t have the staff to cope,” says Ahmed. “Or they’ve closed a percentage of the beds in their services. If you’ve got a 30-bed service, you might bring it down to 25 beds, so you’ve got the right ratio of staff.”</p> \n<p>And what does that mean for people who need care?</p> \n<p>“Well, they’re often stuck in hospital, which is why you hear about all issues in the NHS with that awful term ‘bedblocking’. That’s people sitting in NHS hospitals who are medically fit for discharge, but they can’t be placed anywhere because no service can deliver the care.”</p> \n<h2><strong>What Brexit means for British food-growers</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"932186137ace54d49a9c45a7267c7479d6405044\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/932186137ace54d49a9c45a7267c7479d6405044/0_0_4457_2972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Capper inspects the blossom on her apple trees at her farm in Worcestershire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali Capper inspects the blossom on her apple trees at her farm in Worcestershire.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain is seemingly short of food, hunger is an increasingly visible problem, and empty shelves in supermarkets are now an ingrained part of everyday life – but we are also throwing away tonnes of produce.</p> \n<p>Ali Capper is the owner of a farm in Worcestershire that grows apples and hops. When harvests peak between late August and mid-October, she needs about 70 temporary employees. “We’re pretty small-to-medium in that respect,” she says. “There are soft fruit growers who’ll employ 1,000 to 1,500 for the summer, and vegetable growers who need more like 2,500 to 3,000.”</p> \n<p>Since 2017, getting enough workers has been an annual headache. “If you haven’t got labour, you can’t harvest your crop, and you don’t have a business,” she says. “It’s as simple as that. And we’ve had two years when we’ve had to walk past crops: that’s how we describe it. You have to start prioritising. You leave the less good, or the marginal, or the second-pick: the crop that might not get you the highest return.”</p> \n<p>What proportion of her produce has been thrown away? “I’m not going to crystal-ball this season,” she says. “But in previous seasons, we’ve probably left behind up to 25%. That’s really painful.” Where does it leave the business? “Well, I would say that in fresh produce, many businesses are questioning their sustainability.”</p> \n<p>Since the referendum, the makeup of her workforce has drastically changed. It used to be split between people from Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, many of whom would come back three or four seasons running, and become expert pickers. Now, workers come from such countries as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Ukraine and Russia – and convulsive recent events in the latter two countries have meant more people only coming for a single period, which has led to a drop in productivity.</p> \n<p>There is also, Capper says, a rising issue with some of the export companies she deals with, as evidenced by a Worcestershire-based hops merchant she knows who is about to set up a new warehouse in Poland. “Hops is an international business,” she says. “If he brings hops in from Australia or America, and he wants to package them up with hops from the UK and send everything into Europe, he’s paying double duty. The only way of avoiding that is directly importing hops into Europe. So we’re going to see merchants with a focus on Europe rather than here. And that means UK hops will get forgotten.”</p> \n<h2><strong>Brexit is also terrible for food imports</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72ce1ef029df99861e893294d95a9758f00c7ba6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72ce1ef029df99861e893294d95a9758f00c7ba6/0_0_6998_4670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Empty supermarket shelves at an Asda in Cardiff in 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Empty supermarket shelves at an Asda in Cardiff in 2021.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Before Brexit happened, Truss famously alerted the Conservative party conference to the fact that the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/12/liz-truss-post-brexit-stilton-deal-with-japan-will-not-make-britain-grate-again\">imported two-thirds of its cheese</a> – which was, she half yelled, “a disgrace”. She is, therefore, presumably ecstatic about the seemingly endless snags that now face British buyers of European dairy products – and, for that matter, lots of other EU foodstuffs besides. Food importers face many of the same bureaucratic nightmares as exporters (in the words of Speciality Food magazine, “with Brexit now officially in full force, cheesemongers across the UK are struggling with costs and supplier issues when it comes to importing European cheeses”), which is one of the reasons why the refrigerated aisles of many British supermarkets are often so sparsely stocked. Note also: the British government was due to introduce new import controls on EU food products this summer, but their arrival has been postponed for a fourth time. If they ever materialise, importing European products will be even more problematic.</p> \n<h2><strong>What’s happened to other businesses</strong></h2> \n<p>At the end of June, the EU published figures showing that between 2020 and 2021, British exports to the rest of Europe had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/30/brexit-uk-exports-fall-eu-goods-services\">fallen by 14%</a>. Covid was part of what had happened – but, as one high-ranking European commissioner said, the plunge was also down to “paperwork for virtually every product shipping between our markets”, and checks on “thousands of goods being carried out on a daily basis” – as well as a sudden mess of VAT, import duties and raised charges for transporting goods from Britain to the continent.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You can pay for a two-day service, getting things back, and it’ll take nine days now</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Kenneth Mackenzie, founder of menswear brand 6876</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Since 1995, Kenneth Mackenzie has run a high-end men’s casualwear business called 6876, based in London. Pre-Brexit, he could count on a resident of Berlin or Paris buying his clothes on exactly the same basis as someone in the UK. But, since Britain left the EU, he has lost somewhere between 60% and 70% of his European customers, which accounts for about 30% of his business. “They just don’t want the hassle,” he says. “They don’t want to pay the duty and the VAT.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f621e1fe328b5fda5b3a0327a565aa02d8cd49a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f621e1fe328b5fda5b3a0327a565aa02d8cd49a/60_40_1591_1944/818.jpg\" alt=\"Kenneth Mackenzie, who runs the men’s casualwear business, 6876.\" width=\"818\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kenneth Mackenzie, who runs the men’s casualwear business, 6876.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Tran</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Worse still, he now has to hack his way through a tangle of complexity that surrounds the clothing factories he uses on the continent, who charge far less than manufacturers in Britain, and thereby make his business viable. He uses a company in Portugal to manufacture his jackets, to exacting specifications. But now, thanks to customs checks and byzantine courier arrangements, he is never sure how long it will take for finished products to arrive back in the UK. “You can pay for a two-day service, getting things back, and it’ll take nine days now,” he says. “It’s insane; it’s actually got slower. Before Brexit, you could get stuff in two days, or even overnight, if you paid for it. Now, it just comes when it comes. Boxes get split: I’ll be checking on the internet thinking, ‘Why’s this box in France? Why’s that one in the UK?’”</p> \n<h2><strong>Queues that even British people can’t cope with</strong></h2> \n<p>It was easily the most vivid illustration so far of how Brexit has upturned things that millions of Britons once took for granted: the episode that exploded into the news on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/22/dover-port-declares-critical-incident-travellers-four-hour-queues-french-border-control\">Friday 22 July</a>, when the Port of Dover declared a “critical incident”, as droves of people trying to get to the continent were stranded in six-hour queues.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"55280f85-b042-4be0-a45a-8ad86d7db9f4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qCJSnhSwBnQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Even Jacob Rees-Mogg was forced to admit this week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/jacob-rees-mogg-admits-i-was-wrong-to-say-brexit-would-not-cause-dover-delays\">he was wrong to say Brexit would not cause delays at Dover</a>. The port’s chief executive – along with an array of Conservative politicians – blamed insufficient staffing at French border posts, but there was an obvious related issue: the plain fact that British travellers now have to go through the bureaucratic ritual of getting their passports stamped, instead of going through the pre-Brexit quickfire checks (the typical processing time has reportedly gone <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cc3e31e-0233-4d61-8329-8c1e171f8236\">from 58 to 90 seconds</a> – which, when you’re dealing with thousands of people, is obviously a big jump). Much the same applies to the multitudes of British people who are now arriving in Spain – where, at airports in Mallorca, Ibiza and Alicante, there have been reports of long queues for the “third country” entry points that they must now use. Worse still, Spanish border staff may now ask for proof of a return plane ticket, where British arrivals are staying, and guarantees that they can spend <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11049249/British-tourists-able-prove-spend-85-day-enter-Spain.html\">at least £85 a day</a>. The Austrian daily newspaper <a href=\"https://www.kleinezeitung.at/international/6134490/BrexitKonsequenz_Briten-empoert-ueber-laengere-Warteschlangen-an\">Kleine Zeitung</a> recently summarised all these stories, saying, with no schadenfreude whatsoever: “The British discipline of queueing is occasionally put to the test at EU airports. It is a consequence of Brexit that leaves a nasty taste in some of the kingdom’s tourists.”</p> \n<h2><strong>Anaemic economic growth</strong></h2> \n<p>Just about every major economy in the world is facing big problems, and the countries of mainland Europe are no exception. But whereas the EU’s gross domestic product (GDP) per head has grown by 8.5% since Brexit, the UK’s figure is just 3.8%. Moreover, the UK is now behind all the other G7 nations in its recovery from the pandemic. If a country shrinks its export markets, strangles its supply routes and creates labour shortages, this is what happens – a view backed up by the government’s own forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Its <a href=\"https://obr.uk/forecasts-in-depth/the-economy-forecast/brexit-analysis/\">basic prediction</a> remains in line with what it projected in March 2020: that Brexit would reduce UK productivity and GDP by 4% compared with remaining in the EU. The OBR says that a little over half of that damage has yet to hit us.</p> \n<p>There is a piquant twist to the part of the post-Brexit tale. In June this year, the Office for National Statistics revealed that in the July-September quarter of 2021, England and Scotland’s GDP had grown by 0.6% and 0.9% respectively, and Wales’s had slightly shrunk. Thanks to the controversial Northern Ireland protocol, by contrast, that part of the UK was still benefiting from trading in the EU single market, and its GDP had gone up by 1.4%.</p> \n<h2><strong>Inflation</strong></h2> \n<p>The UK has the highest inflation rate of any country in the G7: higher than France, Italy and Germany. To state the obvious, the war in Ukraine and pandemic-related supply issues are sending prices soaring across the world, but what gives Britain a particularly pronounced problem – which forecasters say will endure into the immediate future, while inflation in the eurozone starts to fall – is Brexit. Our departure from the EU has weakened the pound, which increases the prices of imports, and adds to companies’ costs. Post-Brexit limitations on foreign workers are also hitting firm’s bottom lines, as are problems with the UK’s European supply chains. In April, Adam Posen, an American economist and former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, said that 80% of the explanation for Britain’s higher inflation was bound up with Brexit and its endless complexity. It amounted, he said, to “a trade war the UK declared on itself”.</p> \n<h2><strong>Universities</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"239d0e3ef298bd4511dbc18160e4eac03d4d4c07\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/239d0e3ef298bd4511dbc18160e4eac03d4d4c07/0_0_1540_1020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thiemo Fetzer, a professor of economics at the University of Warwick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thiemo Fetzer, a professor of economics at the University of Warwick</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The government has tried to patch up at least some of the damage Brexit has inevitably caused to British universities and research. There is one obvious example: in place of the UK’s participation in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/09/erasmus-programme-year-studying-europe\">EU’s Erasmus+ programme</a> – which, pre-Brexit, allowed thousands of UK students to study or train in Europe, and people from EU countries to do the same here – there is now the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/aug/04/students-apply-to-uk-version-of-erasmus-foreign-study-scheme\">Turing scheme</a>, which will provide funding for about 40,000 British students a year to study and work abroad.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I consider the UK my home, but it’s a home that keeps on rejecting me</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Thiemo Fetzer, professor, University of Warwick</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But Brexit has drastically changed the UK’s universities, what they do, and the people who work and study in them. Between 2020 and 2021, there was a 40% drop in the number of students from EU countries coming to the UK. Academics say that their European colleagues are increasingly reluctant to work here – partly because teaching and research often depends on people being mobile enough to move from one institution to another, often with their families, and Brexit has put no end of barriers in the way.</p> \n<p>One recent story crystallises what is happening. As Britain left the EU, UK negotiators managed to secure associate membership of Horizon Europe, the EU’s €95.5bn (£80bn), seven-year “framework programme for research and innovation”. But in July, it was announced that because of the government’s failure to resolve issues around Brexit and Northern Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/05/eu-scraps-115-grants-uk-scientists-academics-brexit-row#:~:text=EU%20scraps%20115%20grants%20for%20UK%20scientists%20and%20academics%20amid%20Brexit%20row,-Move%20follows%20dispute&amp;text=British%20scientists%20and%20academic%20researchers,Brexit%20row%20over%20Northern%20Ireland.\">115 of its grants</a> for UK-based research projects were being cancelled. British involvement in Horizon Europe is now seriously in doubt: the UK government says it has a backup funding plan for researchers, but there is widespread suspicion that it will be an inferior, inward-looking version of a programme that brought British universities no end of benefits.</p> \n<p>Thiemo Fetzer is a 36-year-old, German-born professor of economics at the University of Warwick. The Horizon announcement threatened the cancellation of a €1.5m research project he had been preparing for a year, which will look – among other things – at how the media across the world covers the climate crisis, and its political implications. He has now transferred the project to the University of Bonn in Germany, where he will soon spend 50% of his time. “It’s been extremely unsettling, very difficult to deal with emotionally,” he says. “I consider the UK my home, but it’s a home that keeps on rejecting me. I hope to start a family in the next couple of years, and I don’t know whether the UK’s a good place to do that.”</p> \n<h2><strong>Fishing</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"169249ca4f910f34061df2648a791fd576bdf073\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/169249ca4f910f34061df2648a791fd576bdf073/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie McMillan from Lochfyne Langoustines.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie McMillan from Lochfyne Langoustines.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some people who make their living from fishing were among Brexit’s loudest supporters, encouraged to look forward to a new ocean-going utopia of unrivalled access to British waters, and the binning of European rules and regulations. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/26/deal-fishing-industry-boris-johnson-betrayal-eu-demands\">Boris Johnson’s deal with the EU</a> was announced, these hopes palpably faded, though there were some who tried to hang on to a little optimism: in the view of the trade journal Fishing News, the agreement at least secured “tariff- and quota-free exports to the EU, although with a massively increased burden of paperwork”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s easier and quicker for me to sell products to China than it is to France</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Jamie McMillan, Lochfyne Langoustines</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The latter involves a whole new world of pain. Jamie McMillan – who didn’t vote in the 2016 referendum at all, something he says he regrets – runs Lochfyne Langoustines, a small seafood business on the shores of the sea loch in west Scotland from which it takes its name. The company sells “live langoustines, live king scallops, live lobster, live razor clams – premium products that can achieve very high prices”.</p> \n<p>When we speak, it does not take long for him to get down to the basics of his position. “We no longer export to Europe,” he says. “We’ve lost 60% of our turnover. We tried to do it, but four months after Brexit, we realised it was no longer viable. We’re a small company, and after Brexit, it cost us £500 per day per dispatch. It’s barely worth it.” His increased costs, he explains, are down to customs declarations, new charges, health certificates that now have to be completed for every variety of shellfish, and more. “In the first four months of 2020, we had to spend £17,500 just on paperwork. We can’t afford that.”</p> \n<p>Before Brexit, Lochfyne Langoustines employed 23 people. That number is now 13. The company is now trying to attract business in Singapore, Hong Kong, the US and elsewhere – something McMillan says shows promising signs, but will take years to really bed in. Trading with such countries, moreover, entails spurning markets on his doorstep in favour of flying shellfish halfway around the world. “It’s absolute madness. But it’s easier and quicker for me to sell products to China than it is to France.”</p> \n<h2><strong>The arts – and music in particular</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70f9aa3175393afed7ef1a96f1a136b69c4dc403\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70f9aa3175393afed7ef1a96f1a136b69c4dc403/0_0_5571_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah McQuaid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah McQuaid.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Nicholls</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For musicians, actors and the multitudes of people whose work puts them on stage, Brexit amounts to a particularly mind-boggling tangle of rules, demands and fees that simply didn’t exist when practitioners of the arts could work and travel freely around mainland Europe. Obviously, this cuts both ways: fewer European performers fancy coming here, and talented people in the UK have to find ways of surmounting endless obstacles, if they can. The results of the latter problem are obvious: figures recently published by the campaign group Best for Britain show that the number of British musicians playing at EU festivals this summer has fallen by 45% compared with the period immediately before Brexit and the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Sarah McQuaid is a folk musician based in Cornwall. She tours on the most stripped-down basis imaginable: in a single car, with her manager-cum-roadie. She tends to play very intimate venues – in Berlin, she tells me, her favourite place has a capacity of 60 – but between tickets and on-the-road sales of vinyl LPs, CDs, T-shirts and other “merch”, that model has always allowed her to just about make a living.</p> \n<p>Brexit has upturned everything. “Continental Europe was the one place I could get good audiences, and really good merch sales,” she says. “Even with the cost of ferries getting over there, I could still earn more in four weeks than I’d make in twice that amount of time in the UK. You could earn as little as €400 on a fee, but make the same amount on merch sales. So, for a solo artist like me, it worked.”</p> \n<p>She says she knows musicians who have now simply decided to stop playing in Europe. One problem is the different VAT regimes in each European country: “I’m supposed to register for VAT in every single one of them, declare the value of all the merch I’m bringing in to sell, and pay VAT on it. And then when I leave the country, I can reclaim the VAT, as long as I can show that I’m bringing all the stuff out again.” Another issue is import duty. And then there are Carnets: the documents that now have to detail the equipment being moved from country to country, and that entail sizeable fees (McQuaid’s latest one cost £379.25 – for the kind of operation surrounding a band or theatre company, the costs are inevitably even more punishing).</p> \n<p>When she recently toured Ireland, what struck her the most was the spectacle of customs officials having to check her load as she arrived by ferry: “They’re not there to make sure that musicians who take a PA system out of the country take it back in again. They’re there to catch people-smuggling.”</p> \n<p>She sighs, and then echoes something I have heard from just about everyone I have spoken to: a sense of rules, arrangements that make no sense, and are upturning people’s lives. “It’s such a waste of everyone’s time,” she says. “Why do it?”</p> \n<p>• This article was amended on 3 August 2022.

According to their latest data, the bras may have boosted the players’ athletic performances as well.</p> <p>“Evidence suggests that sports bras have performance benefits, comfort benefits and health benefits, so I would say they’re just as important for exercising females as trainers,” said Prof Joanna Wakefield-Scurr of the University of Portsmouth, who led the project.</p> <p>In the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2021, Wakefield-Scurr and her colleagues provided similar prescriptions to 112 British athletes, in collaboration with the English Institute of Sport (EIS). Before their intervention, most of the athletes wore ill-fitting, loose bras, offering limited support, and many reported breast discomfort or pain. Four weeks later, 87% of the athletes reported having benefited from the prescriptions, and 17% said it had <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35711113/\">improved their sports performance</a>.</p> <p>“We were delighted because it meant the athletes had noticed a difference in their performance on the pitch, the court or wherever, and that difference was the result of changing their bra,” said Wakefield-Scurr.</p> <p>Sports bras broadly fall into one of two categories. There are compression bras, which help reduce breast movement by squashing them flat against the chest, and encapsulation bras, which support each breast in individual cups.</p> <p>“Crop top-style compression sports bras are really common in football,” said Wakefield-Scurr. “They can be reasonably effective for smaller-breasted athletes, but there are also some hybrid bras that look like a crop top but contain a bit more support, which is what Chloe [Kelly] was wearing. It looks like a crop top from the front but it’s got more structured support within it.” </p> <p>This support is important. Previous research has suggested that wearing an ill-fitting bra <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jun/18/theyre-not-treating-us-as-small-men-team-gb-women-get-the-right-bras\">can create multiple problems</a>, from breast pain and sagging tissue to chafed skin. Running in a poorly supportive bra was also found to shorten women’s strides by up to 4cm, which could add up to an extra mile over the length of a marathon.</p> <p>“Some of our research has also shown reductions in muscle activity in the upper body as a result of wearing a well-fitting bra, which means you could potentially go for a bit longer in your training session before getting fatigued,” said Wakefield-Scurr. “If you are exercising and your breasts are moving a lot, you essentially work harder in your upper body to try to stop that movement.”</p> <p>Before the UEFA European Women’s Championships, Wakefield-Scurr provided general breast and bra education to the Lionesses, followed by individual sessions. “We looked at their bra needs and any issues they’d been experiencing with their sports bras, and then we prescribed sports bras for them – including the sports bra that we saw Chloe displaying to everybody,” she said.</p> <p>“They were off-the-shelf bras, but we found that the players really appreciated information on how to fit them, what styles would work for them best. There are some really good products out there that can work for elite athletes, but it’s about helping them navigate through the marketplace.”</p> <p>Dr Pippa Bennett, acting director of medical services at the English Institute of Sport and the Football Association’s medical lead for the women’s professional game, said: “While the EIS has not worked directly with the Lionesses, it is great to see that the FA has – like the EIS – prioritised work on female athlete health, including bra fitting.”</p> <p>Besides inspiring more women to take up football, Kelly – who has said she will frame her bra – may have inadvertently prompted a boom in sports bra purchases. John Lewis said sales had surged 140% over the weekend, while there was a nearly tenfold increase in Google searches for “Nike sports bra” following Saturday’s game.</p> <p>That’s no bad thing, said Wakefield-Scurr. “What we tend to see with sports bras is that they can offer increased comfort, and they probably also have a bit more R&amp;D behind them because some of the big sports apparel brands have put in a lot of money into their development. I think the general public can get real benefits from wearing them, and they can be worn all day.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>How to choose a supportive sports bra</strong></h2> <p>The best bra is a well-fitting bra, but because women’s breasts vary so widely in size, shape and composition, what suits one women may not suit another. The same is true of sports bras. </p> <p>Pure compression bras are made of stretchy material that flattens the breasts against the chest to minimise bounce. “The challenge is that breast tissue is non-compressible. It doesn’t get smaller, the bra just repositions it somewhere else,” said Wakefield-Scurr. “To cope with that, compression bras have to have quite a lot of elastic in them, which tends to makes them quite stretchy.”</p> <p>Although they may be OK for small-breasted women doing low-impact activities, Wakefield-Scurr doesn’t generally recommend them for exercising women. Encapsulated or hybrid bras are a better option, because they contain cups that support each breast. But it may not be obvious which type of bra you’re looking at.</p> <p>Wakefield-Scurr recommends turning the bra inside out to get a better look: “From the outside you quite often can’t tell [if it’s a hybrid bra], but if you turn it inside out you’ll be able to see the structuring – either a moulded cup that has a shape to it, or seaming where multiple panels have been sewn together to create a 3D shape.”</p> <p>Both types can be equally effective, but some women prefer the thickness of a moulded cup. Whichever you choose, make sure your bra doesn’t restrict your breathing, that the fabric of the cup is smooth and unwrinkled, and that breast tissue isn’t spilling out. Another tip is to try jumping around the changing room and swinging your arms. If you experience pain or discomfort, try another bra.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/01/china-and-taiwan-whats-behind-the-tensions-in-30-seconds","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T04:55:01Z","webTitle":"China-Taiwan relations: what’s behind the tensions – in 30 seconds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/china-and-taiwan-whats-behind-the-tensions-in-30-seconds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/01/china-and-taiwan-whats-behind-the-tensions-in-30-seconds","fields":{"headline":"China-Taiwan relations: what’s behind the tensions – in 30 seconds","trailText":"Unification is a key goal of Chinese leader Xi Jinping and analysts say threat that Beijing will invade Taiwan is higher than ever","byline":"Helen Davidson in Taipei","body":"<p>The Chinese government claims Taiwan as a province of China and has not ruled out taking it by force.</p> <p>At the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, the losing Kuomintang government fled to the island of Taiwan, establishing the Republic of China (ROC) government in exile.

Barton was looking for the right candidate to serve in some of Australia’s most marginalised regions, and Whitham, who had volunteered with remote communities in the mountains of Peru, seemed to fit the bill.</p> <p>Taking a role in far northwestern New South Wales to deliver eye services to remote Indigenous communities was an incredibly rewarding change for Whitlam, made possible by funding from a partnership between Specsavers and The Fred Hollows Foundation.</p> <p>“It was nice to find a job where I could make a difference helping communities who needed it,” Whitham says. “A lot of the patients I see are more than four hours away from their nearest major regional town, which creates barriers in accessing health services.</p> <p>“Often, they present with issues that could have been prevented through earlier intervention. The funding enables us to improve the number of patients that we can get through and [pays] for the equipment needed to run a clinic.”</p> <p>Whitham says the service has already provided more than 120 sight-saving surgeries in the first half of this year alone – more than its usual annual quota – in addition to other services that include paediatric eye care, referrals for ophthalmology treatments, and diabetic eye disease treatments such as laser and injections.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cdb127ea96e4401ae3ee1cd874976a5ed559f8db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb127ea96e4401ae3ee1cd874976a5ed559f8db/1310_0_2995_3744/800.jpg\" alt=\"Surgeon peering into microscope positioned above the head of  an anaesthetised patient head while performing an eye operation. \" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Dr Angus Turner, Director of Lions Outback Vision, performing cataract surgery on a patient in Broome, WA. Photo: Alan McDonald</p></li> </ul> <p>Since Specsavers and the foundation’s partnership was formed more than a decade ago, Specsavers has donated more than $5m to the foundation’s work in providing eye health services to Indigenous communities, and hopes to donate a further $1m this year to help close the eye health gap.</p> <p>One way Specsavers raises funds is through its limited-edition frames. Since 2014, it has created collections featuring the artwork of Indigenous artists; $25 from each pair sold goes to the foundation to help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in remote communities have better access to life-changing surgery and high-quality eye care.</p> <p>The initiative has involved a number of Indigenous artists over the years, including the late Ernabella artist Langaliki; the renowned painter and Gumatj leader from Northeast Arnhem Land, Peter Datjing Burarrwanga; and contemporary Aboriginal artist and proud Yuin woman Rheanna Lotter. This year, the frames feature artwork from proud Gurinji woman Sarrita King.</p> <p>The donations are crucial. Access to reliable funding, Whitham says, allows for a “continuity of care”, particularly in communities where day-to-day lives are significantly affected by change in government, policy or service. The pandemic, he says, was one such change, with the team utilising telehealth to ensure patients had ongoing contact with their healthcare providers and access to repeat scripts, “to try to minimise any impact that could worsen their outcome”.</p> <p>“We’ve had to play catch-up on all the cancellations from the Covid-19 lockdowns,” he says. “So many patients’ surgeries were delayed so we had to increase that side of our service.” The speed in which cataract surgery can be performed is just one reason for the growth of outreach eye care services in rural and regional Australia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fdc6b46481cf4b74973d71db5980035e6ccb32e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fdc6b46481cf4b74973d71db5980035e6ccb32e/411_14_2983_2039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eye doctor and patient seated next to each other in consultation room, smiling to camera. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"684\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Whitham, Orthoptist that FHF funds through the Outback Eye Service, with patient, Tracey Walford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Whitham/The Fred Hollows Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Orthoptist Ben Whitham with patient Tracey Walford at the Outback Eye Service operating in far North West NSW Photo: Ben Whitham</p></li> </ul> <p>Dr Angus Turner, ophthalmologist and founder and director of Lions Outback Vision in Western Australia, says patients appreciate the treatments because they make an instant difference to their quality of life.</p> <p>“It’s just a really gratifying vocation because patients are so grateful for restored vision, and as a speciality we are fortunate to have some dramatic and quick wins,” he says.</p> <p>Turner’s “longstanding interest in delivery of health care to marginalised groups” and time spent researching outreach ophthalmology have enabled Lions Outback Vision to slowly improve its service offering over the years.</p> <p>Funding from the foundation has supported the training of senior registrars in the unique challenges and rewards of rural work, and Specsavers’ contributions to the foundation have enabled Lions to expand its services further.</p> <p>Telehealth collaboration with a team of visiting optometrists has halved waiting times for patients; a fly-in service from Rubibi (Broome) and Boorloo (Perth) to 10 locations offers monthly injections for diabetes-related blindness; and the Lions Outback Vision Van, a mobile facility, takes state-of-the-art equipment to 25 regional towns offering specialist services for which patients would otherwise have to travel to the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e9edb4fc9e10b375ca21752dd1c058497b2e784\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e9edb4fc9e10b375ca21752dd1c058497b2e784/0_288_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"side view of limited edition glass frames withe artwork on the frame arms, artists hands in background working on canvass \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>For each pair sold of Specsavers’ limited edition frames featuring the work of Indigenous artist Sarrita King, $25 goes to the the Fred Hollows Foundation to help fund its work in remote and regional Indigenous communities</p></li> </ul> <p>Establishing a trusting relationship with the locals, many of whom have become regular patients, has also been an incredible by-product of the work.</p> <p>“Building relationships with clinics on the ground is key to our work, so we’re really dependent on links with Aboriginal health workers on the ground,” Turner says.</p> <p>“A great example is our connection in Fitzroy Crossing, who has been helping our service for over a decade. He knows where everyone else is, helps glue other itinerant staff together, and has developed his own eye care requirement, so he knows exactly how to explain it to new patients.”</p> <p>The establishment of a regional eye care base in Broome – due to be completed in October – is the latest venture on the agenda. It will feature facilities for healthy eating programs, optometry services, and research and training provisions for future students “that can inform the way [Lions Outback Vision] delivers services for Aboriginal populations in collaboration with community”, Turner says.</p> <p>“The distance and cost of providing [these services] from Perth was becoming unsustainable, so it’s exciting to consider the potential of this new hub thanks to the support of Specsavers and The Fred Hollows Foundation.</p> <p>“Things like keeping a driver’s licence, seeing our family and enjoying our pastimes are all dependent on vision to some extent. We can all appreciate how precious sight is in our lives, and the need to provide services that can restore vision, or prevent blindness, is so important for regional and remote patients.”</p> <p><em><strong>Support this partnership and discover the <a href=\"https://www.specsavers.com.au/glasses/fred-hollows\" rel=\"nofollow\">Specsavers limited-edition collection in collaboration with The Fred Hollows Foundation</a>, available exclusively in-store and online.</strong></em></p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"hurtigruten-discover-norway/2022/aug/03/northern-lights-fjords-and-polar-bears-why-you-need-to-visit-norway","type":"article","sectionId":"hurtigruten-discover-norway","sectionName":"Hurtigruten: Discover Norway","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T03:41:18Z","webTitle":"Northern lights, fjords and polar bears: why you need to visit Norway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/hurtigruten-discover-norway/2022/aug/03/northern-lights-fjords-and-polar-bears-why-you-need-to-visit-norway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/hurtigruten-discover-norway/2022/aug/03/northern-lights-fjords-and-polar-bears-why-you-need-to-visit-norway","fields":{"headline":"Northern lights, fjords and polar bears: why you need to visit Norway","trailText":"From its picturesque coastal communities to the majesty of the High Arctic, this Scandinavian nation is home to some of the most beautiful places on Earth","byline":"","body":"<p>Visiting Norway feels like stepping inside a fantasy land. In summer, you can bathe in the warming glow of the beautiful midnight sun, as daylight hovers for more than a month in parts of the country, while in the pitch black of winter, you might see the sky light up with bursts of orange, green and purple. Polar bears bask in Arctic surrounds, fjords inspire awe, and fairytale houses dot mountain landscapes in tiny coastal villages. It’s an otherworldly beauty.</p> <p>While cities such as Oslo and Bergen are full of charm and culture – think cobblestone streets, modern art museums and exciting fine dining – Norway’s best bits are in the natural world. After all, this is a country that loves the outdoors so much it created a word, <em>friluftsliv</em>, to describe the joy of being outside.</p> <p>So what are the most magical outdoor experiences in a country full of them? Here’s a brief guide to Norway’s incredible drawcards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eb46a2d4192565c49e2e1313568bb24ffadcd357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb46a2d4192565c49e2e1313568bb24ffadcd357/0_0_7187_4791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The night sky ablaze with eh aquamarine tinted norther lights Northern lights reflected in still waters of a fjord, a hurtigruten cruise ship anchored to one side. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>The world-famous northern lights</strong></h2> <p>The northern lights are one of those rare travel experiences that exceeds all expectations. Photos don’t do the natural phenomenon justice – you’ve got to be there to truly understand its majesty.</p> <p>In certain parts of the world, seeing the lights can be hit and miss: they are a bucket list item that can be as fickle as they are astounding. However, they are dependably on display in cities such as Tromsø, about 350km north of the Arctic Circle, just off the tip of mainland Norway. This picturesque university town experiences polar night – 24-hour nighttime – for more than a month in winter, which gives you great odds of seeing the spectacular natural light show.</p> <p>Cruise company Hurtigruten Norwegian Coastal Express is so confident it can show you the northern lights that if the natural light show doesn’t appear on your voyage, it will offer you another six- or seven-day trip free of charge.</p> <p>Hurtigruten’s <a href=\"https://www.hurtigruten.com.au/the-north-cape-express/?&amp;utm_source=Guardian&amp;utm_medium=Native&amp;utm_campaign=APAC_COA_Awareness_Iconic_B2C_W24_YR_2022_NO_23-24&amp;utm_content=\" rel=\"nofollow\">North Cape Express</a> trip, which launches in September 2023, is designed to seek out the lights. After Tromsø, it heads to the northerly towns of Honningsvåg and Alta, where you’ll get more time to see the sky light up in technicolour hues. In Alta’s winter wonderland you can even toast the experience in the world’s northernmost ice hotel, which is built out of snow and ice afresh every winter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c45c0a8c8fd7c02efc3337ead61e1b57af5535dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c45c0a8c8fd7c02efc3337ead61e1b57af5535dd/0_0_2500_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norway landscape at sunrise, a blanket of fog hugs the base of soaring mountain of rock, and spreads out across the fjord waters \" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Remote beauty</strong></h2> <p>At the very top of the world, halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole, is Svalbard. This Norwegian territory is one of the world’s northernmost inhabited areas, with a small local population that’s outnumbered by animal life including polar bears, reindeer and foxes. This Arctic archipelago is so remote that no indigenous people ever settled here. It’s a truly off-the-beaten-track destination that few will ever get to experience.</p> <p>The best way to get to this intriguing archipelago is by boat. On Hurtigruten’s <a href=\"https://www.hurtigruten.com.au/the-svalbard-express/?&amp;utm_source=Guardian&amp;utm_medium=Native&amp;utm_campaign=APAC_COA_Awareness_Iconic_B2C_W24_YR_2022_NO_23-24&amp;utm_content=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Svalbard Express</a>, which launches in June 2023, you’ll have a week exploring Norway’s mainland coast before setting sail for Svalbard. In the small town of Longyearbyen, set dramatically between fjords, you’ll be able to try dog sledding or stay warm wandering through halls of the North Pole Expedition Museum. Hurtigruten will then take you through Kongsfjord, one of the area’s largest fjords, where you could spot walrus, reindeer and even beluga whales. Get lucky and you might even see a polar bear stalking the coastline.</p> <p>You’ll come away from a trip to Svalbard awed by the beauty of the Arctic and sure of the need to preserve its incredible landscapes. By travelling with Hurtigruten you’ll also get to feel good about your visit, as the company has already kicked off Europe’s largest environmental ship upgrades, which will cut Co2 emissions by 25%. By 2030, Hurtigruten will also have launched its first emissions-free ship.</p> <p>That commitment to sustainability extends to the menu on board, which is locally sourced and comes direct from farm or sea to plate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"33dd51f7a25bb492a0df2641dde72bfbb4ac16b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33dd51f7a25bb492a0df2641dde72bfbb4ac16b4/0_0_2121_1414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clouds and sun beams over forest edged fjord with aqua water \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fantastic fjords</strong></h2> <p>Norway is famed for its fjords: long, narrow bodies of water surrounded by steep walls of rock.

Weather permitting, you may even be able to kayak across its unspoiled waters.</p> <p>Along Norway’s dramatic coastline you can also seek out sights such as the Vega Islands, a world heritage listed archipelago that has been inhabited since the Stone Age. There’s also the mysterious Torghatten mountain on the island of Brønnøysund, famous for the natural tunnel that runs through its centre, which you can explore on an hour-long walk.</p> <p>Elsewhere, in the coast’s remote villages, you can set off on snowshoe hikes, horse rides or boat safaris, passing moody beaches and dramatic mountain peaks as you go.</p> <p>In the summer, you’ll get to sail under the midnight sun: a golden hour that bathes everything in a heavenly glow.

It provides immunity for providers and their staff for some of the most objectionable aspects of aged care – the use of restrictive practices without having obtained lawful consent. Such practices, which include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/13/robbed-of-precious-time-chemical-restraints-and-aged-care\">chemical restraint</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/07/sydney-dementia-patient-tied-up-and-drugged-at-nursing-home-inquiry-hears\">physical restraint</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/25/melbourne-aged-care-residents-incarcerated-in-rooms-for-two-months\">seclusion</a>, attracted the most ire from the aged care royal commissioners.</p> <p>The royal commissioners did not recommend that providers and their staff be granted immunity for using restrictive practices. So why include this schedule in the aged care response bill?</p> <p>It has been claimed that legislative differences among states and territories present a risk to aged care providers because of the uncertainty and difficulty in identifying who has the lawful authority to consent to restrictive practices.</p> <p>The aged care providers’ solution is immunity if they comply with the not yet written Quality of Care Principles. The Morrison government, and now the Albanese government, simply adopted this solution.</p> <p>However, granting such immunity is discriminatory because it denies older people who live in residential aged care – a vulnerable cohort of people – the same legal protections given to all other Australians.</p> <p>It subordinates the common law developed over centuries to regulations made under the Aged Care Act. It is an extraordinary overreach of constitutional powers to grant providers immunity from key legislation enacted by states and territories.</p> <p>Schedule nine may also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/01/immunity-over-use-of-restraints-in-australian-aged-care-may-breach-torture-conventions-lawyers-say\">breach Australia’s obligations</a> under the international covenant on civil and political rights and the optional protocol to the convention against torture that Australia has signed.</p> <p>It is also unprecedented to offer immunity to commercial businesses. Many providers are private or publicly-listed for-profit companies (Estia, Regis) and multinational corporations (Bupa, Opal).</p> <p>Some “consumer” organisations that are funded by the government have indicated <a href=\"https://www.cota.org.au/news-items/time-for-the-premiers-to-fix-restraints-rules-in-the-meantime-a-temporary-fix-is-needed/\">support</a> for schedule nine. However, independent advocates and elder abuse and human rights lawyers who speak without fear of losing government funding have voiced strong <a href=\"http://www.agedcarematters.net.au/letter-to-aged-care-minister/\">opposition</a>.</p> <p>The number of recorded court cases against aged care providers over the past 25 years is tiny, possibly as few as six, and the complainants were not always successful.</p> <p>Given that residents and their families have rarely taken legal action – despite the well-documented track record over decades of neglect, poor treatment and abuse of the people in their care – the willingness of governments to protect approved aged care providers is staggering.</p> <p>One solution is to offer aged care providers an indemnity<em> </em>not immunity. There are many examples of similar indemnity schemes – most recently the one offered by the Morrison government for health practitioners who may be found liable to pay compensation for serious adverse events experienced by people receiving Covid-19 vaccines.</p> <p>An indemnity scheme would also avoid the potential legal and constitutional challenges to the immunity proposal and would ensure no further delays in the Albanese government’s determination to reform the aged care system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/01/immunity-over-use-of-restraints-in-australian-aged-care-may-breach-torture-conventions-lawyers-say\">Immunity over use of restraints in Australian aged care may breach torture conventions, lawyers say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>People who have been abused should always have access to their common law rights, regardless of where the abuse occurred.

one.</p> <p>“You can imagine the amount of money that households are dedicating to buying a house, getting the deposit, paying back the mortgage but also having to pay a lot more interest than they

Some of the changes include forcing councils to provide information about climate risks to prospective homebuyers, making councils account for climate change in planning regulations, and creating national mapping and public portals for people to see up-to-date information on how the climate crisis will affect their area.</p> <p>“Our government has taken steps to support those communities affected, and will continue to do so,” Shaw said. “But rather than having to deal with these events as and when they happen, what people want are the tools to prepare, so that when climate events occur their lives can continue.”</p> <p>What the plan doesn’t provide, however, is an answer to one of the most crucial questions facing the country: when houses, streets or entire communities become uninhabitable due to climate change, who pays to shift them?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/30/forced-retreat-one-new-zealand-towns-fate-highlights-coming-fight-over-climate-adaptation\">The question of “managed retreat”</a> – who foots the bill when sea level rise or flooding renders a community unsafe or uninsurable – has become increasingly pressing in New Zealand. One in seven New Zealanders, or 675,000 people, live in areas prone to flooding, and another 72,065 live in areas projected to be subject to extreme sea level rise. A 2020 government-funded report by Deep South Challenge – a national science collaboration – found at least 10,000 homes in New Zealand’s biggest cities would be in effect uninsurable by 2050. The government has committed to legislation on managed retreat by the end of 2023.</p> <p>Scientists say the plan, while welcome, is light on detail.</p> <p><strong>“</strong>Paucity remains in some of the details,” said Dr Luke Harrington, senior lecturer in climate change at University of Waikato. “There also remains uncertainty about how a warming planet will modify climate hazards at the neighbourhood scale. Some of these uncertainties are unavoidable, but many can be reduced if the right scientific questions are asked. Unfortunately, this is not one of the knowledge gaps identified,” he said.</p> <p>Dr Nick Cradock-Henry, a senior scientist at Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research, said the new plan was “overdue, but welcome”.</p> <p>“As we clean up following recent flooding, and face another potentially record-breaking year of extremes, this plan is a reminder that we still have a long way to go,” he said. “Adaptation to climate change is one of the most complex societal and environmental challenges we face, but with this plan we are at least moving in the right direction.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/03/irredeemable-batgirl-movie-unexpectedly-cancelled-despite-being-in-final-stages","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T01:02:52Z","webTitle":"‘Irredeemable’ Batgirl movie unexpectedly cancelled despite being in final stages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/03/irredeemable-batgirl-movie-unexpectedly-cancelled-despite-being-in-final-stages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/03/irredeemable-batgirl-movie-unexpectedly-cancelled-despite-being-in-final-stages","fields":{"headline":"‘Irredeemable’ Batgirl movie unexpectedly cancelled despite being in final stages","trailText":"Warner Bros confirms film starring Leslie Grace as Barbara Gordon, Michael Keaton, JK Simmons and Brendan Fraser won’t ever be released","byline":"Sian Cain","body":"<p>The previously announced Batgirl film starring In the Heights actor Leslie Grace, Michael Keaton and Brendan Fraser will not be released at all, Warner Bros Discovery has unexpectedly announced, despite shooting already being completed and the film being in post-production.</p> <p>Directed by Ms Marvel directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, the film was initially greenlit in 2021 as part of a wider move at Warner Bros to create feature films specifically for the streaming service HBO Max.

And he has the right for the inquiry to take place.</p> <p>“On receiving that information, I have made the decision to act. In relation to the entire review, once that review is finalised I will make it public and I always have said I will.”</p> <p>Perrottet said the draft findings of the Head report would now be subject to a separate investigation to determine whether Ayres had breached the ministerial code of conduct.</p> <p>He said Ayres had denied any wrongdoing in relation to the appointment and stands by his position that the recruitment process was conducted at arm’s length.</p> <p>“Mr Ayres denies any wrongdoing at all,” Perrottet said.</p> <p>He said there would be a further investigation by the Department of Premier and Cabinet into Ayres’ conduct.</p> <p>In a statement released on Wednesday, Ayres said he did not believe he had breached the code but would stand down while it was investigated to maintain the integrity of the cabinet.</p> <p>“Last night, I read a section of the independent review being conducted by Graeme Head. This section is relevant to my role as minister. It creates a question as to whether I breached the ministerial code of conduct,” he said.</p> <p>“In my view, no such breach has occurred. However, I agree it is important that this matter is investigated appropriately and support the premier’s decision to do so.</p> <p>“To maintain the integrity of the cabinet, I have decided to resign as a minister to allow the investigation to be completed.”</p> <p>Despite coming under increasing pressure, Ayres has maintained that Investment NSW head, Amy Brown, had the ultimate responsibility for the decision to appoint Barilaro to the role that he has since given up. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/public-servant-who-recruited-for-ny-role-taken-by-john-barilaro-to-appear-at-inquiry-for-second-time\">Brown will give evidence</a> at a NSW parliament upper house inquiry into the matter on Wednesday.</p> <p>The Head investigation is separate to the upper house inquiry and was established by the premier.</p> <p>Perrottet has repeatedly said he would not act on the matter until the Head review was completed but on Wednesday said the draft he had seen meant waiting to act was no longer viable.</p> <p>“Mr Head’s review does not and could not extend to whether Mr Ayres had complied with the ministerial code of conduct. When I put these matters to Mr Ayres, he offered his resignation from the ministry and as deputy leader of the parliamentary Liberal party,” Perrottet said.</p> <p>The report was still in its draft form, Perrottet stressed, and would not be released until it was completed. He said the parts he had seen so far, however, “clearly demonstrates the process was not at arm’s length”.</p> <p>“But the questions that have arisen that come through the report make it very clear in my view and in Mr Ayres’s view that there are potential breaches of the ministerial code. And in those circumstances, this is the appropriate course of action to take.</p> <p>“He has a different view in relation to his engagement with the process, and the review that will be conducted by DPC will make findings.”</p> <p>The premier defended his handling of the saga following the announcement in June that former deputy premier Barilaro had been appointed to a $500,000-a-year trade and investment role based in the US.</p> <p>“I said from the outset in relation to these matters that I would conduct an inquiry, and that is exactly what I have done,” Perrottet said.</p> <p>Ayres intends to remain in the parliament as the member for Penrith.</p> <p>Barilaro has previously said he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/30/john-barilaro-withdraws-from-new-york-trade-role-due-to-media-attention\">“always maintained that I followed the process”</a>.

Under Eddie Howe’s intelligent management Newcastle were a team transformed during the second half of last season and there is no reason why they should not continue on that upward trajectory.</p> \n<p>Although, on paper, last year’s Saudi Arabian-led takeover has turned them into the world’s wealthiest club, the owners are determined to spend wisely and remain acutely conscious of the need to remain within financial fair play rules. In other words, Howe’s reconstruction work is expected to be much more a case of evolution than revolution.</p> \n<p>While on-field signings appear suitably sensible, the installation of the former FA and Brighton technical director Dan Ashworth as director of football and Darren Eales as chief executive look shrewd. Eales, a Cambridge law graduate with past experience at West Brom and Tottenham, joins from MLS club Atlanta where he was much admired. Their appointments will allow co-owner and director Amanda Staveley, who ran the club magnificently last season, more time to concentrate on wider projects.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"59e1f7f1-ffc1-4907-b739-0263673bd759\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nPxD40qbb60?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So far Howe seems to have bought well this summer, with the widely coveted and, crucially, left-footed central defender Sven Botman arriving from Lille, the England goalkeeper Nick Pope signing from Burnley and Matt Targett, so quietly impressive at left-back last season, making his move from Aston Villa permanent. Howe remains in the market for another striker and a new midfielder but already possesses plenty of talent and an outstanding leader in right-back Kieran Trippier.</p> \n<p>Hopes are high that Brazil’s Bruno Guimarães, a January buy from Lyon, will continue to shine in midfield but his manager will need to determine whether Botman should be partnered by Dan Burn, Fabian Schär or Jamaal Lascelles. Howe also needs to coax the gifted, but sometimes frustrating, Allan Saint-Maximin into increased consistency, while hoping his injury prone centre-forward Callum Wilson stays fit and Joe Willock starts fulfilling his potential.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/epl-preview/newcastle-united/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The manager</h2> \n<p>Howe has been such a success at St James’ Park that Newcastle fans probably believe he is capable of walking on the river Tyne. Club executives shudder slightly when they recall that Unai Emery was their original first choice to replace Steve Bruce and the former Bournemouth manager merely a backstop option.</p> \n<p>Believed to be the first obsessive A-ha fan – “I want other people to hear what I hear” – at Newcastle’s helm, Howe is evangelical about a band he has followed since the 1980s. Tactically smart and emotionally intelligent he has impressed hugely, transforming previously underachieving players such as Schär and the apparently reborn Joelinton. The 44-year-old describes himself as “a bit shy and introverted” and spent part of his post-Bournemouth sabbatical “digitalising my training sessions”. Howe took a fortnight off this summer to drive down the west coast of the United States with his wife and three sons and has devoted spare time to helping move his family into a new home on Tyneside.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4c6a5736e292a3159ecc5048922caa0390fdfdf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4c6a5736e292a3159ecc5048922caa0390fdfdf/0_278_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Howe talks to his players during Newcastle’s pre-season training camp in Austria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Howe talks to his players during Newcastle’s pre-season training camp in Austria.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer Coup</h2> \n<p>Botman. Technically accomplished and physically imposing, the left-footed 22-year-old central defender’s £35m arrival on Tyneside from Lille is regarded as a significant coup, particularly as, among others, Serie A champions Milan were desperate for Botman’s signature. After kicking off his career in Ajax’s academy, Botman has joined the senior Netherlands squad for training camps and is regarded as on the verge of winning his first cap.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>Trippier will very much hope to be part of Gareth Southgate’s squad and, providing he stays fit, it would be a surprise were Howe’s first signing to be omitted. Wilson has a case for inclusion in England’s attacking ranks but the centre-forward needs to stay out of the treatment room. Meanwhile Guimarães should be on the plane to Doha with Brazil. Ditto Schär and Switzerland.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:46:34/embed.html\" data-alt=\"V\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:46:34/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p>Try a night out in the infamous Bigg Market and the adjacent Quayside but, be warned, no one wears a coat and you will have zero street cred if you appear in anything remotely woollen.

She doesn’t think she is an alcoholic herself, “but I do think I have a problem with drink, and I have abused it in the past.” Watching her drunk self on the show for the first time now brings her out in a cold sweat.</p> <p>What follows in her Channel 4 documentary, Alcohol, Dad and Me, is a deeply personal, very moving untangling of the part booze played in her upbringing. It looks at what it means to her now – and the slippery definitions of “problematic drinking” versus full-blown alcoholism – and what it means to be the adult child of a man now left by his wife of 30 years and unable to stop drinking.</p> <p>We watch her get ready for a night out with her girlfriends in Newcastle. She says she is much more contained than she was during her Geordie Shore years, and is looking forward to it (hell, we’re all looking forward to it – I haven’t been out or young for years), but – “I’m already sweating behind my knees thinking how poorly I’m going to be tomorrow.” Those slippery definitions, lubricated with the perspiration of hangovers and regret.</p> <p>“Three or four drinks,” her voiceover tells us over scenes of her downing about that number of limoncello shots as the night starts, “and I’m sociable, fun and I can function the next day. Any more and I don’t know when to stop. I’d go so far as to say I can’t stop.” As driven and ambitious as she is, she notes, it’s the one thing she can’t seem to control.</p> <p>The other “thing”, of course – as any child, spouse, friend or relative of an alcoholic will know – is her dad, John, and his drinking. The bulk of the programme concentrates on her evident, painful, unswerving love for him (“He could do more one-armed press-ups than Rocky!” she says, smiling at the memory) and the fear and misery that comes with that. John was always a heavy drinker – they reminisce about him drinking port when he “couldn’t be bothered” to drink eight pints of beer or cider – but Vicky says alcohol “really started to win” when he retired (“without a blimming plan” as he puts it) eight years ago. He is now 63, has cirrhosis of the liver and – brief periods of sobriety aside – is still drinking, despite various forms of therapy, including AA.</p> <p>They attend a couple of counselling sessions together and we see Vicky’s anger flare amid the grinding sadness. “Fuckin’ take your own advice,” she says, with furious pleading in her voice, when he recommends she try to take control of her own drinking. And: “If you’re fucking lucky,” she responds through tears when he warns her that he may still be making the same futile promises to her in 10 years’ time.</p> <p>She is an absolute gift of a presenter: commanding, charismatic, beadily intelligent, unfailingly honest and unflaggingly articulate. You hope that, off the back of the absolute blinder she plays here, she will be given the opportunity to broaden her reach.</p> <p>Alcohol, Dad and Me is trying to do too much in one hour. Any one of its concerns – from the intergenerational effects of trauma, via the roots of addiction, to the awful conundrum presented by the desire to support the addict (and when does that become enabling?) and the need to protect oneself – could easily fill a whole programme. Vicky’s own “problematic” drinking rather fades from the picture as John falls off the wagon, and her mother’s story could fill another hour, too. Add to that the inchoate nature of alcoholism itself and the lies, myths and denials that surround it and its victims, and there is a great need for a strong controlling hand on the directorial tiller, which is not always met.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Pattison has hacked a path, and you gladly – if that’s the word – follow. She seems to get genuine insight out of the sessions she has with experts and the people she meets who have been through some of the same experiences as she has. The ethics of putting John through his sessions on camera feels much more problematic, and there is no closing word on him or how he has been doing since the programme was made.</p> <p>But Vicky recently, and for the first time ever, came home from a night out while others went on without her. She marvels about how huge a tiny thing can be. For good, sometimes, let us hope.</p> <p>• Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just 13% backed the move, while 34% expressed no view.</p> <p>Among voters who backed the Conservatives in 2019, 41% were against the plan while 21% were in favour.

It’s time to end this system of unchecked political patronage and ensure all our lawmakers are elected by the people they serve.”</p> <p>While previous prime ministers have appointed peers at the end of their administration, Johnson was accused by the former Lord Speaker Helene Hayman of attempting to “trash constitutional norms”. She told the BBC: “I’m not sure Boris Johnson understands that having a challenging House of Lords actually improves government policy and improves legislation.”</p> <p>The current Lord Speaker, John McFall, wrote to both Tory leadership contenders to urge them not to follow suit and inject their own influx of peers. Rishi Sunak is understood to have responded but Liz Truss has not.</p> <p>Analysis by the Institute for Government found that in just three years, Johnson had already made 86 appointments to the Lords – equivalent to 10% of its current size.</p> <p>Though the House of Lords appointment commission can advise against certain candidates being given peerages, the thinktank’s deputy director, Hannah White, said that “on his way out of Downing Street there will be even less incentive on Johnson to exercise restraint”.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said that given the number of peers stepping down, some new members were essential to keep the expertise and outlook of parliament’s upper chamber fresh and ensure it could continue scrutinising legislation.

The 20-year-old, in action at the Commonwealth Games, has been inspired by her lifelong friend Toone’s stunning Euro 2022 success. </p> <p>Toone scored a brilliant opener in England’s 2-1 extra-time win over Germany on Sunday to help the Lionesses win their first major tournament. It came after Hodgkinson won 800m silver at last month’s World Championships in Eugene. </p> <p>The pair went to Fred Longworth High School in Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, having grown up together. </p> <p>“We are just two young girls living their dreams,” said Hodgkinson, who reached Saturday’s 800m final at the Commonwealth Games following Tuesday’s heats. “I was always referred to as the ‘mini Ella’ growing up at school. So we kept in touch from that and she was in Tokyo last year as well with the football. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9029ef5ed9a884093b3b31a03815819de8dc1266\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9029ef5ed9a884093b3b31a03815819de8dc1266/5_0_3428_2058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Keely Hodgkinson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Keely Hodgkinson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Ella did so well to score as well. I know she’s on cloud nine so big congrats to her, it’s good to see. We went to school together. She was two years older than me but somehow we just ended up getting on really well. We did some cross countries - I always tended to beat her on the running, that was my forte, but she was naturally very good, she’s got a lot of talent. </p> <p>“She used to play on our boys’ football team and she was smoking them, so there was absolutely no way she wasn’t going to make it. She’s very good. We were raised about four miles away from each other, so it’s putting our hometowns on the map and I know they are very proud of us. </p> <p>“I thought it (Sunday) was absolutely amazing, I really enjoyed watching it. What that’s going to do for women’s football, women’s sport, I’ve seen all the little girls watching it and it’s really nice for them to see that because before they wouldn’t have had that.” </p> <p>Hodgkinson is joined in Saturday’s final in Birmingham by England teammate Alexandra Bell and Scotland’s Laura Muir. She added: “It’s actually a very world-class field. I feel like the only people missing is probably the Americans and some of the Ethiopians. It’s not going to be easy but I hope I can come away with gold this time.” <strong>(PA Media)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62e9487b8f08b58de97eb3e5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-02T15:54:30.567Z\">4.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bowls:</strong> In the Para-lawn bowls men’s pairs B6-B8 gold medal match, Garry Brown and Kevin Wallace of Scotland trail Australia 4-3 after five ends.

Today has once again been dominated by Joe Fraser and Jake Jarman, really the two world-class performers of this event. </p> <p>Jarman won a men’s record fourth gold medal of the Games with some unbelievable vaulting, nailing his Dragulescu (a handspring double front with a half twist), then his Kaz 2.5 (which requires a total of three-and-a-half twists). It is hard not to overstate how incredibly impressive this has all been from 20-year-old Jarman, as that is some of the best vaulting from any gymnast today. For comparison, the 2020 Olympic vaulting champion won with the score of <strong>14.866</strong>. Jarman scored <strong>14.916</strong> today.<br><br>Then there is Fraser, who will be back out for the high bar as he also chases a fourth gold medal. As the top qualifier, he will be the favourite. This has been an incredible meet in its own way for Fraser considering his recent foot fracture and ruptured appendix. He is such a talented gymnast, now a World and Commonwealth parallel bars champion, and it feels like this event is setting him up for more global success once he is fully healthy.</p> <p>Alice Kinsella will get one final opportunity at redemption in the floor final, where she was the first qualifier. What started as such a great meet for her with a really impressive performance to lead England to team gold has really fallen apart. Two major errors cost her in the balance beam final, leaving her in fourth place on her best event.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62e9355d8f08b58de97eb2bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-02T14:34:00.522Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Women’s netball:</strong> Final score in Pool A – Jamaica 78-34 Scotland.</p> <p>As a result, the top of Pool A looks like this:</p> <p>1) Australia 8pts<br>2) Jamaica 8pts<br>3) South Africa 2pts<br>4) Wales 2pts</p> <p>Australia and Jamaica have both played four, RSA and Wales have played three.

Mira laughs in disbelief. At least it’s the final premiere, and it has brought her to France, away from a failed relationship, and where she is about to start shooting a new project. Something worthy and arty and European – a remake of the (real) 1915 Louis Feuillade serial, Les Vampires.</p> <p>Irma Vep (Sky Atlantic/Now) is a fun, spiky eight-part series that is so meta it makes my head hurt. Mira’s character in the arthouse remake is Irma Vep, a velvet-catsuited villainess and part of the criminal gang known as the Vampires – “pure evil but in a sexy kind of way”, as René Vidal (Vincent Macaigne), the director, explains to her. Irma Vep also happens to be the real-life name of a 1996 film by Olivier Assayas, who has written and directed this show. Here, René also made an earlier Irma Vep film and married its star, as did Assayas, who married the actor Maggie Cheung, who played Vep in his 1996 film. Yes, meta all the way.</p> <p>So Assayas has made a TV remake of his own film, which was about making a remake of the 1915 original, with a director (named René Vidal in both) who is based on Assayas himself. I don’t even know if I’ve got that right, but it doesn’t really matter – it stands up without having to know the history – except to raise the idea that it’s all very clever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f1b5aa804b1ad907eaaf19b9032635dd17d8132d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1b5aa804b1ad907eaaf19b9032635dd17d8132d/0_362_5427_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Devon Ross as Regina in Irma Vep, with angular hair and expert makeup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Has appealing bite … Devon Ross as Regina in Irma Vep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It mostly is. It has grand ideas, expressed in entertaining ways, about the difference (or not) between art and “content”, and the jaundiced pall money casts over everything. René, the struggling auteur, is determined to stay true to Feuillade’s vision, but the cosmetics corporation financing the project is more interested in making Mira the new face of their perfume brand. Mira wants to be taken seriously, even if her agent is trying to get her to cash in and become the female Silver Surfer.</p> <p>I don’t have a high tolerance for films (or in this case TV programmes) about film-making, but Irma Vep has appealing bite – mainly of the hand that feeds it, with all the trashing of prestige TV the characters do. René refuses to accept he is making television. “It’s a film,” he quibbles, “admittedly a bit long, divided into eight pieces.” His cast sit around in a later episode, debating the merits of cinema versus the streaming giants, and the obsession with ratings and marketing, even the shift in the balance of power towards rabid online fans. “Because we have platforms, they need content, so you stretch the content,” says Edmond, one of René’s leads. “You adapt to the market – that’s the opposite of art.”</p> <p>Is René remaking Irma Vep because the industry is now so reliant on reboots, or is it because he still has, as his therapist suggests, “unresolved” issues following his divorce from its star? Regardless, it’s a thankless shoot, dealing with unbiddable actors who can’t understand their characters’ motivations, or are angling for sex scenes, complete with intimacy directors (this being 2022), as a way to get close to former lovers.</p> <p>The supporting characters – and cast – are wonderful, from the smart, film-obsessed Regina (Devon Ross), who wants to be a director but whose job is to nanny Mira, to the seen-it-all-before costume director Zoe (Jeanne Balibar) and the obscene, and scene-stealing, crack-addicted German actor Gottfried (Lars Eidinger).</p> <p>It’s a visual treat for those of us who got hooked on chic Frenchness via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/12/call-my-agents-camille-cottin-on-becoming-a-sex-symbol-in-her-40s-theres-a-desire-to-see-women-whove-been-invisible\">Call My Agent</a>; even Emily in Paris gets a wry namecheck here. And it is funny, particularly René’s farcical film shoot. When we’re thrown a self-referential bone – a Sonic Youth T-shirt here (the band’s Thurston Moore has done the music), an actor from the 1996 film popping up there – you can either feel clever for spotting it, or view it as Assayas skewering the tiresome trend for referencing everything.</p> <p>There are some boring scenes, and even bad ones – those between Mira and her former assistant and lover, Laurie, who is now married to Herman, the blockbuster’s director, are marred not only by lack of chemistry but also by some painful exposition. By this point, you might be wondering if Assayas is having us on. Entertaining, disorienting, at times annoying, Irma Vep is like being tickled. <br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/02/england-edge-out-australia-in-first-3x3-basketball-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T21:04:01Z","webTitle":"Hesson’s last-gasp shot edges England past Australia in 3x3 basketball final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/england-edge-out-australia-in-first-3x3-basketball-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/02/england-edge-out-australia-in-first-3x3-basketball-final","fields":{"headline":"Hesson’s last-gasp shot edges England past Australia in 3x3 basketball final","trailText":"England beat Australia 17-16 to win gold in the first 3X3 men’s basketball Commonwealth Games final","byline":"Tumaini Carayol","body":"<p>The first edition of the frenetic, hyperactive game of 3x3 basketball at the Commonwealth Games came to an end on Tuesday evening as England defeated Australia 17-16 in the most dramatic circumstances.

That much becomes pretty clear, pretty quickly during the early episodes of All or Nothing: Arsenal – Amazon’s fly‑on‑the-wall documentary of the club’s 2021‑22 season. His team talks are life and death: opponents are there to be killed, expletives screeched. “Whatever happens I don’t want one fucking player complaining, one fucking player walking,” he demands from the Emirates Stadium changing room at half‑time, before sending the team back out to face Chelsea.</p> \n<p>His intensity doesn’t let up as I sit opposite him, on a picnic bench outside Arsenal’s London Colney training centre, before the documentary’s release. “It’s who I am,” Arteta says, as he dispatches my questions with a ruthless efficiency and the unfaltering stare of a hawk studying its prey.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/25/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-1-arsenal\">Premier League 2022-23 preview No 1: Arsenal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“The passion that I feel for this game, for this club, is what drives that emotion and that level of participation and that desire and hunger to be the best and improve at all times.”</p> \n<p>The 40-year-old Arteta is the linchpin of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jul/09/amazon-to-film-behind-the-scenes-arsenal-documentary-for-2021-22-season-all-or-nothing\" title=\"\">Amazon’s latest reality‑documentary series</a>. Others drift in and out with single‑episode arcs but his narrative presents the clearest through-line: can the league’s youngest manager lead its youngest team from rock bottom to improbable heights?</p> \n<p>The answer: sort of.</p> \n<p>After losing the first three games, Arsenal finished fifth, in the Europa League places, higher than the eighth of the previous two seasons, but they did so after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/12/tottenham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">giving up a commanding position</a> for the much-coveted fourth Champions League place to Tottenham. Most Arsenal fans (of which I am one) would agree the season represented steady progress on and off the pitch, if not a resounding triumph. As for the manager, he silenced many of his critics.</p> \n<p>“I don’t ask for people to like me or love me,” he says. “It is who I am. That’s their choice. And my choice is always … to try to be myself and be the person with the values that I have been raised with.”</p> \n<p>Self-image is of little importance. “It doesn’t [concern me] but it concerns my loved ones and obviously everybody likes to be liked. But what I guarantee you are going to see is who I am and not only me, about who we are as a club, which is the most important thing, much more important than me, and that perception, hopefully, is positive. That worries me much more than my personal one.”</p> \n<p>At times our conversation feels like an extension of the series: a club-managed, carefully curated peek behind the curtain. He is affable and courteous, but guarded. Shortly before we are due to meet the promised interview time is significantly cut down; not even my assurances that I’m an Arsenal season-ticket holder can persuade him to stay and open up. Perhaps it is out of shyness; perhaps a general distrust of the media (he regularly highlights media hostility toward him throughout the series).</p> \n<p>Arteta’s trepidation is probably understandable, given the intensity of the criticism he received last season. Arsenal’s shocking start to it is well documented: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/13/canos-and-nrgaard-sink-arsenal-to-give-brentford-dream-start\" title=\"\">deservedly beaten by Brentford</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/22/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/28/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City</a>; zero points and zero goals; bottom of the league.

We can have the best intention but you have to win football matches. And when you don’t as a manager, you get sacked. It’s as simple and as clear as that.”</p> \n<p>It is an evasive answer but he is at least more direct about fans such as me who had their faith in him and the club restored over the course of the season. “I’m so grateful that now they are happy that we are continuing this journey together, because without our supporters it doesn’t make any sense what we do.</p> \n<p>“One of our biggest responsibilities – and [it’s a] beautiful thing – is to make people happy and enjoy certain moments in their lives. And we are responsible for that, and it is a big pressure, but at the same time is an incredible power to have.”</p> \n<p>After the first three defeats Arteta chose his pre-match talk in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/sep/11/arsenal-norwich-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the next game against Norwich</a> to share a story from his childhood. He was born with <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10561400/mikel-arteta-wife-lorena-bernal-heart-operation/\" title=\"\">a heart condition</a> that stopped his heart getting the right supply of clean blood. At two years old he had surgery, becoming one of the first in Spain to undergo such an operation. The doctors ruled out sports. But by the time he was three he was in love with football; he still remembers his first black and white ball and his first football shirt (Barcelona).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9253dd15-d476-4136-81ed-38fa5743c237\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oPLqI1B4V34?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“I was much more aware [of the heart condition] when I was developing and growing, because there were some issues and there were some restrictions, but I was probably not conscious about that [potential repercussions]. My parents were. They were really brave, because they push and push and push and [said]: ‘We’re going to try to get the best doctor to give us advice.’ They were really honest, but at the same time brave, to allow me to do certain things.”</p> \n<p>His mum always worried about him playing. “My mum never wanted to watch me play because in the back of her mind that issue was always there, that when I push my heart to the limit, what is going to happen?”</p> \n<p>And his dad? “My dad was a bit stronger and I think realised: ‘I’m not going to stop him whether he’s a professional footballer or he plays with the amateurs. [No matter how] competitive it is, he’s going to play the same way.’”</p> \n<p>Arteta was, he says, a very active child who played a lot of tennis, as well as football. He struggled to sit still. “It was difficult to keep me seated on that table. But I was pretty responsible. So when I knew that I had to do something. I always did it.”</p> \n<p>Judging by Arteta’s reputation as a manager and a player it is easy to imagine him as a well-drilled, highly disciplined child. “My father in that sense was really, really disciplined with me. The threat was simple and very effective: if you don’t do it, you don’t play football. So it was no choice for me.”</p> \n<p>Does he channel his father in his management of his players? “The way you’ve been raised and educated is a huge part of who you are as a person – as a father as well, to try to get those values across to your kids as well. So this is what I try to do.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In nearly three years as a manager Arteta has established his reputation as a staunch disciplinarian with his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/articles/c6yp3lv65zeo\" title=\"\">“non‑negotiables”</a> of respect, commitment, passion, a studious tactician and an effective coach. Granit Xhaka labels him a freak (“but in a positive way”), such is his attentiveness to the small details. He also seems to enjoy quirky team talks.</p> \n<p>Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/30/leicester-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the Leicester match at the King Power stadium</a>, he has the squad standing in a circle, rubbing their hands together as they visualise their success in the match, before grabbing each other’s hands and creating a bubble of energy. It’s a lot less cringe-worthy than it sounds and Arteta’s impassioned delivery helps him skirt any comparisons to David Brent (and in fairness the 45 minutes that followed was some of Arsenal’s best of the season).</p> \n<p>Is he studying management techniques in his spare time? “A lot. I like to read about other industries, a lot of sports. I have a lot of connections with other sports that are super rich in terms of how they manage the culture, how they manage different situations, how they apply the methods into the style of play that they want.</p> \n<p>“A lot of my education, it doesn’t stop here. Languages – if I could learn German, I will do it tomorrow, if I could. I think when I have time and when I’m in the car I’m always spending my time doing things like that.”</p> \n<p>Arteta rejects the idea he is a natural leader – “The role gives you the possibility to become a leader but the players decide who the leader is and they have to feel it” – and when asked why players buy into him with such fervour, he deflects to the collective.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2994933daa2b5aeae84c0057625c8384a0a2325b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2994933daa2b5aeae84c0057625c8384a0a2325b/913_301_2212_1327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mikel Arteta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arteta has established a reputation as a staunch disciplinarian at Arsenal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“We have the right people here to try to convince them they are in the best club in the world, trying to do the right things, things that are beneficial for them, that they’re going to feel protected if they fail and that they’re going to be trusted to do what we asked them to do. You cannot do that by yourself.”</p> \n<p>As for the hardest aspect of management: “Probably that line between how personal it gets and how professional it gets and when … you have to make a decision based on the professional.” He doesn’t elaborate on specifics, but I’m not sure he needs to.</p> \n<p>He says he has lost sleep over the job, breaking into a rare smile, though he quickly adds that such insomnia is infrequent. “I think I’m quite good at getting to sleep. One thing really important for me is to make sure that what is happening tomorrow is under control. And the things that I have to do tomorrow, they are already on the way to getting done. If I don’t have that, then I find it really, really difficult.”</p> \n<p>For Arteta one of the biggest challenges of the job is not bringing his work home with him, made all the harder with his three boys – aged 13, 10 and seven – having caught the football bug. “They love football and very naturally they will ask me what happened or why didn’t he play?” And ask for updates on the summer’s transfer business? “Yes, the whole summer,” he says, with an air of exhaustion.</p> \n<p>Do they at least have a set of non-negotiables similar to your players? “They do have, especially with their mum, because she’s the one that spends long hours and [takes] the responsibility with them. So mum is the one that they really need to look after … and I’m really lucky because they are pretty amazing kids.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/premier-league-2022-23-fan-previews-part-one-arsenal-to-leeds\">Premier League 2022-23 fan previews, part one: Arsenal to Leeds</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Watching Arteta in the documentary, it’s impossible not to think of Arteta’s old boss Arsène Wenger and his own obsessive commitment to the game.</p> \n<p>When Wenger released his memoir last November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/08/arsene-wenger-sweat-dangerous-arsenal-football-manager\" title=\"\">he spoke about</a> his regret at not taking care of his family in the way he should have.

Adam Bandt will launch a scathing attack on<strong> </strong>the Liberal party as jostling over the climate bill reaches a climax. “Virtual” nurses may be needed to meet the 24/7 aged care staff mandate. And an official visit to Taiwan by Nancy Pelosi has sparked a furious response from China.</p> \n<p><strong>Adam Bandt will declare the Greens are in a “powerful position” and the Liberals are “irrelevant”</strong> as he outlines his party’s position on Labor’s climate target bills during an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/greens-in-powerful-position-on-climate-as-labor-faces-scrutiny-over-coalitions-gas-fired-recovery-projects\">address to the National Press Club today</a>. With the Albanese government pressing for a vote on the legislation in the House of Representatives this week, the Greens met twice yesterday to consider their stance. Crossbenchers believe they have secured agreement for amendments including a five-year statutory review of the legislation. The Greens have pushed Labor to ensure the 43% emissions reduction target for 2030 is a floor and not a ceiling, and for the inclusion of a climate trigger in environment laws.</p> \n<p><strong>The Albanese government should consider allowing “virtual” nurses to help meet a new 24/7 staff mandate for aged care homes,</strong> a leading health executive says. Martin Bowles, the chief executive of Calvary Health Care, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/virtual-nurses-may-be-needed-to-meet-247-aged-care-staff-mandate-top-health-executive-says\">chronic staff shortages in the sector will make it hard to meet the round-the-clock requirement</a> and remote nurses should be considered.<strong> </strong>The aged care minister, Anika Wells, said health department modelling found that 869 extra nurses were needed to fulfil the new mandate but others say the number could be much higher.</p> \n<p><strong>The US House of Representatives speaker,</strong> <strong>Nancy Pelosi, has landed in Taiwan for a controversial visit to the self-ruled island</strong>, offering “unwavering commitment” to supporting its democracy as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/nancy-pelosi-lands-in-taiwan-amid-soaring-tensions-with-china\">already heightened tensions with China escalate</a>.

Now, though, England’s lionheart could feel it rushing back.</p> <p>“I didn’t have the hunger, no way,” he said. “You can easily say in each interview, ‘I’m ready, I’m confident’. But it’s not until you get out on those blocks that you feel ready – and I didn’t feel ready in the 100m. I felt lost. I didn’t know where I was. But I’ve got that renewed hunger for Paris now.

Recommendations from that report “continue to be relevant”, the latest one says.</p> <p>Some headwinds are global, such as supply chain disruptions in the wake of Covid. Building local capability, including redundancy when supplies fail, may be costly and drag on productivity gains compared with previous competitive trade approaches.</p> <p>While Australia is “highly exposed” to the threats of climate change, weaning the economy off fossil fuel industries will bring its own risks. Despite the need to handle the transition efficiently, the report notably did not recommend putting a price on carbon.</p> <p>“Decarbonising the economy in line with international commitments over the next thirty years will have a non-trivial bearing on productivity outcomes,” the report said.</p> <p>Developing and implementing new technologies will require new investment to replace, rather than increase, the economy’s existing capital stock, it said.</p> <p>In some cases that may raise production costs – such as dropping coal in steel-making – at least until the replacement technologies fall in costs.

Still, the same slowdown in Australia’s productivity advances have been shared elsewhere too, crimping other nations’ ability to increase living standards.</p> <p>For Australia, productivity gains have “slowed significantly” in the past decade”.</p> <p>“If, over the decade, productivity had instead grown at an annual rate consistent with the average over the past 60 years [1.7% compared to 1.1%], gross national income per person would have been around $4600 higher [or 6%] in 2020 ,” the report said.</p> <p>The Covid-imposed changes, such as increased working from home, provide some pointers to how productivity rates can be increased.</p> <p>“The uplift in online capacity [among both businesses and households] combined with a broader embrace of the innovative potential of digital technology, can transform the way the economy operates,” the report said.</p> <p>With about 90% of workers now in services, extracting ever higher output can become a harder task than improving production from sectors such as mining and farming. The latter sectors have benefited from increased application of capital, trimming the workforce, a shift harder to apply to some services at least.</p> <p>Australia has historically benefited from the attraction of migrants who have brought fresh skills and innovation. But “global migration patterns have not returned to those observed prior to the pandemic and it is not guaranteed that Australia will remain as attractive to working migrants as it was previously”, the report said.</p> <p>Of course, increasing productivity doesn’t mean the spoils are shared evenly, as Sally McManus, the ACTU head, noted on Twitter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sallymcmanus/status/1553867484188807169\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Todays graph from ABS national accounts: Productivity growth does not automatically make wages rise. <a href=\"https://t.co/sumq94btaP\">pic.twitter.com/sumq94btaP</a></p>&mdash; Sally McManus (@sallymcmanus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sallymcmanus/status/1553867484188807169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 31, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Similarly, the report concedes not everything that is important can be measured and valued, including mental health and a clean environment.</p> <p>“If there are no markets to provide an indication of how different environmental outcomes are valued, or regulations to influence behaviour to achieve environmental outcomes valued by the community, then this can mean there are environmental consequences of productivity growth that detract from people’s wellbeing,” it said.</p> <p>One consequence of the attention on productivity may be that the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, revises the projections used in his budget. According to John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra who served as a senior economist with both Treasury and the Reserve Bank, the Morrison government relied on 1.5% annual growth.</p> <p>“It’s a bit unrealistic because it’s assuming that we’re going to get a pickup in the productivity growth rate,” Hawkins. “There’s no sign of that happening anytime soon, and that’s making the forecasts a bit rosy.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/03/commonwealth-games-mollie-ocallaghan-shocks-mckeon-in-birmingham-as-kennedy-wins-pole-vault-gold","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T20:22:01Z","webTitle":"Mollie O’Callaghan shocks McKeon as Kennedy wins Birmingham pole vault gold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/03/commonwealth-games-mollie-ocallaghan-shocks-mckeon-in-birmingham-as-kennedy-wins-pole-vault-gold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/03/commonwealth-games-mollie-ocallaghan-shocks-mckeon-in-birmingham-as-kennedy-wins-pole-vault-gold","fields":{"headline":"Mollie O’Callaghan shocks McKeon as Kennedy wins Birmingham pole vault gold","trailText":"Australia raked in more gold medals as Ariarne Titmus set an 800m freestyle Games record and Cody Simpson finished fifth in the 100m butterfly","byline":"Emma Kemp","body":"<p>Mollie O’Callaghan shocked Emma McKeon and Shayna Jack to clinch gold in the women’s 100m freestyle, as Ariarne Titmus set an 800m freestyle Commonwealth Games record and Cody Simpson finished fifth in the men’s 100m butterfly final.</p> <p>Australia raked in more gold medals in Birmingham on day five, when Australian pole vaulter Nina Kennedy kicked off the athletics with a comfortable win, Kate McDonald upset gymnastics golden girl Georgia Godwin and the men’s wheelchair basketball team stood atop the podium.

Surely not a young couple who have ‘just’ 40k to do up an already over-priced doer-upper","byline":"Chitra Ramaswamy","body":"<p>Such is the total state of this country that when I first saw the title of this series I assumed it was a euphemism for Britain. As in: here’s Worst House on the Street, a hard-hitting Channel 4 documentary about the UK housing crisis. Next, set the tape – as my mum would say – for Sick Man of Europe, an unflinching look at our shrinking economy, how countries closed their borders one by one to UK air travel during the pandemic, and … you get my drift. How grim. But, also, nice one, Channel 4. What else should a public broadcaster be doing while the ideological – sorry, formal – process of selling it off continues? You get the TV programming you deserve.</p> <p>Then I Googled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/30/worst-house-on-the-street-is-this-the-most-ill-advised-property-show-yet\">Worst House on the Street (Channel 4)</a>. Oh. It’s another property programme. The Place in the Sun of 2022, if you like. The logical outcome of a situation, where, even if you have a place in the sun – which, obviously, you don’t – you can’t get to it because all the flights are cancelled. And a place in the sun is deeply concerning because Europe is on fire. What does a nation primed over generations to be infatuated with home ownership need in such end times? A classic Channel 4 property programme about how whacking a £4,750 porch on to the front of your “ultimate doer-upper” could add 2% to the value. What the Worst Country in Europe needs, in short, is Worst House on the Street.</p> <p>This warped mirror held up to our broken society is presented by a chipper brother and sister duo, Stuart and Scarlette Douglas. They have been renovating properties for 15 years and were on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/25/george-clarke-flipping-fast-review-gordon-and-pamela\">George Clarke’s Flipping Fast</a>, in which six novice teams fought it out over a year to make the biggest profit on their properties. Which sounds about as fun as finding asbestos in your ceiling. The Douglas duo seem lovely even if it’s all a bit gendered: he’s the haggler when it comes to natural stone worktops; she does the sensitive chat about whether to go for flatpack or bespoke built-in wardrobes blah, blah, blah. There are some half-hearted attempts at sibling rivalry, but my cynicism levels are so high now that I found myself wondering if they are even related in real life. They are, and run an aspirational property design and development agency called Kindred Elite. Of course they do.</p> <p>WHOTS is based on the adage that says you buy the worst house on the best street if you want to maximise profit. Or, find a property show loophole at a time of rising rents, house prices, pay freezes and a dearth of affordable homes. In this case, the worst house is a 1930s three-bed terrace in Purley, Croydon, that costs … £415k. Which, for anyone outside the sick man of Europe, is a perfect example not of picking up a bargain, but the eyewatering extent of our housing crisis. And our mauvaise foi.</p> <p>Harry, a public affairs consultant, and Yimika, a marketing manager, are in their late 20s. They recently married, and have scraped every penny together to buy the house, paid £15k over the asking price, and have been living with Yimika’s family for a year to save for renovations. One can only assume they must have cancelled their Netflix subscription and put the kibosh on takeaway flat whites, too. Anyway, they’ve got “just” £40k to do up the wreck and plan to move in in six weeks. Cue, leaping off the sofa to scream at the TV: “WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?!’”</p> <p>The rest is like bad graffiti printed on the peeling wallpaper of your mouldy British soul. There’s the near-disaster relating to the removal of a chimney breast. The discovery of, yup, asbestos in the ceiling. The incessant talk of maximising budget, profit, and light. The happy ending, in which three valuations are done and, in direct opposition to reality, they have made a £32k profit. And the increasing pressure on our young couple, as the weeks drag on, the budget dwindles and the momentum of the build wanes. My favourite unintentional-exposition-of-the-patriarchy moment (most property programmes have them lurking in the walls) comes when Harry waxes lyrical about the spreadsheet they created “automatically” calculating their spend. “No, it doesn’t do it automatically,” says Yimika. “<em>I</em> put the figures in.” “Oh,” says Harry. “Ok. Cool. Sorry.”</p> <p>Look, I’m not being sniffy about property programmes or escapism. I understand that it’s part of the British psyche to watch endless episodes of 24 Hours in A&amp;E, while the NHS is being dismantled. I’ve put in my fair share of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/06/grand-designs-review-six-feet-under\">Grand Designs</a> hours over the centuries. I had a crush on Sarah Beeny in the 00s, like everyone else. But when you can picture the hand-rubbing execs around the table blue-sky-thinking-up-outside-the-box a property series for an age in which frontline workers are priced out of owning their own home in 98% of the country, you wonder if it has gone too far.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 3 August 2022.

Of course there are some others who aren’t here but my personal opinion is they will probably regret that.” That view was backed by the legendary decathlete Daley Thompson, who won three gold medals at the Commonwealth Games during his career.</p> <p>“I think that everybody has a choice and I think back in the day, it was less about earning a living and more about glory – for yourself and your country,” he said.” If there are people that want to earn a living and go and race in Zurich or wherever that might be, that’s fair enough. But from my own point of view, it was only ever about winning championships and being the best.</p> <p>“But I think everyone is entitled to their choice but the people who go for the money are missing out because it’s a brilliant place to be. The Olympic champion, Elaine Thompson-Herah, was running today, she’s here. If it’s good enough for her, it’s good enough for most people.”</p> <p>Thompson-Herah qualified joint-fastest for Wednesday 100m semi-finals, running an impressive 10.99sec. However, England’s Darryl Neita believes she can be the best in Birmingham – and hopes her pet chihuahua, Melon, will be watching on.</p> <p>Neita also looked superb as she ran 11.02 in her heat. And afterwards she insisted: “I’m always aiming for gold. Any time I step on the track I want gold. I’m going to get as close as I can.” </p> <p>Elsewhere Laura Muir, who won 1500m bronze in Eugene last month, reached the 800m final in 1min 58.84sec, joining Keely Hodgkinson and Alexandra Bell in Saturday’s showpiece.</p> <p>Muir, who will double up in the 800m and 1500m at these championships, said: “I feel I’m really competitive in both events. I’ve not run the Commonwealth Games for eight years. It’s on relatively home-ish ground so it’s very close and it was too good an opportunity not to do. I feel strong and fit enough to do both and run well in both.”</p> <p>Meanwhile Katarina Johnson-Thompson ended the first day of heptathlon leading by 109 points from Northern Ireland’s Kate O’Connor. The defending champion from Liverpool was only fifth after a disappointing 100m hurdles but a clearance of 1.84m in the high jump, followed by a 12.94m shot put and a 23.70sec 200m put her firmly in control.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/02/chelsea-kyle-walker-peters-southampton","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T19:23:52Z","webTitle":"Chelsea agree Carney Chukwuemeka deal and interested in Walker-Peters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/02/chelsea-kyle-walker-peters-southampton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/02/chelsea-kyle-walker-peters-southampton","fields":{"headline":"Chelsea agree Carney Chukwuemeka deal and interested in Walker-Peters","trailText":"Chelsea have agreed a deal with Aston Villa for Carney Chukwuemeka, believed to be worth up to £20m, and are interested in signing Southampton’s Kyle Walker-Peters","byline":"David Hytner, Jacob Steinberg and Fabrizio Romano","body":"<p>Chelsea have moved quickly to agree a deal with Aston Villa for Carney Chukwuemeka, believed to be worth up to £20m, and are interested in signing Southampton’s Kyle Walker‑Peters, with Thomas Tuchel looking to bring in a right‑sided defender to compete with Reece James.</p> \n<p>Chukwuemeka, 18, is one of the most highly rated prospects in England and there has been a scramble for his services since he made clear to Villa last November that he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/26/aston-villa-carney-chukwuemeka-will-not-sign-new-contract\" title=\"\">not sign a new contract</a> – to replace one scheduled to expire next June.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/02/newcastle-fail-bid-leicester-james-maddison-transfer-window\">Newcastle fail with £50m bid for Leicester midfielder James Maddison</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The midfielder, who was central to England’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/01/england-fight-back-to-seal-glory-at-under-19-european-championships\" title=\"\">victory at the European Under-19 Championship</a> last month, has been discussed by most of the top clubs in England and Germany although, up until the middle of last week, Barcelona and Milan were leading the race for him.</p> \n<p>Barça had offered a package worth a potential €15m (£12.5m) to Villa, albeit heavily incentivised, and Milan had put forward something similar. But Chelsea made contact with Villa last Friday and, with their co‑owner Todd Boehly negotiating directly with Villa’s chief executive, Christian Purslow, they reached agreement on an initial fee of £10m with a further £10m in potential add-ons.</p> \n<p>Chukwuemeka, who has made 14 Premier League appearances for Villa – two in the starting XI – will now try to agree personal terms with Chelsea. Villa and Chelsea released a joint statement at 5.30pm BSTto confirm they had reached an agreement on the fee; it is unusual for this to happen before the player has finalised terms.</p> \n<p>The likely arrival of Chukwuemeka follows Chelsea moving to buy the exciting 18-year-old midfielder Omari Hutchinson from Arsenal and the 18-year-old American goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina from Chicago Fire. There is a clear focus on bringing in more quality young players. Chelsea are targeting the 16-year-old Palmeiras forward Endrick, who is being courted by several of Europe’s biggest sides.

Inter’s Denzel Dumfries is another option at right-back.</p> \n<p>It is understood a bid of about £35m could be enough to buy Walker-Peters, though there have been suggestions Southampton will ask for more than £40m for the England international. The 25-year-old, who can operate on both flanks, is a key player for Southampton. He is strong on the ball and would lessen Tuchel’s dependence on James, who was sorely missed while out with a long‑term hamstring injury last season. Manchester United have also been linked with Walker-Peters.</p> \n<p>Chelsea’s need for additions at the back is plain. They were hit with a crisis in central defence after losing Andreas Christensen to Barcelona and Antonio Rüdiger to Real Madrid. They responded by signing Kalidou Koulibaly but have failed with an attempt to take Nathan Aké from Manchester City, missed out to Barça on Jules Koundé and have had little luck with attempts to buy Josko Gvardiol from RB Leipzig and Presnel Kimpembe from Paris Saint-Germain.</p> \n<p>The outlook will be much brighter if Chelsea sign Cucurella. Tuchel wants a left-footed defender and the intention is not only for the Spaniard to provide quality competition for Ben Chilwell at left wing-back. Chelsea also see Cucurella, who was previously targeted by City, as a possible candidate for the left centre-back position.</p> \n<p>Leicester value Fofana at £85m and have insisted he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/leicester-will-not-be-exploited-despite-transfer-unrest-insists-brendan-rodgers\" title=\"\">not for sale</a>, but Chelsea want to test that stance. There have been suggestions the 21-year-old wants to move to Stamford Bridge. </p> \n<p>The complication around any deal is Fofana has five years on his contract, giving Leicester plenty of leverage. One possibility is that Chelsea try to sweeten the deal by giving Leicester the chance to sign Levi Colwill. Brighton are also interested in the highly rated 19-year-old centre-back.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhones or the Google Play store on Android phones by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the yellow button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The arrival of defensive reinforcements could allow more defenders to leave Chelsea.

But a chain of serious incidents, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/dec/21/guardianleaders?CMP=gu_com\" title=\"\">1992 killing of Jonathan Zito</a> by Christopher Clunis, prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/oct/23/mentalhealth.politicalcolumnists\" title=\"\">growing calls for the policy to be reversed</a>.</p> <p>Minghella, who was programme lead at the then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/dec/13/mentalhealth\" title=\"\">Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health</a>, headed a team that evaluated a new approach pioneered in north Birmingham, under which crisis resolution teams provided 24-hour rapid response to people suffering psychotic episodes, or thought to be posing a risk to themselves or others.</p> <p>Her report, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Open_All_Hours.html?id=XTm-AAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Open All Hours</a> (1998), found that this approach enabled people to remain safely in the community, was just as effective as hospital treatment, but far less costly, and was greatly preferred by most individuals. As a result, the scheme was recommended the following year in the official <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/quality-standards-for-mental-health-services\" title=\"\">National Service Framework for mental health</a> and, in 2000, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/dec/04/health.policy1\" title=\"\">it became a central plank</a> of the Labour government’s NHS Plan.</p> <p>This pledged the establishment of 335 crisis teams across England over the following three years and guaranteed that anyone in contact with specialist mental health services would be able to contact a team at any time, forecasting a consequential 30% reduction in pressure on acute inpatient units.</p> <p>Although this optimistic forecast was never realised and the original model came to be watered down, especially when austerity hit the NHS later that decade, crisis teams remain central to NHS mental health care provision, and the threat to community-based care has receded.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ2z9_zLn0Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oQ2z9_zLn0Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The Edana Minghella Quartet performing What a Little Moonlight Can Do in 2019</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Born on the Isle of Wight, Edana was the daughter of Gloria (nee Arcari) and Edward Minghella, who ran an ice-cream business, cafe and hotel in Ryde. The third of five siblings, including her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/18/filmnews.theatrenews\" title=\"\">film director brother Anthony</a>, she attended St Therese Presentation convent school and, for A-levels, Ryde high school. The children helped out with the family business from an early age and became confident in handling customers of all kinds, not least those with health and addiction issues drawn to a seaside resort that was by then tipping into decline.</p> <p>After a false start on a drama degree at Hull University, where Anthony had also studied drama and was lecturing, Minghella returned to the island and worked in a care home before undertaking a four-year sandwich degree course at Brunel University and the Bethlem Royal and Maudsley hospitals in south London, qualifying as a mental health nurse in 1982 and graduating in psychology and sociology the following year.</p> <p>A fellow student on the course was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/15/jo-brand-you-ask-the-questions-going-forward-comedy\" title=\"\">comedian Jo Brand</a>, who admits to having envied the ease and speed with which Minghella picked up the skills of mental health nursing. The two became lifelong friends, with a shared commitment to fun and feminism, and were later even to perform together. Minghella also met social work student Toby Dickinson at Brunel, marrying in 1985. The union later ended in divorce.</p> <p>Minghella worked as a mental health nurse, service manager, tutor and lecturer at King’s College London, taking a teaching qualification at Surrey University, until she joined the Sainsbury centre in 1994. As well as her work on crisis teams, she led influential research into the effectiveness of so-called assertive outreach, working with people considered hard to engage via conventional mental health services.</p> <p>It was at the Sainsbury centre that Minghella worked alongside Heather Harper, who became her partner for the rest of her life, sharing a home first in Brighton and, from 2018, in the Liguria region of Italy.</p> <p>In 2001 Minghella was awarded a doctorate in mental health studies at Middlesex University and moved to the Audit Commission, the public spending watchdog, where she became head of mental health but also co-authored a groundbreaking study of failings in services for disabled children and their families.</p> <p>As in all her work, she was indignant and outspoken on behalf of people ill-served by the state. But she went further, bringing children with disabilities into the research process itself through what was at the time still an innovative idea of forming a reference group for the project.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MirwqldpmM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8MirwqldpmM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Minghella co-wrote with her younger brother, Dominic, much of the second series of the ITV drama <a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xuf90u\" title=\"\">Doc Martin</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>After a brief secondment to the new but short-lived Healthcare Commission, which took over some of the Audit Commission’s functions, Minghella left full-time employment to work as a consultant. She continued to produce definitive research and analysis, co-developing and writing national guidance on commissioning services for dementia and extending her interest to care and support for people with personality disorders, learning disabilities and/or autism.</p> <p>One of her last studies, published in 2020, was a typically incisive report for social change agency NDTi – where she was an associate – on the persisting problem of people with mental illness in need of hospital care being sent long distances from their home areas.</p> <p>The greater flexibility of consultancy work enabled Minghella to develop other interests. She co-wrote with her younger brother, Dominic, much of the second series (2005-06) of the popular ITV drama Doc Martin, ran writing workshops in Italy and, above all, fulfilled in later life a long-held ambition to sing jazz professionally.</p> <p>Encouraged and assisted by the established singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/23/liane-carroll-right-to-love-review-jazz\" title=\"\">Liane Carroll</a>, who was subsequently to produce her two albums, <a href=\"https://www.edanaminghellajazz.com/listen.html\" title=\"\">Still on My Feet</a> (2011) and <a href=\"https://www.edanaminghellajazz.com/\" title=\"\">All Or Nothing</a> (2016), Minghella put together an accomplished band and became a regular performer at leading jazz venues in London and the south-east. Singing enabled her to give free rein to her effervescent personality, and her distinctive voice and fresh interpretation of jazz standards were widely acclaimed.</p> <p>After moving to Italy, her love of which she shared prolifically and infectiously on social media, she returned occasionally to perform in the UK. However, the Covid pandemic and her cancer were to restrict opportunities in recent years.</p> <p>She is survived by Heather and by Edward, aged 101, Dominic and her sisters Gioia and Loretta.</p> <p><em>• </em>Edana Louise Minghella, healthcare researcher and jazz singer, born 14 May 1959; died 13 July 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/02/england-women-south-africa-commonwealth-games-cricket-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T19:02:29Z","webTitle":"Alice Capsey’s bat inspires England to victory over South Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/england-women-south-africa-commonwealth-games-cricket-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/02/england-women-south-africa-commonwealth-games-cricket-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Alice Capsey’s bat inspires England to victory over South Africa","trailText":"The hosts won by 26 runs after scoring 167 for five in their 20 overs to all but qualify for the Commonwealth Games semi-finals","byline":"Geoff Lemon at Edgbaston","body":"<p>England’s women, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/25/england-south-africa-women-third-twenty20-match-report\" title=\"\">trounced South Africa through bilateral matches this summer</a>, delivered them one last defeat that all but qualified them for a Commonwealth Games semi-final in T20 cricket. The eenage sensation Alice Capsey was again the key for England’s batting, with an even 50 out of 167 for five. South Africa never looked like meeting that pace in the chase, finishing on 141 for four.</p> <p>With England’s regular captain, Heather Knight, still on crutches with a hip injury, Capsey has made the most of her absence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/30/teenager-alice-capsey-shines-as-england-chase-down-sri-lanka-total\" title=\"\">Her innings of 44 on Commonwealth Games debut</a> steadied a wobbling run chase against Sri Lanka last Sunday, then she backed it up with her first half-century for England in this match.

But that brought Capsey to the crease and she smashed three balls over the off-side field in one Nadine de Klerk over after Danni Wyatt had scored boundaries of her own from the first two balls. Ismail returned to take Wyatt’s edge for a catch behind for 27 but Capsey carried on, flaying Ismai for four and a couple more from De Klerk, who was put on ice for the day having conceded 34 from two overs.</p> <p>Still, from 79 for two at the halfway mark, England did manage to stammer. Stand-in captain Natalie Sciver nicked a ball behind from Anneke Bosch, Capsey charged the spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba and chipped a return catch after raising her milestone, then Maia Bouchier was run out next ball trying to return for a second run.</p> <p>But South Africa could not press home the advantage at 94 for five, with the wicketkeeper, Amy Jones, and pace leader Katherine Brunt looting 73 runs from the final six overs. Jones rifled shots through the off side, while Brunt went huge over the midwicket rope off Bosch, before pulling out a perfect ramp shot for four from the returning Ismail. When Jones iced the cake with a last-ball six over midwicket from Ayabonga Khaka, there was no doubt that England had all the momentum.</p> <p>South Africa’s in reply made exactly the same mistakes that they had made in their first match of the tournament against New Zealand. Openers, Bosch and Tazmin Brits, have historically struggled to score at a high enough rate with the fielding restrictions in place and while they bashed the occasional boundary, there were far too many dot balls in between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f136fbf97c9cec3661237100cb83fe08c4ea3482\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f136fbf97c9cec3661237100cb83fe08c4ea3482/0_84_3263_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Sophie Ecclestone bowls out South Africa’s Anneke Bosch at Edgbaston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anneke Bosch is bowled by England’s Sophie Ecclestone as South Africa’s run chase faltered.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The partnership lasted into the 10th over but did not get far above a run a ball, when South Africa had needed more than eight runs per over from the start. It took a beauty of a delivery from left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone to break through, bowling Bosch through the gate from around the wicket for 32. Brits followed her in the 13th over, stumped while dragging her foot out her ground while missing a reverse ramp attempt off Freya Kemp.</p> <p>As in the New Zealand game, that left South Africa’s best batters far too much to do, needing nearly 12 runs an over to win. Laura Wolvaardt and Chloe Tryon did their best, sacking 15 runs from a Sarah Glenn over to keep the pulse beating, but Ecclestone was typically parsimonious and Brunt returned to take the key wicket, foxing Tryon with a slower ball that she could only hit down to long-on, rather than over the top for six.</p> <p>Tryon fell for 16, Mignon du Preez a few balls later for a single run and, while Wolvaardt batted through with Sune Luus to make 41 from 33 balls, she had to attack the target from too far back. South Africa may be missing the injured Dane van Niekerk, the absent Marizanne Kapp, and the retired Lizelle Lee, but it is a sharp fall for the team that swept all before them to the semi-finals of the 50-over World Cup only a couple of months ago. The next tier of players have not delivered.</p> <p>England, on the other hand, have built up an enviable level of depth, and will play New Zealand on Thursday to settle who will finish in Group B’s top spot, who will finish second, and who will face Australia in a semi-final.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/02/idaho-abortion-ban-justice-department-sues","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T19:00:49Z","webTitle":"Justice department sues Idaho over state’s near-total abortion ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/02/idaho-abortion-ban-justice-department-sues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/02/idaho-abortion-ban-justice-department-sues","fields":{"headline":"Justice department sues Idaho over state’s near-total abortion ban","trailText":"Lawsuit is DoJ’s first piece of litigation aimed at protecting abortion access since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade","byline":"Gloria Oladipo","body":"<p>The Biden administration’s Department of Justice is suing Idaho over the state’s near-total abortion ban, set to take effect on 25 August.</p> <p>The lawsuit is the justice department’s first piece of litigation aimed at protecting abortion access since the US supreme court in June overturned the landmark Roe v Wade decision that established federal abortion rights nearly 50 years earlier.</p> <p>During a press conference on Tuesday, the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, announced the lawsuit alongside representatives from the justice department’s reproductive rights taskforce.</p> <p>Garland said Idaho’s abortion ban violates federal law which mandates that medical providers offer emergency care in the face of serious health consequences – not just in life-saving circumstances.

When I started writing about women’s football there was no full-time work available at any national newspaper for those wanting to cover the game.</p> <p>I was asked to write a weekly column for the Guardian in 2017, on the eve of the Euros, at which Sarina Wiegman would guide the Netherlands to a home win. The headline on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jun/20/england-women-euro-2017-netherlands\" title=\"\">my first column</a>? “England’s Euros adventure can deliver glory abroad and lasting impact at home”.

Incredibly, it does not feel as if we are at the summit but at base camp, ready to roll, with all the equipment needed to reach the top.</p> <p>There are people who have been pioneering this game far longer than I have – on and off the pitch. I came in as minds were starting to shift in the industry. I could sight potential openings; not that it was ever about that. Trying to fathom the feelings of Tony Leighton, Jen O’Neill and Cath Etoe, who are among those who have covered the women’s game for decades, when Leah Williamson lifted the trophy on Sunday is impossible.</p> <p>They very much had a hand on the trophy too, as did so many others – I, perhaps, can claim a fingernail.</p> <p>Every journalist covering a football team – men’s or women’s – gets to know the players and staff. We sit down with them and delve into their stories, sometimes asking deeply personal questions about their state of mind, feelings, tragedies, health and failures. You connect with many, with their stories, their passion, their unerring desire to push themselves to be the best. In women’s football the players tell their stories freely, knowing that fans who connect with them may engage with the game and its journey to the front and back pages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d3a06186a37a0267cd8becda57ceb3cd434feda\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d3a06186a37a0267cd8becda57ceb3cd434feda/0_0_3437_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alessia Russo celebrates after her outrageous backheeled goal against Sweden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"576\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alessia Russo celebrates after her outrageous backheeled goal against Sweden</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/14/manchester-citys-chloe-kelly-everyone-doubted-us-but-we-always-believed\" title=\"\">spoken to Chloe Kelly</a> about the ACL injury that ruled her out of the Olympics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/03/manchester-city-keira-walsh-interview-criticism-world-cup\" title=\"\">to Keira Walsh</a> about how she wanted to quit football after the 2019 World Cup, to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jul/30/tearful-ellen-white-give-up-every-goal-for-olympic-gold-team-gb-australia\" title=\"\">tear-stained Ellen White</a> after Team GB crashed out of the Olympics in extra time, at the quarter-final stage, her hat-trick not enough to earn victory over Australia. The list goes on.</p> <p>Had the men’s team won last summer, or should they go one step further at the World Cup in Qatar, I imagine many journalists who have covered the team for decades will have their emotions turned upside down in similar and different ways. We work late nights, long days and have many more unglamorous hours than Instagram-worthy ones. It is, of course, all worth it.</p> <p>Women’s football is decades, if not a century, behind the development of the men’s game. At the moment it is still very, very reliant on and invested in an engaged media to help it grow. Of course the men’s game needs the press too, to maintain its deep stamp on society, but the fledgling nature of the women’s game prompts far greater openness from players and managers who recognise the importance of a reciprocal relationship – we grow it and them; it grows us.</p> <p>So while tears and cheering in the press box may be unfamiliar, slightly frowned upon or seen as a little unprofessional, forgive those of us who were broken by events on Sunday. We know what this means for our jobs, our industry, the players, the game and for society more generally. Football is powerful and the broader impact of it ‘coming home’ thanks to a group of young women cannot be underestimated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/02/pride-of-the-lionesses-englands-road-to-euro-2022-glory-in-pictures\">Pride of the Lionesses: England’s road to Euro 2022 glory – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are lots of people raising warnings, saying the opportunity to develop this wonderful sport off the back of this historic win and moment cannot be missed. They are right. Of course they are.

As international media pumped out headlines and op-eds, domestic news prioritised local elections, a long-running heatwave and celebrity news. In one bulletin, Pelosi didn’t even make the top half. Having fun with it, some commentators bet bags of rice that she wouldn’t visit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28b142a9-c826-4b48-af24-5735b6070ae3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PLcHsJ-JamI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Foreign reporters quoted Taiwanese people telling the world once again: we have been under the threat of Chinese invasion every day for decades, so what’s the use in worrying about it?</p> \n<p>“It’s useless to worry too much,” said Chiu. “You’ve seen the Russian war, and what war looks like. If it happens, it happens.”</p> \n<p>People’s reasons not to worry are diverse, ranging from seeing invasion as an unstoppable inevitability, to a futile mission bound to be resisted by Taiwan or thwarted with US help, to something that simply won’t happen because no one wants it.</p> \n<p>But then Pelosi’s visit was confirmed and the mood shifted. News sites ran polls, with almost two-thirds of UDN’s respondents saying the visit was destabilising. Talk radio discussed preparation and escape plans, and walked listeners through their growing anxieties. At one point more than 300,000 people around the world were tracking her flight on FlightRadar24, before the site crashed under load.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of civilians gathered across multiple city sites to welcome or protest against her arrival. Outside the airport, Taiwan independence groups held signs saying “I love Pelosi” and “shut up China”.</p> \n<p>The largest crowd gathered outside the Grand Hyatt, where Pelosi was due to stay. The turnout was larger than any expected and drew a large police presence but remained peaceful. Well organised, vociferous protesters held signs calling Pelosi a warmonger, and chanted “Yankee go home” from across the road. Heavy-set men wandered the crowd wearing body cameras or holding phones aloft, capturing faces among the crowd.</p> \n<p>A short way down the road, separated from the other group by a wide cordon and dozens of police, opposition crowds shouted “CCP get out”.</p> \n<p>Pelosi finally arrived shortly before midnight, mobbed by supporters and media before disappearing inside the hotel. Her public comments went to Twitter, offering the US’s “unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy”.</p> \n<p>Analysts here and overseas have said the visit is the most dangerous moment in cross-strait tensions for decades. The last Taiwan strait crisis lasted a few months into 1996. The following year one of Pelosi’s predecessors as speaker, Newt Gingrich, visited the island. Eventually, Beijing swallowed its irritation. But that was 26 years ago.</p> \n<p>Now, Taiwan, facing a much more prosperous and assertive neighbour that claims its sovereignty and that is its largest trading partner, is balancing a wish to maintain the safety of the status quo and avoid conflict while still building international relationships.</p> \n<p>In Taipei, Blair Lo, a biomedical industry worker, said the government could not keep defending the status quo. With China on the other side, “status quo never means the same thing”, she said.</p> \n<p>Her views echo those of Lo Chih-Cheng, a legislator with the ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP), who told a Taipei forum last week that Taiwan needed an alternative approach towards China. “Engagement with China is OK but don’t expect we can change China by engaging with China,” she said.</p> \n<p>Lo supports Pelosi’s visit but said she and the elders in her life were fearful of war.</p> \n<p>After the leak last month about the visit, a bellicose China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/taiwan-and-china-step-up-military-rhetoric-as-expected-pelosi-visit-looms\">rattled and raged</a>, promising dire consequences and warning the US not to “play with fire”. On Monday and Tuesday the rhetoric was followed with action. People’s Liberation Army ships and planes were close to the median line, an unofficial border in the Taiwan Strait between China and Taiwan that until recently China had respected, and live fire exercises were announced for the coming days. </p> \n<p>In China, the visit accounted for the top two approved trending topics on the social media platform Weibo on Tuesday, suggesting public interest was officially encouraged. Much of the discussion was nationalistic, pro-China and anti-Taiwan independence; occasionally it was violent. “The bottom line is here, you can’t blame us for what we do if you come,” said one post.</p> \n<p>There is also worry among Chinese people. Some told the Guardian they did not know who Pelosi was but they saw senior officials railing against her actions, and the military publishing propaganda videos about slaughtering enemies, and they feared a war was on the horizon.</p> \n<p>Zhu Feng, the dean of the Institute of International Relations at China’s Nanjing University, said the US was “adding fuel to the fire” but China would not do anything hostile in retaliation.</p> \n<p>“We don’t want the military conflict to escalate. We don’t want to fight with the US on the Taiwan issue. However, it is reasonable that China and its people are angry over Pelosi’s hypocrisy,” he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sources close to Taiwan’s government say the Pelosi visit is welcome but its execution has raised issues.

To Rishi Sunak’s chagrin, this heretical past (and an earlier disreputable association with the Lib Dems) has failed to unduly disconcert Conservative party members. Ms Truss has confessed to error and now pursues the ever elusive benefits of Brexit with the zeal of a convert. Unfortunately for the former chancellor, who needs to come <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/sunak-closing-gap-truss-tory-leadership-contest-poll-shows\" title=\"\">from behind</a> in the polls, the transformation appears plausible because Ms Truss’s political style – if not her past policies – gels naturally with the disruptive vibe of Vote Leave.</p> <p>This week, this “move fast and break things” approach arguably led to Ms Truss’s first major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/liz-truss-u-turns-plan-cut-public-sector-pay-outside-london-tory-leadership\" title=\"\">misstep</a> of the leadership contest. An ill thought out but radical sounding policy to slash civil service wages outside London was withdrawn within hours, after a predictably furious response from “red wall” Tories. But if Mr Sunak fails to capitalise on the moment, it will confirm the continued hegemony of what one might call the “insurgent style” in British politics.</p> <p>Despite serving three successive Tory prime ministers in five cabinet positions, culminating in her current role as foreign secretary, Ms Truss has successfully cast herself as the “change” candidate in the party leadership race. To pull this off, she has shown a considerable appetite for confrontation (she blamed media misrepresentation for Tuesday’s policy fiasco) and a gymnastic gift for repositioning. Mr Sunak’s traditional Thatcherite focus on deficit-cutting has been <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/07/31/liz-truss-will-overturn-orthodoxy-deliver-true-conservative/\" title=\"\">derided</a> as part of a failed “orthodoxy” in the Treasury, where Ms Truss served for two years as chief secretary (after previously backing the austerity policies of the Osborne era). The Northern Ireland protocol bill has become an anti-Brussels totem to brandish before the members as evidence of crusading authenticity. At the second hustings in Exeter on Monday, Ms Truss <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKeV0EejY5E\" title=\"\">spoke</a> about the EU in terms more appropriate to discussing Vladimir Putin’s Russia, suggesting that: “We’ve learned from history that there is only one thing the EU understands and that is strength.”</p> <p>To a country facing rampant inflation, possible recession, an accelerating climate crisis and an ever-more threatening energy crunch, Ms Truss and Mr Sunak offer different kinds of wrong answers. Mr Sunak’s dry economic instincts are hopelessly inappropriate for the times, and are already leading to a shortfall in the assistance needed to help those suffering at the sharp end. Ms Truss’s libertarian iconoclasm, and distrust of the state and public sector – at a time when collective solidarity and solutions are required – would sow division and social strife. But her status as favourite as voting begins – bolstered by the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/08/01/liz-truss-candidate-hope-declares-penny-mordaunt/\" title=\"\">support</a> of supposedly moderate figures such as Penny Mordaunt and Tom Tugendhat – suggests that aggressively paraded convictions and having it both ways still cuts through, however contradictory and inconsistent the claims being made.</p> <p>Disastrously, this brand of politics has come to dominate since the Brexit referendum. It enables Ms Truss to pledge to <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/trade-secretary-liz-truss-uk-not-dependent-china/\" title=\"\">curtail</a> Britain’s economic dependency on China, Britain’s third-largest trading partner, while simultaneously risking a trade war with its biggest, the EU. In the middle of a cost of living crisis. If the tone is right – a kind of belligerent boosterism which condemns all criticism as “talking Britain down” – it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t add up. Boris Johnson pioneered this style in Downing Street. For the time being, it seems that a majority of Tory party members may be minded to go again.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"law/2022/aug/02/archie-battersbee-parents-fail-to-stop-planned-withdrawal-of-life-support-treatment","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:35:14Z","webTitle":"Archie Battersbee: mother says life support to be removed at 11am Wednesday","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/aug/02/archie-battersbee-parents-fail-to-stop-planned-withdrawal-of-life-support-treatment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2022/aug/02/archie-battersbee-parents-fail-to-stop-planned-withdrawal-of-life-support-treatment","fields":{"headline":"Archie Battersbee: mother says life support to be removed at 11am Wednesday","trailText":"Announcement made hours after attempt to postpone withdrawal of life support was rejected by UK supreme court ‘with a heavy heart’","byline":"Haroon Siddique Legal affairs correspondent","body":"<p>The mother of 12-year-old Archie Battersbee has said his life support treatment will be removed at 11am on Wednesday, hours after a last-minute attempt to postpone the hospital taking action was rejected by the UK’s supreme court “with a heavy heart”.</p> <p>On Monday, the court of appeal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/01/archie-battersbee-court-refuses-further-postpone-end-of-life-support\">set a deadline of midday</a> on Tuesday beyond which Archie’s treatment could be ceased.</p> <p>Hollie Dance, 46, and Paul Battersbee, 57, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, had sought a lengthier postponement but the court of appeal judges had granted only a limited extension to make an application to the supreme court to appeal against their decision.</p> <p>However, on Tuesday morning, a panel of judges at the UK’s highest court, led by its deputy president, Lord Hodge, refused permission to appeal and Dance said Archie’s life support treatment would be withdrawn at 11am on Wednesday.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/dance-and-battersbee-v-barts-health-nhs-trust-permission-to-appeal-decision.html\">In a written decision</a>, the judges said: “The justices have great sympathy with the plight of Archie’s devoted parents who face a circumstance that is every parent’s nightmare – the loss of a much-loved child.</p> <p>“It is nonetheless the task of the court to apply the law which requires judges to give paramount consideration to Archie’s welfare.

Doctors are clear that it is widespread – yet are not sure how common it is, or how to respond.</p> <p>This is in part because it is an umbrella term for a wide range of symptoms; the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/science-in-5/episode-47---post-covid-19-condition\" title=\"\">says</a> that up to 200 have been recorded, with shortness of breath, brain fog and fatigue the most common, while others range from loss of smell and tinnitus to stomach aches and depression. It may be that five or six separate syndromes are involved. Most of the symptoms have numerous potential non-Covid causes, making it still harder to isolate which are related to the infection.</p> <p>What is clear is that it is common. There are an estimated 2 million sufferers in the UK with continuing or returning symptoms more than 12 weeks after falling ill.

In the US, official data has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-22/long-covid-affects-one-in-five-us-virus-patients-survey\" title=\"\">shown</a> that one in five adults who have had Covid still suffer symptoms after 12 weeks.</p> <p>Some evidence suggests that those who were more acutely ill with Covid are more likely to suffer from lingering or recurring symptoms, and that older people and those with comorbidities are also likely to be worse affected. Vaccination appears to offer a slight protective effect. None of this is surprising. But some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/01/marathon-runner-long-covid-athletes\" title=\"\">very fit people</a> who did not appear to be severely ill have been hit too. Women seem to be more likely to suffer than men.</p> <p>Scientists are delving into possible explanations for ongoing problems – such as pockets of the virus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/28/are-pockets-of-covid-in-the-gut-causing-long-term-symptoms\" title=\"\">remaining in the gut</a>, or the virus triggering an autoimmune disease – and doctors are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/high-pressure-oxygen-shows-promise-long-covid-earlier-omicron-infection-may-2022-07-14/\" title=\"\">trialling different treatments</a>. Yet the Royal College of Nursing has warned that services in Britain are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/07/care-for-2m-britons-with-long-covid-woefully-inadequate-say-top-nurses\" title=\"\">woefully inadequate</a>. Though long Covid clinics have now been set up by the NHS, demand far outstrips supply, and the treatments offered vary widely. Thousands of sufferers are travelling abroad to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/12/thousands-seeking-unproven-long-covid-blood-treatments-abroad\" title=\"\">try unproven treatments</a>, at huge expense, from sheer desperation.</p> <p>In many regards, long Covid has echoes of existing autoimmune diseases and (usually post-viral) conditions such as ME/CFS, which are complex, poorly understood, hard to diagnose and tough to treat. The biggest difference may be that Covid’s seriousness and its spread have ensured greater attention and resources this time; patients with ME/CFS and some autoimmune illnesses who have long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/13/why-are-women-more-prone-to-long-covid\" title=\"\">complained about the lack of interest and investment</a> in research hope that it may lead to breakthroughs that could help them.</p> <p>But even if those materialise, there will be no miracle cure. Some may gradually recover with little help; others may benefit from a variety of treatments. Those who are still unwell need other forms of help. Shamefully, even British doctors left with long Covid after working on the frontline in the pandemic say that they have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/13/uk-doctors-long-covid-say-denied-financial-support\" title=\"\">denied disability benefits</a>.</p> <p>The Long Covid Support group says that delays to or denial of personal independence payments are affecting the recovery of patients as well as their state of mind. An appropriate response to long Covid must mean supporting people as well as trying to cure them, through measures such as <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/long-covid-and-workplace-what-employers-could-do-better\" title=\"\">flexible working</a> and financial help.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/02/pelosi-taiwan-trip-political-reaction-democrats-republicans","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:28:00Z","webTitle":"Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan trip puts US analysts and Democrats on edge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/02/pelosi-taiwan-trip-political-reaction-democrats-republicans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/02/pelosi-taiwan-trip-political-reaction-democrats-republicans","fields":{"headline":"Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan trip puts US analysts and Democrats on edge","trailText":"Experts and officials raise concern over timing of trip even as Republicans hail House speaker","byline":"David Smith in Washington","body":"<p>Typically a plane crash is big news, whereas a plane taking off or landing is not news at all.</p> \n<p>But the sight on Tuesday of Nancy Pelosi’s US military aircraft <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/nancy-pelosi-lands-in-taiwan-amid-soaring-tensions-with-china\">touching down at Taipei Songshan airport</a> in Taiwan – smoothly and without incident – was certainly news, and cause for a collective sigh of relief.</p> \n<p>In this instance, however, the destination is as important as the journey. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and its bellicose response to the House speaker’s arrival suggested that the risk of unintended consequences remains high. For those who believe a confrontation between the US and China over the self-governing island is one day inevitable, the speaker’s provocation may have just accelerated the timeline.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/aug/02/ayman-al-zawahiri-death-joe-biden-drone-strike-kabul-al-qaida-chief-osama-bin-laden-live-updates\">Nancy Pelosi defends Taiwan trip as ‘more important today than ever’ amid China tensions – live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pelosi, second in line to the presidency, defied a series of increasingly stark threats from China that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/nancy-pelosis-visit-to-taiwan-risks-upsetting-beijing-to-no-advantage\">fuelled tensions</a>. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told Joe Biden during a phone call last week that “whoever plays with fire will get burnt”.</p> \n<p>Biden himself acknowledged that the US military felt it was “not a good idea right now” but also knew better than to try to meddle in the plans of Pelosi, who has long marched to the beat of her own drum.</p> \n<p>She wrote in the Washington Post: “We cannot stand by as the CCP [Chinese Communist party] proceeds to threaten Taiwan – and democracy itself.</p> \n<p>“Indeed, we take this trip at a time when the world faces a choice between autocracy and democracy. As Russia wages its premeditated, illegal war against Ukraine, killing thousands of innocents – even children – it is essential that America and our allies make clear that we never give in to autocrats.”</p> \n<p>Even as American democracy crumbles internally, there is nothing like a rallying cry for democracy abroad to bring the major political parties together. Twenty-six Republican senators, including the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, issued a joint statement in support of Pelosi’s visit. Even Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News lauded her.</p> \n<p>Newt Gingrich, a Republican who was the last House speaker to visit Taiwan in 1997, told the Guardian: “Once it became public, she had to go through with it. Otherwise Xi Jinping would have got the impression that we could be bullied. She had no choice once it was public and it was disappointing to have the Biden administration confused by that reality.”</p> \n<p>Which is reassuring up to a point, although, as a general rule, earning the full-throated endorsement of McConnell and Gingrich would normally give Pelosi cause to at least take a second look at her course of action. Some analysts believe they have all got it wrong.</p> \n<p>Lyle Goldstein, director of Asia engagement at the Defense Priorities thinktank, said: “This foolish political stunt is unlikely to cause a war in itself, but it will only accelerate the sad process of sleepwalking into a global and national catastrophe at some unspecified time in the future. Preserving Washington’s One China policy and strategic ambiguity are the best approaches to maintain Taiwan’s autonomy.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28b142a9-c826-4b48-af24-5735b6070ae3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PLcHsJ-JamI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some have also questioned: why now? For Pelosi, it may simply be electoral arithmetic as she seems poised to lose the speaker’s gavel to Republicans in November’s midterm elections and, at the age of 82, potentially retire. The Taiwan visit could be the culmination of a long career calling out Beijing’s human rights abuses.</p> \n<p>But for critics, while the cause is just, the timing is off. Thomas Friedman, an opinion columnist at the New York Times, described the visit as “utterly reckless, dangerous and irresponsible”, not least because the White House has been involved in delicate negotiations to prevent China providing military assistance to Russia in Ukraine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/nancy-pelosis-visit-to-taiwan-risks-upsetting-beijing-to-no-advantage\">Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan risks upsetting Beijing to no advantage </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia programme at the US-based German Marshall Fund thinktank, argues that it would have been better to wait until after the Chinese Communist party’s 20th national congress later this year, when Xi is expected to secure a third term, and after the US clarifies its Taiwan policy. Biden raised eyebrows earlier this year by promising to defend the island militarily, throwing the longstanding policy of “strategic ambiguity” into doubt.</p> \n<p>Glaser said: “There have been many statements about our policy toward Taiwan, some of which have been contradictory, and there is a need for some consistency and clarity in US policy. One of the reasons why China is responding as it is – and there are many drivers – is that they are losing confidence in the US commitment to One China and they see a gap between US words and deeds.</p> \n<p>“The Chinese see a need to bolster their red lines to head off a bigger crisis with the United States down the road. They want to get US attention and react strongly enough now so that they can avoid a crisis later that might lead to a decision in China that they have to use force in order to stop the United States from going down this path. There is a need for the US to be more consistent and more disciplined.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, China’s foreign affairs ministry wasted no time in condemning Pelosi’s visit, saying it “has a severe impact on the political foundation of China-US relations, and seriously infringes upon China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. It could respond by breaching Taiwan’s air defense identification zone or firing missiles into the Taiwan Strait – risking an accident that leads to escalation.</p> \n<p>Democrats around the world may thank Pelosi for making a stand against autocrats – while praying that she can also keep the peace.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/02/truss-suffers-setback-as-criticism-of-civil-service-pay-plan-brings-u-turn","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:18:02Z","webTitle":"Truss suffers setback as criticism of civil service pay plan brings U-turn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/truss-suffers-setback-as-criticism-of-civil-service-pay-plan-brings-u-turn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/02/truss-suffers-setback-as-criticism-of-civil-service-pay-plan-brings-u-turn","fields":{"headline":"Truss suffers setback as criticism of civil service pay plan brings U-turn","trailText":"Foreign secretary forced to abandon policy amid widespread criticism from within Conservative party","byline":"Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot","body":"<p>Liz Truss suffered a humiliating setback in her bid to become the next prime minister on Tuesday, as she was forced into a U-turn on civil service pay after a backlash from within her own party.</p> <p>The foreign secretary swiftly abandoned the cornerstone of her plan for a “war on Whitehall waste” when it was revealed it could lead to pay cuts for millions of teachers, nurses and police officers.</p> <p>The foreign secretary had proposed creating “regional pay boards” to set civil sector pay, matching it more closely to local labour markets outside London and the south east.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/21/liz-truss-v-rishi-sunak-tory-pm-contenders-differ-policy\">Truss v Sunak: how do Tory PM contenders differ on policy?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it was scrapped within hours, after analysts pointed out the purported £8.8bn saving from the policy was only remotely achievable by cutting wages across the public sector.</p> <p>With ballot papers dropping this week, Truss is widely regarded as the frontrunner in the race to succeed Boris Johnson; but one new poll put her just five points ahead of Rishi Sunak, while Conservative MPs say many members remain undecided.</p> <p>The Teesside mayor, Ben Houchen, a popular figure within the party and a Sunak backer, said he was “speechless” at the policy, which he said would work against the flagship Conservative policy of levelling up.</p> <p>“There is simply no way you can do this without a massive pay cut for 5.5 million people – including nurses, police officers and our armed forces outside London.

Mrs Thatcher would be livid,” he said, accusing Truss of “blaming journalists” for misconstruing her plans.</p> <p>The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, said: “U-turning on a multibillion-pound policy five weeks before even taking office must be a new record. We can’t let Liz Truss run the country with the same incompetence she’s running her leadership campaign. The British people must have their say in a general election.”</p> <p>Labour said the original plan would have meant a £7.1bn hit to local economies across Yorkshire, the north and the Midlands.

Soaring oil and gas prices that followed Russia’s invasion in February meant quarterly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/02/bp-profits-oil-prices-ukraine-war-energy-prices-cost-of-living-crisis\">profits have tripled</a> to just under £7bn. Only once, when oil prices hit a record level of almost $150 a barrel 15 years ago, has the energy giant posted higher profits.</p> <p>It was only two years ago that oil prices briefly went negative in the early stages of the pandemic, but the big energy companies can expect little public sympathy.</p> <p>News of BP’s bonanza came as the latest estimates emerged of the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/02/energy-bills-great-britain-winter-discount\">energy price cap </a>consumers can expect to come into force this winter and beyond. The forecasts from the research group Cornwall Insight suggest the average household will see their gas and electricity bills rise from just under £2,000 a year to just under £3,500 in October. Further increases are expected in 2023 and the squeeze on living standards will intensify.</p> <p>This juxtaposition of massive windfall profits and the hardship facing millions of households prompted a furious response from the Labour party, the TUC and pressure groups. Even in normal times, BP profits of this size would raise an eyebrow or two. When the country is facing a cost of living crisis in large part caused by dearer energy bills, they are politically explosive.</p> <p>No question, Britain has a long-term energy problem born of years of neglect. Too much energy is wasted heating badly insulated homes and the case for investing more on retro-fitting is more powerful now than it has ever been. If ever there was a case of failing to mend the roof while the sun was shining, then this is surely it.</p> <p>But there is also a pressing short-term problem. One early decision facing Boris Johnson’s successor is whether to provide a third package of support for households to help with rising energy costs. This is a no-brainer: it will be one of the first items on the to-do list for either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.</p> <p>The real question is whether the government is going to expect energy companies to pay towards the cost of this package, either by levying a higher windfall tax than the one it announced in May, or by removing the loophole that allowed companies a tax break for investment.</p> <p>In truth, the energy companies have made themselves the softest of targets and BP certainly did itself few favours by announcing an increase in its dividend. True, pension funds will benefit, but the beneficiaries will mainly be the better off and not those deciding whether to eat or heat.</p> <h2>Strength of labour market unlikely to last</h2> <p>At the very start of the pandemic, the government took steps to prevent businesses going bust in droves. There was an array of measures including the furlough scheme, soft loans, grants, deferred tax payment, and business rate holidays.</p> <p>Corporate failures remained low (and below pre-pandemic levels) despite the repeated lockdowns, but there was always some doubt about what would happen once the support was turned off. Now we know.</p> <p>Latest insolvency statistics for England and Wales show a sharp increase in business distress. The number of company insolvencies was up by 13% between the first and second quarters, and by 81% year on year. The number of creditors’ voluntary liquidations – where the directors pull the plug on their businesses themselves – was at the highest level since modern records began in 1960.</p> <p>The rise in insolvencies is perhaps less of a surprise than the continued strength of the labour market. Businesses clearly felt the impact of the withdrawal of government financial support but the ending of the furlough last autumn did not lead to the expected rise in unemployment.</p> <p>The strength of the labour market looks unlikely to last. Companies that survived the pandemic and the supply bottlenecks that followed the ending of lockdowns are now facing fresh headwinds from rising inflation. More firms will go out of business in the coming months and many of those that survive will only do so by axing jobs.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/02/better-call-saul-recap-season-six-episode-11-its-the-episode-weve-all-been-waiting-for","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T18:00:04Z","webTitle":"Better Call Saul recap: season six, episode 11 – it’s the episode we’ve all been waiting for!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/02/better-call-saul-recap-season-six-episode-11-its-the-episode-weve-all-been-waiting-for","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/02/better-call-saul-recap-season-six-episode-11-its-the-episode-weve-all-been-waiting-for","fields":{"headline":"Better Call Saul recap: season six, episode 11 – it’s the episode we’ve all been waiting for!","trailText":"Finally, Walt and Jesse are back. But with two episodes to go, the ending still feels a long way off","byline":"Paul MacInnes","body":"<p><em>Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Better Call Saul season six, which airs on Netflix in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episodes one to 11.</em></p> <p>There’s something unpleasant happening and it’s not just the quick cuts between black and white and colour. We might once have imagined Nebraska, the land of snow and tarmac, to be an escape for Jimmy McGill. But now we know that’s not the case. Saul Goodman is now in control of Gene Takavic, not Jimmy, and he’s plumbing new depths.</p> <p>This was the episode everyone has been waiting for, as we travelled back from Gene’s timeline to the world of Breaking Bad, and to an incident we have seen once before – Saul inside an RV, engaged in negotiations with up and coming meth barons Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.</p> <p>We know the version of events from the Breaking Bad episode in season two called Better Call Saul. That was when we met Saul Goodman for the first time, targeted as he was by White as a solution to an early legal problem (the arrest of Badger). After refusing the work, our heroes kidnapped Saul in ski-masks in an attempt at persuasion. He asked if Lalo sent them, then he got them to put a dollar in his pocket.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1253b7a34dedb195764630a5e8098abba933c0d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1253b7a34dedb195764630a5e8098abba933c0d1/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, in this Better Call Saul episode – called Breaking Bad – White and Pinkman return to show us the aftermath of the deal. We watch the partners bicker just like in the good old days – “no details!” “dick!” – and argue over how best to get the RV to start. We see Saul cast his eyes over the interior of the RV and deduce immediately that Walt is Heisenberg and Jesse his “Igor”. We see Walt have another coughing fit and attempt to hide the blood, unsuccessfully. We see the trio drive off into the night. It is satisfying.</p> <p>Why did we see this flashback at all? We are led to believe it was triggered in the mind of Jimmy/Gene after he attempted to find out what was going on in Albuquerque for the first time since he fled. It’s another moment set up a long time ago, a flash-forward in season four, in which Saul warned Francesca Liddy to be standing by a payphone on 12 November, without explaining why. At the beginning of this episode we follow her to that call.</p> <p>It’s Gene, offering money on the end of a fishing line. He’s also asking about his own fortune and associates. Francesca has only bad news. The laundering businesses, the offshore account, even the laser tag, it’s all been shut down. Skylar White cut herself a deal with the feds which means only Saul and Jesse (presumed dead) are still on the loose. There is one thing, though, Francesca admits. She took a call from Kim Wexler, and she was asking after him.</p> <p>Gene leaves as if to go home but abandons the journey. He returns to the booth to make another call, this time to a Palm Coast Sprinklers where he asks for Kim. We don’t get to hear what is discussed but we see the aftermath. Gene starts remonstrating, then shouting, and by the end he’s trashed the phone booth.</p> <p>With two episodes to go, therefore, any reconciliation between Jimmy and Kim looks a long shot. Not least because Jimmy appears to be dead, with the violence perpetrated on the telephone box indicative of where Gene is as a person. He is lost, trying to rekindle the life of Saul Goodman. He’s gone as far as buying a chiropractic ankle wobbler, but it all seems desperate, not to mention depraved. By way of proof, we get a telltale “sitting dead-eyed in a strip bar” shot before, at the very end, Gene breaks into the house of a cancer patient to steal his identity.</p> <p>The burglary is the consequence of another successful scam perpetrated by Gene and his Omaha crew. It starts with Gene chatting up some rich guy in a bar (siphoning off his own drinks with a convoluted tube drainage system). The target is then escorted outside where Jeff is waiting to drive them home and pump them full of barbiturates. Finally, the third guy – Buddy – sneaks into their home while they are sleeping, takes photos of all their documentation and sells it to someone who makes a living from draining bank accounts.</p> <p>It’s a surprisingly fruitful endeavour (and for those of you who didn’t buy last week’s scam, I don’t buy this one: dozens of wealthy, lonely men, in Omaha, Nebraska?). All the same, it ends up with Buddy drawing a line. He won’t rip off a mark who has cancer, but Gene won’t accept any other outcome. He’s getting angry even at the thought and insists on doing the job himself. We watch Jimmy smash the glass on the victim’s front door before the credits roll.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9331f09ecdb83736b4dcbf688fffb93eab20f28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9331f09ecdb83736b4dcbf688fffb93eab20f28/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breaking … and entering … Bob Odenkirk as Gene.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breaking … and entering … Bob Odenkirk as Gene.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Lewis/AMC/Sony Pictures Television</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It feels like this act of breaking and entry could be significant. It might even lead to Gene/Saul/Jimmy’s ultimate undoing. Less clear is why this moment is paired with Saul walking into JP Wynne high school to tell Walt the pair should form a long-lasting relationship (another scene from Breaking Bad, the series). In terms of this episode, it works, even if it is a bit garish, going black and white to colour and back again. But in the bigger picture, while Saul’s relationship with Walter White is important, we know the journey that led Jimmy to become Gene began long before the two men met. Neither was Jimmy Walter’s enemy or vice versa. So why did it happen? Is it simply to justify the crossover? We shall find out soon enough.</p> <h2>Albuquerque Incidental</h2> <ul> <li><p>Marion is back, fascinated by cats on YouTube. “It’s like America’s Funniest Videos, but you get to be the host!”, says Gene. “Wouldn’t that be something!” says Carol Burnett, one of the US’s biggest TV stars.</p></li> <li><p>I don’t know who those stoners are that Francesca has as her tenants, but I would watch a short web series of their antics.</p></li> <li><p>We see Mike Ehrmantraut in a Saul era flashback too and, not for the first time this season (see Lalo Salamanca) he makes the wrong call.

In the last few days, Biden’s officials have been keen to highlight the differences between the White House and Congress. But Chinese commentators seemed to conflate the position of the House speaker with that of the White House itself, even though the two have separate constitutional roles.</p> \n<p>On Monday, China’s spokesperson warned its military would “not sit idly by” if the visit happened.

Here is everything you might have missed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The United Nations chief has warned that nuclear annihilation is just one miscalculation away</strong>. At the opening of a key nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) conference in New York, António Guterres warned that the world faced “a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the cold war.” “Humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,” he said citing the war in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> as a significant factor.<br><br></li> <li><strong>On Monday Russian President Vladimir Putin said there could be “no winners” in a nuclear war and it should “never be unleashed”</strong> in a letter sent to attendees of the NPT conference. In February, Putin pointedly referred to Russia’s nuclear arsenal and warned outside powers that any attempt to interfere would “lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history”. Days later, he ordered Russia’s nuclear forces to be put on high alert.<br><br></li> <li><strong>The US will send $550m in a new tranche of weapons to Ukraine</strong>, including ammunition for increasingly important rocket launchers and artillery guns. Ukraine received a batch of four more US-made high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars), Ukraine’s defence minister said on Monday.<br><br></li> <li><strong>The US has accused Russia of using Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant as a “nuclear shield”. </strong>US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Washington was “deeply concerned” that Moscow was now using the plant as a military base and firing on Ukrainian forces from around it and called Russia’s actions around the plant “the height of irresponsibility”.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>A ship carrying Ukrainian grain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/grain-ship-leaves-ukraine-port-for-first-time-since-russia-blockade\">left the port of Odesa</a> for the first time since the start of the Russian invasion</strong> on Monday under an internationally brokered deal to unblock Ukraine’s agricultural exports and ease a growing global food crisis. The Sierra Leone-flagged ship Razoni was carrying 26,000 tons of corn and destined for Lebanon. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy described the shipment as “the first positive signal that there is a chance to stop the development of a world food crisis” while the Kremlin called the departure “very positive” news.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The daily gas production of Russia’s Gazprom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/01/gazprom-daily-gas-output-in-july-lowest-since-2008-analysis-suggests\">dropped in July to its lowest level since 2008</a>,</strong> figures suggest, amid fears that Moscow could cause an energy crisis in Europe by shutting off supply. The state-owned energy firm pumped 774m cubic metres a day last month – 14% less than in June – according to analysis by Bloomberg of data released on Monday. Overall total output for the year was 262.4bn cubic metres, a 12% fall compared with the same period last year.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Food inflation has soared across much of the developing world since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</strong> and has trapped several richer countries in a cycle of rising prices, a report by the World Bank has found. The organisation said the war would hit many countries with an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/01/food-prices-soar-across-world-amid-ukraine-crisis-world-bank-finds\">increase in food bills worth more than 1% of their annual national income</a> (GDP), while others would fail to contain the impact and be plunged into a full-blown debt crisis.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>France will donate a mobile DNA lab to Kyiv authorities</strong> <strong>in a bid to ensure war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine do not go unpunished</strong>, President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Spanish businesses, restaurants, museums and public transport will be required to adhere to strict temperature requirements under emergency measures</strong> the government announced on Monday to save energy. The plan establishes a minimum temperature of 27C (80F) in summer and a maximum of 19C (66F) in winter.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The Russian economy has been deeply damaged by sanctions and the exit of international business since the country invaded Ukraine</strong>, according to a new report by Yale University business experts and economists. Largely unpublished data shows that much of its domestic economic activity has stalled since the invasion. “Not only have sanctions and the business retreat worked, they have thoroughly crippled the Russian economy at every level,” the 118-page report read. “Russian domestic production has come to a complete standstill with no capacity to replace lost businesses, products and talent.”</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66bace564a6c8ada8142e80a7416f2f0a00cbaa4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66bace564a6c8ada8142e80a7416f2f0a00cbaa4/0_34_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A firefighter extinguishes a burning hospital building hit by a Russian missile strike in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, on 1 August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A firefighter extinguishes a burning hospital building hit by a Russian missile strike in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, on 1 August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/nancy-pelosi-lands-in-taiwan-amid-soaring-tensions-with-china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T17:50:20Z","webTitle":"Nancy Pelosi arrives in Taiwan as China puts military on high alert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/nancy-pelosi-lands-in-taiwan-amid-soaring-tensions-with-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/nancy-pelosi-lands-in-taiwan-amid-soaring-tensions-with-china","fields":{"headline":"Nancy Pelosi arrives in Taiwan as China puts military on high alert","trailText":"People’s Liberation Army announces targeted military operations as it calls visit a ‘malicious provocation’","byline":"Helen Davidson and Chi Hui Lin in Taipei","body":"<p>Nancy Pelosi has landed in Taiwan for a controversial visit to the self-ruled island, offering “unwavering commitment” to supporting its democracy as already heightened <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/taiwan-and-china-step-up-military-rhetoric-as-expected-pelosi-visit-looms\">tensions with China escalate</a>.</p> \n<p>Timed with her arrival, China’s ministry of defence said the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had been put on “high alert” and announced a series of targeted military operations, including missile tests in the waters east of Taiwan and drills encircling the main island for four days after Pelosi leaves.</p> \n<p>China, which regards Taiwan as its territory, has repeatedly warned of retaliation for the visit.

furiously online</a>. “China firmly opposes separatist moves towards ‘Taiwan independence’ and interference by external forces,” said Hua Chunying, a ministry spokesperson. “The US should give up any attempt to play the Taiwan card.”</p> \n<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Hua accused the US of “reckless disregard” and said it would be “held liable and pay the price for hurting China’s sovereignty and

The prospect of brewing at a commercial scale is really exciting.”</p> <p>Folland said he took up home brewing in 2017 “because I was bored with some of the local beer offerings and felt sure I could brew beer better”.

Last week official figures showed that the average <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/czms/mm23\">cost of a pint has topped £4 for the first time </a>and is well over £6 in London.</p> <p>Folland said: “A lot of my friends took up brewing in lockdown because they needed something to do. As prices in pubs go up it is making the gap between making your own and going to a pub much wider, so the cost of living crisis is only going to fuel the home brew hobby.”</p> <p>Folland said the secret to his winning beer’s flavour was leaving it to mellow for five years.</p> <p>The panel of five judges were impressed by the flavour of the beer despite its strength. One of the judges, Phil Cooke, landlord of Hop Inn in Hornchurch, said: “To brew really strong beers is very hard. To brew a beer at 16.1% that is that drinkable is absolutely stunning.”</p> <p>Labour MP Charlotte Nichols, chair of the parliamentary group on pubs, confessed that strong beers were “not really my thing”, but during the judging she said: “I actually really like that. You could almost put it on ice-cream.”</p> <p>The second prize went to the least alcoholic beer on the 12-strong shortlist, a mild called Crooner by Mark Sanderson, from Catford in south London. He said: “We’ve all had to drink horrible home brew that you to have to be polite about, so to brew something that people actually want to drink is a really wonderful feeling.”</p> <p>Beer writer Laura Hadland, who has written a history of Camra and who helped judge the shortlist, said: “I thought the standard was really high.”</p> <p>She added: “Cask ale is a great British product. It’s something that we do better than anyone else in the world, so I love that people are taking the leap and trying it do it themselves. A lot of small brewers come from a homebrew background.”</p> <p>She added: “It absolutely will save you money if you get good at brewing beer even if you start from scratch.”</p> <p>Her favourite beer was a speciality salty sour beer, called Margarita Gose, which came third overall. She said: “It has that incredible Margarita vibrancy, but in beer form.”</p> <p>Its brewer, Thomas Corry, 33, a physics teacher from Farnham in Surrey, said: “Home brewing is all about new flavours and doing stupid things in my garage that a commercial brewer can’t. I wanted to see how cocktails could be merged with beers.”</p> <p>He added: “You can brew a beer for less than a pound a pint, whereas in a pub you’re looking at up to £6 a pint for craft beer, so a lot of people are turning to home brew. I made most of my beer with a kit of under £100.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/03/csiro-recommends-double-strength-mouse-baits-after-report-finds-dose-used-to-protect-crops-ineffective","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia

in instances where there is not much other food around to distract mice, and they can quickly find two or three grains of the bait, which is enough to get a lethal dose.</p> <p>If not, he said, “the bait is competing with those other foods for the attention of a mouse”.</p> <p>“If they have … a dose that doesn’t kill them, then they become bait averse and they stop eating the bait.”</p> <p>The

series of studies to reassess the sensitivity of mice to zinc phosphide in the laboratory, as well as the effectiveness of a new bait formulation in the field.</p> <p>Henry said the final study

Exposure to daylight is also thought to stimulate receptors in the eye to produce dopamine that protects against the development of shortsightedness.</p> \n<p>Children who spend more time doing <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4618477\">near work</a>, focusing on books or screens, are at greater risk of becoming shortsighted. Other risk factors include increasing level of education and having two parents who are myopic.</p> \n<p>“The prevalence of myopia was high in Taiwan and Singapore by the 1970s, when computer use was very limited, and smartphones were nonexistent,” Morgan said. “You don’t need these devices to create an epidemic. Since smartphones only took off about 10 to 15 years ago, we need to get more evidence that they are having an effect.”</p> \n<h2>What effect has the pandemic had on kids’ eyesight?</h2> \n<p>Research overseas has linked a decrease in outdoor time during the Covid-19 pandemic to a rise in shortsightedness in children.</p> \n<p>A study of more than <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/article-abstract/2774808\">120,000 primary school-age</a> children in Feicheng, China found that the prevalence of myopia was 1.4 to three times higher in 2020, after months of home confinement, compared with the preceding five years.</p> \n<p>Another <a href=\"https://bjo.bmj.com/content/early/2021/07/15/bjophthalmol-2021-319307\">study</a> followed children in Hong Kong between January and August 2020.

Joe Carnahan’s frosty 2011 action-thriller The Grey ticks all three boxes, and then some – it not only stars the grizzled Irishman, but has him wrestling ravenous canines. After being bitten during one moment of man-on-wolf action (oh yes, there are more!), Neeson’s straight-talkin’ protagonist John Ottway jokes: “Maybe I’ll turn into a wolf man now.”</p> <p>But it isn’t that kind of film. Having said that, one of the amazing things about The Grey – Neeson’s best action movie by a wide margin – is its blurring of the line between high and low art. This allowed it to be accurately marketed as a gnarly genre picture (Neeson! Wolves! Snow! Survival!) and then, once in the door, audiences expecting little more than an interspecies punch-on found themselves grappling with, and potentially sniffling through, a deep exploration of masculinity. The Grey contains some extraordinarily moving sequences that give me shivers just thinking about them.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUP5Vr0lBvY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eUP5Vr0lBvY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The trailer for The Grey.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Set in remote Alaska, the film follows a small group of plane crash survivors – all men – who trudge across an unforgiving, storm-ravaged and wolf-populated landscape. The white expanse around them provides the barest of aesthetic platforms: a kind of hollowed-out stage in a theatre of the damned. The men, who all work at an oil refinery, include the sage Ottway, the belligerent Diaz (Frank Grillo), Burke (Nonso Anozie) and Talget (Dermot Mulroney), who carries with him the wallets of people who died in the crash.</p> <p>Neeson’s opening narration establishes basic character and situational detail (“A job at the end of the world. A salaried killer for a big petroleum company”) and then moves into melancholic self-analysis (“I don’t know why I did half the things I’ve done”), evoking a sense of place and purpose (“but I know this is where I belong”). During these early moments, Ottway prepares to die by suicide, but stops when he hears wolves howling. He’s a man on the brink before he becomes the film’s deeply principled moral centre, rather than a gung-ho, all-guns-blazing type.</p> <p>After the visceral plane crash sequence, Ottway tends to a dying man who is (chillingly, from my perspective) named Luke. Luke is losing blood and pleading for help. Instead of telling him everything will be OK, Ottway tenderly cradles the man’s head in his hands and delivers words nobody wants to hear.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/27/blue-nothing-has-exposed-australias-mean-streak-better-than-this-sleazy-drama\">Blue Murder: nothing has exposed Australia’s mean streak better than this sleazy drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Listen, you’re going to die, that’s what’s happening,” he says. Shepherding poor doomed Luke to the great beyond, Ottway tells him that “it’s alright, it will slide over you, it’ll start to feel warm, nice and warm” and encourages him to think about his daughter: “Let her take you.”</p> <p>I can’t watch this scene without welling up. It resonates partly through the absence of comparable moments in comparable productions; the action genre tends to be dominated by testosterone-filled brouhaha that means and stands for nothing. We don’t know Luke, but his death profoundly registers. It’s unusual for a scene with this kind of dramatic heft to be 20 minutes into an action movie. It sets a hell of a tone and a very high benchmark.</p> <p>The rest of the film doesn’t disappoint: it’s terrifically acted and directed, and has much to say about masculinity, “toxic” and otherwise. These blokes are tough –Ottway describes the company he keeps as “ex-cons, fugitives, drifters, assholes” – but they can’t solve their problems here by using their fists. It communicates a message that applies to life more generally: there will always be something, or someone, physically stronger – but internal strength is another matter. In one scene, Diaz, initially a bit of a villain (but who becomes more complex), makes it clear he is insulted to be called scared. “What’s wrong with being scared?” Ottway asks. “I’m terrified. And not an ounce of shame in saying it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/06/does-liam-neeson-not-understand-the-rules-of-the-game-or-is-he-having-us-on\">Does Liam Neeson not understand the rules of the game? Or is he having us on?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neeson’s superb performance, and the intelligence of the writing, builds a space where the film can have it both ways: showing the protagonist as an alpha male, kicking wolf ass and doing blokey bloke things, but also as a priest-like figure of spiritual reasoning, penetrating all that macho BS. What an awesome character; what an amazing movie.

In what may surprise some, private health insurance was a consistent predictor of higher out-of-pocket costs, with insured patients paying as much as double compared with the uninsured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Discover the Australia Weekend app\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&link=true&link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>But as I watch my patient decline, the phrase that keeps nagging me is “time toxicity”, recently defined <a href=\"https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.21.02810\">in a thoughtful commentary</a> as “time spent in coordinating care and in frequent visits to a healthcare facility (including travel and wait times), seeking urgent/emergent care for side-effects, hospitalisation, and follow-up tests”.</p> <p>The oncologists write that we do a poor job of acknowledging and weighing the impact of time toxicity, which is admittedly not easy to measure objectively and reliably. </p> <p>But the very diagnosis of a life-limiting illness underlines the importance of knowing not only how much time is left but also how and where it will be spent.</p> <p>In one example, the survival gain from chemotherapy is 27 days, but the estimated time spent on facility visits, infusions, investigations, travel and deferred treatment is 30 days. In other words, the survival benefit is dwarfed by the logistics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/17/birthing-women-may-feel-fear-but-it-should-not-be-about-midwives-and-obstetricians\">Birthing women may feel fear, but it should not be about midwives and obstetricians | Kae Sheen Wong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In another example, chemotherapy provides nine months of survival with three of those spent away from home, while the option of no chemotherapy offers seven-month survival but time mostly spent at home. Presented with such estimates, I am confident that there would be many who will still take a chance on treatment, reflecting the tenacity of hope in a cancer clinic. But equally, there will be those who would rethink their desires and goals and choose the remote fishing expedition or a rambunctious family reunion over time spent in a series of waiting rooms. </p> <p>To be clear, time toxicity may be less pertinent when treatments offer a significant survival benefit or align with the patient’s goals. No choice is inherently wrong provided it is made with sufficient information.</p> <p>Finally fed up, the patient stops chemotherapy shortly before dying. His daughter recollects that his time on therapy contained a few “shocking” weeks, many “just OK” weeks, and no “fully good” ones. The family kept hoping for better days but were unprepared for the sheer demand on their time to the extent that she left an executive job to care for her elderly parents.</p> <p>Left to ponder the opportunity cost for everyone involved, I imagine a day when patients will be spared the lament of time toxicity because oncologists like me will have embraced it as a plank of our counsel. It won’t be the easiest thing to talk about but by doing so, we will be serving the best interest of our patients.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/03/sampa-the-great-paul-kelly-and-genesis-owusu-australias-best-new-music-for-august","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T17:30:05Z","webTitle":"Sampa the Great, Paul Kelly and Genesis Owusu: Australia’s best new music for August","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/03/sampa-the-great-paul-kelly-and-genesis-owusu-australias-best-new-music-for-august","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/03/sampa-the-great-paul-kelly-and-genesis-owusu-australias-best-new-music-for-august","fields":{"headline":"Sampa the Great, Paul Kelly and Genesis Owusu: Australia’s best new music for August","trailText":"Each month we add 20 new songs to our Spotify playlist.

As a signoff, Kamikaze is a perfect amalgamation of everything that makes the band so beloved: a spidery guitar part that echoes Covered In Chrome, a quiet/loud dynamic, a face-melting down-tuned riff, and a chorus that screams in your face and compels you to scream back. After 20 years of stinky vans and sweaty fans, Violent Soho say they have moved on somewhat from their early years. Musically, however, they remain on the exact same setting – the quality and volume of their passionate tunes sitting firmly at 11. It’s been a great ride.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Violent Soho play one final show 10 September at Fortitude Music Hall in Brisbane, with DZ Deathrays.</p> <h2>Paul Kelly – Northern Rivers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbe5f5c0dc90a388087280d5566baf55e04ef2b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbe5f5c0dc90a388087280d5566baf55e04ef2b0/0_0_6192_4128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Kelly performing at the One From The Heart benefit concert\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Kelly performing at the One From the Heart benefit concert on 15 May in Lismore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Archie Roach, Don Walker, Perry Keyes</p> <p>Paul Kelly wrote his deceptively jaunty new single Northern Rivers late last year and describes it as “a love song set in contrasting landscapes”. Since then, the region has been twice decimated by floods. Images of recovery continue to beam into our living rooms, and Kelly’s song, an ode to a woman who “can tell the coming weather in her bones, her body and her blood” has grown more poignant. This is a song about nature in its wildest form.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/31/big-tree-down-archie-roach-remembered-as-a-truth-teller-healer-and-first-nations-champion\">‘Big tree down’: Archie Roach remembered as a truth-teller, healer and First Nations champion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kelly wouldn’t be the first to liken an unknowable woman to a tempest; in fact storms and waterways feature so heavily in his work that Northern Rivers acts as the lead single for a new compilation that trawls his storied career for songs that address watery themes. Sonically, this song sounds a lot like Kelly’s 90s output; warmly sung, crisply produced, and with an ear locked to the FM dial.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Rivers and Rain is out now, and follows similarly themed collection Time.</p> <h2>Alannah Russack’s Entropy Band – Movement</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Aerial Maps, the Clouds, the Hummingbirds</p> <p>As a key member of indie stalwarts the Hummingbirds, Alannah Russack has contributed more than her fair share of earworms to the Aussie musical canon over the years. Like the very best fuzzy pop from that aforementioned group, Movement hits instantly. There’s a giddy rush of Hammond organ, crunchy guitars and wordless harmonies which crash through the speakers before dropping away in favour of Russack’s unmistakable voice, which still sounds as fresh and inviting as ever. All the pop pep disguises the serious subject matter of Movement, written about a friend who died from motor neurone disease and the hopeless acceptance one is forced to reach in the face of such a cruel fate. Another great mid-career song from Russack.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Listen to previous single Tend Your Fire and Places You Love.</p> <h2>Kasey Chambers – Lose Yourself</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Peter, Paul and Mary, Janis Joplin, the real Slim Shady</p> <p>One of the more unlikely upsides of the recent pandemic was that it gave Kasey Chambers ample downtime in which to perfect her long-postponed banjo cover of Eminem’s hype-up anthem Lose Yourself. She has been treating audiences to this set highlight of late, now seeing fit to release this towering eight-minute version recorded at Newcastle’s ornate Civil Theatre as a single. While on the surface this reeks of mere novelty, to laugh at then move on, Chambers instead treats the source material as gospel, moving from a 60s folk reading towards barn-burning blues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/29/grinspoons-phil-jamieson-goes-solo-all-these-alt-90s-kids-with-their-adult-contemporary-hoo-ha\">Grinspoon’s Phil Jamieson goes solo: ‘All these alt-90s kids with their adult contemporary hoo-ha!’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As she belts “success is my only motherfucking option, failure’s not” after six-and-a-half minutes, you feel ready to go 10 rounds with Apollo Creed. With all its talk of growing old in Salem’s Lot and paying the Pied Piper, the lyrics actually translate well to Chambers’ Southern gothic reading. It is a testament to the power of a perfectly performed cover song.</p> <p><strong>For more</strong>: Chambers plays the Gympie Music Muster from 25 to 28 August.</p> <h2>Richard Cartwright – Seaweed</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Brian Eno, the Flaming Lips, Pink Floyd</p> <p>As the frontman of psychedelic wanderers Richard In Your Mind, a band who slide from peyote-infused ragas to VHS-plundering beats within the space of a single album, you’d think that Richard Cartwright would have an ample outlet for his musical experimentation. But on his debut solo album, Daisy Lion, Cartwright finds further sonic avenues to stroll down. This is instantly apparent on lead single Seaweed, a shimmering slice of nautical nonsense that was originally written and rejected for a SpongeBob SquarePants movie. Not surprisingly, given this cinematic brief, this song floats along in endless bliss, a midpoint between Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robot and the proggiest Pink Floyd jam. As 1970s synths chirp inoffensively and Cartwright’s washed-out falsetto drags the gentlest melody across the surface, you could do worse than close your eyes and drift downstream.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Daisy Lion is out now.</p> <h2>Workhorse – Darkness</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Julee Cruise, Cocteau Twins, Slowdive</p> <p>While fans of the aforementioned acts will have already cued this song up to play, those less seduced by a dreamy vocal reverbed to infinity, and laconic tremolo guitars will still find much to love from South Australian multi-instrumentalist Harriet Fraser-Barbour’s Workhorse project. A truly breathtaking piece of music, Darkness veers away from David Lynch’s dystopian American dreamscapes, often aped by the likes of Lana Del Rey. It is instead a true mood piece that could be at home between My Bloody Valentine and Enya on a Pure Moods new age compilation.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Debut album No Photographs is due out 12 August.</p> <h2>Genesis Owusu – GTFO</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff1cd65b521b60153adfbcfd9d56a7c3fef3da98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff1cd65b521b60153adfbcfd9d56a7c3fef3da98/0_0_7305_4870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Genesis Owusu performs during the Future of Fashion show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Genesis Owusu performs during the Future of Fashion show on 11 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Gosatti/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> David Bowie, Childish Gambino, Anderson .Paak</p> <p>A lot has happened since Genesis Owusu released his debut album Smiling With No Teeth last March. Four Aria awards, Triple J’s Album of the Year, European tours, a rousing debut on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and a nod from Barack Obama, who included album highlight Gold Chains in his favourite music list of 2021. It’s fair to say there’s a lot riding on the success of return single GTFO, and not surprisingly, Owusu has hit another home run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/18/midnight-oil-their-20-greatest-songs-sorted\">Midnight Oil: their 20 greatest songs – sorted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Opening with a creepy, muffled gospel choir, Owusu skips syllables across the top of a dreamy musical bed before the song breaks down into a stomping, chanting chorus of “Get the fuck out” quite at odds with the rest of the tune.

Three albums in, Wollongong’s Hockey Dad aren’t so removed from this lifestyle that they cannot conjure the perfect anthem for this pointless daily grind. As the band matures, they seem to lean more into classic Australian songwriting, echoing the likes of Woodface era Crowded House and golden era You Am I with this wonderful ode to that ever-niggling “is this it?” feeling. As many of us return to skyscrapers in the city, to waste away behind ever-upgrading computers, this song takes on a particularly urgent meaning.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Hockey Dad play This That festival at Brisbane 29 October, and Newcastle 5 November.</p> <h2>The Buoys – Red Flags</h2> <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Jimmy Eat World, Lit, Hayley Mary</p> <p>I sincerely hope that when Zoe Catterall sings “you bathe in your own waste” at the start of The Buoys’ incendiary new single Red Flags, this is a metaphor for how a lover is the architect of their own downfall, and not a troubling sign of poor hygiene. Whatever the sorry case, Catterall sees the red flags all too well, but is choosing to postpone any decisive action. Musically, Red Flags is sugary pop punk, production clean as a whistle, wound tighter than a Swiss watch, with melodic guitar lines weaving throughout any vestige of sonic space. A tambourine brightens the chorus as Catterall’s voice lifts in concert, and we have yet another winner from one of Sydney’s fastest-rising punk bands.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Listen to 2021 EP, Unsolicited Advice for Your DIY Disaster.</p> <h2>Sampa the Great – Bona</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99f97004284e9e6728ea7c4e7d9167558136f31d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99f97004284e9e6728ea7c4e7d9167558136f31d/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sampa the Great at Lollapalooza in Chicago\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sampa the Great at Lollapalooza in Chicago on 28 July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Grabowski/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>For fans of:</strong> Yeezus-era Kanye, Jamila Woods, REMI</p> <p>Sampa the Great’s 2018 banger Energy featured in <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3xN6J0LCyVj8k1gVCguWRH\"> Obama’s recent summer playlist</a> alongside luminaries such as Miles Davis, Joe Cocker and Beyoncé. It’s the perfect summer anthem, a bouncy, horns-driven bomp for summery times. In Australia, however, it’s winter. Sampa’s new single, Bona, is a claustrophobic club tune with a stalking bass line, breathy percussion and creeping vocal harmonies. While Barack may not be bumping this tune, it’s a far more accomplished creation than Energy – and while it’s pointless to make such comparisons, at this rate, Sampa might find that she is her only decent competition.</p> <p><strong>For more:</strong> Album As Above, So Below is out 9 September.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/03/the-reserve-bank-has-to-navigate-a-path-away-from-inflation-but-the-economic-signals-are-months-old","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T17:30:04Z","webTitle":"The Reserve Bank has to navigate a path away from inflation but the economic signals are months old | Peter Hannam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/the-reserve-bank-has-to-navigate-a-path-away-from-inflation-but-the-economic-signals-are-months-old","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/the-reserve-bank-has-to-navigate-a-path-away-from-inflation-but-the-economic-signals-are-months-old","fields":{"headline":"The Reserve Bank has to navigate a path away from inflation but the economic signals are months old","trailText":"While backward-looking labour market data is still robust, property prices provide a taste of the deteriorating outlook","byline":"Peter Hannam","body":"<p>A major challenge for central banks – and treasurers – is having to steer the economy down sometimes treacherous tracks using dated data, leaving them peering as much in the rearview mirror as through the windscreen.</p> <p>Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe’s destination is getting inflation back into the central bank’s preferred 2% to 3% range without stalling the economy.

In fact, notebooks of all kinds are cherished items to the media personality – he’s held on to the books he “self-published” as a kid and still aches for a notebook he once lost overseas. Here, he tells us why these journals become more valuable the more you use them.</p> <h2>What I’d save from my house in a fire</h2> <p>I would save the books I wrote when I was in primary school. I started my very own publishing company called Better Books. They were stapled pages with badly drawn pictures complete with grammatical errors and huge narrative potholes. I feel a connection with my school-age self through these books, which my mum kept in our garage all these years. All my influences are in there: Star Wars, Back to The Future, Indiana Jones, friends and sport – one story has me winning the 1986 Davis Cup by serving a hand grenade to Stefan Edberg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0de6e3ec3bf47c60317ad4f8bad914ea8feebb52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0de6e3ec3bf47c60317ad4f8bad914ea8feebb52/0_0_1900_2446/777.jpg\" alt=\"Buried Alive by Peter Helliar: one of the comedian’s childhood literary excursions under his primary school imprint.\" width=\"777\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buried Alive by Peter Helliar: one of the comedian’s childhood literary excursions under his primary school imprint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These books were not only my gateway to writing but also performing, as I would read them to the class and feed off their laughter. There is also a weirdly grim book called Buried Alive, which only as an adult I’ve come to understand was a reaction to losing my cousin, Matthew, to leukaemia.</p> <h2>My most useful object</h2> <p>My most useful items are pens and notebooks. Yes, I use my laptop and will often rely on my notes app to jot ideas down, but I have always loved the endless possibilities that a blank page presents. I genuinely find a piece of white paper exciting. I make sure I write with a pen quite often as my brain seems to work a little differently when I do.</p> <p>Whenever I begin working on a new standup show, I always buy a new distinctive notebook and I carry that around with me wherever I go, which is dangerous (see below). My wife, Brij, is always on me for the amount of notebooks I have and my refusal to throw any of them out. I’m not sure if I’m being silly for not tossing some of them, but there have been enough times when I look into an old notebook and rediscover a seed of an idea that I can now grow into something more substantial. That’s my excuse anyway and I’m sticking with it.</p> <h2>The item I most regret losing</h2> <p>I travelled overseas by myself when I was 18. I spent time in Scandinavia, the UK and (briefly) Germany for Oktoberfest. When I was in the UK, I decided that I would try standup. I bought a notebook and began writing ideas for routines and jokes. Notebooks are funny in that the more you write in them, the more valuable they become to you. I ended up coming home earlier than I thought I would, so I never tried standup in London – but I continued to write ideas and more jokes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/31/sunday-with-adam-hills-ill-be-on-barbie-duty-ribs-with-my-secret-ingredient-\">Sunday with Adam Hills: ‘I’ll be on barbie duty – ribs with my secret ingredient’</a> </p> </aside>  <p> A couple of years later I met up with a mate for lunch and a couple of drinks. I took my notebook because I thought if he left me waiting I could people-watch and write down my observations. By now you have probably guessed what happened: I left the notebook in the back of a taxi. I was devastated. That notebook represented my future. All those amazing thoughts, genius ideas and killer punchlines.</p> <p>Of course, I eventually got over it and began a standup career, which has gone pretty well. I also got to the stage where the gags and routines in there were probably amateurish and not as groundbreaking as they were in my head at the time. With that said, it would be nice to flick through and see what my first foray into writing comedy was like.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/03/elsy-wameyo-on-learning-her-roots-i-felt-i-had-this-coat-of-power-no-one-could-touch-me","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T17:30:04Z","webTitle":"Elsy Wameyo on learning her roots: ‘I felt I had this coat of power.

They made a handful of songs together, including Wameyo’s early singles Outcast, Pastor and Never There.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a8617760807baadfb5a35646552a0c00b6451f84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8617760807baadfb5a35646552a0c00b6451f84/161_165_846_1026/825.jpg\" alt=\"Elsy Wameyo\" width=\"825\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elsy Wameyo’s debut EP Nilotic is self-produced, and ‘dizzying in scope’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Tran</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the early days of the pandemic, Wameyo began to take part in Zoom calls hosted by the popular Kenyan band Sauti Sol. During one session, her mother popped her head in and began talking about Nairobi with the band’s guitarist, Polycarp Otieno. Amid the flurry of conversation, Otieno said the word “Nilotic”, sparking Wameyo’s interest. “I just hadn’t heard that word for a very long time, and I really just pondered on it for quite a bit,” she remembers. Over the next six months, she began researching the Nilotic people Indigenous to the Nile River regions, steeping herself in Nilot history. From there, she wrote Nilotic, the EP’s title track – a simmering, bass-booming rap song about the powerful, winding history of the Nilots, and their continued presence in the modern world.</p> <p>“[After doing all that research] I knew who I was – I felt like I had this coat of power that I had been wrapped in, and no one could touch me,” she says. “I feel like, as Black people, we’ve gone through so much, from slavery to today, where the moment you step outside of your house you’re being attacked by everything. And it was just ironic to me that, even after all of that, we still remain on top. That’s what made me say [on Nilotic] ‘I’m such a Nilot G’, because you’re fighting against all odds but [Black people are] still on top, and [the rest of culture is] still copying you<strong> </strong>– they’re still trying to replicate.”</p> <p>Nilotic was released on Music In Exile, a Melbourne-based label and artist services not-for-profit that aims to amplify culturally and linguistically diverse musicians and connect them with the industry. Over email, label director Joe Alexander praises the auteurist bent of Nilotic. “It’s Elsy, expressing what Elsy is, how Elsy feels, in the way that Elsy wants,” he says. “Viewing from the outside, it seems like it’s been such a cathartic process [for her] to make this EP and finally be able to have the space to do that.”</p> <p>The Nilotic EP is historical and timely, meditative but frantic in its genre-hopping. Its scope is dizzying, especially considering it comes from a first-time producer. Wameyo, who is devoutly Christian, sees it as spiritual duty. “A lot of [Nilotic] wasn’t something I did with my physical self. I think a lot of my work comes from pre-meditation, pre-prayer, pre-crying – it’s me going to God first and asking: ‘What is the purpose that you have for me? What do you want me to say?’ Because if Elsy said what she wanted to say, oh my gosh – it wouldn’t be it,” she says.</p> <p>“As a human, I’m so limited to, and so bound to, this world. So for me, I think it always really starts with first, just being in prayer and just asking God to guide me in that sense,” she continues. “I find that it always lands me in the right places, with the right people, in the right kind of conversations. God always reveals something – it’s just up to me to be ready.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Elsy Wameyo is playing in Adelaide, Melbourne, Darwin and Sydney through August and September, before sets at Falls festival over New Year’s Eve.

But a senior Labour source said it was made clear to her that Starmer did not expect to see pictures of shadow cabinet members on a picket line.</p> <p>The account of the meeting remains disputed between the two sides. One exasperated party adviser described the handling of the issue by Starmer’s office as “a car crash”, adding that it was “predictable, and predicted”, that with a series of strikes expected over the summer, the picket line ban would lead to ongoing confrontation.</p> <p>No further action is expected to be taken against Nandy, but the row has stoked tensions in Labour’s top team over the issue.</p> <p>Two other frontbenchers also visited CWU pickets: the shadow employment minister, Imran Hussain, in Bradford and the Labour whip Navendu Mishra, in Stockport. Both are expected to be spoken to but not sacked.</p> <p>The Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, is understood to be one of those shadow cabinet members who is sceptical about the picket line ban, and has made her concerns known to Starmer – but she has stuck to the agreed position, tweeting her support for striking workers without appearing publicly alongside them.</p> <p>Rayner and the shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, held an online meeting with senior figures from the CWU including its general secretary, Dave Ward, on Monday.</p> <p>They sent a joint letter to the BT chief executive, Philip Jansen, on Tuesday, urging him to meet workers’ representatives directly, to try to reach a settlement.</p> <p>The frontbenchers called his decision not to do so “highly unusual and deeply damaging, not just to the company but, given your role in critical national infrastructure, the interests of the country as a whole”.</p> <p>As the uncertainty over Labour’s stance continued, the leftwing campaign group The World Transformed said it would hold a “festival of resistance” alongside the party’s conference in Liverpool, at which leftwing Labour MPs would speak beside striking workers.</p> <p>The Liverpool West Derby MP, Ian Byrne, said: “Trade unions have been leading the way in demanding fairness and dignity for working people, and it is crucial that we support them.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Momentum, the Labour grouping that grew out of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership campaign, also plans to spend the summer putting pressure on the party to do more to show solidarity with struggling workers.</p> <p>“As the Tories deliver pay cuts for key workers and energy bills soar, Labour has a huge opportunity to show it is on the side of working people.

Sadly, I cannot see Keir Starmer heeding Mr Brown’s call to arms, despite the evident support for such changes in his own party and across the country.

Following the inquiry from the Guardian, to turn around and say it’s OK for them to play quietly in the corridor is actually insulting. It is not a privilege to play in a corridor. I never wanted my child to run around corridors.”</p> <p>James McAsh, Southwark’s Cabinet Member for the Climate Emergency and Sustainable Development, said the council was looking at whether Berkeley was in breach of the original planning agreement: “We want children of all backgrounds to have equal opportunities in life and the chance to play together. As a council we owe it to residents to make sure that developers give them the affordable housing and amenities they were promised.</p> <p>“We are looking into what Berkeley Homes agreed to provide in the original, consented planning applications … and will enforce violations retroactively if required.”</p> <p>Sarah said the lack of play space was compounded by wider restrictions on play in nearby streets.</p> <p>“The land on the riverside that we live on is privately owned so there are no ballgames, no kids’ bikes allowed, even with stabilisers. In lockdown, with everything closed, we took them out to play and immediately had security guards hovering over us.”</p> <p>All the parents the Guardian spoke to wanted to remain anonymous for fear of being labelled ungrateful for raising the issue.</p> <p>Sarah said: “I work for the NHS, I pay rent here. When I accepted the offer to move here I didn’t realise I was accepting a sentence of being a second-class citizen. I just thought it was a beautiful opportunity for me and my son. I do consider myself very fortunate to have been housed here but I have been shocked at how we are spoken to.”</p> <p>Play campaigners say they are seeing similar situations across the country, with lockdowns driving a rise in neighbours complaining about children playing, which are often backed without question by councils and landlords.</p> <p>Alice Ferguson runs <a href=\"https://playingout.net/\">Playing Out</a>, a Bristol-based charity that supports street play across the UK.</p> <p>She said: “Sadly, this type of situation is not at all unusual. We hear regularly from parents who have been sent ‘play ban’ letters by their council or housing association.</p> <p>“We have even seen letters threatening tenants with eviction if they continue to let their children play out. We saw an increase in these complaints and ‘play bans’ during the pandemic.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the mayor of London said: “All children should have access to outdoor and green space to play in, and segregation of these spaces has no place in London. Our play and informal recreation policy in the London plan requires new residential developments across London to provide at least 10 sq metres of play and information recreation space per child. The mayor has no enforcement powers in this instance and whether or not there is a breach is for the local authority to determine – the mayor welcomes the ongoing investigation by Southwark council.”</p> <p>*<em>Names changed</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/aug/02/those-of-us-with-family-abroad-cant-just-give-up-flying","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T17:02:35Z","webTitle":"Those of us with family abroad can’t just give up flying | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/02/those-of-us-with-family-abroad-cant-just-give-up-flying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/aug/02/those-of-us-with-family-abroad-cant-just-give-up-flying","fields":{"headline":"Those of us with family abroad can’t just give up flying","trailText":"<strong>Brief letters: </strong>Reasons to fly | Transport costs | ‘Sadmin’ music | Inventive chicken feed","byline":"Letters","body":"<p>It’s all very well for Fiona Henderson to tell us that we shouldn’t be flying (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/its-time-to-give-up-flying-on-holiday\" title=\"\">Letters, 1 August</a>).

Fast forward 3,500 years and the reverberations are still being felt within the global Anglican church.</p> <p>The issue of same-sex relationships, and more recently same-sex marriage, has caused bitter divisions among Christians. Conservatives argue for faithful adherence to the teachings of the Bible, saying there can be no questioning of its words.</p> <p>Liberals and campaigners for LGBT+ equality say that such a rigid approach to biblical teaching should also mean adulterers being put to death and a ban on wearing wool and linen at the same time. The constant reference to Leviticus 18:22 is demeaning and hurtful to LGBT+ people, they say.</p> <p>The Anglican Communion, the umbrella organisation of the 65 provinces of the global Anglican church, has been in combat over sexuality for at least four decades. To complicate matters, the divisions fall broadly along the lines of the global north and the global south.</p> <p>The current 12-day gathering of the once-a-decade Lambeth conference – confusingly held in Canterbury, Kent, rather than in south London – was postponed from 2018 when Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, concluded there was little hope of papering over toxic divisions. It was rescheduled to 2020 but again postponed because of the Covid pandemic.</p> <p>In 1998, the conference passed a resolution, known as Lambeth 1:10, which reaffirmed biblical teaching. It ​​rejected “homosexual practice as incompatible with scripture” and upheld “faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union”. Same-sex unions should not be legitimised or blessed, it added.</p> <p>Over the past decade, Welby, the leader of the Anglican Communion, has sought to hold together the polarised wings of his church, urging bishops, priests and congregations to “disagree well” and “walk together” despite their differences. In practice, he has infuriated both liberals and conservatives.</p> <p>In the Church of England, the leadership has insisted on a long drawn out debate, called Living in Love and Faith, perhaps in the hope that people will tire of the argument. There seems little chance of that happening.</p> <p>People in the UK and other global north countries may look on in bemusement, wondering how the shrinking church can be so out of tune with social attitudes towards same-sex marriage, which the church still forbids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in the global south, Anglican and other churches are growing in size and influence.</p> <p>Worldwide, the Anglican church includes 85 million people from 165 countries, speaking 2,000 languages.

The Padres sent minor league shortstop Victor Acosta to the Reds for the 29-year-old Drury, who has a career-high 20 homers this year.</p> <p>After contributing to the Nationals’ first championship in franchise history in 2019, Soto hit .351 in 2020 to win the NL batting title. He has been walked more than any other player in the major leagues over the past two seasons.</p> <p>“The atmosphere here is they want to win, and not just go to the playoffs but win a World Series,” said All-Star closer Josh Hader, who was obtained by San Diego on Monday in another big deal with Milwaukee. “That’s a contagious atmosphere to be a part of.”</p> <p>San Diego began the season with a luxury tax payroll of $229.3m, just below the first threshold, and the trades push the Padres into tax territory for the second straight season. Soto is owed $5,978,022 for the rest of this season and Bell $3,516,844.</p> <p>The package of prospects going to Washington is one of the most touted groups ever involved in one deal. Gore and Abrams debuted in San Diego this season after ranking among the sport’s elite minor leaguers, Hassell and Wood are both top 100 prospects according to MLB.com, and Susana was considered the best pitcher available in the 2021-22 international free agent class.</p> <p>Washington general manager Mike Rizzo set a lofty asking price last month after reports emerged that Soto rejected the team’s latest contract offer of $440m over 15 years.</p> <p>“We set the bar very, very high, and one team exceeded it and that’s the deal we made,” Rizzo said. “Props to the San Diego Padres. They’re not afraid, and ownership’s not afraid and AJ Preller’s not afraid and they were aggressive and we made a deal that you call historical.”</p> <p>Soto remains under team control for two more seasons after this one, which made it no sure thing the Nationals would trade him now. The Padres getting him for potentially three playoff runs even absent a new deal made this the peak of Soto’s value.</p> <p>That uncertainty began weighing on Soto, who said after Sunday’s game against St Louis: “I just want to get it over with and see what’s going to happen. Start over here or wherever I’m at.”</p> <p>He gets to start over in San Diego in the midst of his second All-Star season, part of a loaded lineup that also includes All-Star Manny Machado and Fernando Tatis Jr when the shortstop returns from a broken left wrist.</p> <p>“It’s pretty impressive to have those three types of guys on one team in the same lineup,” said Wil Myers, the Padres’ longest-tenured player. “Excited to see that trio, hopefully in the next week or two.”</p> <p>Tatis could be 10 days to two weeks away from being added to the active roster.</p> <p>With little protection around him in Washington’s lineup, Soto hit .246 with 20 home runs and 45 RBIs and 91 walks in 101 games.</p> <p>In 2,435 plate appearances since making his Nationals debut in 2018, Soto is batting .291 with 118 home runs and 357 RBIs.

We take a closer look at what we learned over the second quarter earnings season.</p> <h2>Vulnerable customers are struggling, but they have not borrowed from big banks</h2> <p>Lenders were up-front about the impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/uk-inflation-rise-petrol-diesel-prices\">40-year-high inflation</a> was having on their poorest customers.</p> <p>Lloyds said around 1% of its account holders were “really struggling to make ends meet”, while NatWest revealed customers on the lowest incomes were already edging into fuel poverty – defined as spending more than 10% of their earnings on energy bills.</p> <p>However, banks said this was not resulting in a surge in defaults, since few of those vulnerable customers actually borrow from major high street banks. That may be due to the fact that they would not have qualified for those loans in the first place.</p> <p>It means that, rather than putting aside cash to bad debts, banks are able to take less costly steps to deal with the cost of living crisis, including referring struggling customers to consumer charities, or building online budgeting tools.</p> <h2>Customers are cutting back on spending and some have more savings</h2> <p>Banking executives said many customers are actually in a better financial position than they were before the Covid pandemic. That is due to a drop in spending during lockdowns, which helped borrowers pay off debts and built up savings.</p> <p>“They’re going into this environment in really much better financial shape than they would have been pre-pandemic,” Barclays’ chief financial officer, Anna Cross, said.</p> <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/29/uk-government-payout-natwest-group-profits\">NatWest said most customers were spending about 20-30% more</a> on “critical items” such as utilities and fuel, consumers seem to be taking matters into their own hands. Lloyds said many were cutting back on subscription services such as Netflix and were avoiding big ticket items including white goods and computers.</p> <p>Cross explained that Barclays was keeping an eye out on changes in behaviour, such as a fresh reliance on overdrafts or cash withdrawals from credit cards, but had not yet seen any red flags. “I think it’s because of the the rational change around their own spending patterns. But also what we saw during Covid was a real buildup of savings by consumers and indeed corporates, and the [subsequent] paydown in unsecured debt.”</p> <p>NatWest’s boss, Alison Rose, added that nine out of 10 of her bank’s own mortgage borrowers had also protected themselves against inflation and subsequent rises in interest rates, by signing on to fixed rates.</p> <h2>Rising interest rates are supporting bank income</h2> <p>Even though some banks such as Lloyds Banking Group put aside extra cash to help cushion the blow of potential defaults, those costs were largely offset by higher income linked to rising interest rates.</p> <p>UK interest rates, which have hovered near record lows for the better part of the last decade, have jumped from 0.25% last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/16/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-125-to-tackle-inflation\">to 1.25% </a>today. It has meant banks are able to charge borrowers more for loans and mortgages, and in turn increase their net interest margin – a key measure of profitability and growth.</p> <p>Policymakers at the Bank of England are widely expected to increase interest rates again on Thursday, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/barclays-reveals-40-fall-in-profits-after-having-to-put-aside-15bn\">lenders including Barclays</a> believe they could rise to 2.5% by the end of the year.</p> <p>That could result in a slowdown in house price growth and mortgage lending. However, Lloyds said it still expected its own rate of lending to grow by single digits over the next 12-18 months.</p> <p>Barclays also appears to be taking advantage of the outlook on interest rates, having bought the specialist lender Kensington Mortgages in a £2.3bn deal last month.</p> <h2>Low unemployment is giving banks hope</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/lloyds-profits-take-hit-after-putting-more-money-aside-for-defaults\">Lloyds revealed one of the most pessimistic forecasts</a>: predicting little or no growth in UK gross domestic product over the rest of the year, and a mere 0.5% increase in 2023. That forecast will partly be affected by inflation peaking at 10-11%, before declining in the latter half of next year, the bank said.</p> <p>However, Lloyds executives explained that they were still encouraged by forecasts for the UK unemployment rate, which is expected to stay steady at just under 4%.</p> <p>“It is a very different shock that we’re experiencing, relative to the last 25 years in UK history. But there’s a lot to learn from some of those previous shocks that the economy has been through,” said Charlie Nunn, Lloyds’ chief executive.</p> <p>He said it was worth considering how emerging economies had dealt with similar economic situations in recent years. “I take a lot of personal experience from those experiences in places like Mexico, India, other parts of Asia, where we saw really significant inflation, but employment rates [were] high. There’s quite a lot to be learned from that.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/02/hodgkinson-knew-toone-would-become-england-star-after-smoking-boys-team","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T16:41:23Z","webTitle":"Hodgkinson knew Toone would become England star after ‘smoking’ boys’ team","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/02/hodgkinson-knew-toone-would-become-england-star-after-smoking-boys-team","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/02/hodgkinson-knew-toone-would-become-england-star-after-smoking-boys-team","fields":{"headline":"Hodgkinson knew Toone would become England star after ‘smoking’ boys’ team","trailText":"Britain’s 800m world silver medallist Keely Hodgkinson says she always knew her schoolmate Ella Toone would become an England star","byline":"Sean Ingle","body":"<p>Britain’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/25/keely-hodgkinson-settles-for-silver-in-narrowest-of-world-800m-defeats-to-mu\" title=\"\">800m world silver medallist Keely Hodgkinson</a> says she always knew her schoolmate Ella Toone would become an England star because she used to “smoke” all the boys at football.</p> <p>The pair have been good friends since meeting at Fred Longworth High School in Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, where they used to do cross-country and football together.

Talk about stress. These little berries that we’ve been nurturing, they’re like our … children.”</p> <p>Egton Bridge is the oldest gooseberry show in the UK, running on the first Tuesday of every August since 1800, apart from enforced breaks due to foot and mouth and Covid.</p> <p>Benson and her partner Dr John Snape, who tends the berries, have had many years of disappointment but are optimistic this time. “We’re in with a chance,” she says of the berries, carefully transported in a Marks &amp; Spencer shortbread tin with a homemade label, the word “scones” crossed out and replaced with “gooseberries”.</p> <p>“It is just such a fantastic tradition and it’s important, it’s part of our heritage,” Benson says. “With the weather we’re having, keeping berries until the first of August is a challenge because they are ripening too soon.

I think I’ve got a good pair of twins and I’ve got a heavy green as well. I’m happy this year, I might win a prize.”</p> <p>Like other growers, she says there is no big secret to growing big gooseberries apart from care and attention, although she has memories of the fertiliser her dad used when she was a child. “We used to go out for the day to Osmotherley and spend all day gathering sheep muck,” she says, possibly joking, possibly not.</p> <p>No one knows why the passion for growing giant gooseberries started but there is evidence of it being a hobby in industrial areas of England in the late 18th and 19th centuries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"199f44f6b5a94311a7511e07456de027ac3d4913\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/199f44f6b5a94311a7511e07456de027ac3d4913/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A grower’s gooseberries\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A grower’s gooseberries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Egton Bridge show started in 1800 and is still going strong, held this year for the first time at the plush <a href=\"https://egtonevents.co.uk/\">Egton Manor</a>, a weddings and events venue.

There’s gooseberry sawfly, mice like them, somebody has had rats attacking them on an allotment … blackbirds love them, wasps.”</p> <p>Keeping the show going is important, he says. “We are the custodians.

His research brought lasting change, creating an enlightened, more humane view of drug dependency.</p> <p>In 1960, Bewley was working at Tooting Bec hospital, a vast mental asylum in south London. When his colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/25/griffith-edwards\" title=\"\">Griff Edwards</a> said he knew of people living rough who would like treatment for their alcohol addiction, Bewley stepped forward to take care of them.</p> <p>He rapidly became interested in other types of addiction, treating 20 heroin-addicted patients at Tooting Bec, at a time when most psychiatrists in Britain had only come across one or two. He became a national authority on opiate dependence, publishing his findings in a series of groundbreaking papers in the Lancet and the British Medical Journal from 1964 to 1967. The government-appointed Brain committee (named after its chair, Sir Russell Brain) used his evidence as the basis of its 1964 report on drug addiction.</p> <p>Bewley described addiction as “a chronic relapsing disorder” and stressed that doctors had a fundamental duty to treat those who relapsed so that they could cope more successfully. He also introduced the concept of “harm reduction”, which today is a pivotal principle in treatment. It involved admitting patients for short periods to stabilise them, addressing their physical needs, which might include treating abscesses and sepsis, and sometimes prescribing methadone to take orally, to avoid the highs and lows they experienced when injecting drugs.</p> <p>He also believed it was important to understand patients’ hopes and fears and to take all their needs into account: some may benefit from literacy classes, for example, to equip them to get a job, or bereavement counselling if they had a traumatising grief from which their addiction stemmed.</p> <p>In an early survey, Bewley asked 50 patients how they injected and was horrified at the insanitary methods used. He started by cleaning their syringes with bleach and then got the outpatients department at Tooting to dispense sterile syringes.</p> <p>But it was also vital to address the number of drug addicts, which at the beginning of the 60s was rising fast. While there had always been long-term patients who became addicted to pain medication, and healthcare professionals who had become addicted because their jobs brought them into contact with drugs, now there was a new type of user. Young people were seeking out private doctors in London who would prescribe huge daily doses of heroin and cocaine with few questions asked. Bewley found one young man being prescribed 1,000mg of pure heroin a day. Some were selling their excess on to others.</p> <p>As part of his advice to the Brain committee, Bewley said there should be controls on prescribing and compulsory notification of drug addiction, as otherwise it was impossible to get accurate numbers of opiate addicts. He also said there should be specialised treatment centres, not least because withdrawal from drugs such as cocaine could induce huge mood swings and agitation, making it impossible to care for a patient on an ordinary hospital ward.</p> <p>In 1971 the Misuse of Drugs Act was passed and doctors needed a licence to prescribe controlled drugs. Dependence units began to be set up across the country. As well as being in charge of the inpatient unit at Tooting Bec, which was the largest in the UK, Bewley set up drug dependence units at St George’s hospital in Tooting and at St Thomas’ hospital in central London.</p> <p>Bewley was born in Dublin, the elder of two children. It was a distinguished Quaker family: one branch ran the Dublin-based Bewley’s cafe and beverages company, while the other side were doctors. His father, Geoffrey, and grandfather, Henry, were leading Dublin physicians, both working at Bloomfield, a small Quaker mental hospital. His mother, Victoria (nee Wilson) trained in medicine and his sister Mary became a psychiatrist.</p> <p>As a small child, he and Mary were taken by their grandfather to Quaker meetings in Dublin, and he would later describe himself as a “Quaker atheist”: though he didn’t believe in God, his approach to psychiatry and life in general were rooted in Quaker values such as tolerance, pacifism and caring for the most needy.</p> <p>Aged eight, he was sent to Arnold House, a boys’ prep school in Wales, where he developed a love of chess. A term at Rugby school in England followed, but the second world war broke out and he returned to Dublin to finish his schooling at St Columba’s college. From 1944 to 1950 he studied medicine at Trinity College Dublin, before working at the Adelaide hospital in the city and training in psychiatry at St Patrick’s hospital.</p> <p>In 1951 Bewley met the medical student <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/22/dame-beulah-bewley-obituary\" title=\"\">Beulah Knox</a>, whom he married in 1955. Her career took her to England, and Bewley followed. He took up a position in 1956 at the Maudsley hospital in London, a prestigious institution in psychiatry but one that left him underwhelmed, as he believed it failed to provide the kind of wraparound care that patients needed. In 1957 he left, moving to Cincinnati in the US for a year, where he was able to study alcoholism in different ethnic groups.</p> <p>On his return to the UK, Bewley got a job at Tooting Bec hospital. He and Beulah lived in the grounds of the hospital for the next eight years, before moving to their own house in nearby Streatham. They had five children, one of whom, Sarah, had Down’s syndrome and a heart condition. It was not possible for her to live with them, which was a great sadness, but the family used to visit her every week.</p> <p>Bewley became greatly involved with the Royal College of Psychiatrists, becoming its dean and, from 1984 to 1987, its president. He used the platform of his presidency to promote evidence-based medicine, setting up a research unit at the college as well as a faculty for substance misuse. He also became an adviser to the World Health Organization on drug dependence. When he retired, he wrote a history of the college called Madness to Mental Illness (2008).</p> <p>A cerebral man who always wore a polka dot bow tie, Bewley read voraciously and his living room was furnished with several thousand books. He had a dry wit and obtained great satisfaction from writing a satirical column, Ezra the Scribe, in the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Bulletin.</p> <p>Latterly he and Beulah lived in Victoria, in central London. He was prouder of her achievements than of his own, and when she developed dementia they both moved into a home in Wimbledon, where he could look after her until she died in 2018.</p> <p>Sarah died aged 44 in 2003. He is survived by his other four children, Susan, Louisa, Henry and Emma, and his granddaughter, Hannah.</p> <p> • Thomas Henry Bewley, psychiatrist, born 8 July 1926; died 26 June 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/02/russia-claims-us-directly-involved-in-ukraine-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T16:28:09Z","webTitle":"Russia claims US ‘directly involved’ in Ukraine war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/02/russia-claims-us-directly-involved-in-ukraine-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/02/russia-claims-us-directly-involved-in-ukraine-war","fields":{"headline":"Russia claims US ‘directly involved’ in Ukraine war","trailText":"Kremlin says White House supplying information used by Kyiv to conduct long-range missile strikes","byline":"Luke Harding in Lviv","body":"<p>The role of American intelligence in the war in Ukraine has been put under scrutiny after Russia accused the White House of supplying targeting information used by Kyiv to conduct long-range missile strikes.</p> <p>Russia’s defence ministry claimed Washington was “directly involved” in the war, and had passed on intelligence that had led to the “mass deaths of civilians”.

endorsement came as a blow to Sunak after a bitter campaign during which supporters of Mordaunt blamed Truss for a damaging “blue-on-blue dogfight”.</p> <p>Mordaunt was the latest in a number of new

Plans by <strong>Liz Truss</strong>, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership hopeful, to save billions a year with civil service cuts have been described as “ludicrous” and “a fantasy recipe for levelling down”.<br></p> <p>Truss has vowed to cut civil service salaries and reduce expenditure to recoup £11bn a year in a “war on Whitehall waste” if she becomes prime minister.</p> <p>In her announcement on Monday night, Truss revealed plans to move more civil servants out of London and to link their pay to living standards where they work. She also presented plans to slash civil service holiday entitlements.</p> <p>Truss also promised to “tackle left-wing groupthink in government” and to scrap diversity and inclusion jobs, saying they “distract from delivering on the British people’s priorities”.<br></p> <p>Truss said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As prime minister I will run a leaner, more efficient, more focused Whitehall that prioritises the things that really matter to people and is laser-focused on frontline services.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is “too much bureaucracy and stale groupthink” in Whitehall, she added. </p> <p>But her campaign, which received another boost with the backing of Penny Mordaunt on Monday, was forced to redo some of its sums within hours of releasing a series of proposals to reduce the cost of the civil service.</p> <p>Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said Truss’s plans showed the Conservative government’s “commitment to levelling up is dead”. It would also reduce “the pay of Northerners, worsening the divide which already exists”, she added. </p> <p>Rayner said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Liz Truss is declaring war on herself with her fantasy recipe for levelling down. </p> <p>This wannabe prime minister is stuck in the past, fighting old battles, and promising a race to the bottom on public sector workers’ pay and rights.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trade unions and policy experts condemned the plans as unworkable and said Truss had dramatically exaggerated the potential savings that she claimed would amount to £11bn a year.</p> <p>Alex Thomas, programme director at the Institute for Government, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The whole Civil Service pay bill is only about 9 billion. You’re not going to reduce the Civil Service pay bill to 200 million unless you pretty radically reshape the state.</p> </blockquote> <p>He argued the “complicated and controversial” move would mean nurses and teachers being paid less or receiving slower pay rises than others, adding: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not war on Whitehall, it’s more like war on Workington.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dave Penman, head of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, accused Truss of recycling “failed policies and tired rhetoric from the 1980s”.</p> <p>He described her plan as out of the “P&amp;O Ferries playbook” which would lead to cuts to “pay, terms and conditions”.</p> <p>PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka warned Truss to expect opposition “every step of the way” if she becomes prime minister.</p> <p>He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Civil servants are not a political tool to be used and abused for one person’s ambition; they are the hard-working people who keep the country running, day in day out, and they deserve respect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am: </em>The Insolvency Service releases their quarterly insolvency figures</p> <p><em>11:00am:</em> The National Institute of Economic and Social Research releases their quarterly forecast</p> <p><em>Morning: </em>Liz Truss visits Devon ahead of another round of hustings</p> <p>I’ll be covering for Andrew Sparrow today.

Record-high inflation and the war in Ukraine, combined with the supreme court’s decision to end the federal right to abortion access, appears to have sparked a national sense of pessimism.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/395378/biden-job-approval-dips-new-low.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> taken last month found that Biden’s approval rating had sunk to its lowest level since the start of his presidency, with just 38% of Americans giving him a positive review. Biden’s disapproval rating has climbed to 59%, intensifying Democrats’ concerns over a potential shellacking in the midterm elections this November.</p> <p>But things now seem to be looking up for Biden. In addition to the death of Zawahiri, the president has enjoyed some recent success on his domestic agenda as well. Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator who previously tanked Biden’s signature legislative proposal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/manchin-deal-democrats-schumer-reconciliation-bill-climate-health\">announced last week</a> that he had reached an agreement with the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer.</p> <p>The compromise bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/02/biden-agenda-climate-kyrsten-sinema\">still needs</a> to win the support of every Democratic senator, but if passed, the legislation would deliver $369bn in investments to combat climate change and help reduce the federal deficit through a series of tax increases.</p> <p>Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist and senior adviser to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the killing of Zawahiri and the Manchin deal showed how Biden and his party were delivering for all Americans.</p> <p>“Because of those two things, the country benefits, even those who did not support the president,” Seawright said. “I think it is a reminder to all those in the political ecosystem – elected and non-elected, voters and non-voters – that it is so important that we have leaders who understand the issues and the challenges we face, both abroad and at home, and can deal with those at the same time.”</p> <p>Biden’s allies say the killing of Zawahiri also vindicates the president’s broader foreign policy agenda.</p> <p>When the US withdrew from Afghanistan last year, Republicans and some foreign policy experts warned that America’s absence would leave them with little visibility into the region, as the Taliban took control of Kabul. Biden continued to defend his decision to withdraw troops, even as the world saw heartbreaking images of desperate Afghans trying to flee the country by clinging to departing planes.</p> <p>Biden administration officials asserted the killing of Zawahiri demonstrated how the US can still collect crucial intelligence and conduct counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan, even without boots on the ground.</p> <p>“President Biden last year committed to the American people that, following the withdrawal of US forces, the United States would continue to protect our country and act against terrorist threats emanating from Afghanistan,” the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. “With the operation that delivered justice to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaida, we have made good on that commitment and we will continue to do so in the face of any future threats.”</p> <p>But Republicans countered that Zawahiri’s presence in Kabul underscored how Afghanistan was becoming a sanctuary for terrorists now that the Taliban has regained control.</p> <p>“President Biden deserves credit for approving this strike. But al-Zawahiri’s return to downtown Kabul further indicates that Afghanistan is again becoming a major thicket of terrorist activity following the president’s decision to withdraw US forces,” the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said. “Killing al-Zawahiri is a success, but the underlying resurgence of al-Qaida terrorists into Afghanistan is a growing threat that was foreseeable and avoidable.”</p> <p>While the US celebrates the demise of a man who helped bring about the deaths of thousands of Americans, experts agree that Biden and other global leaders must remain vigilant to prevent future terrorist attacks.</p> <p>“It is dangerous to believe that the death of Zawahiri ends the threat of terrorism,” said Thomas Warrick, senior resident at the Atlantic Council and former deputy assistant secretary for counter-terrorism policy at the Department of Homeland Security.</p> <p>“Today’s most dangerous al-Qaida franchise is al-Shabaab in Somalia, far from where Zawahiri was living in Afghanistan. Their plots, we can predict, will continue uninterrupted by Sunday’s successful strike.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/02/the-new-dementia-tax-trusss-u-turn-is-first-real-howler-of-tory-leadership-race","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T16:16:13Z","webTitle":"‘The new dementia tax’: Truss’s U-turn is first real howler of Tory leadership race","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/the-new-dementia-tax-trusss-u-turn-is-first-real-howler-of-tory-leadership-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/02/the-new-dementia-tax-trusss-u-turn-is-first-real-howler-of-tory-leadership-race","fields":{"headline":"‘The new dementia tax’: Truss’s U-turn is first real howler of Tory leadership race","trailText":"Analysis: Truss’s misjudgement earns her comparisons to Theresa May in blunder critics say could have proved fatal in general election","byline":"Jessica Elgot Chief political correspondent","body":"<p>The most popular meme being shared by Rishi Sunak’s Conservative MPs on WhatsApp after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/liz-truss-u-turns-plan-cut-public-sector-pay-outside-london-tory-leadership\">Liz Truss’s U-turn</a> was the fateful image of Theresa May’s “nothing has changed”, which became a defining image of the 2017 election.</p> <p>Many of the former chancellor’s backers were quick to dub Truss’s policy the “new dementia tax”, which dogged May’s campaign and turned her MPs against her.</p> <p>In a comment clearly intended to invoke this previous trauma, his campaign spokesman said that if the U-turn had occurred during a general election campaign it could have been a “potentially fatal own goal for the Conservatives”.</p> <p>Scenting blood, both Labour and the Liberal Democrats were already preparing attack adverts for MPs in marginal seats who had backed Truss. Her U-turn was being predicted hours before it arrived, the first real howler of the campaign.</p> <p>It might not change the wind for Sunak – May won the 2017 election after aborting the unpopular social care reform. But it was a key reason why she lost her majority and it raised grave doubts in the minds of her colleagues about her political judgment.</p> <p>Truss’s plans for regional pay boards and savings of £8.8bn, which experts pointed out would mean swingeing pay cuts for all public sector workers, are likely to evoke similar unease. There is also a lingering question about whether there was sufficient scrutiny of the policy before it was hoofed out to journalists. The release talked about a “war on Whitehall” and plans to make efficiencies in the civil service.</p> <p>But when reporters and external experts questioned how Truss could save £8.8bn from a civil service pay bill that is around £9bn in total, the background notes from the campaign made it clear that it was “the potential savings if the system were to be adopted for all public sector workers in the long term”.</p> <p>Sources on Sunak’s campaign said they believed the sums had been lifted wholesale from an earlier report from the Taxpayers’ Alliance, which made it clear it should apply to the whole of the public sector – without exception.</p> <p>Truss’ campaign say it was never meant to apply to the public sector after all – but cannot then say how the sums add up to make the same savings.</p> <p>One former aide recalled officials in Number 10 had jokingly nicknamed the Department for International Trade the “Ctl C, Ctl V” department when it was run by Truss. Some around Sunak have suggested there has been a similar mistake made with this policy – Truss’s campaign have not commented.</p> <p>But Truss has long been interested in regional pay boards since her time as chief secretary to the Treasury, which means her insistence that the figures have been taken out of context or misinterpreted is unlikely to put an end to the matter.</p> <p>Governing when a significant number of your parliamentary colleagues have significant doubts in the back of their minds about your abilities and judgment is difficult – as Boris Johnson and Theresa May found. Already, Sunak has more backers in the parliamentary party than Truss, even though she has a string of new eye-catching endorsements and is steaming ahead with members.</p> <p>There is another lesson too for this leadership campaign. Over the course of the campaign both sides have been punting gradually more and more unworkable policies in order to win over Conservative members.</p> <p>The reams of ideas from both campaign – including hard right policies on jail sentencing and immigration – have been subject to very little real scrutiny thus far. Without more serious thought in the coming weeks, either candidate could stumble into a similar embarrassing blunder.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
