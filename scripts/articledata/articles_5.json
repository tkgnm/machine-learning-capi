Having ruled Westeros for centuries thanks to their possession of the greatest weapons known to man – fire-breathing dragons – the Targaryens were brought low when the dragons began to die, robbing them of their unique advantage.

The term “sexposition” was coined to describe the show’s habit of delivering key plot points while the characters were busy <em>in flagrante</em>, but the joke soon started to wear thin. The fact that the nudity was almost exclusively female was problematic enough, but the show also developed a worrying tendency to use extreme sexual violence as a “gotcha” plot point, leading to accusations that the show wasn’t just depicting misogyny but indulging in it.</p> <h2>4 No one is safe</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/house-of-the-dragon-review-game-of-thrones-prequel-got\">House of the Dragon first look review – this epic Game of Thrones prequel is a roaring success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Game of Thrones was adapted from the work of the American author George RR Martin, whose penchant for gleefully killing off major characters became a notorious talking point – there was always a chance your favourite might be next for the chop.

The Callisto Protocol, which arrives on consoles and PC later this year, is pitched as a spiritual successor to that franchise. Papoutsis is at the helm once again, and wants to show us just how terrifying the final frontier can be.</p> <p>“The challenge with things like supernatural horror is that there just aren’t clear rules for how things work,” says Papoutsis. “We like scenarios that are a little more relatable and visceral for players. When you’re talking about sci-fi weapons and monsters, there are some basic ground rules that players can count on. That way we can focus more on the thrill-ride and keeping players on their toes.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvNtUzSMKeE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DvNtUzSMKeE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The guns in The Callisto Protocol are heavy, unwieldy, and chronically low on ammunition, forcing players to rely on some eccentric methods to score a kill. See that massive fan blade whirring in the corner? Shove an assailant in and brace for the viscera. Papoutsis is especially proud of those wince-worthy moments: “Callisto is an incredibly dangerous place, and the environmental kills are a great chance to reinforce this idea with players,” he says. “Environmental hazards help keep the action fresh over time, as players are constantly looking for things to use to their advantage. Every encounter in every setting is a new challenge. Since this is a survival horror game, players will always be scraping to get by, and environmental hazards are also great options when players find themselves in particularly sticky situations.”</p> <p>I can only hope the deeper we delve into The Callisto Protocol<em>, </em>the more unsettling it will grow. One of the things I remember most fondly about Dead Space<em> </em>is the way it told its story; how we slowly uncovered what went so wrong on that accursed starship. Papoutsis stays mum on the plot, saying only that a “mysterious outbreak” has infected our poor fellow inmates, but he does say that the enemies we’ll find are all former earthlings overwhelmed by something outside our understanding. “The creatures are humans that have been transformed, so we wanted them to all have that shred of humanity left in them,” he says. “That makes them even more terrifying.”</p> <p>• The Callisto Protocol is out on 2 December on PC, PlayStation 4/5 and Xbox.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/19/experience-i-unearthed-a-mammoth-from-the-ice-age","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T09:00:11Z","webTitle":"Experience: I unearthed a mammoth from the ice age","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/19/experience-i-unearthed-a-mammoth-from-the-ice-age","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/19/experience-i-unearthed-a-mammoth-from-the-ice-age","fields":{"headline":"Experience: I unearthed a mammoth from the ice age","trailText":"An incredible storm blew up, as if we had released more than just an animal","byline":"Travis Delawski","body":"<p>I’d been working as a gold miner for only 30 days when I made my big discovery. The company I’d been employed by, Treadstone Gold, had begun its second season mining a cut in Eureka Creek in a remote region in Yukon, north-western Canada.</p> <p>I had been operating various machines as I learned the ropes, and early in the afternoon of 21 June this year I was using an excavator with a “ripper” attachment – a big metal hook that allowed me to break through the permafrost.</p> <p>The cut I was working in was surrounded by pine forests and had been dug down to about 60ft below the treeline. As I chipped at the bottom of a frozen bank of earth, I pulled a chunk away and saw something that I first took to be a skull. Miners often uncover the skeletons of animals such as ancient bison in this part of the Yukon – like other members of the crew, I’d been trained to remove these finds with care. My boss, Brian, was on site, so I called him on the two-way radio. “You’d better come down,” I said. “I think I’ve found a body.”</p> <p>“Is it human?” asked Brian.</p> <p>“I think it’s a buffalo or something,” I said. At that stage, we assumed we were dealing with a few bones, but when I looked closer I realised I was looking at something much more unusual. Wiping away some of the black muck coating the head, I saw it was more than a skull – it still had skin and ears, as well as what appeared to be a trunk. I grabbed the radio again.</p> <p>“It’s like a tiny elephant,” I said. “Brian, I think it’s a baby mammoth.”</p> <p>Brian told me to dig out the body and bring it straight up to camp. I had uncovered only the front half of the body, and wondered if there was more, so used the ripper attachment to cautiously poke around in the same area, eventually uncovering the mammoth’s back legs and rump, complete with a cool little tail. All in all, the body was about 4ft 6in long.</p> <p>I loaded the remains into an excavator bucket and drove them up to the mine’s main camp, where Brian and I examined them further. He was pretty taken aback – I don’t think I’d prepared him for how well preserved the mammoth was. It looked like it could have died the week before, and you could make out pores in the skin and the patterns on the pads on its feet – there was even hair still clinging on.</p> <p>Brian contacted the Yukon government palaeontologist Grant Zazula who promised to scramble a field crew as fast as he could. Meanwhile, we were advised to cover our find in wet blankets and tarpaulin. When the geological survey team arrived, it was clear how excited they were. They spent an extra couple of hours surveying the site of the discovery and found more hair from the mammoth, and preserved greenery from the time it had been entombed. We later learned the body was that of a female, probably a month old, and that she’d died during the ice age, at least 30,000 years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/29/experience-i-look-after-the-worlds-oldest-pot-plant\">Experience: I look after the world’s oldest pot plant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She was packed with ice to help preserve her long enough to make the two-hour journey to Dawson City, where she could be stored in a freezer. As she left the site on the back of a truck, the most incredible thunderstorm blew up out of nowhere and rolled through the valley. Thunderbolts were striking the ground nearby, rain was coming in sideways and we were pelted with hailstones the size of golf balls. Brian had to shut down the whole operation until it passed. It was like a scene from a movie, as if we’d released something more than just the mammoth.</p> <p>It took a few days for me to realise how significant the discovery was. We knew our find was a rare one, but soon learned I’d uncovered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/26/gold-miner-in-canada-finds-mummified-35000-year-old-woolly-mammoth\" title=\"\">most complete and best-preserved</a> mummified woolly mammoth found in North America.</p> <p>The land we’re mining belongs to the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation people, whose elders have called the mammoth calf Nun cho ga – in their Hän language, this means “big animal baby”. There has been a blessing ceremony at the Eureka site, and I gather she’ll remain on the traditional territory where she was found.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I’m concentrating on mining for gold, though always conscious of what else I might find.

In the past two years alone the firm received more than 50,000 complaints, the most of any operator and almost double that of the parallel east coast mainline operator, LNER.</p> <p>Avanti, co-owned by the Italian national railways, has come under renewed criticism for slashing services between major cities by up to two-thirds on the west coast mainline, and earlier this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/inquiry-after-avanti-passengers-scale-7ft-spiked-fence-to-leave-station-lake-district\">passengers were forced to climb a fence</a> at Oxenholme station in Cumbria after being locked in as their train arrived 100 minutes late.</p> <p>Avanti West Coast, whose contract is due for renewal in October, already has the lowest passenger satisfaction rating possible, a figure the transport minister Charlotte Vere <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2022-07-04/debates/6908E830-EB6E-4087-AEFE-4667CC85D585/WestCoastMainLine\">said last month was “terrible”</a>.</p> <p>Despite this, the Department for Transport (DfT) confirmed it would continue to hand over millions of pounds in management fees, after ruling out fining the operator for the failing service.</p> <p>The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, has warned her counterpart, Grant Shapps, that the government “cannot continue to wash their hands of responsibility, nor reward failure” as the damage to the economy from the ongoing failure of the private operator mounts.</p> <p>She has renewed calls for ministers to urgently demand a plan from Avanti for the full restoration of services, recover taxpayers’ money for services that are not running and, if an urgent plan to restore services is not put in place, strip the company of the contract.</p> <p>“This fiasco is causing real damage to the regional economy, passengers and the public,” said Hague.</p> <p>“This government has willingly sat back and rewarded failure, handing over millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money for an abysmal service. Under the absurd system they have created, passengers always come last. It’s time for ministers to wake up, do their job and hold this failing operator to account.</p> <p>“They should demand a plan from the operator to urgently restore these services, claw back taxpayers’ money being handed over for services that aren’t running, and if they do not act, they have no business holding the contract.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Avanti blamed the reduction in service on “the current industrial relations climate which has resulted in severe staff shortages”.</p> <p>He apologised to customers for the “enormous frustration and inconvenience this will cause”.</p> <p>The company is considering a request from Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, to scrap first-class restrictions while the reduced timetable is in operation, to fit more people on trains.</p> <p>The Department for Transport said: “The department’s performance-related pay to train operating companies is independently evaluated through a scorecard criteria based on factors such as operational performance, efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p> <p>“We are meeting Avanti West Coast regularly to discuss its performance and delivery for passengers.

An AR-15 is nearly three times more powerful than a typical handgun [and] already we’ve seen instances of school resource officers unintentionally discharging their weapons.</p> <p>“In Highland Ranch, Colorado, a security guard’s handgun <a href=\"https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/stem-school-shooting/guard-who-disarmed-suspect-mistakenly-shot-2-students-in-stem-school-attack-wont-face-jail-time\">shot through a wall</a> and injured two students. Had that weapon been an AR-15, there could have been even greater casualties,” Brown said.</p> <p>Brown said Sheriff Harwood’s approach was “misguided and dangerous”.</p> <p>“[It] could have deadly consequences. Our future generations deserve evidence-based solutions to keep them safe in the classroom, solutions like life-saving gun laws.”</p> <p>In June, Joe Biden signed the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/25/joe-biden-signs-gun-control-law\">sweeping package of gun reform measures</a> in decades that included tighter background checks and strengthening “red flag” laws to remove weapons from those adjudged to be dangerous.</p> <p>In Uvalde, as in Parkland, authorities missed, or ignored, <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2022/07/17/uvalde-shooter-warnings-background/\">multiple warning signs</a> indicating the teenage shooters were becoming a threat.</p> <p>“Lives will be saved,” Biden said during the signing ceremony at the White House, though the president acknowledged the bipartisan compromise bill “doesn’t do everything I want … I know there’s much more work to do.”</p> <p>It fell short of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/02/joe-biden-speech-assault-weapon-ban-gun-reform\">stated wish</a> to ban access to assault weapons for the general public.</p> <p>In North Carolina, meanwhile, activists blame politicians’ reluctance to act for provoking Harwood into a policy of placing assault-style weapons closer to pupils.</p> <p>“It’s disturbing that state lawmakers’ abject failure to pass common-sense gun safety laws has forced schools to even consider such dangerous and militaristic measures,” said Lee Ann Kelley, a volunteer with the North Carolina chapter of the campaign group Moms Demand Action.</p> <p>“There is a concerning lack of detail about the training, storage, and safety guardrails associated with this policy.</p> <p>“Instead of further militarizing schools and exacerbating the harm done to students of color who are already negatively impacted by the presence of [armed] school resource officers, policymakers should work to implement policies that will actually keep guns out of kids’ hands and keep our schools safe,” she added.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/19/covid-uk-arts-venues-energy-crisis-fatal","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T09:00:11Z","webTitle":"Soaring MDF prices, extortionate interval drinks, cash-strapped audiences: the arts are staring inflation in the face | Charlotte Higgins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/covid-uk-arts-venues-energy-crisis-fatal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/covid-uk-arts-venues-energy-crisis-fatal","fields":{"headline":"Soaring MDF prices, extortionate interval drinks, cash-strapped audiences: the arts are staring inflation in the face","trailText":"Just putting the lights on is staggeringly expensive. How many of our venues can survive this, asks Charlotte Higgins, the Guardian’s chief culture writer","byline":"Charlotte Higgins","body":"<p>Imagine a small music venue. There are many such places dotted around the UK, the sort of spot where you might catch an up-and-coming band, some folk or jazz, the occasional standup comedian. I’m thinking of a real venue, capacity 500, in the south of England. There’s nowhere else to see live music in this town, and it’s been going for decades. Only it may not be around for much longer. It’s just had its electricity bill, from the <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v34/n17/james-meek/how-we-happened-to-sell-off-our-electricity\">largely state-owned</a> French company EDF (fill in your own ironies). That bill is 640% higher than the last one.</p> <p>There’s no energy price cap for businesses such as this – that’s just for households. They’ve pulled in a broker to try to get them a better rate, without success. The extra £31,000 for putting the lights on is more than what the boss is paid. They’re worried that if they go public, the landlord and their suppliers will panic and pull the plug. Which really would be the end.</p> <p>One possible solution is to increase ticket prices from £8 to £12.50. Another, to put up a pint of lager from £5.70 to £8.20. But the last thing any of them wants to do is pass on costs to an audience who are already tight for cash, with inflation at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis-recession-looms\">40-year high</a> and the real value of workers’ pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/uk-wages-in-june-fall-at-fastest-rate-for-20-years\">falling at its fastest</a> for 20 years.</p> <p>But what’s to do? Covid was a nightmare for venues such as this, but the government did eventually step in with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/aug/22/culture-recovery-fund-135-english-music-venues-receive-336m-in-grants\">cultural recovery fund</a>. Mark Davyd, who runs the Music Venue Trust, told me that 50 to 100 members of his network are facing a “frankly imminent crisis” – one that is even more threatening than the pandemic, because this is happening completely outside the political conversation, which is focused on household bills. “It is oddly and tragically likely to close more music venues than Covid,” he told me.</p> <p>It’s not just small music venues. Thousands of small businesses and shops are going to be clobbered by massive energy bills and the result will be job losses and high streets yet more desolate than they are now. Let’s bring it back to the arts, though: the Lowry, Salford’s arts centre, has already gone public with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/17/the-lowry-salford-faces-tripled-electricity-bill\">tripled energy bill</a> – pushing £1m. There’s a similar picture at Sadler’s Wells in London, Britain’s national dance theatre, where it has just heard its energy costs are also likely to triple, to £900,000. That’s on top of a dozen years of standstill funding – which in real terms means a cut in its Arts Council grant of around 25%. It will be happening all around the country, and to your local arts centre, unless it is lucky enough to be locked into a long-term deal that doesn’t expire yet, or is part of a government energy-purchasing scheme.</p> <p>“Frankly, we are looking at ticket prices. And that’s difficult,” Sir Alistair Spalding, the theatre’s boss, told me. He’ll probably hike up the top end of big popular shows, leaving the cheaper tickets be – but even that policy, progressive in its way, letting the rich absorb the cost, is not an ideal vibe for a supposedly inclusive, welcoming theatre.</p> <p>Inflation and its consequences, as they filter through cultural organisations, will hit people hard: lives actually do get worse, more impoverished, when the Christmas show at your local theatre, a treasured family ritual, becomes unaffordable; when your teenager can’t watch bands in her home town; when the museum gets shabbier and cuts its opening hours and there’s nowhere warm and free to take the kids for a few activities. When arts organisations are under this much pressure, whole communities suffer.</p> <p>Of course, the long tail of Covid is making this much worse. Staff are exhausted by the constant crisis mode. Workforces are still getting hit by outbreaks. For many organisations, ticket sales have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jun/14/cancellations-costs-and-chaos-uk-theatres-grapple-with-rising-covid-cases\">yet to recover fully</a>. No one really knows if a whole tranche of people will ever kick the comforting Netflix habit and venture out again. The Proms, for example, are not alone in being around 20% down on sales compared with 2019. Audiences are also booking tickets later, hedging their bets. One folk musician, who’s embarking on a tour this autumn, tells me that venues are almost begging people to book early. Without enough advance sales they can be pushed into cancelling shows for fear that they won’t make back their costs.</p> <p>It’s not just energy bills that are going through the roof: at <a href=\"https://www.theatrclwyd.com/\">Theatr Clwyd</a>, in Mold, Flintshire, Steve Eccleson is head of workshop, in charge of building sets. He is staring inflation in the face through the huge hike in the cost of materials. An 8ft x 4ft MDF sheet has gone from £6.79 in July 2020 to £17 in January this year. Plywood has leapt from £29.98 a sheet in January this year to £43.75 in June. The tubing they use for scaffolding was £17.84 in 2020, but £64.90 now. That means the cost of a set – say, for the theatre’s new musical, The Famous Five – is up by between 30% and 40%. The theatre is also at the start of a big capital redevelopment, the cost of which Liam Evans-Ford, its executive director, is projecting to go up by 20%, but who knows?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/inflation-10-percent-class-war-brexit-cost-of-living-crisis\">Inflation at 10%?

A decade ago Glyndebourne plunged £1m into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/20/glyndebourne-wind-turbine-launch\">wind turbine</a> that, having paid for itself in six years, is shielding it from the current crisis.

Hampshire Cultural Trust, which runs the county’s museums, has used the same grant scheme, designed to decarbonise public buildings, to put <a href=\"https://www.hampshireculture.org.uk/about-us/environment\">solar panels</a> on four of its buildings. In truth, though, this kind of thing could have been done long ago; energy efficiency should have been higher up the political and cultural agenda.

The pictures are by a young Maurice Sendak. I can still quote it: “A tablespoon is to eat a table with. Mashed potatoes are to give everybody enough.”</p> <p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br>The Green Poodles by Charlotte Baker. It had everything I felt a book should have – orphans (none of whom missed their parents enough to spoil the story with sorrow), a mystery, a valuable painting and many dogs. </p> <p><strong>The book that changed me as a teenager </strong><br>Although my parents were proud to have raised such a reader, they began to worry about my unwillingness to leave the YA section of the library. When I was 14 or 15, Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice was pressed into my hands. It turned out to be just as good as the teen romances I’d been choosing for myself.</p> <p><strong>The writer who changed my mind</strong><br>In college, I read Doris Lessing’s The Golden Notebook<em>.</em> This was not the first book by a woman I’d read, but the first time I was so conscious of it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ernesthemingway\" title=\"\">Ernest Hemingway</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fscottfitzgerald\" title=\"\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/saulbellow\" title=\"\">Saul Bellow </a>and Ken Kesey – their women were inexplicable. They were often childish, petty and shallow, yet desirable. My bewilderment just seemed to be something I had to put up with until Lessing showed me I didn’t.</p> <p><strong>The book that made me want to be a writer </strong><br>I read Maxine Hong Kingston’s The<em> </em>Woman Warrior when it came out in 1976<em>.</em> I particularly loved the integration of personal and mythical; I’d never read anything like it. And then I read Gabriel García Márquez’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/apr/17/one-hundred-years-of-solitude-review\" title=\"\">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a><em>. </em>I grew up during a period in which realism was king, but these two works shifted the ground for me.</p> <p><strong>The book or author I came back to </strong><br>As a child, I did not like fairytales. Only as an adult have I become an enthusiast. I read fairytales; I read books about them; I rewrite them. I no longer mind so much when bad women cut off their own toes, or good ones exchange their tails for painful legs.</p> <p><strong>The book I reread</strong><br>I am one of the legions of women who reread Austen regularly, and am always surprised by how often I see something new. As a teenager, I was all about the romance. During college I focused on how few options women had. Then I had children and noticed admirable mothers in Austen were mostly dead. Then I began to write and saw her unusual plotting choices, her uncanny ability to be both present and absent on the page. Austen can be anything you want while always remaining herself. </p> <p><strong>The book I could never read again </strong><br>The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger<em>. </em>I no longer like it even a little bit.</p> <p><strong>The book I discovered later in life</strong><br>I made a New Year’s resolution to stop pretending I had read books I hadn’t. This necessitated a crash course in all those I had already pretended to have read. Given that it’s generally conceded to be a great book, I shouldn’t have been surprised to really like Moby-Dick, but I did and I was. </p> <p><strong>The book I am currently reading</strong><br>Jason Mott’s Hell of a Book. So very good.</p> <p><strong>My comfort read</strong><br>Brat Farrar by Josephine Tey. I honestly don’t know why.</p> <p>• Booth by Karen Joy Fowler (Serpent’s Tail) is nominated for the Booker prize<em>.</em><em> </em>To support The Guardian and Observer, order your copy at <a href=\"http://guardianbookshop.com/\">guardianbookshop.com</a>.

He rejected suggestions parents should be given basic supplies or vouchers for specific shops to reduce the possibility of fraud.</p> <p>“The return-to-school allowance is useful and fair. It is a precious help for 3 million families to finance the supplies for the children and cover the expense of the start of the school year. Stop stigmatising them,” Veran tweeted.</p> <p>Fourteen MPs from the opposition Les Républicains party submitted a draft law aimed at “controlling the use of the school supplies allowance and combatting fraud” earlier this month.</p> <p>The signatories pointed to the “absence of checks on what the money is spent on”, saying this allowed recipients “to use this benefit for purposes other than their children’s educational needs”.</p> <p>Instead, they want families to be given a set of basic school supplies for each child, along with “vouchers allowing parents to buy the clothes or equipment needed for their schooling”. Most French schools do not insist on uniforms.</p> <p>Laurence Rossignol, the former minister for families, now vice-president for the Parti Socialiste (PS) in the Sénat upper house, said allegations of fraud by parents were an “annual old chestnut”.</p> <p>“Every year parents are accused of buying flat-screen televisions, new wheels for their car, smartphones … it’s the same old story of the poor drinking their benefit money,” Rossignol said.</p> <p>Another critic of the proposals, Sandrine Rousseau, an MP for the Europe, Ecology, Les Verts (EELV) party, added: “Behind this proposal lies doubts of the ability of the poorest parents to take care of their children. And this is serious.”</p> <p>The annual list of <em>fournitures scolaires </em>(school supplies) is an end-of-summer headache for parents of school-age children. Pupils are expected to arrive for the first day of term in September with the exact number, size and colour of exercise books, pens, pencils and folders specified by different teachers. This time of year, supermarkets and stationers are packed with frustrated parents looking for packs of single/double A4 paper with small/large squares that are perforated/unperforated.</p> <p>For low-income families the cost is eased by <a href=\"https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/actualites/actualites-du-ministere/article/majoration-de-4-de-l-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-versement-en-aout-pour-plus\">the allowance</a>, paid in August, to parents with at least one school-age child.

It is paid to households whose income is lower than €25,730 with one child, €31,225 with two children, €37,080 with three and €42,935 with four or more.</p> <p>As well as the school allowance, the French government has approved an “exceptional” extra payment of €100 (£85) plus €50 (£42) for each child to families on the minimum income in September to help with the rise in the cost of living.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/aug/19/australia-politics-live-emissions-environment-electric-vehicles-summit-chris-bowen-anthony-albanese-scott-morrison","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T08:50:08Z","webTitle":"Russian embassy spokesperson suggests Australian government unwilling to support espionage-proof building ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/19/australia-politics-live-emissions-environment-electric-vehicles-summit-chris-bowen-anthony-albanese-scott-morrison","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/aug/19/australia-politics-live-emissions-environment-electric-vehicles-summit-chris-bowen-anthony-albanese-scott-morrison","fields":{"headline":"Russian embassy spokesperson suggests Australian government unwilling to support espionage-proof building – as it happened","trailText":"This blog is now closed","byline":"Mostafa Rachwani and Natasha May","body":"<div id=\"block-62ff4b888f080eafb8918a9e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-19T08:46:07.297Z\">9.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">What we learned: Friday 19 August</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And with that, we will close the blog for the day.

Kennedy</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Bowen opened with a quip about the <a href=\"https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/inflation-reduction-act\">US Inflation Reduction Act</a> that recently passed Congress could have been the Inflation and Emissions Reduction Act.</p> \n  <p>There’s also a standard stump speech reminding the attendees of the previous government’s “decade of denial and delay” on all things climate, including electric vehicles.</p> \n  <p>Bowen said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the intent of an electric-car policy in Australia had been to limit the availability of choice for Australians and to make [EVs] more expensive than they need to be, that policy has been entirely successful.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The main point of the speech, though, <a

believe that now is the time to have an orderly and sensible discussion about whether vehicle fuel efficiency standards could help improve the supply of electric vehicles into the Australian market, to address the cost-of-living impacts of inefficient cars, and to reduce emissions from the transport sector.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

Firstly - there is no inequality that climate change doesn’t make worse, including Indigenous disadvantage, whether it be people in substandard housing in remote communities or the people of the Torres Strait dealing with the impacts of climate change today on their beautiful islands that I was able to visit recently and the prime minister was there yesterday.</p> \n   <p>And secondly - that First Nations people must be integral partners in charting the way forward.

Thomas Tuchel has made no secret of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/18/wesley-fofana-leicester-will-not-play-chelsea-interest-distraction-brendan-rodgers\">his desire to sign another centre-back</a>, leaving the 23-year-old in little doubt of his lowly place in the pecking order. Chalobah has no shortage of admirers in the Premier League, while <strong>Inter</strong> are also reported to be interested in taking him to San Siro for the rest of the season.</p> <p>With the Brazilian defensive midfielder <strong>Casemiro</strong> looking increasingly likely to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/manchester-united-close-on-casemiro-with-real-madrid-to-accept-70m-offer\">parachuted into the Manchester United bin fire</a> sooner rather than later, surprise reports from Spain suggest <strong>Real Madrid</strong> have identified his compatriot <strong>Bruno Guim</strong><strong>ãraes</strong> as a potential replacement. Having established himself as a fan favourite since moving to Newcastle from Lyon for £40m last January, the 24-year-old has frequently expressed his delight with life at St James’ Park and any departure in the current window seems extremely unlikely.</p> <p>Borussia Dortmund are the latest to rule themselves out of a move for <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong>, on the grounds that he is too old and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/05/erik-ten-hag-cristiano-ronaldo-manchester-united-reprimanded-leaving-early\">high maintenance</a>, and has excessive wage demands. The 37-year-old striker is desperate to leave United to play Champions League football but is fast running out of options. The offer of a return to his former club <strong>Sporting</strong> remains on the table but only if the Lisbon side can get him on a free transfer.</p> <p>The Benfica striker <strong>Gon</strong><strong>çalo Ramos</strong> is turning heads at <strong>Wolves</strong>, <strong>Southampton</strong> and <strong>Newcastle</strong>, who are all in dire need of a frontman. The 21-year-old is in fine form, having scored five goals and provided three assists in five games for his club this season. Southampton are believed to have made an offer of £24m for Ramos but could end up being gazumped by their far wealthier rivals on Tyneside. Newcastle also remain keen on signing <strong>Jo</strong><strong>ão Pedro </strong>but are reported to have had a second offer of over £23m for the Watford forward turned down.</p> <p><strong>West Ham</strong> have upped their bid for the Club Brugge midfielder <strong>Hans Vanaken</strong> after having an initial offer of around £8m rejected. The 29-year-old Belgian has made it clear he wishes to join the Premier League side and negotiations between the two clubs are set to continue in the coming days.</p> <p>Finally, <strong>Bernardo Silva</strong> continues to be linked with a move away from Manchester City, despite their apparent determination to keep him at the Etihad. <strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong> and <strong>Barcelona</strong> are the Portuguese playmaker’s two main suitors.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"info/cookies","type":"article","sectionId":"info","sectionName":"Info","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T08:25:35Z","webTitle":"Cookies on the Guardian website","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/info/cookies","fields":{"headline":"Cookie policy","trailText":"This policy describes what cookies are, the kinds of cookies we use and how to switch off cookies in your browser, and provides some useful links for further reading.

Some Guardian web pages may also contain content from or link to other sites which may set their own cookies. If you share a link to a Guardian page, the service you share it on may set a cookie on your browser.<strong><br><br><br>How do we use cookies?</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>We use cookies in a range of ways to improve your experience on our sites or apps (“site”), including:</p> <ul> <li><p>Keeping you signed in</p></li> <li><p>Understanding how you use our site, for instance how long you stay on a page or which article you read next</p></li> <li><p>Delivering content to you</p></li> <li><p>Showing you journalism that is relevant to you</p></li> <li><p>Showing you Guardian products and services that are relevant to you</p></li> <li><p>Delivering marketing and service messages to you on our site</p></li> <li><p>Working with partners to deliver relevant advertising to you</p></li> <li><p>Reminding you to complete online journeys</p></li> <li><p>Processing payments and refunds</p></li> <li><p>Monitoring how users interact with pages on our site to identify and remedy interface issues</p></li> </ul> <p>In the next sections, we explain in more detail how cookies on our site may be useful, as well as when and where you can control them.</p> <h2><strong>What types of cookies do we use?</strong></h2> <p>We use four types of cookies:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Strictly Necessary</strong> – These cookies are essential to provide you with services you have requested, which means they cannot be switched off through the privacy settings link. For example, strictly necessary cookies make it possible for you to stay logged into your Guardian account and make comments. If you set your browser to block these cookies, then these functions and services will not work for you. In particular, we won’t be able to save your preferences about cookies.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Performance</strong> - These cookies measure how often you visit our sites and how you use them. We use this information to get a better sense of how you engage with our journalism and to improve our sites and apps so that you have a better experience. For example, we collect information about which of our pages are most frequently visited, and by which types of users. We also use third-party cookies to help with performance.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Functionality</strong> – These cookies are used to recognise you and remember your preferences or settings when you return to our site so that we can provide you with a more personalised experience. For example, if you are based in the UK, we will remember this and make sure that you receive the UK homepage when you visit our site, rather than the US or Australia homepage. A mix of first-party and third-party cookies are used.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Advertising</strong> – These cookies are used to collect information about your visit to our site, including the content you have viewed, the links you have followed and information about your browser, device and your IP address. We have set out more details on this below.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>How long do cookies last?</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Session cookies</strong> – These cookies only last as long as your online session and expire when you close your browser such as Internet Explorer or Safari</p></li> <li><p><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> – These cookies stay on your device after your browser has been closed and last for a time specified in the cookie (but not longer than 13 months). We use these cookies when we need to remember you for more than one browsing session, for instance to remember your preferences from one visit to the next.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Why do we use cookies for advertising?</strong></h2> <p>From the very first edition of the Manchester Guardian, published in 1821, our journalism has been funded in part by advertising. Our editorial content is not influenced by the advertising we display and our journalists are free to, and often do, challenge the activities of companies and organisations that advertise and sponsor content that appears in Guardian sites and publications.</p> <p>Increasingly, our readers fund us directly – either by buying a newspaper, or taking out a print or digital subscription or through making one-off, regular or monthly contributions. But to grow our number of supporters, we are reliant on marketing and still rely in part on advertising to fund our journalism. Therefore, cookies provide vital services to the Guardian without sacrificing our independence or values.</p> <h2><strong>How do we use cookies for advertising?</strong></h2> <p>If you accept cookies, as you browse our site, we will place cookies on your device. Some cookies are for advertising, so we can understand what sorts of pages you read and are interested in viewing. We can then display advertising on your browser based on these interests. For instance, if you have been reading a lot of food articles, you may be shown more adverts for food.</p> <p>Our apps integrate third-party software that provides us with information about how the app is used and what content you have viewed for the purposes of online advertising and analytics. It uses cookies from some of the providers listed in our Privacy settings, that can be found in the footer of every page on our site. The advertising techniques we use do not collect personal data such as your name, email address, postal address or phone number. We sometimes use information such as your IP address and browser type and also sometimes share limited aspects of this with others for advertising purposes.</p> <p>We also allow other organisations to use cookies and other technology to help us analyse how our site is being used, measure the number of visitors to the site, and display advertising. </p> <h2><strong>How do third parties use cookies for advertising?</strong></h2> <p>With your consent we share and receive online data collected through cookies with our advertising partners. This means that when you are on another website, you may be shown advertising based on your browsing patterns on our sites. We may also show you advertising on our sites based on your browsing patterns on other sites that we have obtained from our advertising partners.</p> <p>Online retargeting is another form of online advertising that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you advertising based on your browsing patterns and interactions with other sites. The use of cookies may mean that when you are on another site, you may be shown advertising based on what you have looked at on our sites. For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop, you may start seeing adverts from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products you were browsing. This allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase.</p> <p><strong>Ozone Project</strong></p> <p>We are a partner in the <a href=\"https://ozoneproject.com/\">Ozone Project</a> that uses cookies to collect information about what you have viewed and how you have used our sites and our app. They will make assumptions about your interests and preferences and add you to groups based on those assumptions, in order to show you advertising. For example, if you look at a page in our travel section you might be added to a group for people interested in holidaying abroad, and then we might show you adverts for holidays abroad.</p> <p>You can find details of how the Ozone Project handles your information <a href=\"https://www.ozoneproject.com/privacy/platform-notice\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Microsoft<br></strong>We have entered into an agreement with Microsoft who may collect or receive information about you to provide Microsoft Advertising, you can opt out by following this link: <a href=\"https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement\">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement.</a></p> <p><strong>Google Ad Manager </strong> </p> <p>We use Google Ad Manager to deliver advertising.

We use cookies to help with this. For example, we place a pixel on our web pages that allows Facebook to place cookies on Guardian online readers’ web browsers.</p> <p>When a Guardian reader who uses Facebook returns to Facebook from our sites, Facebook can identify them as part of a group of Guardian readers and, on behalf of the Guardian, deliver them marketing messages from us. Based upon our agreements with Google, Facebook, and Twitter, the data that can be obtained from a visit to the Guardian is limited to the URL of the pages that have been visited and, in some cases, the status of any partially-completed or completed commercial transactions undertaken with us, together with the limited information a browser might pass on, such as its IP address.</p> <p>In addition to the cookie controls that are set out below, if you are a Facebook user you can opt out by following this <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217\">link</a>.</p> <h2><strong>How can you control advertising cookies?</strong></h2> <p>If you reside anywhere in the world (except California or the US), you can exercise control over advertising cookies by clicking the Privacy settings link in the footer of every page on our site. For more information, please read “How to manage cookies at the Guardian” below.</p> <p>If you are a California or US resident, you may elect to opt out of all sales of personal information through these cookies, tags, pixels, and web beacons by clicking the “California resident - Do not sell” link located in the footer of every page on our site or by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” button inside our privacy banner.</p> <h2><strong>How to manage cookies at the Guardian</strong></h2> <p>You can manage the use of cookies on our sites, including advertising cookies, and disable the sharing of data with partners for advertising purposes by clicking the Privacy settings link in the footer of every page of our site. This link is displayed in the footer of every page you view on our sites. These Privacy settings allow you to withdraw your consent to placing cookies, or object to the use of data collected by cookies under the legitimate interests option.</p> <p>If you are located in the US, please use the “California resident - Do Not Sell button” instead, which you can find in the footer of every page on our site.</p> <p>Opting out will reduce the number of advertising partners with whom we share your data, although you will still see some advertising that has been tailored to you as well as advertising intended for Guardian readers in general.</p> <p>You can switch some cookies off through the <a href=\"http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk\">Your Online Choices site</a>. You may need to do this again each time you use a different IP address, device, or virtual private network.

We determine the legal grounds based on the purposes for which we have collected your personal data.</p> <p><em>Legal grounds for using your personal data</em></p> <p>The legal ground may be one of the following:</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Consent</em>: Often we will use your personal data because we have asked for your consent, which you can withdraw at any time. Examples of where we ask for your consent include:</p> <ul> <li><p>to send marketing emails to you, when we have asked your permission. You can withdraw your consent to receiving these emails at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email or through your email preferences in the “emails and marketing” tab, when signed into your Guardian account.</p></li> <li><p>to place non-essential cookies, or other similar technology. We provide more details of how we use cookies in our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies\">cookie policy</a>. In particular we use cookies to enable the display of advertising through Google Ad Manager and to collect analytics on how our site is used, including through Google Analytics. You can withdraw your consent to us placing these cookies at any time through our Privacy settings link on our sites in the footer of every page.</p></li> <li><p>to place non-essential cookies that allow us to personalise the advertising that you see. For example, the Ozone Project is an advertising platform that collects information from users to build “segments”. This allows the Ozone Project to identify users on our sites and those of other publishers.</p></li> <li><p>to analyse your registration data and data collected from cookies to personalise advertising. We do this by analysing your data to predict what you might be interested in. We will also compare your registration data with trusted partners.</p></li> </ul></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em>Performance of a contract with you (or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you)</em>: We will use your personal data if we need to in order to perform a contract with you. For example, where you have purchased a subscription from us, we will need to use your contact details and payment data in order to process your order and deliver your subscription or we may contact you directly via social media or email if you enter competitions, prize draws, bids or respond to call-outs.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em>Compliance with law</em>: In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal data.</p></li> <li><p><em>Our legitimate interests</em>: We may process your personal data where it is necessary for our legitimate interests in a way that might be expected as part of running the Guardian and in a way which does not materially impact your rights and freedoms. For example, it is in our legitimate interests for us to understand our readers, promote our services and operate our sites and apps efficiently for the creation, publication and distribution of news, media and related journalistic content both online and in print form, globally. Examples of when we rely on our legitimate interests to use your personal data include:</p> <ul> <li><p>when we analyse what content has been viewed on our sites and apps, so that we can understand how they are used and improve our content.</p></li> <li><p>to monitor the number of articles that users of our apps read, so that we can request our app users subscribe to our app.</p></li> <li><p>when we embed content on our site, for example to display Guardian content on the unbranded version of the YouTube embedded player. We process personal data so that readers can access this YouTube player and we can understand how users interact with our content, for example whether users watch the full video or only a proportion of it. This will involve using cookies as described in our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies\">cookie policy</a> and sharing information with YouTube as set out in the “When we share or sell your personal data” section of this privacy policy.</p></li> <li><p>to analyse our readers and supporters to better understand your interests and preferences so that we can make our marketing more relevant to you. This includes when we promote our own products and services. For example, we look at what you have viewed on our sites and apps and what products and services you have bought (including what you have looked at and what products or services you have bought on our other platforms, for example Guardian Jobs). You can opt out from having your personal data used for marketing analyses by going into your account to the tab “emails and marketing”.</p></li> <li><p>to show you more relevant advertising based on that analysis by creating “segments” of particular types of audiences so that we can show you advertisements that may be more relevant to you and the ‘’segments’’ you may be in.</p></li> <li><p>to use those “segments” to create “custom audiences” so that we can identify our audience across third party websites. This is normally by using cookies as described in our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies\">cookie policy</a>. For example we use these “custom audiences” to present advertising on social media platforms like Facebook. You can manage the use of cookies by clicking the Privacy settings link on our sites in the footer of every page.</p></li> <li><p>to keep you informed about the Guardian if you have subscribed or supported us in the past, and have not opted out from receiving our communications.</p></li> <li><p>for internal administrative purposes related to our services - such as our accounting and records.</p></li> <li><p>to inform you of any changes to our services, such as updates to our terms and conditions.</p></li> <li><p>to collect and log IP addresses to improve and manage our site and apps.</p></li> <li><p>to personalise our services (for example when you sign in) by remembering your settings, and recognising you when you sign in to access the Guardian in different ways, such as by our app and on our site.</p></li> <li><p>enabling you to share our content with others using social media or email.</p></li> <li><p>contacting you directly via social media or email if you send us emails or engage with the Guardian on social media or contact us.</p></li> <li><p>when we respond to your queries and to resolve complaints.</p></li> <li><p>for security and fraud prevention, and to ensure that our sites and apps are safe and secure and used in line with our terms of use.</p></li> <li><p>to test changes to our site we may vary the personal data that is collected and how it is used. This allows us to see the impact on users and how users interact with different options on our sites and apps.</p></li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Where we rely on cookies to collect any personal data please see our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies\">cookie policy</a> for more information and how to manage your cookie choices through our Privacy settings link on our sites in the footer of every page.</p> <p>The Guardian is a media organisation and publisher.

This includes, for example, the region that you are located in, so that we can show you the prices for subscriptions or other products in your local currency. We may also add personal data to improve the accuracy of your delivery address when we send out mail. We may also obtain your personal data from partners whose offers we include in some of our marketing communications and we use this personal data to ensure that we do not send you irrelevant marketing and to ensure the accuracy of the information we hold.</p> <p>We also use personal data based on the content you have viewed on our sites and apps and your interaction with the content to add you to groups with similar interests and preferences, so that we can make our online advertising more relevant. Sometimes we use data about your interests or demographics that some of our global third parties have collected from you online to add you to these groups, such as Comscore and Nielsen.

Some of our services may have a higher age restriction and this will be shown at the point of registration. </p> <p>We also note and comply with the California law which prohibits sale of personal data of consumers between 13-16 years of age unless their guardian has authorised the sale. </p> <h2><strong>Security of your personal data</strong></h2> <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. You are responsible for choosing a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of our sites or apps. You should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site. You should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us. Unfortunately, sending any information, including personal data, via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.</p> <h2><strong>When we share your personal data</strong></h2> <p><em>Within the Guardian group of companies</em></p> <p>Depending on where you live, we may share your personal data within the Guardian group of companies in the UK, US, or Australia. We may share it in order to perform a contract with you, for administrative purposes, or when we have a legitimate interest in doing so. For example:</p> <ul> <li><p>If you book an event held in Australia, at first we may hold your data on our systems in the UK and then we may share it with the Guardian in Australia for administration purposes</p></li> <li><p>Sometimes we may receive a letter, email or another form of communication from you that we consider to be significant to the history of the Guardian. We may decide to share this with the Guardian Archive run by the Guardian Foundation for historic and archiving purposes</p></li> <li><p>We may share your data to understand how you interact across our group products or to tailor and offer relevant advertising to you.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>With external organisations</em></p> <p>We share your personal data with other organisations that are not directly linked to us under the following circumstances:</p> <p><em>Service providers</em> - We may share your data with other organisations that provide services on our behalf. We may do this to perform a contract we have entered into with you, where it is in our legitimate interests or with your consent. Examples of when we may share your data with service providers include sharing with:</p> <ul> <li><p>companies that help deliver newspapers and subscription vouchers, such as i-Movo</p></li> <li><p>online payments processors who process credit and debit card transactions on our behalf</p></li> <li><p>fraud management providers that help us to identify and prevent online fraud</p></li> <li><p>internet and cloud hosting services providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS)</p></li> <li><p>life-cycle engagement platforms such as Braze, to help us build and manage our campaigns</p></li> <li><p>software service providers such as Salesforce that assist us with our customer relationship management</p></li> <li><p>communications services providers, such as our podcast service provider called Acast</p></li> <li><p>error tracking software providers, such as Sentry and Google Firebase, to help us diagnose and fix errors and optimise the performance of our website and apps</p></li> <li><p>service providers that help us carry out analytics, facilitate audience creation and segmentation and to measure our audience engagement.

The embedded player relies on the YouTube API, which is a type of software that allows data to be communicated between our website and apps and the YouTube player. This will include personal data which will also be collected by cookies as set out in our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies\">cookie policy</a>.

For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep personal data while you are still using our product or services. We may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a subscription. If we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.

In 1973 Los Angeles, a relationship develops between 15-year-old actor and waterbed entrepreneur Gary (Cooper Hoffman, son of Philip Seymour) and mid-20s photographer’s assistant Alana (Alana Haim of sibling rock trio Haim). Despite the occasional discomfort of the age gap (picture this with the genders reversed), it’s a chaste romance, sweetly played by the two leads, which develops through a series of exquisite set-pieces – none more so than the delivery of a bed to notoriously furious Hollywood producer Jon Peters (a hilarious Bradley Cooper cameo). <em><br>From Friday 26 August, Prime Video</em></p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <h2>Witness for the Prosecution</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1697792630a9ffe51566869cb4d79c8d460eb300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1697792630a9ffe51566869cb4d79c8d460eb300/8_7_2604_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton in Witness for the Prosecution.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marlene Dietrich and Charles Laughton in Witness for the Prosecution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MGM/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Billy Wilder meets Agatha Christie in court and the verdict is unanimously positive. The 1957 thriller, adapted from Christie’s play, is carried along partly by its twisty plot and partly by Charles Laughton’s twinkly-eyed turn as defence barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts. His interest is piqued by a watertight murder case against poor inventor Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) – and he won’t let a recent heart attack stop him taking the brief. Marlene Dietrich challenges him for star wattage as Vole’s wife Christine, who is strangely indifferent to her husband’s fate. <br><em>Saturday 20 August, 2.35pm, BBC Two</em></p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <h2>Foxtrot</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95f10b6497814191b1335b36ad26f66076d2eb13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95f10b6497814191b1335b36ad26f66076d2eb13/187_0_1430_858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yonaton Shiray as Jonathan in Foxtrot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yonaton Shiray as Jonathan in Foxtrot.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bord Cadre Films/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>War affects two Israeli parents and their soldier son in different ways in this narratively bold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/04/foxtrot-review-samuel-maoz-israel-venice-festival\">drama</a>. Michael (Lior Ashkenazi) and Daphna (Sarah Adler) are devastated after being told their child Jonathan (Yonathan Shiray) has been killed in the line of duty. We then see Jonathan at his desert checkpoint, where the mood is, initially, a bit Catch-22 – a squaddie foxtrots; the barracks slowly sinks into the sand; a camel saunters past.

Or is he in purgatory – in between heaven and hell – seeing his life flash before his eyes?

Yet that’s the tone Gaia Vince strikes in Nomad Century. “We are facing a species emergency – but we <em>can</em> manage it,” she writes, “with a planned and deliberate migration of the kind humanity has never before undertaken.”</p> <p>Vince, an environmental journalist, stresses that climate displacement is already under way, with people fleeing parts of Latin America, Asia and Africa. Efforts to reduce carbon emissions, though vital to the future survival of humanity, are already unlikely to limit global heating to the extent that we avoid further displacement. The UN’s International Organization for Migration estimates that 1.5 billion people could be forced to move in the next 30 years alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, the world is undergoing a demographic shift. Populations in the global north – the wealthier, cooler parts of the world towards which many people may flee – are ageing rapidly and workforces are becoming too small to support elderly people. This, suggests Vince, presents an opportunity. Brought together, this new population mix can adapt and build cities capable of withstanding the new extremes of flood, fire, drought and heat.</p> <p>Technology will help us, Vince argues, but we must also “shed some of our tribal identities” – such as nationalism – and “embrace a pan-species identity” as citizens of Earth. We will need to move not just once, but multiple times: eventually, Vince suggests, efforts to repair ecosystems could enable people to return to places they once abandoned.</p> <p>Nomad Century raises two questions: do humans have the ability to meet this challenge? And if so, how? Vince offers a persuasive response to the first. She takes us on a tour of cutting-edge technologies – from mats made of algae that float on the ocean and can be used to grow crops, to particles that can be injected into the atmosphere to reflect solar radiation – while remaining clear about their limitations. Her account of human development, meanwhile, argues that movement and mixing are essential to the survival of life (a subject explored more fully by Sonia Shah in her 2020 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/26/the-next-great-migration-by-sonia-shah-review-movement-is-central-to-human-history\" title=\"\">The Next Great Migration</a>).</p> <p>Her answer to the second question, however, is less convincing. “We need to develop new plans based on geology, geography and ecology – not politics,” Vince writes. What this misses is that the very process of treating parts of life as beyond politics – for example, by allowing society to be increasingly governed by market dynamics – has led to a resurgence of the “tribalism” Vince wants us to move beyond. The disaster of the past decade is that rightwing populists have undermined efforts both to mitigate climate change and protect refugees by playing on people’s feelings that political institutions no longer work in their interests.</p> <p>An alternative approach might be to reframe environmentalism as part of a collective demand for greater control over our lives – along with our working conditions and our means to afford such essentials as food and housing.

In the past she has made an LP of drones for yoga and meditation, a new age album that was premiered on the Calm app, and she’s even written a pocketbook called Listening (complete with cards featuring “listening exercises”).</p> <p>But Smith is also a leading figure in modular synthesis. She studied composition and sound engineering at Berklee College of Music, falling under the spell of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/steve-reich\">Steve Reich</a>, and later acquired an enormous Buchla synthesiser, using it to make several solo albums of burbling electronica. She has also made a synth-pop concept album about the life cycle, recorded a duet with her mentor Suzanne Ciani and another collaboration with Hollywood composer Emile Mosseri.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a979c711885920ef76b8df3a62d05a4addce53fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a979c711885920ef76b8df3a62d05a4addce53fe/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith: Let’s Turn It Into Sound album cover\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith: Let’s Turn It Into Sound album cover</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some tracks on this new album hark back to Smith’s earlier fascinations: Check Your Translation, Pivot Signal and Then The Wind Came draw from Reichian phased minimalism, but here these glistening arpeggios are overlaid with heavenly, digitally harmonised vocals. Elsewhere the minimalism collides with poppy electronica and Afrobeat rhythms, as if tape footage from a dozen sessions has been cut into fragments and assembled at random. Tracks frequently change tempo, key and mood, while discordant elements overlap.</p> <p>The result is often similar to one of Charles Ives’s polytonal pieces – but, where Ives replicated the sound of, say, a brass band marching past a church choir, Smith’s music often sounds like a dozen mobile phone ringtones going off in a video games arcade while a west African drum circle rehearse on the street outside. Occasionally, this cacophony sounds sublime.</p> <h2>Also out this month</h2> <p><strong>Takuro Okada</strong> is a 29-year-old Japanese guitarist whose album Betsu No Jikan (Newhere Music/Space Shower Music/Bandcamp) starts with an oblique version of John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme, but it’s the trippy astral jazz of Alice Coltrane that dominates – an all-enveloping riot of low-volume percussion, quavering sax solos, rippling piano and woozy string instruments. Sam Gendel, Carlos Niño and Jim O’Rourke guest. <strong>Diamanda Gal</strong><strong>ás</strong> is one of the few contemporary artists whose music can truly be described as gothic. Her latest, Broken Gargoyles (Intravenal Sound Operations), is filled with strangled banshee wails, creaky medieval drones, dark ritualistic utterances in German and horror-movie soundscapes that are genuinely quite terrifying. Montreal quintet<strong> Esmerine</strong> explore that liminal zone between post-rock and drone-based minimalism, and their Everything Was Forever Until It Was No More (Constellation) is dominated by lovely, spartan melodies played on strings and piano. Bruce Cawdron’s marimba is the star of Foxtails &amp; Fireflies, while Brian Sanderson’s horns carry the haunting Fractals for Any Tonality.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/19/why-areas-uk-drought-visual-guide","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T07:59:35Z","webTitle":"Why are some areas of the UK in drought?

We are in need of urgent action and the new prime minister must commit to publishing a fully costed and funded workforce plan to tackle chronic staff shortages in the longer term.”</p> <p>That call was echoed by Dr Kitty Mohan, the chair of the international committee at the British Medical Society, who said the NHS did not have enough staff.</p> <p>“The simple fact is that we do not have enough doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff to meet the growing and increasingly complex healthcare needs of our population,” Mohan said. “We are calling for the government and NHS England to publish a long-term workforce strategy as soon as possible.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/19/dropping-plans-for-indigenous-cultural-centre-at-barangaroo-a-backward-step-aboriginal-leaders-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T07:47:32Z","webTitle":"Dropping plans for Indigenous cultural centre at Barangaroo a ‘backward’ step, Aboriginal leaders say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/19/dropping-plans-for-indigenous-cultural-centre-at-barangaroo-a-backward-step-aboriginal-leaders-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/19/dropping-plans-for-indigenous-cultural-centre-at-barangaroo-a-backward-step-aboriginal-leaders-say","fields":{"headline":"Dropping plans for Indigenous cultural centre at Barangaroo a ‘backward’ step, Aboriginal leaders say","trailText":"NSW government under fire after scrapping proposed standalone venue at the Cutaway site","byline":"Sarah Collard","body":"<p>The New South Wales government has come under fire for its decision to cancel plans for an Indigenous cultural centre at Barangaroo’s enormous Cutaway site.</p> \n<p>A number of feasibility studies and concept designs had been undertaken on the proposal for the subterranean landmark site, housing almost 5,500 sq metres of space.

href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/bulletins/retailsales/july2022\">Office for National Statistics</a> said sales volumes rose by 0.3% on the month, after a revised fall of 0.2% in June, with a range of online sales promotions helping to overcome a broader trend for a decline in spending.</p> <p>Despite the increase in headline sales, spending on clothing and bigger-ticket household goods continued to fall as consumers cut back amid concerns over affordability and the cost of living.</p> <p>The figures come as households across the country come under

sales snapshot showed clothing stores sales volumes fell by 1.2% in July as shoppers tightened their belts amid concerns over the cost of living.</p> <p>Household goods stores sales volumes dropped by 0.4%, mainly because of falls at furniture and lighting stores.</p> <p>Food store volumes rose by only 0.1% in July, compared with a monthly growth rate of 2.7% in June when the Queen’s jubilee celebrations boosted sales.</p> <p>Kien Tan, the director of retail strategy at PwC, said online promotions such as Amazon’s Prime Day event had contributed to the surprise growth in headline sales volumes last month. “Almost every other retail category continued to go backwards,” he said.</p> <p>“With the prospect of more inflation to come, the concern for retailers is that shoppers will simply have less to spend as the nights draw in.”</p> <p>The ONS said public sector borrowing was £4.9bn in July, a month when the government finances are typically in surplus because of self-assessed income tax receipts flowing into the exchequer.</p> <p>The figure was £800m lower than the same month a year earlier, when the coronavirus pandemic affected the public finances, but was significantly higher than the £200m deficit forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p> <p>The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said the government would provide support for households hit by soaring living costs. “I know that rising inflation is creating challenges for families and businesses, and it is also putting pressure on the public finances by pushing up the amount we spend on debt interest,” he

You decide who’s right in this bad-mannered standoff","byline":"Interviews by Georgina Lawton","body":"<h2><strong>The prosecution: Helena</strong></h2> <p><em>Benji clutches his fork in his fist like Henry VIII and I </em><em>find it really embarrassing</em></p> <p>I’ve been with Benji for four years, and we’ve lived together for two. Ever since I’ve known him, he’s always eaten with his knife and fork the wrong way around.</p> <p>I’ve been raised, like most, to eat with the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right. But Benji doesn’t do that. He often eats an entire meal with his knife in the left hand and his fork in the other. I think it’s bad manners.</p> <p>I’m not a stickler for perfect etiquette, but there’s something about watching him cut a piece of meat with a big knife in his left hand, and eating it with his right that just bugs me. He also holds his fork in a funny way: he sort of points it up to the sky with his hand, which is balled up like a fist. It brings to mind an image I studied as a child of a group of men at some sort of 16th-century banquet. Sometimes I jokingly call him Henry VIII.</p> <p>It’s just the way he clutches his fork. It’s so intense. I was raised to never direct your fork anywhere but to your plate, and to hold it pointing downward, with your index finger on the back. When I tell Benji this, he laughs it off and says I’m overthinking. He also scoops his food on to his fork, rather than spear his food with it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>At a wedding, he used a soup spoon for cutting a piece of fish</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once, at a dinner party, a friend of mine said: “Oh, doesn’t Benji hold his cutlery in a funny way?” Obviously I had to agree. I brought up the Henry VIII nickname and I think he got a little embarrassed. I apologised later when the guests had gone home.</p> <p>Benji also isn’t very good with following the order of cutlery in formal settings. Once at a wedding he used a soup spoon for cutting a piece of fish. Another time he placed a napkin in his neck-tie to use as a bib. I said to him, “You can’t do that, it looks childish.”</p> <p>I also told him, at a formal dinner, cutlery is placed in the order it will be used, starting from the outside. He said rules were not as important as enjoying the food. </p> <p>I love Benji but he needs to brush up on table etiquette. We’re in our late 20s and starting to attend more weddings. I don’t want to be embarrassed to sit around a table with him.</p> <h2><strong>The defence: Benji</strong></h2> <p><em>Helena is being snobby; table manners vary around the world and we all have our little quirks</em></p> <p>I don’t think my table manners are that bad. In fact, I think they’re pretty normal. There is no right way to hold a knife and fork: it simply depends on where you’re from and what you’re used to.</p> <p>In America, they’ll put their fork in the left hand and knife in the right when they cut their food. Then, to eat, they place the knife down and switch the fork to the right hand to eat. In Europe they don’t do that. I have said this to Helena and she goes, “But you’re not American!” Alas, this is true. But it shows that the way you hold cutlery is cultural.</p> <p>Helena imposing the British way on me is, in my opinion, snobby (even though I am British). She should be more open-minded. Helena also says I hold my fork like Henry VIII and that it looks “uncouth”. I had to research what she meant, and discovered that the European way is to point the fork down and spear the food. I never took to eating this way. </p> <p>I don’t remember my parents ever teaching me that and it certainly doesn’t come naturally to me. I prefer to use the fork a bit like a spoon and scoop food on to it. Sometimes, I even cut my food with the side of my fork, which drives Helena crazy. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The manners and etiquette police are very boring. They exist to keep us in little boxes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The time we had a dinner party and Helena jumped onboard with her friend was a bit annoying. We all have our little quirks, and I could have done without everyone poking fun at me. Helena says she isn’t into etiquette, but she knows so much about it I have to disagree. She has even shown me a few table manners videos on YouTube.</p> <p>At a couple of weddings she pointed out I shouldn’t tuck my napkin into my neck but I only did it as a joke as I’d had a few beers. She was embarrassed but I thought it was funny.</p> <p>I think Helena needs to take a chill pill. She isn’t perfect on this front either – although she may deny it, she’s been known to belch at the table on more than one occasion. And I always let that slide. The manners and etiquette police are very boring. They exist to keep us in little boxes – and I want to break free.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/05/you-be-the-judge-should-my-wife-switch-to-brushing-her-teeth-after-breakfast\">You be the judge: Should my wife switch to brushing her teeth after breakfast?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The jury of Guardian readers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Should Benji make an effort to follow convention at the dining table?</strong></p> <p>Benji is innocent – his table manners sound fine and Helena’s attitude towards him holding his cutlery the “wrong” way round sounds a bit antiquated. I’d understand her point if he were eating with his mouth open, so until that happens, carry on Benji.<em><br></em><strong>Jonny, 30</strong></p> <p>Table manners are important, but Helena’s approach is unhelpful. If Benji feels defensive enough to cry “freedom” or joke about the issue – it’s indicative of a wider relationship problem. <br><strong>Amy, 37</strong></p> <p>If Benji were going to a banquet with the Queen this might matter slightly, but in ordinary life there are plenty of ways to use cutlery. Left-handed people might switch them round, and it’s perfectly acceptable to scoop food with a fork. Helena needs to lighten up.<br><strong>Elaine, 56</strong></p> <p>Helena should stop trying to change Benji and pressuring him to act the same way she does. Surely all that matters is that he’s good company. <br><strong>Kirsty, 28</strong></p> <p>Helena’s rules are rooted in an outdated class system where form and posture were more important than kindness and happiness. While Benji’s technique could be refined, it is Helena who displays bad manners by calling him out in public. (Benji should be careful about mentioning Helena’s belching though.)<br><strong>Joseph, 27</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>You be the judge</strong></h2> <p>So now you can be the judge.

It’s fun, fantastic-looking and seems set to get us hooked all over again","byline":"Lucy Mangan","body":"<p>The Iron Throne has been taken out of storage and returned to the Great Hall of the Red Keep. The wardrobe department has de-mothballed its finest furs and thrown them round the shoulders of a new cast. The creator of High Valyrian, David J Peterson, has likewise been brought out of hibernation to supply new dialogue.</p> <p>And there be dragons.</p> <p>Yes! The long-awaited prequel to the epic fantasy series Game of Thrones, which dominated the televisual landscape for eight riotously expensive seasons is here. It is derived from parts of author George RR Martin’s 2018 bestseller Fire and Blood (the release was a bittersweet moment for fans who hoped he had been completing the Song of Ice and Fire book series from which Game of Thrones was adapted, rather than writing a prequel). House of the Dragon, then, is the tale of the Targaryens who began the whole bally thing.</p> <p>Everyone who wasn’t in Game of Thrones or filming The Crown when principal photography started is here. House of the Dragon begins in the ninth year of King Viserys I Targaryen’s reign (played by Paddy Considine) – and about 200 years before we TV viewers first set foot in Westeros. His wife is pregnant. Their firstborn was a daughter, Rhaenyra (Milly Alcock), so everyone in the Seven Kingdoms is hoping for a male heir. Some of us at home are kind of hoping for another girl, otherwise Viserys’s arrogant, bellicose younger brother – and heir presumptive – Prince Daemon (Matt Smith) is going to kick off and there will be more plot than anyone knows what to do with.</p> <p>Alas and alack. After a spectacularly bloody and pain-meds-free birth, mother and baby (boy) die. The King’s Hand, Ser Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) gives his boss five minutes to grieve before ordering his comely teenage daughter Alicent (Emily Carey) into her late mother’s dress and Viserys’s chamber to make herself useful to the king. This is a post-#MeToo prequel, so they bond over their shared griefs and his stone model of the Seven Kingdoms rather than dish up one of the rapey sex scenes so beloved of GoT. God, feminists ruin everything.</p> <p>So here’s a pickle! Viserys knows – though he gets very narked when members of his council point it out to him – that Daemon is fundamentally unsuited to governing the realm. But he’s only got a lousy girl-child with any kind of claim to the throne instead. What to do, what to do? Nothing that makes anyone too happy, that’s for sure.</p> <p>By the end of the first hour, all the main pieces are in play, countless political, domestic and actual storms are brewing, old alliances are being broken, new ones formed and treachery is never more than a spear’s length away. House of the Dragon looks set fair to become the game of political seven-dimensional chess that its predecessor was, designed to reward diehard fantasy fans in full measure without alienating the masses that will propel it to the top of the ratings.</p> <p>For the avoidance of doubt and anxiety, the first hour also contains:</p> <ul> <li><p>Bloody beatings</p></li> <li><p>Bloody deaths</p></li> <li><p>Terrible wigs</p></li> <li><p>Extensive exchanges in High Valyrian</p></li> <li><p>Boobs and bums in brothels (take THAT, feminists!)</p></li> <li><p>Incesty vibes (AGAIN!)</p></li> <li><p>A king’s council filled with self-interested twunts and one good man</p></li> <li><p>Countless brewing political, domestic and actual storms</p></li> <li><p>Alliances, counter-alliances, treacheries and broken loyalties</p></li> <li><p>All the money up on screen</p></li> <li><p>Dragons</p></li> </ul> <p>By the end of the second hour, you can add more dragons, more extended exchanges in High Valyrian, a dragon’s egg, some decapitations, a hand in maggots, more bums and boobs, some arterial spray, narrative twists and turns that are still comprehensible (though we are still in the early stages and you can feel the barely controlled crowds of more jostling in the wings), a potential forbidden-love interest for Rhaenyra, and sailors fed to crabs – a lot more frightening than it sounds, actually.</p> <p>In short, all is as it was in GoT’s heyday. Fun, propulsive, looking great and sounding passable. And that, after the bizarrely poor finale to what had been a roaring success of a show, is a relief. There are also signs that in the remaining eight episodes there will be much more of the magnificent Eve Best as Viserys’s cousin Rhaenys, known since her thwarted ascension to the Iron Throne as the Queen Who Never Was and I suspect to the writers as And One Who Might Be After All. Overall, a good time is coming.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Episode one of House of the Dragon airs on Sky Atlantic at 9pm on Monday 22 August in the UK.</em> <em>In the US, it’s available on Sunday 21 August at 9pm on HBO and HBO Max.<br></em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/19/james-purefoy-fishermans-friends-brexit-sex-education","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Sex Education’s James Purefoy: ‘Fisherman’s Friends is the only good thing that came out of Brexit’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/19/james-purefoy-fishermans-friends-brexit-sex-education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/19/james-purefoy-fishermans-friends-brexit-sex-education","fields":{"headline":"Sex Education’s James Purefoy: ‘Fisherman’s Friends is the only good thing that came out of Brexit’","trailText":"As the sequel to the Cornish fishing film is released, its star discusses his 30-year mission to avoid fame, being caught up in a racism row and dealing with bullies – himself included","byline":"Ryan Gilbey","body":"<p>James Purefoy strolls over to the breakfast buffet in a London hotel, pours himself an orange juice and saunters back to the table. “Nobody knows who I am here,” says the 58-year-old actor in a hushed, appreciative tone. To be fair, nobody knows who he is anywhere. Sure, there were times when he had phone cameras shoved in his face in New York during his three-season spell between 2013 and 2015 as a serial killer and cult leader opposite Kevin Bacon in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/27/the-following-box-set-review-kevin-bacon\" title=\"\">The Following</a>, which was watched by 11 million viewers in the US. And shoppers at the supermarket near his home in Somerset (“not the fashionable part”) once approached him to praise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/13/fishermans-friends-review-seaswept-britcom-reels-in-the-laughs\" title=\"\">Fisherman’s Friends</a>, the 2019 hit about real-life Cornish lobster fishers whose sea shanties won them a recording contract.</p> <p>Mostly, though, he has spent the past 30 years in constant employment and near-anonymity. He has twice “pulled away” from offers to play James Bond. “I was worried about what would change. Could you still sit in a pub with your mates? Could you knock a ball around in Ravenscourt Park [in west London]? You really can’t.”</p> <p>He has seen the perils of fame up close. “It affected some of my friends so badly, especially during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\" title=\"\">the phone-hacking stuff</a>.” Was he hacked, too? “Ah. Well. Hmm. We’re looking into it. But the effect on the level of trust in my friendship group was cancerous. When people become famous, it’s exhausting.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3945ae442b922fd131e4a35b90c81d755e1ff18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3945ae442b922fd131e4a35b90c81d755e1ff18/0_0_3270_2136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Reese Witherspoon in Vanity Fair\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Undercover … Purefoy with Reese Witherspoon in Vanity Fair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, he has zigzagged from costume dramas (Vanity Fair, Mansfield Park) and historical epics (Rome) to fantasy adventures (Resident Evil, Solomon Kane, John Carter), bawdy comedy (Sex Education) and superhero origin stories (in Pennyworth, about the early years of Batman’s butler, he plays a kind of blue-faced, steampunk Tin Man). “Part of the reason I do so many jobs is to hide behind them,” he says.</p> <p>His latest film is a sequel to Fisherman’s Friends. “You saw it, right? You probably hated it, but anyway …” Woah there: why would he assume I hated Fisherman’s Friends: One and All? “No, no, I shouldn’t judge,” he says, apologetically, rubbing his salt-and-pepper beard, which is several days past stubble. “But you watch incredibly complex, interesting, textured stuff, so this must have seemed rather … <em>simplistic</em>. I’m sorry. I get into this self-defeating whirlpool of anxiety and neurosis.”</p> <p>Perhaps that is to be expected. For such innocuous Britcoms, the Fisherman’s Friends movies come with more than their share of serious undertones. Both pictures take place before the EU referendum, but in their stories of Cornish voices trying to make themselves heard in the modern world, they contain the seeds of Brexit. “When the first one came out, the country was highly polarised,” he says. “Here was a very simple story about family, community, friends. It was a comfort blanket. And diversity is not just about people of colour. It can be about working-class lobster fishermen, too.” He gives a doleful smile. “Maybe the film is the only good thing that came out of Brexit.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ef0XMH2bwg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-Ef0XMH2bwg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Latest catch … watch the trailer for Fisherman’s Friends: One and All.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>With the second film out this week, there is still a lingering question of racism surrounding the promotion of the first. “I’ve been instructed not to discuss the Noel Clarke situation,” he says, through gritted teeth. “Suffice to say that everything is complicated.” Did he feel that Clarke, as the one lead actor of colour in the original film, had a point when he objected in May 2020 to the poster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/29/noel-clarke-i-was-left-off-fishermans-friends-poster-and-none-of-the-cast-spoke-up\" title=\"\">which named seven lead actors, but featured only six white faces </a>? Purefoy raises an eyebrow and makes a kind of “frrrp” noise with his lips, as though blowing a raspberry. “It <em>was</em> quite a long time after release,” he says.</p> <p>Clarke also tweeted at the time that “not one of these other actors spoke up for me”, meaning Purefoy, Daniel Mays, Tuppence Middleton and the rest. “Maggie Steed wasn’t on the poster either,” Purefoy says. “Are we saying we’re being sexist and ageist because <em>she’s</em> not on there? And did Maggie shout about it?” He changes tack. “It’s up to the distribution people. They’re selling a movie, not trying to represent it.” Then he adopts another angle: “If our producers really <em>were</em> racist, they’d have [put Clarke on the poster] as a cynical exercise to get more people to see the film. Wouldn’t they?” He thinks he has said too much. “I can’t go into it … Hmm.” </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being bullied and then discovering I’d been a bully, too, made me feel sick</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The consequences of Cornwall’s 56.5% vote for leave, which led to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-61104836\" title=\"\">withdrawal of £100m a year of EU funding</a>, hangs over these films. However upbeat the tone, we know we are watching characters ambling toward a precipice they can’t see. “A lot of fishermen did vote leave,” he says, sadly. “Some of them probably regret it now. So many people were conned into thinking their lives were going to get better. Those lives will be blighted for a good couple of generations now. I find that difficult to get my head around. As do they, I expect, under the darkness of the duvet.”</p> <p>Speaking of improving lives, Purefoy – who was bullied at school – prides himself on standing up to bullies wherever he finds them. “It’s become a thing for me,” he says. There was the time he witnessed a director humiliating an extra and informed him he had behaved appallingly. “He screamed at me: ‘Where in my contract, James, does it say that I am not allowed to bully?’”</p> <p>Then there was the stage production early in his career during which he overheard a well-known actor viciously berating a female co-star, telling her exactly what he was going to do to her if she dared to upstage him that night by getting a laugh: “I pulled him against the wall and told him: ‘If you do anything, I will be right behind you on stage and I will deck you. I will take you out in front of that audience.’ When the moment arrived that evening, I was meant to be downstage, but I stood right behind him.” He doesn’t reveal the bully’s identity, although it takes me less than a minute of searching online to find him.</p> <p>This is all highly commendable, but it transpires that Purefoy is no angel. He was contacted not long ago by a former classmate from his boarding school, Sherborne in Dorset, who had heard him speaking about the abuse that went on at the institution. The correspondent remembered the young Purefoy not as a victim of bullying, but a perpetrator. “I had no recollection of this,” he says. “I felt mortified and appalled. I don’t know what form my bullying took, but it troubled me.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44bb819b7d09cf84c01cae1ea6614eda444b15ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44bb819b7d09cf84c01cae1ea6614eda444b15ec/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Purefoy in Sex Education\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘And there are things women have said to me which they wouldn’t say now’ … Purefoy in Sex Education.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Taylor/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How did he respond to his accuser? “I wrote him a letter of profound and heartfelt apology. I didn’t know what else to do. He wrote back and thanked me. Maybe he thought: ‘OK, I can have a little bit of closure.’ It must have been very hard for him. Every time I popped up on screen, perhaps it triggered him.” He looks fretful. “Being bullied and then discovering I’d been a bully, too, made me feel sick.”</p> <p>Purefoy doesn’t need to police showbusiness colleagues so much now that sets have become safer places to work. “Safest in the world!” Then a pause. “Not quite as much fun. Not quite as interesting.” What is missing? “They were a bit messy, weren’t they? When you could flirt. Although, obviously, fun to some people is not fun to everyone. So, the best thing to do is just cut out all that stuff and shut the fuck up.”</p> <p>The subject of men modifying their behaviour comes up in the new Fisherman’s Friends film when the fishers attend a sensitivity training course to learn how to address women respectfully. “A lot of men struggle with that,” says Purefoy. “And there are things women have said to me which they wouldn’t say now. Back when I was young and very beautiful, a casting director in LA said: ‘Oh my God, you’re <em>so</em> cute!’” He gives a pout. “You’d never say that now. Though I was delighted by it. I thought it might get me the part.”</p> <p>He believes today’s cultural tumult is temporary; he is certain that calmer times are waiting around the corner. “The pendulum has been shoved so far the other way, but eventually we’ll find equilibrium. Some people are resistant to diversity in casting. Being a white man, you often get other white people secretly talking to you about things. They make assumptions that you are going to agree with them and you go: ‘Hmm, well …’ Especially down in Somerset. People try to feel you out: ‘Are you on my side?’” It doesn’t help when politicians exploit those anxieties. “The whole anti-woke thing,” he sighs. “Being woke is just being well mannered. Why would you want to upset anyone?” Spoken like a fisherman’s friend.</p> <p>• Fisherman’s Friends: One and All is in UK cinemas on 19 August</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/19/thatcherism-obsolete-ideology-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-tories","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Thatcherism is an obsolete ideology – but it’s the only one that Sunak and Truss have | Andy Beckett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/thatcherism-obsolete-ideology-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-tories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/thatcherism-obsolete-ideology-rishi-sunak-liz-truss-tories","fields":{"headline":"Thatcherism is an obsolete ideology – but it’s the only one that Sunak and Truss have","trailText":"The Tories see fresh thinking as a luxury, so their leaders are sticking with an orthodoxy that’s well past its sell-by date, says Guardian columnist Andy Beckett","byline":"Andy Beckett","body":"<p>It’s generally agreed that the last dozen years have been some of the most turbulent in our modern history. So much has changed or been called into question: our climate, the cost of living, the state’s ability to protect us, capitalism’s ability to spread prosperity, the continuation of the United Kingdom, our relationship with Russia and the EU, even our sense<strong> </strong>that we can be a functional society. To an extent that was almost inconceivable in 2010, when the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition took office, this has become a different country.</p> <p>Some politicians have tried to adapt. Labour has moved leftwards and then back towards the centre. The Lib Dems have moved rightwards, supporting Tory austerity, and then become more hostile to the Conservatives under Ed Davey. The SNP has become more assertive in its push for independence. Meanwhile some Tories, such as Boris Johnson and Theresa May, have at least talked about governing in new ways, by “levelling up” or helping the “just about managing”.</p> <p>Yet one group of politicians, who have gradually become the most powerful in the country, and are about to become our rulers, whoever wins the Tory leadership contest, have seemingly not adjusted their thinking at all amid the chaos and flux. As a result, we may face our worst peacetime crisis since the 1930s under a government with a disastrously out-of-date worldview.</p> <p>Eleven years ago, five Tory MPs first elected in 2010 – Liz Truss, Kwasi Kwarteng, Dominic Raab, Priti Patel and Chris Skidmore – set out this worldview in a now largely forgotten book, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/After_the_Coalition.html?id=ki4aYAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">After the Coalition: A Conservative Agenda for Britain</a>. “The future of Britain’s prosperity lies in … free market values,” declared its introduction. Taxes should be cut, “the ‘handout’ culture” should be ended, and “Britain should seek to regain control” from the EU, and negotiate “its own trade deals”. If these steps were taken, the book concluded, “Britain’s relative decline … is not inevitable”.</p> <p>In its optimism and broad-brush solutions, its combativeness and air of utter conviction, the book now reads just like a leadership race speech by Truss. It also prefigures many of the promises currently being made by her rival, Rishi Sunak, who became an MP five years later than the Tory class of 2010 but shares much of their outlook. While Truss has become known for sometimes dressing and posing exactly like Margaret Thatcher, last month <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Telegraph/status/1550035984011632641\">Sunak told the Telegraph</a>: “My values are Thatcherite.”</p> <p>When Truss and Sunak first began promoting that version of Conservatism in the 2010s, it was already showing its age. Thatcher’s heyday had been a quarter of a century earlier. Much more recently, the 2008 financial crisis had discredited deregulated capitalism. And then came the stagnant wages and regional decline of the 2010s: problems serious enough to persuade May and Johnson that a Conservative government could no longer just be about liberating business and confining the state.</p> <p>Yet though Truss, Sunak, Raab, Patel, Kwarteng and Skidmore all served in these mildly heretical Tory governments, and could easily have noticed that British free market capitalism was in difficulties, they never renounced the Thatcherite faith. Why not?</p> <p>One answer is that May and Johnson’s economic rethinks rarely produced more than rhetoric. Their governments remained good places for economic rightwingers to build careers. Another answer is that the rightwing press – which has become even more important for the Tories as newspaper readerships and Conservative voters have aged – remains essentially Thatcherite in its economic assumptions. In its pages, unions and regulation are nearly always bad, and shareholders and homeowners are the interest groups that matter.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Toryism increasingly values politicians who refuse to change direction, and instead become more dogmatic – who “double down”, as political reporters often admiringly put it. The success of the leave campaign, built on decades of stubbornness and escalation, has helped make rigidity seem a virtue. The fact that the Conservatives have not lost a general election for 17 years, despite how detached they have often seemed about Britain’s alarming socioeconomic shifts, has convinced many Tories that fresh thinking is a luxury they don’t need. Since 2010, a greater and greater proportion of the party’s supporters have been people who grew up under Thatcher, and who probably still see her governments as the gold standard.</p> <p>Much of the party’s funding also comes from people who want Thatcherite policies to continue. Hedge funds, private equity firms and property developers tend to favour looser regulation, and are often not hugely concerned about the social consequences of their working practices. The government has prioritised these interests, through housing market subsidies and plans to further deregulate finance, while increasingly neglecting other businesses, such as the many small manufacturers and exporters being steadily choked by Brexit.</p> <p>It’s hard to think of a modern precedent for the broader problems Britain now faces: much of the population and the state in deep financial trouble, while the governing party – if that’s not too generous a description – becomes less, rather than more, flexible in its thinking. When the financial crisis happened, Labour had been in power for a similarly long time; but by then it had become increasingly self-doubting and prepared to change its policies, as Gordon Brown’s largely improvised rescue of the banking sector demonstrated. Even Thatcher could be less conventionally rightwing in a crisis than her disciples like to think. During the recession of the early 1980s, she allowed her chancellor Geoffrey Howe to raise taxes – the opposite of Truss’s promised approach.</p> <p>When the Tories finally deign to give us a new premier, Truss or Sunak might surprise us. As chancellor, Sunak’s response to the pandemic did temporarily break with the free market dogma that economic hardship should be largely for individuals rather than the state to solve. Yet that transgression, partly because it involved raising taxes, is one of the reasons that he trails Truss in Tory membership polls.</p> <p>She has a history of occasional big U-turns, over Brexit and even her choice of party. But they are in the fairly distant past. Her more enduring attitudes, exemplified by the recording leaked this week of her saying that British workers needed to show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/16/leaked-audio-reveals-liz-truss-said-british-workers-needed-more-graft\">“more graft”</a>, are of the Norman Tebbit school: Tory governments are meant to toughen us up.</p> <p>Such an approach amid an economic catastrophe could lead the Conservatives to a heavy election defeat. But that outcome would also require many more voters to realise how old-fashioned the party has become. Until a large part of the electorate finally renounces Thatcherism, too, her disciples will march on.</p> <ul> <li><p>Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/19/qpr-ask-fans-to-take-blood-stem-cell-donor-test-at-match-against-rotherham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"QPR ask fans to take blood stem cell donor test at match against Rotherham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/qpr-ask-fans-to-take-blood-stem-cell-donor-test-at-match-against-rotherham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/19/qpr-ask-fans-to-take-blood-stem-cell-donor-test-at-match-against-rotherham","fields":{"headline":"QPR ask fans to take blood stem cell donor test at match against Rotherham","trailText":"The Championship club will host a swab centre outside Loftus Road on Saturday, as the defender Jimmy Dunne searches for a bone marrow transplant for a close family friend","byline":"Ben Fisher","body":"<p>Queens Park Rangers will host a swab centre outside Loftus Road on Saturday to try to find a bone marrow transplant match for a close family friend of the defender Jimmy Dunne.

<p>What Australians didn’t know was that those jobs – plural – turned out to be his own.</p> <p>In an unprecedented power grab unseen in Australian politics even during the uncertainty of the second world war, it emerged this week that Morrison had sworn himself into roles in five different ministries between March 2020 and May 2021, in most cases without the extant minister knowing.</p> <p>He sat as a ghostly understudy in health, finance, resources, treasury and home affairs, all portfolios where the appointed minister had unilateral decision-making powers. Thus far, he has been able to explain the ministries hoard only as “a safeguard” during the Covid pandemic.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/18/why-didnt-the-governor-general-push-back-against-scott-morrisons-secret-ministries\">Queen’s representative, governor general David Hurley</a>, had sworn in Morrison for the portfolios, but did not make it public. Hurley said he had no reason to believe the appointments would not become known. Usually, Australian ministers are sworn in to their positions by the governor general in front of the cameras, the appointments then gazetted and tabled in public. At the very least, there is a press release. This didn’t happen for any of Morrison’s five extra appointments.</p> <p>Anthony Albanese, who beat Boris Johnson ally Morrison in a landslide election victory this year, labelled his predecessor’s actions an “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/scott-morrison-five-more-secret-ministries-minister-portfolio-ministry-including-treasury-home-affairs\">unprecedented trashing of our democracy</a>”.</p> <h2>An ‘elegant solution’</h2> <p>The secret trove may have remained a secret if it was not for throwaway paragraphs in a recently released book from two News Corp journalists, who did not seem to comprehend the ramifications of what they had been told.</p> <p>The book Plagued described Morrison’s plan to swear himself in as health minister as an “elegant solution” to any one minister from having “absolute power” at the beginning of Australia’s response to the pandemic. The finance portfolio was thrown in for good measure, to ensure, the book’s author’s relayed, “there were two people with their hands on the purse strings”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2dc56a3b5887a2fc23cb551518ae2b28f2fcc7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2dc56a3b5887a2fc23cb551518ae2b28f2fcc7e/0_0_5300_3533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who was unaware he was sharing his ministry with the prime minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who was unaware he was sharing his ministry with the prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That tidbit was included in an extract of the book published by the Murdoch masthead the journalists work for. The broadsheet too appeared to underestimate the revelations, making very little fanfare over what the authors themselves wrote was a move without precedent. But social media cared. As did Albanese, Australia’s new prime minister, who ordered an immediate briefing on what had occurred. What unfurled was another extraordinary week in Australian politics.</p> <p>At first it was just the two reported ministries, but it quickly became apparent there was a third – resources – which Morrison had sworn himself into in order to use ministerial unilateral powers to make decisions about projects. It emerged Morrison used those powers to overturn the decision of the existing minister to approve an offshore gas mine, off the coast of New South Wales, where Morrison was trying to hold on to seats.</p> <p>The minister only discovered he had a ministry bedfellow when Morrison told him he was stepping in to change the decision. It had nothing to do with the “elegant solution” of curbing ministerial powers during the pandemic.</p> <p>That was on Monday. On Tuesday, Morrison was telling a friendly radio host he did not recall swearing himself in for any further ministries, but had asked for a briefing to be sure.</p> <p>Just hours later, a departmental briefing revealed Morrison had also taken on Treasury and home affairs, more than a year after he first exercised the little-known constitutional loophole. Both had been taken without the ministers’ knowledge.</p> <p>That prompted a 1,200-word Facebook explanation from the ex-prime minister who insisted he had been right to take on the roles, as a form of “break in case of emergency” safeguard, but he did not explain the secrecy.</p> <p>By Wednesday, with the scandal continuing to grow and one of his former ministers calling for him to resign from parliament, Morrison held an hour-long, combative press conference where he explained that in hindsight, he probably didn’t need to act as he did, but he did not regret having done so.</p> <p>No one knew what it was like to be the prime minister during those times, Morrison argued. “You’re standing on the shore after the fact. I was steering the ship in the middle of the tempest,” he said with all seriousness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec5055d45a46551f72bf2828b89927217bd3dd18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5055d45a46551f72bf2828b89927217bd3dd18/0_0_1400_932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rational fears meme on Scott Morrison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rational fears meme on Scott Morrison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A Rational Fear</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morrison apologised to the ministers he had secretly usurped for the “offence” but no more. He argued he had to keep the moves secret, in order for “good government” to continue.</p> <p>The only explanation he could muster for taking on additional powers was because the Australian people had expected him to, with everyone holding him responsible for “every single thing that was going on, every drop of rain, every strain of the virus, everything that occurred over that period of time”. He needed more power he didn’t use, he argued, because “people expected me to be able to take what responsibilities I could to deal with the issues.”</p> <p>His press conference opened up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/ten-glaring-inconsistencies-in-scott-morrisons-bamboozling-press-conference\">more inconsistencies and questions than it answered</a> but by Thursday, Morrison was making jokes about the saga on Facebook, admitting he found the memes of him also doing the jobs of various Australian businesses and industry “amusing”.</p> <p>Morrison seems unbothered by a potential censure in the parliament, as well as a looming inquiry. The new government is waiting on advice from the solicitor general, due next week, before mapping out its next moves.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/19/haven-by-emma-donoghue-review-a-seventh-century-room","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T06:30:08Z","webTitle":"Haven by Emma Donoghue review – a seventh-century Room","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/19/haven-by-emma-donoghue-review-a-seventh-century-room","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/19/haven-by-emma-donoghue-review-a-seventh-century-room","fields":{"headline":"Haven by Emma Donoghue review – a seventh-century Room","trailText":"In early medieval Ireland, a priest and two monks struggle to preserve their humanity – and their sanity – in utter isolation","byline":"Paraic O’Donnell","body":"<p>All nations beguile themselves with stories, and Ireland has long been susceptible to the warm tingle of mythology. Some cherished beliefs, though, are not only comforting but at least partly true. For instance, during the collapse of the Roman empire, Irish scholars really did salvage much of Europe’s literary heritage. Mind you, this had as much to do with their remoteness and obscurity as their zeal for learning.</p> <p>Emma Donoghue’s latest novel takes a disenchanted view of these events. Set in the seventh century, it strips away the misty hagiography shrouding this period, dispensing with saints and scholars in favour of striving and imperfect humans. Though it retains some of the starkness and figurative grandeur of mythology, this is a tale that entertains no illusions.</p> <p>From the outset, it grounds itself in an early medieval Ireland that was much more plural and fluid than is often supposed. Artt, a learned priest recently returned from afar, arrives at the monastery of Cluain Mhic Nóise. Bringing with him new and uncompromising notions, he finds himself an honoured if not entirely welcome guest, refusing the abbot’s wine and disparaging his lax observance of fast days. Donoghue does some deft scene-setting in these early pages, giving us a strong sense of a society still stitching together its disparate fabrics, a people not so much embracing the light of Christ as putting it where it wouldn’t be in the way.</p> <p>It is to general relief, then, that Artt announces his departure. God has visited him with a dream, he explains, of a solitary island “far away, in the western ocean”. But that’s not all. Artt’s dream, being divinely inspired, is also highly specific. Taking two monks as companions, he is to journey to this storm-lashed rock – a place not “tainted by the breath of the world” – and found upon it a bastion of prayer.</p> <p>In fulfilment of his vision, Artt settles upon an unlikely pair of missionaries. Cormac is well past his prime, a grizzled brawler who found Christ only after a plague claimed his family and a rival clan his patch of land. Trian, meanwhile, is a mere youth, “ungainly and odd” by his own rueful admission. Neither is much of a true believer, but both are sufficiently awed to accept their new calling without a murmur. It helps, too, that they have little notion of just what that calling will entail.</p> <p>Artt’s island proves to be a place for which nothing could have prepared them. Skellig Michael may be familiar to some from its appearances in later Star Wars movies. A jagged mass of almost naked rock, it towers above the Atlantic seven miles or so off the Kerry coast. Were it not the site of a real monastic settlement from this period, it could reasonably be described as uninhabitable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Donoghue wrings plenty of narrative sustenance from her barren landscape</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But when the pragmatic Cormac ventures this opinion, he is sternly rebuked. “This place,” Artt declares, “was set aside for us when the Earth was made.” Accepting their lot, the monks clamber ashore. Their master may seem harsh and inscrutable but, for the time being, his authority is unquestionable. Though, by now, we have glimpsed enough of Artt’s nature to guess at what lies before them.</p> <p>Donoghue wrings plenty of narrative sustenance from her barren landscape. Though they are granted little liberty, the brothers each discover inner resources that might otherwise have been overlooked. Trian, from a seafaring family, proves an adept fisherman and, within his narrow bounds, a keen explorer. Cormac tends a meagre garden on their lone patch of workable ground. But soon Artt banishes even these small consolations. A stone altar must be raised, though they lack the barest shelter; the scripture must be copied, though their provisions are all but exhausted. “Divided, we’ll fall,” he insists. He’s proved right, but not in the way he foresees.</p> <p>Donoghue is an eclectic talent, and some of her fiction – such as the riotous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/12/frog-music-emma-donoghue-review-melodrama-motherhood-murder\" title=\"\">Frog Music </a>– has encompassed broad and colourful canvases. In the drama that unfolds here, though, she returns to the radical minimalism of 2010’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/01/room-emma-donoghue-review-fritzl\" title=\"\">Room</a>. Indeed, the two works share striking formal similarities: two characters struggle to preserve their humanity in utter isolation while appeasing an implacable captor.</p> <p>Still, many writers rework familiar materials with potent results. This is a miniature created with a muted palette, sombre in aspect but crowded with quietly beautiful details. And its subject, of course, is a universal one: we’re all stuck on this rock, trying to keep hold of simple moral truths while quietly losing our minds. As poor young Trian puts it, in one of his darkest moments: “Even this unbearable life is still sweet.”</p> <p>• Paraic O’Donnell’s The House on Vesper Sands is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (£9.99).

Now we were all homeless refugees and there was nothing to do but wait. Even though we could not be more grateful for what the UK had done for us, we had no agency, no independence, no money.</p> <p>Four hundred people from different ethnicities and backgrounds all living close together, all dealing with the trauma of what they had been through and seeing the poverty, hunger and violence happening back home is a disaster. As the months went on we witnessed domestic violence, families breaking up and ethnic tensions. As families struggled to adapt to their new surroundings we saw women being prevented from leaving the hotel by male relatives and as a group of young Hazara women with no patriarch with us, we had our share of problems during our time there. I know our hotel was no different from many where thousands of Afghans were living month after month, trying to deal with what had happened to their lives while witnessing their country and the family and friends left behind falling into darkness, hunger and violence.</p> <p>All of us struggled with depression and post traumatic shock.

Now I am in exile I feel my responsibility to keep reporting even more heavily.</p> <p>All year, every day, I and my team of reporters in Afghanistan, who are all working in secret, have told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/14/life-for-afghan-women-one-year-after-the-taliban-took-power\">sad and painful stories</a> about what is happening to women in our homeland. We have reported about women being lashed by Taliban fighters, going hungry and losing the jobs they had fought so hard for. Even though it is depressing and boring to constantly be writing bad news, I wake up early every day, open my laptop and start working, sometimes until the early hours of the morning.</p> <p>When I see my young niece and my sisters who are now living in a free country, I think about millions of other girls in Afghanistan who are no longer free and are facing an uncertain future. My heart breaks and I know I must keep going – the world must not forget about what is happening in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Now, finally, we have a home and we can start to build our life here. We are able to go to the market, shop and cook our own food, plan for our future. I will continue my work in exile until it is safe to return.

I am desperate. And not just through thirst. Across those hulking mountains, plunging glens and surging waters survives a community that has recently overcome the odds – yet again – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/29/locals-secure-buyout-mainland-britain-most-remote-pub-old-forge-inverie\" title=\"\">to buy its only pub</a>. It’s just the latest skirmish in a baleful battle waged for centuries to avoid last orders being called on a community that literally survives between heaven and hell.</p> <p>Even finding the start of the walk at Kinloch Hourn is a herculean effort down the UK’s longest dead-end road, 22 miles from what is already the middle of nowhere. Those local names are daunting – Knoydart is a 55,000-acre peninsula sandwiched between the lochs of Nevis (heaven, in some Gaelic translations) and Hourn (hell). A friend drops me off – otherwise it’s an hour by taxi from Invergarry – and as the engine cuts, the mountains threaten, steel-blue waters close in and foreboding clouds scud across the sky. With no escape bar the sinewy trail, I’m struck by a familiar sense of highland awe. I’m dumbstruck by the scenery, yes, but my stomach is churning at the wildness I’m hurling myself into, and I feel incredulous, too, that humans have stubbornly managed to eke out a living here for thousands of years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4456554f3661407d1c5bf620cf8bed5d9428896d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4456554f3661407d1c5bf620cf8bed5d9428896d/0_0_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A river flows off the mountains in Knoydart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘If epic scenery tugs at your heart, this peninsula is for you.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin McKelvie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If epic scenery tugs at your heart and sends your spirits soaring, this peninsula, home to a trio of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/27/highland-hounds-take-on-scotland-munros-as-mountain-hikes-rise-in-popularity\" title=\"\">Munros</a> (mountains higher than 914 metres or 3,000ft), is the place for you.

In this world, the imprint of man is a painful one. To those willing to look, it’s the sort of landscape that reveals how much of north-west Scotland is not just a wilderness, but a human-made one. In its heyday, more than 2,000 people had their wee bit of hill and glen here. Then came the calamitous Battle of Culloden in 1746 – when the highlands-backed Jacobites failed in their attempt to overthrow the Hanoverian monarchy – and its aftermath tore the clan system asunder. Gone was <em>dùthchas</em> – the inalienable right to clan land. Gone were the people; the scattered ruins were their ghostly legacy. Today, Knoydart may be recovering, but the population is still only around 120.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/feb/29/bothy-mountain-huts-scotland-highlands-walking-routes-hikes-highlands\">Scotland’s best Highland and islands bothy weekend adventures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much as the wildlife and scenery excels, it increasingly becomes a mere distraction.

Ask the two women currently facing life sentences","trailText":"Vulnerable women are being imprisoned for ending pregnancies in Britain. It’s time to legalise abortion, says barrister Charlotte Proudman","byline":"Charlotte Proudman","body":"<p>Like many people in Britain, you probably watched with horror the US supreme court’s reversal of Roe v Wade, thinking, “Thank goodness women could never be prosecuted for having an abortion here.”</p> <p>But let me tell you, it already happens here.</p> <p>Two women are currently awaiting criminal trial in England for abortion-related offences, both facing charges that carry a maximum sentence of life. At least 17 women have been investigated by police over the past eight years for having had abortions.</p> <p>In Oxford, a 25-year-old mother of one is facing trial for allegedly taking the drug misoprostol – one of the two pills routinely prescribed by doctors to abort a pregnancy. But her baby was born alive and she was subsequently reported to the police. She is being charged under the Offences Against the Person Act, a law passed by parliament in 1861, before the invention of the lightbulb and before women had the right to vote. The law states that a woman must be “kept in penal servitude for life” if she procures an abortion.</p> <p>Another woman is facing trial after she <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11690506/police-probe-death-of-unborn-baby-after-woman-has-illegal-abortion-by-post-at-28-weeks-four-weeks-past-limit/\">took abortion pills</a> she obtained from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) by post when rules were relaxed during the pandemic to allow this. She was allegedly 28 weeks pregnant at the time and is facing charges of “child destruction” (note the visceral language) under the Infant Life (Preservation) Act from 1929, which also comes with a maximum life sentence. She could spend the rest of her life in prison.</p> <p>We so often think that the 1967 Abortion Act legalised abortion. But it did no such thing. It partially decriminalised abortion in England, Scotland and Wales, so long as strict conditions were in place, such as a confirmation from two medical practitioners that the pregnancy had not exceeded 28 weeks (subsequently reduced to 24 weeks in 1990), or that the termination was necessary to prevent injury or mental harm. Any abortion outside these criteria is still a criminal offence.</p> <p>We know that it is overwhelmingly vulnerable women who are investigated and prosecuted for having abortions. One woman collapsed in the dock when she was sentenced to two and a half years in 2015 for taking tablets she had bought online to induce a miscarriage after the 24-week period of gestation. The court heard that she had “a history of emotional and psychological problems”.</p> <p>Another woman, a mother of one, ordered pills online to induce an abortion in 2019 after her abusive boyfriend had told her not to go to the doctor. She had believed she was eight to 10 weeks pregnant but after a traumatic miscarriage in her bath tub, where she has <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lauras-story-jailed-for-having-an-abortion-in-britain-0m06nzrlx\">described</a> sitting in an inch of blood, she realised her pregnancy had been much further along. She was arrested in her hospital bed and served two years in prison.</p> <p>These are just some examples of women who have faced trial: there are multiple other women who face gruelling police investigations. In 2021, a 15-year-old girl was investigated for a year after suffering an unexplained stillbirth. Her phone and laptop were confiscated during her GCSE exams, she was self-harming, and the investigation only ended after a coroner concluded that the pregnancy ended due to natural causes. Another woman was <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/woman-police-custody-stillborn-birth-b2111991.html\">arrested in hospital last year</a> and kept in a prison cell for 36 hours after a stillbirth at 24 weeks, and is now suffering PTSD. My question is this: if a woman has had an abortion late in the gestation period, or a traumatic miscarriage or stillbirth, should she go to prison or should she be offered support from medical practitioners at what is clearly a horrendous time, both mentally and physically?</p> <p>Women in 2022 are being shackled by a 160-year-old law made at a time when we were not even allowed to set foot in the House of Commons. Urgent reform is needed to protect more women from harm, which is why organisations such as BPAS and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) are calling on the director of public prosecutions for England and Wales, Max Hill QC, to drop all charges against these women. The RCOG <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/08/07/decriminalise-abortions-rather-prosecute-women-doctors-warn/\">this month has gone further</a>, calling on ministers to finally legalise abortion. There is absolutely no public interest in sending vulnerable women to prison for terminating pregnancies. Instead, these prosecutions will only serve to put off women seeking help from doctors because they might get arrested, pushing more women into unsafe and underground options.</p> <p>Meanwhile, according to the criteria of the Abortion Act, a woman has to show that she would suffer grave permanent injury to her mental health if she did not have an abortion after 24 weeks. Why should women still have to pathologise themselves as mad, hysterical, unfit or suffering to legally access healthcare?</p> <p>The state currently has a triple lock on women’s bodies. By not legalising abortion it has the right to force pregnancy, birth and motherhood upon us. Look to the rules on organ donation: it is illegal to donate people’s organs after they die (however desperately they are needed by people on waiting lists) without their permission. The law at present, which denies women the right to abort a pregnancy on their own terms, is to give us less autonomy than a corpse.</p> <ul> <li><p>Charlotte Proudman is a barrister specialising in violence against women and girls and a fellow at Queens’ College, Cambridge</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She found herself beaten by investors willing to pay cash far above the listing price, and buy sight unseen in gameshow-like bidding wars.</p> <p>The 496-sq-ft condo was one of the very few Austin homes she could still afford as prices soared in January. Her offer put her among the finalists, but at the last minute, the seller threw a new curveball: the other bidders had signed an appraisal waiver. Hawkins needed more cash she didn’t have, so she “bowed out”.</p> <p>Across the US, many have faced similar roadblocks: prices popped as a confluence of forces suppressed supply and inflated demand, leaving many middle- and lower-income buyers with a dwindling number of housing options, or forcing them into rentership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6855b69021e54ade04931e48994aeef50ab4ef04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6855b69021e54ade04931e48994aeef50ab4ef04/0_0_5061_3379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samantha Hawkins at her apartment in Austin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samantha Hawkins at her apartment in Austin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, with interest rates rising and the housing market cooling, things are supposed to be different. So far they aren’t. Nationally, house prices hit an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/homes/existing-home-sales-nar-june-2022/index.html#:~:text=Home%20prices%20hit%20a%20new,the%20National%20Association%20of%20Realtors.\">all-time high</a> in June of $416,000, up 13.4% from a year ago.</p> <p>The challenges Austin buyers are still experiencing show just how difficult the dream of owning your own home has become for a broad swath of Americans.</p> <p>“I’ve worked really hard the last year or two and made the right choices financially to try to have a chance, but it seems like I can’t really win in this market,” Hawkins said.</p> <p>The problems plaguing tight markets nationally have all hit Austin. Hawkins is competing with investors who now account for more than 30% of single-family home sales, Airbnb operators and any number of the about 125 people moving to Austin daily amid dizzying job growth. Meanwhile, builders haven’t kept pace with demand and zoning laws limit new multifamily housing that could provide relief.</p> <p>May’s median sale prices in Austin and surrounding Travis county hit new peaks of $676,000 and $625,000, respectively – up from around $400,000 just before the pandemic. That’s put pressure on the rental market, pushing the median rent above $2,700 and fueling displacement.</p> <p>And even though Austin’s June home inventory doubled over the prior year as interest rate hikes cooled demand, supply is only increasing for the wealthiest buyers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/archive-zip/giv-6562zEdKjQU7NgRe/\" data-alt=\"Bar chart showing the number of new homes sold in Austin increasing from 2012 to 2021.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/archive-zip/giv-6562zEdKjQU7NgRe/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The portion of national listings that someone earning $75,000 annually could afford dropped from 40% to 25% between January and June as home prices and mortgage rates climbed, National Association of Realtors’ (NAR) data shows.</p> <p>“The higher inventory is promising, but not for middle- and lower-income groups,” said Nadia Evangelou, an economist with NAR.</p> <p>There’s some evidence of that on the ground. Austin realtor Sherry LeBlanc, who focuses on finding homes for first-time buyers, recently listed a house that could have fetched $515,000 last year for $435,000 with the expectation that middle-income buyers would snap it up. Instead, showings were slow and only investors bid.</p> <p>“Families are scared off by interest rates,” she said. “They say, ‘Well, shit, that’s out of my budget.’”</p> <p>For those like Hawkins stuck in rentership, the crisis hits on a financial level. Homeownership is a key instrument for wealth building and security, and loss of access to it represents a “breach of the social contract”, said Austin realtor Socar Chatmon-Thomas.</p> <p>“It’s pissing me off because somebody who went to school, got a degree, or otherwise did everything right and now has a job making $60,000 can’t buy a home,” she said.</p> <h2>Investor demand</h2> <p>Even with a six-figure tech salary, Courtney McKinley couldn’t buy in the city. The parks, restaurants, pools and friends that attracted her to a rental in Austin’s Zilker neighborhood were off the table as the lowest house prices had inched toward $1m.</p> <p>But even as she looked around the city’s edge and suburbs, she couldn’t top the cash offers. A $350,000 bid on an over 40-year-old townhouse that “needed some help” was beaten by an investor who offered $50,000 more in cash. Weeks later, she lost on a dilapidated townhome despite including a $50,000 escalation clause. The next month, an offer $30,000 over asking price on a sun-filled, three-bedroom home that felt perfect was turned down. “That was a heartbreak moment. I cried after that one,” McKinley said.</p> <p>After more dead ends, she finally won with a $400,000 bid for a two-bedroom that needed a new kitchen, patio, floors and other improvements. It’s in Pflugerville, a sprawling suburb of strip malls and big box stores that’s in a “kind of isolating” location, McKinley said. Ultimately, however, she says she feels lucky: friends have put in up to 15 offers and still don’t have a house.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"86f0f4d7b23836aa59e9ad604b2e25ec61ea58a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86f0f4d7b23836aa59e9ad604b2e25ec61ea58a9/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A new housing development under construction in Plufgerville, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A new housing development under construction in Pflugerville, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It was a rollercoaster, but no matter how difficult and frustrating it was, at least I’m building equity now,” she said.</p> <p>For middle-class Austinites like McKinley being outbid by cash offers in Austin, this much feels clear: investors are part of the problem.</p> <p>While some argue the percentage of investor-owned single family purchases nationally remains low, tight “sun belt” markets like metro Austin have seen it double from about 15% throughout the mid-2010s to over 30% in 2022’s first quarter.

Some companies also use algorithms to place bids within hours of homes being listed, and Wall Street-backed institutional investors are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2021/investors-rental-foreclosure/\">viewed</a> as particularly problematic.</p> <p>The five largest private equity buyers added 76,000 homes to their portfolio between March 2018 and September 2021, and their model has been derided by critics as “industrial housing” as they maximize profits by raising rents and skimping on maintenance.</p> <p>A June US House committee <a href=\"https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba09-20220628-sd002.pdf\">investigation</a> highlighting private equity’s role in local housing crises noted corporate landlords in Atlanta were up to 205 times <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02673037.2019.1639635#:~:text=Evictions%20cause%20substantial%20harm%20to,repeatedly%20on%20the%20same%20tenant.\">more likely</a> to evict tenants, and increased rents by an average of 37-57% within a year of purchasing properties.</p> <p>However, it’s virtually impossible to quantify how much investors are pushing up home prices, and the situation is a “chicken and egg” question, said Thom Malone, an economist for real estate data analyst CoreLogic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8d214c7ffe4defab42849d4036632781dd1dee6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8d214c7ffe4defab42849d4036632781dd1dee6/0_0_4000_2668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A new home, right, towers over residences on the same street in the Montopolis neighborhood in south-east Austin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A new home, right, towers over residences on the same street in the Montopolis neighborhood in south-east Austin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Where investors go, prices go up, but to what extent is this because the prices were going up because demand increased?” Malone asked. “It’s probably a bit of both.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, another breed of investor is depleting stock in tourist-friendly areas: short-term rental operators. Though the city says Airbnb owners operate about 3,000 units, housing advocate Inside Airbnb gleaned the company’s listings and found about 12,000, including 10,000 whole home units. And that accounts for one company – the true number of short-term rentals is probably much higher.</p> <p>In one east Austin neighborhood, Airbnb in June controlled about 12% of the housing units, Inside Airbnb found. While about 270 units were available for long-term rent during a 2020 US census survey, more than 1,300 whole home units were available on Airbnb in June.</p> <p>“Even without some economic researcher looking into it, common sense tells you that these are entire apartments that are no longer available, and people will be directly or indirectly displaced,” said Inside Airbnb founder Murray Cox.</p> <h2>Short supply</h2> <p>The signs of a construction boom are evident across Travis county, the fifth-most populous county in Texas. Along the metro region’s edges, new neighborhoods and strip malls are multiplying, while closer to the city core in south Austin, expensive new condo buildings have sprouted among the old restaurants, strip malls and pawn shops on Congress Avenue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cc6dc2ae2f188d4e0563778616c95e1abd61e4b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc6dc2ae2f188d4e0563778616c95e1abd61e4b2/0_0_6048_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cars sit parked outside Tesla’s Gigafactory on the east side of Austin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cars sit parked outside Tesla’s Gigafactory on the east side of Austin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though Austin has grown at an exceptional clip for decades, the recent population spike is partly <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-09/silicon-valleys-tech-monopoly-is-over\">driven by tech</a>: Oracle, Tesla, Meta, HP Enterprise and many more have relocated or opened offices here.

The changes would allow the city to build “thousands more units” annually, but Nimby-ism and anti-growth forces shut it down, Wegmann said.</p> <p>“I don’t want to make it sound like this would’ve solved everything, but we’re really tying our own hand behind our back,” he added.</p> <h2>‘I pray every night’</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e91822d1166c5a2af578a3552a59b5d74a9d14b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e91822d1166c5a2af578a3552a59b5d74a9d14b/0_0_6048_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paola Valdez-Lopez cleans while her kids, Alycia, five, and Matias, six, eat dinner in Austin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paola Valdez-Lopez cleans while her kids, Alycia, five, and Matias, six, eat dinner in Austin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergio Flores/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Soaring home prices ultimately create pressure lower in the market, hitting the city’s most vulnerable the hardest.

The extra money was welcome as the couple raised two young kids, and they were proud to own the home outright.</p> <p>But everything changed in early July. The California investor who recently purchased the Congress Mobile Home Park handed 60-day eviction notices to its residents, and leaving isn’t easy – Valdez’s trailer can’t be transported because it’s 30 years old.</p> <p>A new, smaller trailer is $1,500 a month plus the lot fee, and three-bedroom apartments in her neighborhood top $3,500 a month. The family is at a loss over what it will do next, but Valdez expects her days of staying home to raise the kids are done.</p> <p>“One day you’re fine, you’ve paid off your home and you’re making a nest, then all the sudden you’re bombarded with ‘You’ve got to leave in 60 days’,” Valdez said. “I’m trying to stay strong.

This group didn’t have GCSEs, so this is the first time they’ve taken public exams. Their schooling has been decimated, but at the same time they aren’t getting the same allowances as the last two years.</p> <p>“We have to have a conversation about what we do as a society to support these young people, whether they’re going to university or not. Because there’s no question they’ve had it hard.”</p> <p>You can read more from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/a-level-joy-for-sixth-formers-in-wales-after-difficult-few-years\">Caernarfon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/i-didnt-sleep-last-night-leeds-a-level-students-celebrate-after-stressful-wait-for-results\">Leeds</a> on how students are feeling about their grades – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/england-a-level-result-explained-five-charts\">this set of five charts</a> is a useful primer on the significance of yesterday’s results. Here’s some more on what we learned, and what it tells us about the future for this group of teenagers.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Grades are still high, but getting back to normal</p> <p>After two years of cancelled exams and grades instead assessed by teachers (after Gavin Williamson’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/14/gavin-williamson-under-pressure-to-resign-over-a-level-results-fiasco\">infamous initial algorithm fiasco</a> in 2020), this year’s students are in a kind of halfway house, with pupils assessed on a mix of examination and coursework and marked more generously than in a pre-pandemic year. The proportion of As and A*s stands at 36.4% – lower than last year’s 44.8% but still significantly higher than the 25.4% figure from 2019.</p> <p>The problem of how to return to normal is “almost impossible to resolve in a way that will please everyone”, Elliot Major said. “It exposes these debates about fairness – how are you fair within a cohort, but also how are you fair between different years. Maybe you could have staggered it a little more, but I can understand why they want to get back to the previous grade boundaries as quickly as possible.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>The gap between state and private attainment remains significant</p> <p>We won’t have the full picture on how pupils from different social demographics have fared for some time, because Ofqual hasn’t published that data. “So the only measure we have for now is private versus state schools, and that is pretty stark,” Elliot Major said. “In 2019, 16.4% of independent school pupils got A*s, against 7.5% from state academies. This year, it’s 28.7% against 13.8%. So” – against pre-pandemic figures - “that gap has actually widened.” </p> <p>London secondary school teacher Nadeine Asbali <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/there-is-very-little-to-celebrate-about-these-a-level-results-inequalities-just-got-worse\">writes that the gap is “hardly surprising”</a> given the profound pressures on young people in her community through the pandemic. The proportion of A grades and above fell most sharply at independent schools – but that’s because they were the ones giving the most generous grades to their pupils last year.</p> <p>Another measure is the gap between the more typically affluent London and south-east regions and the north-east. That’s also grown against 2019 – from 4-5 percentage points to 8 percentage points this year. Sam Tuckett has more on these figures in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/why-a-level-results-far-from-return-pre-covid-normality\">this analysis</a>.</p> <p>To Elliot Major, all of this is an index of how much ground has been lost on social mobility as a result of the pandemic. “Before 2020, people like me were saying we’ve made some progress in narrowing the gap. It’s hard graft, but we’ve had a decade of slow improvement. But there are some experts in my area who would look at the last couple of years and say we’ve gone back a decade.”</p> <p>As a goal, he notes, social mobility is not about “rags to riches” stories of kids from broken homes becoming millionaires: “It’s about getting to what you need to lead a decent life. And unless there’s a big intervention now, that is going to be very much harder.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>A ‘perfect storm’ is coming</p> <p>For those in 2022 hoping to go on to university, the difficulties so far are only the start of the story – as that figure of 43,000 not getting a place suggests. “There’s a perfect storm that means this is going to be the hardest admissions round for a long time,” Elliot Major said. “There are just more 18-year-olds fighting over a finite number of places, for a start – that’s a demographic trend that will continue for the next decade. And we know that student loan arrangements are going to get less favourable from next year, so there’s a real incentive to start university now.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, because of the better results on paper, “lots of universities took on more students last year – a Covid bulge – and just don’t have the space in terms of things like accommodation, particularly the high prestige places. So they’re really having to manage their numbers.”</p> <p>But, Elliot Major points out, this is only half the story: the teenagers instead going into the working world will be going with one arm tied behind their back. “It’s the poorer pupils who missed the most education during the pandemic,” he said. “Then there have been unprecedented absence rates in schools across the country, and again it’s the poorest pupils who have missed most. We aren’t doing enough for that group.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>The pandemic legacy</p> <p>Of course, the story of the impact of the pandemic won’t end with this year’s cohort, even if the superficial numbers begin to feel more normal from next year. Elliot Major points to the catch-up funding: “We had £100bn on the furlough scheme to protect jobs, and nobody argues with that. But we’ve spent £5bn on education recovery. I would argue we need to double that, at least.” Against that figure, consider that Liz Truss is already planning to cancel a corporation tax rise worth £19bn, and give married couples a tax allowance worth £6.7bn.</p> <p>Whatever happens, it seems certain that the Covid cohort will continue to feel the ripple effects of their disrupted education in the years to come. “We’re all going to have to reflect on whether we’ve got the balance right,” said Elliot Major. “We may conclude that the lasting legacy of the pandemic is in education, and the impact on the prospects of the most disadvantaged young people.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/19/i-got-really-grounded-and-loved-it-how-grief-going-home-and-gabber-built-bjorks-new-album\">Chal Ravens’s interview</a> with <strong>Björk</strong> is a rich look at the singer’s pandemic-era life and why she’s really happy to be a “homebody” back in Iceland these days. <em><strong>Hannah J Davies, deputy editor, newsletters</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Because the UK’s place on a <strong>flagship EU research programme</strong> was cancelled over the Northern Ireland protocol row, microbiologist José R Penadés lost a €2.5m grant. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/brexit-research-grant-uk-science-jeopardy\">His warning</a> that the UK is becoming “more uncertain and uninviting” for scientists is a model of controlled anger. <em><strong>Archie</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>I saw a preview of <strong>the new film from Ruben Östlund</strong> (The Square, Force Majeure) this week, which was fun and disgusting in equal measure. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/ruben-ostlund-triangle-of-sadness-sarajevo-1235344034/\">This Variety interview</a> on Triangle of Sadness sees the Swede discuss shocking crowds and sending up influencer culture. <em><strong>Hannah</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Luke Harding visited Kryvyi Rih, where <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> grew up and went to university, to write <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/story-of-volodymyr-zelenskiy-told-by-his-home-town-ukraine\">this fascinating piece</a> about the Ukrainian president’s youth.

But to the British-Iranian writer-director Babak Anvari’s credit, along with co-writer Namsi Khan, the film doesn’t play out exactly as we might expect given its forebears. The details are never particularly surprising, and it feels like a wallop of a twist short in the last act, but the structure and shifting protagonist upend expectations (even if the final shift borders on too many).</p> <p>We start by spending time with MacKay’s middle-finger-to-the-system rebel – a rather awkward piece of miscasting that sinks a great portion of the first act. MacKay, so believable as a plummy soldier entering hell in the film 1917, is less convincing at the other end of the class spectrum, with an affected accent and persona so jarringly misjudged, I almost questioned if that was the point (a brief aside from another character about others having less than him and what he thinks he has, suggested maybe, but if so, it needed another beat to work). The 30-year-old actor is also not a believable 23-year-old, so the scenes of him sulking and railing against an ever-reliable Kelly Macdonald as his beleaguered mother (just 16 years his senior in real life), play a bit like sketch show exaggeration.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwHGegiFykU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bwHGegiFykU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>His performance looks even worse against a fantastically odious Bonneville, smoothly sinking into the dark side of his well-established upper-crust nice-guy persona, taking it all rather seriously, even as things get rather silly. It’s a monstrously outsized villain role, a cruel psychopath corrupted by the evils of extreme privilege, never not someone many of us can believe in full. But his character and performance are far more effective than the surrounding film (a monologue explaining his backstory is creepily well-acted even if the hows and whys are sadly lacking) and so the idea of him caught in a game of survival is more satisfying than the reality of it.</p> <p>There are half-shaded attempts to position the story as a contemporary cautionary tale about what those upstairs get away with, and the film’s grim worldview is impressively unfettered, but the social commentary, if one could even call it that, is simplistic at best. It’s a suspense thriller first and foremost yet despite the setup, which involves much sneaking and hiding, it’s all strangely lacking in suspense: a mostly sluggish genre exercise in need of more vim. The price paid for the at times bracing character shifts is that we struggle to find someone to pull us through it all, no character other than Bonneville’s possessing enough heft or specificity.</p> <p>Anvari, who impressed with his layered 2016 ghost story Under the Shadow, delivers a slightly more cohesive film than his last, the ungainly English-language debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/31/wounds-review-armie-hammer-dakota-johnson-sundance\">Wounds</a> – a moody and well-made yet poorly written horror about an evil phone – but still misses the target he so effortlessly hit with his first. The last few scenes in particular are bafflingly off-key, with an on-the-nose use of Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Tears for Fears leading the credits, at the end of a film that claims to have said something profound but leaves us struggling to hear what it might be. Bonneville’s performance will linger, the film not so much.</p> <ul> <li><p>I Came By is in UK cinemas on 19 August and on Netflix on 31 August</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/19/former-bp-chief-urges-freeze-to-uk-energy-price-cap-to-help-households","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"Former BP chief urges freeze to UK energy price cap to help households","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/19/former-bp-chief-urges-freeze-to-uk-energy-price-cap-to-help-households","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/19/former-bp-chief-urges-freeze-to-uk-energy-price-cap-to-help-households","fields":{"headline":"Former BP chief urges freeze to UK energy price cap to help households","trailText":"Ofgem should stop rises in cap, and energy firms unable to offer lower bills should be nationalised, says Nick Butler","byline":"Alex Lawson Energy correspondent","body":"<p>A former executive at the oil company BP has called for increases to the energy price cap to be scrapped and for suppliers that fail to help households struggling with bills to be nationalised.</p> <p>Nick Butler, who worked for BP for almost 30 years and was group vice-president for strategy and development, said that expected rises in the cap should be abandoned by the industry regulator, Ofgem, which he said had been “overwhelmed by events” after turmoil in the global energy markets sent 29 British energy retailers to the wall. </p> <p>Butler is also calling for a “forensic examination” of the accounts of remaining suppliers to ensure they are still viable businesses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/bp-energy-sector-incompetent-ofgem-freeze-price-cap-tax-profits\">I worked for BP for 30 years – the energy sector has become incompetent and greedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ofgem is expected to announce next week a rise in the price cap, which is supposed to protect consumers.

Members of the crowd begin to glance around, especially when, from the back of the room, a rich North Yorkshire voice starts chanting: “We want Rob!” The audience picks up the chant. One woman stamps her feet, others join in. And then, Auton extracts himself from the crowd and takes his place on stage.</p> <p>The Crowd Show is comedian Auton’s post-pandemic return to the Edinburgh fringe and while he began writing it before we’d ever heard of Covid-19, our collective time in isolation gave the concept fresh significance. “I wanted to speak about people being together. It took on a whole new life when we weren’t allowed to do it any more,” Auton says. “This experience of being at the fringe has made me realise the scale of what we’ve been through.”</p> <p>Across a playful, reflective hour, Auton instigates games that unite the crowd, and encourages meditation on group dynamics, the give-and-take between audience and performer, and the crowds that we choose for ourselves.</p> <p>Confined to the flat he shares with his partner when lockdown was announced, live shows obviously ceased, so Auton began speaking to people via a daily podcast. “But it didn’t give me the same thrill,” he says. “Nothing is the same as connecting with someone in real life, is it?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d326574b3b9a2d8e97985adaaf246be907b34dd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d326574b3b9a2d8e97985adaaf246be907b34dd6/58_192_928_557/500.jpg\" alt=\"Back in the room … the Comedy Arcade live at Underbelly Bristo Square.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Back in the room … the Comedy Arcade live at Underbelly Bristo Square.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Driven by a similar urge, standup Vix Leyton conceived a lockdown panel show on Twitch, which became the Comedy Arcade podcast. Recorded on Zoom, she was joined by comedian guests who, prompted by a topic plucked from a bingo ball cage, competed to tell the best anecdote.</p> <p>Now it’s a live show at the fringe. Finally, the panellists are together on stage, faced with a real crowd. “The audience become an extra player in the game, they’ve been getting involved, shouting out their own answers,” Leyton says. She introduced audience interaction – paddles they can raise to change the course of the game by, for example, calling for a new topic or awarding someone double points for a great anecdote. “There’ve been a couple of moments when you’re looking out at the room and can’t believe it,” she says. “It felt like this might never happen again.”</p> <p>When Jo Griffin was last at the fringe, it was as part of sketch duo Lola &amp; Jo. Last year, she decided to start standup and wrote People Person, a show about being a people pleaser. It features friendly audience interaction, culminating in a little quiz. “I do lean on the audience more: they’re like my Lola,” she says. “I want people to feel safe to chip in. I really like that feeling of a dialogue – the audience do have power as to whether they’re going to get on the fun bus or not.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc202ca69f9fdec03c80d8bcc0d2375e8643e286\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc202ca69f9fdec03c80d8bcc0d2375e8643e286/0_0_2160_2700/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Griffin.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I want people to feel safe to chip in’ … Jo Griffin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Need-Menear</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For comedians, crowds are the ultimate careers adviser, Auton says. You’ve got to accept their energy and navigate any hiccups. “Once you get on stage, everything is part of the show,” he says. “People have got more on their minds than they used to. We’ve been through a lot and the shockwaves of that are still going through people.” During the show he encourages us to consider what everyone around us might be going through: “It’s just a rallying cry for trying to find the best in people.”</p> <p>Post-pandemic, Griffin felt a renewed love for crowds: “The whole show began because I was so excited to be back in a room with people – I just wanted to give people a hug.” Her show’s finale is an energising surprise that leaves the audience on a high: “After everyone being on screens, I wanted to create something that couldn’t be recorded, where you have to be in the room to experience it.”</p> <p>All three are part of the crowd of artists in the Scottish capital. For Leyton’s show, on Zoom it could be hard to read cues or interact. In person, it flows. “If you’re a comedian who wants to spend time with your peers, it’s so much fun. It’s not like doing a 10-minute spot and running off, you are together.” The room bonds over secrets revealed: “There’s a frisson in the air when someone says ‘I don’t think I should talk about this’. It’s nice that comedians feel safe to do that with us.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39de4615e52ead7322783f7712675d7b25bd382e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39de4615e52ead7322783f7712675d7b25bd382e/0_683_3535_2121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Why do I feel the urge to get up in front of people?’ … Rob Auton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Why do I feel the urge to get up in front of people?’ … Rob Auton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Downie/www.adznye.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Griffin doesn’t have her sketch partner on stage, she feels buoyed by her fellow comedians. “With standup, I’m relatively new to it, but there’s a real camaraderie,” she says.</p> <p>In his show, Auton examines his own feelings about being in crowds. “I wanted to look into myself: why do I feel the urge to get up in front of people? Maybe I’m talking about connectivity and never really feeling like I fitted in, then that’s why you go on stage.” It’s easy to retreat into your own world, Auton tells his crowd, but through live performance, he can take us there with him.</p> <p>At the show’s crescendo, real feeling sweeps the room, people surreptitiously dab their eyes. “I want to get to a stage in the performance where I feel safe enough to pull myself open. If I can make myself feel, I can make you feel. In that moment, we’ve all been in it together.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/16/who-wants-a-lockdown-one-liner-how-comics-are-covering-covid-at-edinburgh-fringe\">Who wants a lockdown one-liner?

When Ivo Graham first emerged, the only challenge this bashful young comic faced was being unfashionably posh and repressed. With this year’s offering, he’s a grizzled dad, bearded and bruised by relationship breakup. “We’re not at V festival any more, m’boy!”, he reflects ruefully, as life throws him into a diplomatic drinks date with the new partner of his little girl’s mum. Oh, maturity! It’s not always fun, but it’s added a bit of heft, some fruitful battle-scarring, to Graham’s comedy.</p> <p>If his new show My Future My Clutter doesn’t scale the heights of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/23/ivo-graham-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh\">its award-nominated predecessor</a>, this remains a very effective hour of standup. Part of its pleasure is observing Graham’s greater ease with himself. Of course, self-mortification is still the keynote. Story after story revels in the 32-year-old’s indignity, as he performs a freshers’ week Zoom gig to an audience member busily making risotto, or finds himself cast adrift when he books a 12-berth barge for a 13-man stag do.</p> <p>Ivo on his own haplessness is a comedy sweet spot – but no longer his only mode. There’s a story here about an acid trip, the humour of which Graham would once have sourced in the awkwardness of someone like him taking drugs in the first place. No longer: the joke here is about the narcotic comedown overlapping with Graham’s (second) trip to Peppa Pig World – on which visit he’d have riffed more, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/23/boris-johnson-peppa-pig-world-ant-dec\">Boris Johnson</a> not “taken the topic off the table for the rest of the posh twats”.</p> <p>Time was when Graham was too sheepish, too self-conscious about his own Eton background, to criticise Johnson and co. Tonight, there’s lovely, if lateral, political material, about the government taking time out from a global crisis, say, to declassify go-karting as a sport.

The increase that Ofgem plans to announce on 26 August and the further increases later in the year should be abandoned by the energy regulator, whose functions have been overwhelmed by events. Ofgem cannot realistically set in motion a process that further fuels inflation, already running at 10%, and condemns millions to fuel poverty. The honourable resignation of Ofgem board member <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/ofgem-director-christine-farnish-quits-over-energy-price-cap\">Christine Farnish</a> will not be the last departure from an organisation that has lost its way.</p> <p>The freeze is necessary but far from sufficient. We still rely on natural gas for about 40% of our daily energy consumption. The promised energy transition has barely begun. The price of the gas we import – about half of total consumption – will still be set on the world market, and is likely to keep rising, especially if Europe’s hot summer is followed by a cold winter. Further action is needed, from the government and the energy industry.</p> <p>First, a support scheme must be put in place that protects the poorest people and those struggling on tight budgets. The welfare system can be used to protect those on benefits, but some further action, perhaps through rebates on the lower bands of council tax, may be the best way of helping those for whom current energy prices are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/energy-chiefs-fear-40-of-britons-could-fall-into-fuel-poverty-in-truly-horrific-winter\">creating hardship</a>. Business rates can also be varied, as during Covid, to help those enterprises in greatest jeopardy. Energy retailers should be required to demonstrate they are supporting those in need, not least by ending the pernicious extra charges imposed for those using pre-payment meters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/16/labour-freeze-bills-britain-energy-supply-government-conservatives\">Labour has a plan to freeze bills and secure Britain’s energy supply. Why doesn’t the government? | Ed Miliband</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, there must be a forensic examination of the accounts of companies across the energy sector. In each case, they must set out their costs and their profit margins if they are to regain public trust. There is, for instance, no reason why the producers of power from nuclear or renewable sources in the UK should be taking advantage of a price cap dominated by the wholesale price of natural gas. A close examination of the true economics of each company is likely to show that freezing the price cap will be cheaper than is currently imagined and expose exactly who should be targeted by any taxation of unjustifiable profits. Those who resist are in danger of losing their licence to operate.</p> <p>The cycle of privatisation that began in the 1980s may be coming to an end. I worked for BP for nearly 30 years and I learned from hard experience during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/23/autumn-2000-fuel-shortages-uk-standstill-price-protest-panic-buying\">tanker drivers’ dispute</a> in 2000 that the continuity of energy supply is rightly regarded as a government responsibility. As with the financial sector in 2008, if the private energy sector fails to meet the needs of the society it serves, its functions must and will be taken on by the government. The companies involved now must show they understand that they must use their skills and resources in the public interest.</p> <p>The third challenge beyond the freeze is to secure adequate physical supplies of gas. This is a matter for close cooperation between the government and the energy sector. Other European countries, led by Germany, have been actively seeking resources on the world market to replace the supplies no longer coming from Russia. The EU has created a single-buyer mechanism and individual countries are pursuing new deals with producers around the world, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/29/if-putin-is-using-gas-prices-to-fight-europe-how-can-it-fight-back\">Qatar and Algeria</a> to the US. Spare resources are scarce because investment levels have been low and new supplies typically take three to five years to come onstream. The result is that a physical shortage of gas across the EU is highly likely this winter.</p> <p>Germany and others are preparing for that risk with serious plans for rationing consumption. The UK, apparently considering itself immune to Europe’s problems, has done nothing and is not even matching the current voluntary measures being adopted across the EU to reduce consumption. Ministers seem not to realise that if countries such as France and Norway limit supplies to the UK this winter in order to meet their own needs, the shortages could be real and substantial. The urgent need is to secure a buffer of additional supplies and develop the long-neglected gas storage facilities that other countries take for granted. Securing and maintaining adequate supplies requires a public-private partnership with the common, overriding aim of maintaining energy security.</p> <p>These steps would help mitigate the risks of the current situation. But they are still not enough to create genuine long-term energy security. Sustained investment is needed in all parts of the energy business – to improve the efficiency of the ways we use energy, to provide the infrastructure necessary for a serious low-carbon transition, and to regulate a complex hybrid sector that combines public policy and private capital. Loose, unsubstantiated and underfunded commitments to ever more ambitious headline targets achieve nothing. A regulator that licenses undercapitalised suppliers in order to promote “competition”, then watches them fail as soon as prices begin to rise is incompetent. Fatalism in the face of the inevitable volatility of a global market in which supplies are concentrated and vulnerable to being weaponised is pathetic.</p> <p>The lesson of past experience is that systemic problems make the line between the public and private sector largely irrelevant. Solutions require a combined effort by pragmatic, realistic governments and companies conscious of their social responsibilities. As we lurch towards a new winter of discontent, the only hope is that the current crisis will drive us back to the substance and detail of a serious energy policy.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nick Butler is a visiting professor at King’s College London, and a former group vice-president for strategy and policy development at BP, and an adviser to Gordon Brown</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Gates and her brother, a contract landscaper, first removed a large hedge that divided the space in two; they replanted the hedge along a boundary, and added a pond next to it. Then they added a layer of gravel before planting into it.</p> <p>“I wanted the space around the front of the house to be quite flat – a big gravel garden with a terrace using engineered, smooth sandstone,” says Gates. Gravel is used as a layer for the plants to grow through, merging the paths with the planting. The feeling is of a relaxed, natural‑looking space, the light colour of the gravel contrasting beautifully with the black of the barn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"beda709504fe974f2e3acddab6605be09e2e12cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/beda709504fe974f2e3acddab6605be09e2e12cc/0_1216_3840_2645/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Gates, in her garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Gates’ garden is in one of the driest parts of the country</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Warne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gates recommends gravel as a topping (called a mulch) because it “locks moisture into the soil below in summer”, while keeping moisture away from plant crowns in winter, which can rot them.

Squeezing her “Christmas bubble” of friends into her living room, Iceland’s most famous citizen was throwing another of her “crazy DJ nights, where 20 people could come and I always ended up DJing just gabber”.</p> <p>According to Björk, the nails-hard 90s Dutch techno style is the perfect soundtrack to Covid life. “There’s always a BPM in our bodies, you know? And I think through Covid we were all pretty lazy, just sitting home reading books, so when we got drunk or partied it was like we went a little bit mental, then we just fell asleep before midnight. Slow energy, but then it goes double.” And that, she realised, is “a little bit gabber”.</p> <p>Iceland’s hardline response to Covid protected its tiny population from the worst of the pandemic. “Please don’t let this come out like a brag, because we felt for you guys, but we actually didn’t have that much of a life change,” she says. Besides, being confined to Iceland is Björk’s idea of a good time. Despite having spread herself around the world for almost four decades, Björk still claims to be “such a homebody”. For her, the nadir of the pandemic was the day the local swimming pool shut.</p> <p>In person – today in a fragrant hotel in east London – Björk is always in motion. There is a fidgety energy to the 56-year-old that seems innate and unchanging, as if her fame as a child singer gave her the confidence not to bother growing up. Maybe it is something to do with the bottom-line feminism of a country where grownup women can be drinkers, shaggers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/09/icelands-new-leader-people-dont-trust-icelandic-politicians\" title=\"\">prime ministers</a> (more on her later) without much controversy. Intermittently jumping out of her seat, Björk is dressed down in a crayon-red asymmetrical dress by Kiko Kostadinov (she obligingly yanks out the label to check), a jacket covered in scales of shimmering blue silk and clompy lace-up platform shoes, with streaks of bronze on her eyelids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bdd21a5641f414897bd167e3e1e309eb61a0548\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bdd21a5641f414897bd167e3e1e309eb61a0548/0_163_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Björk performs at the Bluedot festival, 2022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Björk performs at the Bluedot festival, 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Santiago Felipe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Covid delivered Björk back to her homeland at a transitional time. Her nest was emptying. Her daughter, Ísadóra (who also goes by Doa), was all grown up, studying, acting and making films and music of her own. Björk’s mother, Hildur Rúna Hauksdóttir, the hippy homeopath who nudged her on to the stage as child, had died in 2018 after a long illness. After two albums made in the maelstrom of heartbreak and divorce, Björk fell back to earth with a soft thud, thinking about her ancestors, her descendants and the land of fire and ice that binds them.</p> <p>Her new album is called Fossora, the feminine version of the Latin word for digger. On the cover, she is a glowing forest sprite, her fingertips fusing with the fantastic fungi under her hooves. Compared with the cloudy electronics of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/23/bjork-utopia-review-tinder-album-singer-dating-app\" title=\"\">2017’s Utopia</a>, it is organic and spacious, earthbound rather than dreamy, and filled with warmth and breath. It is also a world of contrasts: the album’s two lodestones are bass clarinet and violent outbursts of gabber. There are moments of astonishing virtuosity and bewildering complexity and, like much of her recent music, a resistance to easy melody. Björk’s journey from 90s dance-pop to something more like surreal opera has more in common with Scott Walker’s graceful trajectory than those of 90s peers such as PJ Harvey.</p> <p>Like all Björk albums, Fossora is a reaction to its predecessor. Soft and light as candyfloss, Utopia was a “survival mechanism out of the heartbreak story” she had told on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/22/bjork-vulnicura-review-breakup-album\" title=\"\">2015’s Vulnicura</a>, which diarised her split from the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/matthew-barney\" title=\"\">Matthew Barney</a> in blow-by-blow bleakness. What she calls the “emergency” album and “the rescue album” popped out like airbags, with barely two years between them, despite the technical challenges Björk set herself (such as the four months it took to figure out the reverb on Utopia’s flutes).</p> <p>This time, she decided to take as long as she needed and “allow myself the luxury of not having any willpower”. Lockdown made that easier. “I don’t think I’ve been that much home since I was 16. Guilty to admit it, but I was eating chocolate pudding every day,” she says with a grin. Usually, on trips back to Reykjavík, she wouldn’t even bother to unpack. This time, her empty suitcase went up on the shelf. “I got really grounded and I really, really loved it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"663de6b4f9ca9cb4539cb23e85174047440d6b6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/663de6b4f9ca9cb4539cb23e85174047440d6b6e/0_128_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homecoming queen … Björk on stage at Harpa Concert Hall, Reykjavik, 2021.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homecoming queen … Björk on stage at Harpa Concert Hall, Reykjavik, 2021.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Santiago Felipe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Between the gabber eruptions, Fossora offers tender songs written for Björk’s mother, a poem by the 18th-century fisherwoman and drifter <a href=\"https://movingpoems.com/poet/latra-bjorg/\" title=\"\">Látra-Björg</a>, the buttery voice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/mar/23/serpentwithfeet-deacon\" title=\"\">Serpentwithfeet</a> and backing vocals from Sindri, her son, and Doa, who lends a pristine, folky tone to Her Mother’s House. “I asked her to write about saying goodbye to the nest and [said] she didn’t have to just be nice,” she says, clearly proud. “It’s me making fun of myself for being a bit clingy.” (They also appeared together in Robert Eggers’ Viking saga <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-hamlet-outrageous-violence\" title=\"\">The Northman</a>, with Doa playing an enslaved Irish person snatched away to Iceland and Björk playing the Seeress, her eyes hidden under sea-snail shells while prophesying a violent death for Alexander Skarsgård.)</p> <p>Despite hyping Fossora as an album for “people who are making clubs in their living room”, rumours of Björk’s rave album have been greatly exaggerated. “I was trying to take the mickey out of myself,” she says with a sigh, her accent still a jolly mixture of Nordic rolled Rs and cockney slang. “Here I am, this lady stuck in my living room in lockdown, and it’s a really serious song for four and a half minutes. And then it’s one minute of” – she bolts up from her chair and starts pumping her arms to a silent beat – “WOO!”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I’m just happy to be back home. I’m really Icelandic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She gives me a visual description of Fossora. If Utopia was a magical retreat from the black lake of misery she plunged into on Vulnicura (“pull all the teeth out, no violence – like a pacifist, idealistic album with flutes and synths and birds”), then Fossora shows life in this dreamland. “Let’s see what it’s like when you walk into this fantasy and, you know, have a lunch and farrrrt” – another gleefully rolled R – “and do normal things, like meet your friends.”</p> <p>This earthiness is trowelled by the album’s sextet of bass clarinets, an instrument chosen not for its gloominess, as in Mahler’s 6th Symphony, nor its smoky luxury, like Bennie Maupin’s playing on Miles Davis’s Bitches Brew, but for its potential as percussive artillery. Björk wanted them to sound “like Public Enemy, like <em>duh-duh-duh-duh</em>, like boxing”, she chirps, before squatting in demonstration of the metre-long instrument’s heavyweight attack.</p> <p>Then there is the hard techno. On heavy rotation at Björk’s living room parties were <a href=\"https://djmag.com/features/get-know-gabber-modus-operandi\" title=\"\">Gabber Modus Operandi</a>, two Indonesian punks who alloy folk styles such as Balinese gamelan with abrasive western gabber, footwork and noise. “They’re taking tradition into the 21st century, which I really respect. They do it like nobody else,” Björk says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd75c9ac5753115a0f3538144e53d2d55de7c616\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd75c9ac5753115a0f3538144e53d2d55de7c616/0_92_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Björk live in Norway, 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Björk live in Norway, 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Santiago Felipe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She had a feeling they would be on the same wavelength. When Ican Harem and DJ Kasimyn first spoke to her over a video call, she explained she was making her “mushroom album. It’s like digging a hole in the ground. This time around, I’m living with moles and really grounding myself. I don’t know if that’s too far-fetched for you guys, but I have to speak in this sort of music lingo,’” she told them. “And they were like: ‘Oh, it’s funny you say that, but last week we took some gamelan drums and dug them in the ground and played them there and recorded it. So, yes, we know what you mean.’” She laughs. “Literally! I was just talking metaphorically!” The duo emailed her beats, which she painstakingly edited into Fossora’s fiddly time signatures, resulting in blasts of what the trio call “biological techno” (also the name of their WhatsApp group chat).</p> <p>Two songs, Sorrowful Soil and Ancestress, are tributes to Björk’s mother, who divorced her husband, an electrician and trade unionist, when Björk was a baby and went to live in a commune of Hendrix-loving hippies. Having trained in alternative medicine, she wasn’t happy to be surrounded by white coats when she got ill towards the end of her life. “She didn’t agree with all that,” says Björk. “She was in the hospital a lot and it was really difficult on her. It was quite a struggle.”</p> <p>Björk is steely as she recounts those distressing couple of years in and out of hospital. Her lyrics, too, are stark in their grief: “The machine of her breathed all night while she rested / Revealed her resilience / And then it didn’t,” she sings over leaping strings and gongs on Ancestress. Hildur Rúna was 72 when she died. “That’s quite early. I think me and my brother were not ready to … we thought she had 10 years left. So we were like: ‘Come on,’ and getting her to fight and … and it was like she had an inner clock in her and she was just ready to go.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc2e18b20ca1ee99798e686c3576de047a8449f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc2e18b20ca1ee99798e686c3576de047a8449f6/0_348_4589_2753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Performing with the Sugarcubes in New York, 1992.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing with the Sugarcubes in New York, 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Eichner/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2002, at the same age Björk is now, Hildur Rúna <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/27/arts.artsnews\" title=\"\">went on hunger strike</a> to protest against the US company Alcoa building an aluminium smelter and 11 dams for a hydroelectric plant in the Icelandic highlands. She said: “I have a famous daughter, and I’ve never used her name ever before, but in this case it was needed.” Björk was supportive of her mum’s activism, but no doubt relieved when, after 23 days, frail and delirious from surviving on herbal tonics, Hildur Rúna ended her fast.</p> <p>The smelter and the dams were eventually built. Since then, Björk has dedicated much of her time to raising the alarm about environmental devastation. She once ditched a performance at Iceland Airwaves festival to protest against plans to build more than 50 dams and power plants. She <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5xialK0XBY\" title=\"\">interviewed David Attenborough</a> for a TV documentary about music and the natural world. Her 2019 Cornucopia tour featured a video message from the climate activist Greta Thunberg. The <a href=\"https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/knowledge-centre/projects/biophilia-educational-project\" title=\"\">Biophilia Educational Project</a>, which bloomed from her 2011 app/album, has become a functioning school syllabus designed to get kids exploring music and science.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a singer-songwriter, my role is to express the journey of my body or my soul. Hopefully I’ll do that till I’m 85</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2019, Björk and Thunberg allied with Iceland’s prime minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, to declare a climate emergency, a move they hoped would force an official response from the government. But when the time came to make the announcement, Jakobsdóttir backed out. “I kind of trusted her, maybe because she was a woman – and then she went and did a speech and she didn’t say a <em>word</em>. She didn’t even mention it. And I was <em>so</em> pissed off,” Björk recounts, practically spitting. “Because I’d been planning that for months.”</p> <p>A few years ago, she might have kept quiet and held the line. Now, her disappointment has spilled over into exasperation – and perhaps a touch of activist burnout. She says: “I wanted to be backing her up. It’s hard to be a female prime minister; she’s got all the rednecks on her back. But she hasn’t done anything for the environment.”</p> <p>In her own world, Björk remains in control, leading orchestras and choirs of increasing size (52 singers at last count) and collaborating with her pick of musicians and designers. Yet, at heart, she is still a freewheeling romantic, a “fountain of blood in the shape of a girl”, as she sang 25 years ago on Bachelorette. “I feel, as a singer-songwriter, my role is to express the journey of my body or my soul or whatever, and hopefully I will do that till I’m 85, or however long I live. I try to keep the antennas up and read where my body is at.”</p> <p>As is obvious from the songs Atopos and Fungal City (“His vitality repolarises me / My north/south shifts to east/west”) Fossora is an “in love” album – but there are two different love objects at play, she winks, refusing to say more. I suggest that her relationship songs often read like confrontations, punctuated by the sort of difficult questions one regrets asking too late at night. On Atopos, she quizzes: “Are these not just excuses to not connect?” No, she says after a moment’s thought – it is the other way around. “Sometimes, when I really love someone, I will have an interrogation lyric and it’s disguised as my doubts, because I want to be nice – but it’s actually their doubts.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/24/bjork-her-20-greatest-songs-ranked\">Björk – her 20 greatest songs ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Björk’s homecoming marks a new cycle. The dust has settled. “I’m just really happy to be back home and I’m such a homebody and I’m really Icelandic,” she gushes. The swimming pool is open again.

A member of the Kaiowá, Marcos Verón, a septuagenarian chief, was beaten to death in violent clashes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/28/guardianobituaries\">there in 2003</a> when he led a group of people seeking to take back their territory.</p> <p>Cargill buys soy grown on the 9,700-hectare farm, which is now known as Brasília do Sul, the Earthsight report claims.

Together the firms account for 30.8% of Brazilian soy exports to the EU and UK.</p> <p>The Brasília do Sul farm is in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul and run by the Jacintho family, a leading landowner in Brazil’s soy and cattle belt, Earthsight said.</p> <p>Luana Fernandes, a lawyer for the Jacintho family, said they had no comment on the group’s report.</p> <p>The territory was recognised as belonging to the Guarani-Kaiowá in 2010 but successive governments have not taken the final step needed to give the Kaiowá legal ownership, according to Earthsight.</p> <p>Under Brazilian law, anthropologists working in conjunction with lawyers, sociologists, cartographers and other experts must study the land and its history before deciding to whom it belongs. Formal deeds are conferred by a presidential decree but that final step has been delayed for more than 10 years due to legal wrangles.</p> <p>Some of the soy produced at Brasília do Sul goes to Cargill and Bunge, but the complexity of supply chains makes it difficult to state whether food linked to those beans are sold by UK retailers, said the study’s author.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.earthsight.org.uk/news/analysis-short-sighted-uk-environment-bill-will-leave-brazil-deforesters-unchecked\">Rubens Carvalho, Earthsight’s head of deforestation research</a>, said: “The point is that it contaminates the supply chain. Whether this particular bit of soy that fed a chicken ends up at Tesco or McDonald’s in the end is a little irrelevant because the point is that the British market, and other European markets for that matter, are contaminated by a supply chain that is linked to a farm with a long history of indigenous rights violations.

Its brilliant cast don’t put a foot wrong","byline":"Lucy Mangan","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/tv-pr/originals/bad-sisters/\">Bad Sisters (Apple TV+)</a> is an adaptation of The Out-Laws – the Belgian series by Malin-Sarah Gozin, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/13/the-out-laws-is-this-the-blackest-comedy-ever\">described by this here very organ</a> as “the blackest comedy ever”. To know that it has been retooled by, and stars, Sharon Horgan is to be reassured that nothing will be lost in translation. This well-founded hope is confirmed within the first few minutes, which see widow Grace (Anne-Marie Duff) pressing down hard on her dead husband’s genitals to try to rid him of the erection she has just noticed he is maintaining in his coffin. “Post-mortem priapism,” explains her sister Ursula (Eva Birthistle). “It’s not uncommon. Especially after a violent death.”</p> <p>The stage, in so many ways, is set. There are five Garvey sisters – Eva (Horgan) is the oldest and took on the maternal role after their parents died. Ursula is a nurse, a mother of three and sensible, except for the affair she is having with her photography teacher. Bibi (Sarah Greene) is fiercely uncompromising, Becka (Eve Hewson) is the slightly aimless baby of the family, and Grace is the only one even slightly mourning the death of her spouse John Paul (Claes Bang).</p> <p>When we flash back six months, it becomes clear why. With painful, pinpoint accuracy, he is shown to have been a controlling, coercive, borderline physically violent man who has spent the years of his marriage to Grace eroding her strength and her spirit. Their scenes together are agony as he needles, wrongfoots and destablises her at every turn, closing down her options at the tiniest levels so that the idea of making freer, bigger choices is no longer even part of her mental landscape. He is now expanding his reach and beginning to do the same to his early-teenage daughter – policing her diet, her social life and even pocketing her confirmation money for his own use. At the wake, a guest tells Eva he is sorry for her loss. “I’m just glad the suffering’s over,” she says. “Oh – was he ill?” says the surprised guest. “No,” she replies.</p> <p>Just as perfectly portrayed is the other sisters’ appreciation of what is happening and their powerlessness to do anything about it. Until they have a whiskey-soaked chat on the beach, after their traditional Christmas family swim (which John Paul has finally succeeded in keeping Grace from attending). They share their secret fantasies about how to get rid of him, before they burgeon into workable theory and then practice. The second episode (two have been released initially by Apple – the rest will follow weekly) covers the first, failed execution of the tyrant in the sisters’ midst. Various other attempts go awry too but we must assume, from the corpse and the sisters’ shifty behaviour since, that one of them worked in the end.</p> <p>Unfortunately for the sisters, we are not the only ones who suspect foul play. Eager not to pay out on a hefty life insurance policy that will bankrupt the firm he inherited from his father, agent Tom Claffin (Brian Gleeson) and – more reluctantly – his half-brother Matt (Daryl McCormack) start digging into what happened on the night their client died.</p> <p>It is a dark comedy indeed. Some will find it too dark, no doubt, just as others will find it too comedic given the central subject is domestic violence. But most, I hope, will find the two elements mostly working in harmony – the serious, unshakeable sorority among the Garvey women, albeit expressed largely in bickering and banter, matching, rather than trivialising, the suffering elsewhere.</p> <p>It is possible that a stronger show would have emerged if John Paul had been made a little less relentlessly monstrous. He exercises his cruelty without, it seems, much discrimination: he humiliatingly refers to Eva’s infertility in public; he snaps at Ursula’s son, who has Down’s syndrome, when the boy tries to hug him. And these are even before we move on to his larger machinations. There’s his blackmailing of Ursula over her affair; his financial ruining of Becka; and his attempt to sabotage Eva’s promotion. At times, all this threatens to make him a cartoonish villain, and undermine the show’s good work elsewhere. When his toxicity is so obvious, it makes it harder to believe that a group of siblings as close and forthright as the Garveys wouldn’t have intervened in the relationship earlier and, more substantially, long before it got to the point when murder seemed the only way out.</p> <p>Regardless, as an exercise in catharsis, Bad Sisters is wonderful. It is also superbly constructed, perfectly paced and brilliantly performed, with Horgan on top form as both writer and actor, surrounded by a cast who don’t put a foot wrong. Wittily directed (by Rebecca Gatward, Josephine Bornebusch and Dearbhla Walsh) and gorgeously shot, this is a fine addition to the growing collection of stories told unapologetically for, by and about women on mainstream television. Sorority takes many forms.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/19/uk-dentist-should-give-antibiotic-patient-risk-infective-endocarditis-study-nice-guidelines","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"UK dentists should give antibiotics to patients at risk of heart infection – study ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/19/uk-dentist-should-give-antibiotic-patient-risk-infective-endocarditis-study-nice-guidelines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/19/uk-dentist-should-give-antibiotic-patient-risk-infective-endocarditis-study-nice-guidelines","fields":{"headline":"UK dentists should give antibiotics to patients at risk of heart infection – study ","trailText":"Nice guidelines advising against antibiotic use for those at risk of infective endocarditis should be reviewed, researchers say","byline":"Sascha Pare","body":"<p>Dentists in the UK should be encouraged to give antibiotics to patients at high risk of life-threatening heart infection before invasive procedures, a study has found.</p> <p>Research suggests bacteria from the mouth entering the bloodstream during dental treatment could explain 30% to 40% of infective endocarditis cases.

Should this have contained parasites, they would have been at risk of becoming infected when they ate their produce.</p> <p>Mitchell added that medieval people thought intestinal worms were linked to having too much phlegm, one of the four “humours”. “They wouldn’t have understood that washing would be a healthy thing to decrease the risk of spreading infection.”</p> <p>Dr Martin Heale, reader in medieval history at the University of Liverpool, who was not involved in the work, said friars did grow some of their own food – sometimes hiring gardeners to assist them – but noted they were supposed to live by begging.</p> <p>“Therefore, much of their food probably came from charitable donations,” he said. “Perhaps stingy townspeople were giving them cheaper or unhealthier food than they ate themselves. Monasteries were also pretty contagious places, and used shared latrines, and that could be another factor once infection set in.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/19/duel-in-the-pool-begins-with-bondi-beach-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T04:42:36Z","webTitle":"Duel in the Pool begins with Bondi beach battle as swimmers enter unknown | Kieran Pender","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/duel-in-the-pool-begins-with-bondi-beach-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/19/duel-in-the-pool-begins-with-bondi-beach-battle","fields":{"headline":"Duel in the Pool begins with Bondi beach battle","trailText":"The competition between swimming powerhouses Australia and the US returned to Sydney after a 15-year absence with a new twist","byline":"Kieran Pender at Bondi Beach","body":"<p>“Iconic” was the word of the day. As Australian and American swim stars gathered at Bondi Icebergs to observe the opening event of the three-day Duel in the Pool – an open water relay – adjectives flowed freely.

Australia v the United States, the two heavyweight swimming nations, head-to-head. Not at the Sydney Olympic Park Aquatic Centre (that comes this weekend), but at Bondi beach – the spiritual home of Australia’s aquatic culture, the nation’s very own swimming mecca. Not a duel in the pool but a battle from one end of Bondi beach to the other and back, and then out and back again – “four by <em>almost</em> 800 metres,” one event organiser quipped, noting the difficulties of setting up an exact “course” in the middle of the ocean.</p> <p>Pool swimming is a sport defined by millimetres and milliseconds. It is a sport of certainty and finely-tuned preparations. As the sun rose over Bondi on Friday morning, there was none of that. The American and Australian teams conferred on details while perched on the beach steps, and last-minute questions were met by shrugs. It was apparent that both nations were entering the unknown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"8f8eb78f93154506199652be2ede61dd874de57a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f8eb78f93154506199652be2ede61dd874de57a/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surfers wait on the ocean on what looks like a normal sleepy morning at Bondi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surfers wait on the ocean on what looks like a normal sleepy morning at Bondi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It’s pretty cool to be racing here at Bondi,” said Australia’s Kareena Lee, an open water bronze medallist at the Tokyo Olympics, as she limbered up on the sand. “A little bit different to what we’re used to!”</p> <p>Australia’s four swimmers– Lee, Chelsea Gubecka, Kyle Lee and Kai Edwards – are all specialised open water swimmers, albeit more accustomed to racing 10 or 20 kilometres, not a mere 800m. The Americans went for a different approach, throwing their pool swimmers into the ocean. The Australians were acclimatised to the conditions – Edwards lives nearby and had been training at Bondi – while the Americans were better-suited to the distance. “I think it will be a fair playing field,” said Kareena.</p> <p>“Bondi is such an iconic spot,” added Kyle (the first of a double-digit count for the “i” word during the morning). The quartet joked about sharks and mind-games with the Americans; fortunately, no great whites would be sighted. The waves rolled in, with 50 or so surfers spread across the beach, although the relay course was just beyond the breakers. “We would have loved some more chop,” Kyle said. The bigger the waves, the more pool specialists would struggle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"87f1ae0ef7bd34efc5245009d74fe9b67cb09385\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87f1ae0ef7bd34efc5245009d74fe9b67cb09385/0_0_6094_3814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian open water swimmers Kareena Lee and Chelsea Gubecka get ready to hit the water.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian open water swimmers Kareena Lee and Chelsea Gubecka get ready to hit the water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Icebergs, swimmers from both nations rubbed shoulders with suits from the state government and its tourism agency, which is underwriting the event. Cody Simpson, the swimmer turned pop star turned swimmer again, snapped selfies with Australian swim legend Grant Hackett and young fans in turn. “This is an awesome way to start it off with the open water relay,” said Simpson. “This is probably one of the most iconic pool locations in Australia, if not the world.”</p> <p>Hackett, serving as team captain for Australia this weekend, eyed the waves with a hint of desire. “I would have loved this,” said the now-retired three-time Olympic gold medallist. “Not many people know this, but I actually grew up more surf swimming than pool swimming. I wanted to be an iron man.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41c950bbb034cf9e6bd1b8a5b727961ec16e252c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41c950bbb034cf9e6bd1b8a5b727961ec16e252c/0_0_6422_4189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Australia team, from left to right: Kareena Lee, Kai Edwards, Chelsea Gubecka and Kyle Lee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Australia team, from left to right: Kareena Lee, Kai Edwards, Chelsea Gubecka and Kyle Lee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perched on the look-out above the picturesque ocean pool, Americans looked enviously at the locals swimming laps below.

The rivalry was a regular feature of swimming calendar in the 2000s, when Hackett and co faced off against the American superstars, but there has been no Duel in the Pool on home soil since 2007. After a decade in the (relative) doldrums, the Australian national swim team – the Dolphins – are back, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/10/australias-swimmers-target-paris-after-record-breaking-tokyo-medal-haul\">finishing neck and neck</a> with the United States in the pool in Tokyo.

After a hectic international calendar, most recently the world championships in Budapest and then, for Australia, the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, “fun” seemed to join “iconic” as the words of the day.</p> <p>“This is the fun part of swimming,” said American Annie Lazor, a short-course breaststroke world champion and Tokyo bronze medallist. “This is arguably the two best swimming countries in the world going head-to-head, but it’s such a nice opportunity to have – even though it’s a rivalry – a much more light-hearted competition.” The weekend’s action in the pool includes a range of atypical events: “broken” relays, “random” order medleys and, for the first-time in an international swim meet, an “integrated” relay featuring both able-bodied and para-swimmers.</p> <p>Simpson chatted with his girlfriend, Australian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jul/31/emma-mckeon-nearly-quit-swimming-now-she-is-on-the-brink-of-all-time-greatness\">swimming stalwart Emma McKeon</a>, as the cameras lingered on the pair. One onlooker offered: “I just came to see Cody Simpson.” Fellow Dolphins regulars Kaylee McKeown and Mack Horton watched on, while the American team – mini-flags in hand, voices ready to cheer – took up the best spots on the look-out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6fdc6dcade2dcb4991a2b3097ac4c50a1713e18f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fdc6dcade2dcb4991a2b3097ac4c50a1713e18f/0_0_4871_3247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kyle Lee takes on the final leg duties in the 4x800m relay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kyle Lee takes on final leg duties in the 4x800m relay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt King/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pool swimming events are typically managed to the minute, but no-one seemed too perturbed as the designated 9am start-time slipped by. “Have they started yet?” someone asked at five minutes past, as the gathering looked enviously at one spectator to have remembered binoculars. Finally at 9.10am the race began, one swimmer from each nation leading off from a makeshift pontoon on the southern end of Bondi. “Iconic” was dropped again – perhaps this time ironically.</p> <p>Someone took the lead, although – from such a distance, with no readily-identifying features – it was hard to know which nation had gained the early advantage. “Australia is always in front,” offered one member of the Dolphins. Fortunately another onlooker had a phone number for an official thought to be stationed the pontoon: “Are you on the pontoon? Are we in front?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"503fc1a97afc8ff4b7f872a45e5d3425d4172d7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/503fc1a97afc8ff4b7f872a45e5d3425d4172d7b/0_0_6112_3921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bella Sims, one of the US team also featuring Charlie Clark, David Johnston and Tylor Mathieu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bella Sims, one of the US team also featuring Charlie Clark, David Johnston and Tylor Mathieu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It transpired that the Australians were not in front. The US had made a tactical gamble – opening the race with two male swimmers, and concluding with two women. The Australians had gone for the reverse: woman, woman, man, man. The Americans built a steady lead, but would have to hold off the fast-finishing Australians. At one point the gap between the nations almost resulted in a mid-water collision; a fresh American swimmer hurtling towards a finishing Australian, only for the pair to narrowly glide by each other.</p> <p>From the Icebergs look-out, Lazor surveyed the view. “It’s amazing,” she said. Lazor recalled how she and teammates had accompanied the open water relay team on a reconnaissance mission earlier in the week. “And we thought we’d jump in this iconic pool. I mean – it’s a bucket-list item, right?” Asked if more laps might follow after the race, Lazor demurred. “It was a little too cold for me the other day, and it’s a little chilly this morning.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07d06ecf04e3477b5afa1758a9f1d03efa253efd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d06ecf04e3477b5afa1758a9f1d03efa253efd/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The open water race went down to the wire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The open water race went down to the wire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Australia’s anchor swimmer, Kyle Lee, began his 800m leg, he faced a 17-second deficit. But he steadily ate it up. As Sydneysiders went about their day – surfers enjoying the morning waves, Icebergs regulars doing their laps, personal trainers working with clients in the background – the inaugural Australian Dolphins v Team USA swimming relay at Bondi beach went down to the wire.</p> <p>“Let’s go Australia go the Aussies,” cheered the small crowd, as Lee surged home to narrowly win the relay. Half an hour later, having dried off and warmed up, and joined the remainder of the team tucking into a spread of pastries at Icebergs, the rising star of open water swimming summed up the event. “It was nice to do something different, at such an iconic place,” he said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/19/country-diary-the-murderous-wails-of-polecats-in-high-summer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T04:30:05Z","webTitle":"Country diary: The murderous wails of polecats in high summer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/country-diary-the-murderous-wails-of-polecats-in-high-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/19/country-diary-the-murderous-wails-of-polecats-in-high-summer","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: The murderous wails of polecats in high summer","trailText":"<strong>Inkpen, North Wessex Downs:</strong> Above the drone of a distant, night-time combine harvester, their hysterical yikkering becomes a crescendo","byline":"Nicola Chester","body":"<p>Nothing seems to be sleeping in the heat.

Teenage programmers sit on bean bags and wander up and down an external staircase built for a recent hackathon. Only one item of furniture is incongruous amid the bright colours and glass cubicles at the institute of economics and technology: an old turquoise-painted desk.</p> \n<p>A student who once sat at it went on to became an international celebrity – and Ukraine’s wartime president. “Volodymyr Zelenskiy was special. He was bright, hard-working and wanted to be the best of the best,” Andrii Shaikan, <a href=\"https://www.duet.edu.ua/en/persons/14\">rector of the state university</a> in Zelenskiy’s home town of Kryvyi Rih, told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>In the mid-1990s, Shaikan was at the university himself, in the year above Zelenskiy. The president’s father, Oleksandr, is <a href=\"https://www.duet.edu.ua/en/persons/49\">a well-known academic and heads its department of informatics and applied software</a>.

Instead, the future president developed a taste for show business, taking part in sketches and comedy competitions. A photo taken by Shaikan in 1996 shows a floppy-haired Zelenskiy standing with a group of fellow student performers, dressed in white jeans and a colourful waistcoat.</p> \n<p>His home was in one of the city’s middle-class districts. Back then, Kryvyi Rih was known for its criminal associations. Young men who returned from the Soviet war in Afghanistan drifted into lives of crime and drug dealing. “As a teenager, Volodymyr had two alternatives: he could succeed, or he could become a member of a criminal gang,” Shaikan recalled.</p> \n<p>He added: “We watched Volodymyr realise himself step by step. He has great leadership skills and is quick at solving problems. He makes instant decisions. And it’s very difficult to influence him.” The rector said he was not a fan of Zelenskiy’s “mass culture” TV shows including Servant of the People and preferred his live standup acts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5393703993d738a287950fce21b1dfe282004a07\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5393703993d738a287950fce21b1dfe282004a07/0_0_5793_3862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrii Shaikan sitting at the turquoise desk once used by Zelenskiy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrii Shaikan sitting at the turquoise desk once used by Zelenskiy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Cherry/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The rector voted for him in Ukraine’s 2019 presidential election, which Zelenskiy won by a landslide. “We knew his environment and family roots,” he said. One influence, Shaikan said, was Zelenskiy’s grandfather who worked in the USSR as a criminal detective. “Volodymyr was interested in the law. He wanted to take after his grandfather,” the rector said.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2022/03/20/exp-gps-0320-zelensky-on-putin-denazification-claims.cnn\">an interview with CNN</a>, Zelenskiy revealed that his grandfather Semyon had fought in the Red Army, reaching the rank of colonel. Semyon’s father and three brothers perished in the Holocaust. The Germans murdered Zelenskiy’s great-grandparents when they burned down their village. His tragic family history makes ridiculous the Kremlin’s claim that Zelenskiy is a fascist.</p> \n<p>The president’s former teachers described Zelenskiy as an intellectually capable undergraduate, who sometimes missed classes because he was busy on stage. Afterwards, he would apologise and hand in his assignments, they said. He drew other people to him, they added, and won an Olympiad competition for his mastery of English.</p> \n<p>“He had a great sense of humour. I taught him business English in his fourth year. I was strict. Students had to write letters. He made fun of stereotypes, and would mock the format by saying he intended to transport camels and elephants,” lecturer Kira Vyshnevska said. “You could see his political sensibility growing. He criticised our corrupt political system,” she added.</p> \n<p>Economics lecturer Natalia Voloshaniuk said Zelenskiy was a “leader and an organiser” who took his studies seriously, even as his show business career took off. She added: “People followed him. He was an intellectual light, and a humorous and fun guy. His decency was obvious. There was lot of the real Zelenskiy in the president he portrayed in Servant of the People.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e62efa0fb224259389da255c0cd7c06714601995\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e62efa0fb224259389da255c0cd7c06714601995/0_385_5772_3463/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bridge in a village between Mikolaiv and Kryvyi Rih that was destroyed to slow the Russian advance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bridge in a village between Mikolaiv and Kryvyi Rih that was destroyed to slow the Russian advance.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Cherry/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In spring, Russian forces came close to seizing Zelenskiy’s home town, which was built in the 19th century along a series of mines. The city in south-east Ukraine is Europe’s longest at 75 miles (120km) and is dotted with chimney stacks and 20th-century foundries. When the enemy advanced, Shaikan said he and his colleagues made molotov cocktails and dug ditches.</p> \n<p>Russia’s objective was to seize Kryvyi Rih’s airfield and use it as a base to conquer the south – and to humiliate Zelenskiy by occupying his native city and hanging up Russian flags. Ukraine’s armed forces shoved the Russians back. The frontline is now 31 miles (50km) away. Russian troops are encamped on the bank of the Dnieper river in Zaporizhzhia oblast.</p> \n<p>From there, they have been bombarding the Ukrainian-controlled towns of Nikopol and Marhanets, last week killing at least 16 people. All the victims were civilians. A 13-year-old girl was hospitalised. Enemy soldiers have occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, just across the river, prompting international concern and accusations from Zelenskiy of “state terrorism” by Russia.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"443d34d0c2d3b05e9b3dde82ab364c60bb10bb2b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/443d34d0c2d3b05e9b3dde82ab364c60bb10bb2b/0_0_5880_3920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oleksandr Vilkul, the Kryvyi Rih military head.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oleksandr Vilkul, the Kryvyi Rih military head.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Cherry/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of Kryvyi Rih’s military administration, said Moscow could no longer reach Kryvyi Rih with artillery. It still bombards the city once a week with longer range rockets. There was no prospect of the Russian army launching a second offensive in the region, he said, adding: “People are patriotic. Everybody is working for victory. Ukraine will free all its territory.”</p> \n<p>Since February, 70,000 internally displaced people have arrived in Kryvyi Rih, Vilkul said, fleeing from the Nikopol district and eastern and southern regions. He said that when Ukraine liberated these occupied areas, it would find evidence of murders and war crimes. “There will be many places like Bucha. The Russians are worse than German fascists,” he said.</p> \n<p>The city – which has a peacetime population of 600,000 – is feeding 40,000 refugees every day. It has converted a house of culture into a humanitarian centre, complete with racks of secondhand clothes, medicines, a nurse, legal advice and a children’s play area. Its industrial enterprises have ground to a halt, since Ukraine is unable to export and import materials from its Black Sea ports.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bb1a51d1-f6c8-4a5f-b895-95aab7be4624\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B3X3wOO29Nw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Outside the centre, a mural of a familiar figure was being painted on a brick wall.

He speaks urgently, the din of a prison behind him. “It’s probably the last time I’m going to call you.”</p> <p>And so it proved. That voice note, sent on the afternoon of 26 January, was the last his family ever heard from Yusuf Zahab, an Australian teenager caught in the middle of a deadly Islamic State attack in January on the prison where he was being held with 750 other boys, none ever charged with a crime.</p> <p>Bleeding from his injuries, Yusuf, 17 years old at the time, had survived six days as a human shield between IS gunmen and Kurdish and US troops in a battle in Kurdish-controlled Syria that killed an estimated 500 people. He believed there was a window to finally escape. Then he vanished.</p> <p>What Yusuf was doing in a western-funded jail, and the mystery surrounding his fate, raise uncomfortable questions about a group of children that governments in the UK and Australia would prefer to wish away: the boys left behind after the defeat of Islamic State’s caliphate.</p> <p>In Sydney, Yusuf’s family presume he is dead, and now spend days and nights on the phone to Syrian fixers and the Australian government, seeking answers to a simple question – what happened to Yusuf?</p> <h2><strong>‘Honestly, it was just disbelief’</strong></h2> <p>He came from suburban Sydney, a world away from the Syrian battlefields that would swallow him before he reached adulthood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/aug/18/the-boy-lost-in-a-syrian-black-hole-prison-podcast\">The boy lost in a Syrian “black hole” prison - podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Yusuf had the most contagious smile, he was the most beautiful boy,” says Hala Zahab, Yusuf’s cousin. Because of their age difference, she felt like another mum to him. “He was like my own child,” she says.</p> <p>An ordinary Australian upbringing – of camping, trampolines and gaming – was cut short in 2015, when Yusuf was taken overseas by his parents, ostensibly to visit their grandmother in Lebanon. “It wasn’t anything we were concerned about, to be honest,” Hala says.</p> <p>But the months stretched on and the family stayed abroad and in November of that year, Hala received a visit from Australia’s security services. Yusuf, aged 11 at the time, had been plunged into IS-held territory with his parents, two older brothers and sister, the agents told her.</p> <p>“Honestly, it was just disbelief,” Hala says. “Because my aunt and uncle … had a future here. They had a beautiful life.”</p> <p>Yusuf’s family have told contrasting stories of why they joined IS, more than a year after the group had started advertising its atrocities in slick propaganda videos. Muhammad, the eldest son, had already crossed over years before, rising to become one of the group’s most senior Australian members. Hichem, Yusuf’s father,says <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUxqmjbiSZ0&amp;t=2s\">he took the family to Syria grudgingly</a>, to persuade his “brainwashed” son to leave. Others have claimed <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-30/women-of-isis-reveal-australian-network/11549490\">the family were tricked</a> into going to the border and were forced over at gunpoint.</p> <p>Whatever the truth of the matter, Hala says, what blame could be fixed on Yusuf? “He was a young boy,” she says. “He couldn’t make decisions on his own.” And yet he would pay the price.</p> <p>In 2019, the Zahabs were among a stream of thousands of IS members fleeing the group’s final redoubt in Baghouz, north-eastern Syria. The surviving members of the family – Yusuf, his sister and their parents – surrendered at a checkpoint manned by western allies, the mostly-Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). His mother and sister were placed in one line, his father another. Yusuf, then 14, was pulled away into another group.</p> <p>“He was too old to go with his mum to the camps,” Hala says. “So he was then separated. And we heard nothing … two years of nothing.”</p> <p>That silence finally broke in November last year, when Hala was doing the laundry at her Sydney home, and her phone buzzed with a message from an unfamiliar number. It was a short, scattershot voice note, recorded in haste.</p> <p>“<em>Salamalaikum</em>, how are you, it’s me Yusuf,” the voice said, familiar but huskier and cracking. “I’m good, I love you, I’m sorry I have no time – I just wanted to send you a message to tell you I’m good, <em>hamdullillah</em>, how are you, are you good?”</p> <p>Hala shook as she listened. “I was just so excited,” she says. “I remember trying to – oh my god – text back, trying to get my phone to work … so I can respond to him in time, because I was aware of the fact there was no time.”</p> <p>The fleeting contact confirmed her second-to-worst fear. Yusuf was alive, but he had spent two years detained in the youth wing of Gweiran prison in Kurdish-controlled Syria, a notorious facility housing about 3,000 of some of IS’s most hardened fighters. The teenager was in a grotty, overcrowded cell, where he had contracted tuberculosis.</p> <p>“He was telling me that he gets body aches, joint pain,” she says. “He was saying it was so hard … [Asking] when can I come home? And I told him, we’re working on it. We’re pushing … We’re trying to get you home.”</p> <p>Aid workers told her that Yusuf, by now 17, was struggling with nightmares, and other dreams that were not frightening but still tormented him, where he could see his mother and touch her and they could hug.</p> <h2><strong>“I’ve lost a lot of blood. Please, what do I do?”</strong></h2> <p>Governments have struggled for more than three years with the dilemma of the children who were taken by their parents to join IS, or those born to fighters, their wives and the women they enslaved.</p> <p>Over time, a consensus has formed – including among many western security officials – that the threat of allowing young Britons, Australians, Canadians and others to grow up in violent prisons and camps outweighs the challenges of re-integrating them back home.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Australia and the UK have been hesitant, repatriating eight and nine children respectively, <a href=\"https://www.rightsandsecurity.org/action/resources/global-repatriations-tracker\">a fraction of those returned</a> by Russia (228), Germany (69) and France (70).</p> <p>Hala, who formed a network with others in Australia whose former IS family members were detained in Syria, says her efforts to persuade the Australian government to help Yusuf were met with disinterest. “You’d get nothing. Either an automated response, or I’m sorry, we don’t have consular assistance in the area.”</p> <p>In January this year, she started seeing news reports of an IS attack at the prison where Yusuf was detained. “I was terrified,” she says. “I was like, please, we have just gotten to him. Please don’t let anything happen to him.</p> <p>“And then … I received a voice clip from him telling me, ‘I’m injured. There’s a helicopter shooting at the prison’ … He said: ‘I’m bleeding, I’ve lost a lot of blood. Please, what do I do?’”</p> <p>The IS assault led to days of bloody fighting in and around the prison, leaving bodies, including those of children, scattered in the surrounding streets.</p> <p>Desperate for help, and in coordination with Human Rights Watch, Hala and the family authorised the public release of two of Yusuf’s voice notes from inside the siege, the first time a boy imprisoned in the facilities has ever been heard.</p> <p>“I just got shot by an Apache, my head is bleeding,” Yusuf says in the recording, broadcast around the world. “I’ve injured my head and my hand, there’s no doctors here who can help me. I need help, please.”</p> <p>In his final message, saying he was about to surrender, he made two requests to his family: for help wherever he ended up next, and that they say hello from him to his mum. They had been separated nearly three years.</p> <h2><strong>‘Infinitely doable’</strong></h2> <p>As the smoke cleared from the carnage at the prison, Hala braced for news about her cousin. “Months go by and you hear nothing,” Hala says. “Nothing, no news. And your heart starts to sink.”</p> <p>In July, Yusuf’s mother, detained in a guarded camp for women and young children, received an ominous message from Kurdish authorities – Yusuf was no longer in their custody. They could not explain when or where he might have died or slipped their grasp.</p> <p>Three weeks later, The Australian newspaper cited unnamed sources to report the government believed Yusuf might now be dead. The combination of the two updates convinced the family to abandon hope Yusuf was still alive. “We were shattered, absolutely shattered,” Hala says.</p> <p>The funeral was held at a mosque in Sydney in July, but closure is elusive. They have simply no idea what happened to Yusuf. Did he die trying to surrender? Or of his wounds, or disease, in a prison hospital?</p> <p>Most haunting is the possibility, in the absence of a body, that he has somehow survived, lost in a system that has become a black hole for hundreds of children.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that the Australian government has established that Yusuf was able to surrender and survived at least into the weeks after the siege. But it has not been able to definitively provide the family with an account of what has happened since and is seeking clarification from the SDF.</p> <p>Australia’s department of foreign affairs and trade says it is “seeking further information on [Yusuf’s] welfare”.</p> <p>Yusuf is among at least 100 other children whose whereabouts are still unaccounted for after the IS siege, according to research by Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, a UN special rapporteur who has been examining the Kurdish prisons.</p> <p>His extraction from Syria sometime in the past three years would have been “infinitely doable”, Ní Aoláin says. “I work with governments every day, who have brought back their nationals. The government of Australia simply refused to bring back this child.”</p> <p>It is this conviction that burns Hala back in Sydney. That it was so needless. A matter of calculation. “They had ample opportunity to get [Yusuf] out,” she says. “And unfortunately, the only conclusion we could come to is – it was not a popular cause. Politically, it was not popular.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Hala spoke to the Guardian for an episode of Today in Focus, our daily news podcast. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2022/aug/18/the-boy-lost-in-a-syrian-black-hole-prison-podcast\">You can listen to her tell Yusuf’s story here.</a></em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/seal-breaks-into-new-zealand-home-traumatises-cat-and-hangs-out-on-couch","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T02:58:02Z","webTitle":"Seal breaks into New Zealand home, traumatises cat and hangs out on couch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/seal-breaks-into-new-zealand-home-traumatises-cat-and-hangs-out-on-couch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/seal-breaks-into-new-zealand-home-traumatises-cat-and-hangs-out-on-couch","fields":{"headline":"Seal breaks into New Zealand home, traumatises cat and hangs out on couch","trailText":"Young fur seal slipped into marine biologist’s home through a catflap before spending more than two hours inside","byline":"Eva Corlett in Wellington","body":"<p>A curious young seal has been returned to the sea after breaking into a New Zealand home, harassing the resident cat, hanging about in the hallway for a couple of hours while the children slept upstairs, and miraculously ruining nothing.</p> \n<p>The Ross family of Mt Maunganui were more than a little surprised to find the New Zealand fur seal in their home, which is about 150m from the shore, on Wednesday morning.</p> \n<p>Phil Ross, who happens to be a marine biologist, said it was unfortunate he was the only one not home at the time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e62df205-56d7-4eef-89ed-080d58ede771\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0JHxWd8Sh-w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>“The big joke is that this is really the only family emergency where it would be useful to have a marine biologist in the house,” he said. “I really missed my time to shine.”</p> \n<p>Ross said his wife, Jenn, rose just before 6am on Wednesday to go to the gym.</p> \n<p>“As she got in the car, something barked from underneath and shuffled away.

Just two weeks ago, she played her first professional doubles match. She had never faced a multiple grand slam champion until this week when she demolished two in a row. On Thursday evening, finally, she stepped out onto the court against a top 10 opponent for just the second time of her life.</p> <p>Standing before Raducanu was Jessica Pegula, one of the most improved players in recent years, and on a cool night in Mason, Ohio the American gave an exhibition of the level required to hang with the very best players in the world as she ended Raducanu’s bright run at the Western and Southern Open. In an intense battle that demanded high octane first-strike tennis, Pegula’s greater firepower and consistency won out as she defeated Raducanu 7-5, 6-4 in the third round.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/18/misfiring-nick-kyrgios-bows-out-in-cincinnati-after-heavy-defeat-to-taylor-fritz\">Misfiring Nick Kyrgios bows out in Cincinnati after heavy defeat to Taylor Fritz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While Raducanu fell, Cameron Norrie continued his own brilliant run in Mason with a clean, efficient win. Despite his third round match being delayed late into the night, Norrie eased into the quarter-final by easily defeating 19-year-old American wildcard Ben Shelton 6-0, 6-2.</p> <p>Even in defeat, Raducanu took great satisfaction in her progress throughout her week, comparing the freedom she felt to her title run at the US Open. “I think that it is definitely relieving, because I feel like I’m swinging with the same sort of freedom as I probably had, more similar to last year,” she said. “So it feels really good. I think that I can really take it as a positive week, and I actually feel like I’m heading in a good direction again.”</p> <p>After<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/serena-williams-emma-raducanu-cincinatti-first-round\"> dominating Serena Williams 6-4, 6-0</a> and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/rampant-emma-raducanu-races-past-victoria-azarenka-in-cincinnati\"> Victoria Azarenka 6-0, 6-2</a>, a new challenge awaited Raducanu. Pegula may have none of the achievements of Raducanu’s prior opponents, but she has form. A late bloomer who has established herself inside the top 10 at the age of 28 after spending the majority of her career outside of the top 100, she is playing the best tennis of her life.</p> <p>Pegula is a clean, flat and early ball striker with a particularly searing forehand and those strengths have propelled her to seventh in the rankings and No 3 in the WTA race.</p> <p>She was determined to take control, stepping inside the baseline and lasering forehands all day. Raducanu initially responded well, suffocating Pegula’s weak second serves and trying to take the initiative herself. But Pegula’s greater raw power and security off both wings was a step above and at no point did her level drop.</p> <p>From her 10 straight-sets wins in New York to the beatdowns she inflicted on Williams and Azarenka, Raducanu had played very few tight, high quality matches with top players until Thursday night. Raducanu played fairly well herself, but Pegula played better.</p> <p>“She’s got, I don’t know, eight, nine years on me, so I think if I keep working and it’s great to have the exposure to these sort of opponents who have been out there for so long and doing these things day in and day out and see how they play, see how fast their ball comes,” said Raducanu.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"881027d826cb73bac2e1dc906332187fc1e3eff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881027d826cb73bac2e1dc906332187fc1e3eff4/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Pegula serves to Emma Raducanu at the Western and Southern Open.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Pegula serves to Emma Raducanu at the Western and Southern Open.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Dean/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Raducanu described her week in Cincinnati as a “great step” forward, with her making the decision to simply attack more without worrying about any negative consequences. “Recently I was kind of playing and hoping they would miss, and I was pushing the ball around a lot more, rather than this week I just was like, ‘Look, I’m just going to try, I don’t care if I make errors, it’s fine, but I’m just going to overhit if anything,” she said.</p> <p>With her latest defeat, the task of defending her US Open title is now upon Raducanu – the tournament is just 10 days away. It is far less daunting now. After an extremely positive tournament in which she defeated two big names before being outplayed by a top player in full flow, she will arrive there with a dramatically more positive outlook. Another valuable experience that will only help her growth.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Norrie arrived in his third round match with all of the experience against the NCAA champion, Shelton, who continued a breakout summer by beating fifth seed Casper Ruud in the previous round. Norrie offered him no real opportunities, neutralising his huge, lefty serve and pinning him behind the baseline.</p> <p>“He’s No 1 in the nation with college and I was previously No 1 so I know exactly how he’s feeling coming into these tournaments and beating players like myself,” said Norrie. “I really wanted to show them how tough it is on the tour. I wanted to go out and make it as tough as possible for him.”</p> <p>The next challenge for Norrie is an enormous one. He will face third seed Carlos Alcaraz for a place in the semi-finals. Alcaraz holds a 3-0 record over Norrie, although they played an extremely tight three-setter during the Spaniard’s run to the Madrid Open title. As Norrie began to describe the challenge before him, he simply shrugged: “Look, the kid’s a beast.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2022/aug/19/australians-buried-lede-on-morrison-begs-the-question-who-knew-what-when","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T01:54:13Z","webTitle":"The Australian’s buried scoop on Morrison raises the question: who knew what, when? | Weekly Beast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/19/australians-buried-lede-on-morrison-begs-the-question-who-knew-what-when","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/aug/19/australians-buried-lede-on-morrison-begs-the-question-who-knew-what-when","fields":{"headline":"The Australian’s buried scoop on Morrison raises the question: who knew what, when?","trailText":"Oz journalists criticised for sitting on dynamite revelations of grab for power for two years.

With the 2021 season postponed to the start of this year due to the pandemic, NRLW players are backing up only four months after they finished last season to do it all again.</p> <p>It may seem jarring, but for the players the short turnaround is a small price to pay for another season on the field and the increasing professionalism of the game. With the postponed Rugby League World Cup taking place in England just a few weeks after the end of this year’s second NRLW season, there is an extra layer of intrigue as the increased talent pool competes for Jillaroos places.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/grateful-just-to-be-here-womens-rugby-league-has-moved-well-beyond-that-kind-of-talk\">Grateful just to be here? Women’s rugby league has moved well beyond that kind of talk | Tiana Penitani</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although progress in the professionalisation of women’s sport has not yet resulted in equality between the men’s and women’s codes, Australia’s relatively early investment in women’s rugby league will be notable in the upcoming World Cup. The last tournament was held in 2017 – before the first season of the NRLW was played. The Jillaroos were dominant, going through undefeated, at a time when none of their players were competing in a professional domestic competition. After five seasons of the NRLW, their dominance could soon become devastating.</p> <p>A similar pattern has been seen in cricket, where Australia made early investment in the professionalisation of domestic and international players. Coming into the eighth season of the Women’s Big Bash League, the Australian team’s dominance on the international stage is yet to be reeled in.</p> <p>This is the trail that the NRLW is just beginning to blaze – one that creates an almost unbeatable legacy and forces other countries to take their women’s competitions seriously in order to even begin to dismantle Australia’s dominance. </p> <p>This past season highlighted the maturity of the competition, putting the foundations in place for this legacy to eventuate. For the first time the Brisbane Broncos not only missed out on the premiership, but failed to even qualify for the grand final. The increase to six teams succeeded in creating a more even talent spread, although two of the new teams in particular – the Newcastle Knights and Parramatta Eels – were not as competitive as the more established teams. </p> <p>However, after a season to settle into the competition and some key movements between clubs, the upcoming season looks set to be the closest yet. With joint Dally M winner Millie Boyle and star fullback Tamika Upton leaving the Broncos for the Knights, the Novocastrians have immediately acquired a lot more speed, power and momentum that may propel them into finals contention.</p> <p>The Eels have been a little quieter on the recruitment front, but a pair of cross-code athletes have stirred up some excitement in their preseason. Gayle Broughton comes into the NRLW as a rookie, but at 26 years old and with Olympic gold and silver medals in rugby sevens to her name, she is far from inexperienced. Brooke Walker meanwhile will enter her third professional sport. Walker has represented Australia in sevens and is also currently contracted to Carlton in the AFLW, in an incredibly rare straddling of the Barassi Line. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/i-love-my-muscles-nrlw-star-julia-robinson-calls-out-online-body-shamers\">‘I love my muscles’: NRLW star Julia Robinson calls out online body-shamers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The most anticipated clash of the season – the grand final rematch between the Roosters and the Dragons – has had an extra layer of excitement added as the NRL announced last week that the round three match will be shifted from Leichhardt Oval to become the first match played at the new Allianz Stadium as part of a double header with a men’s match between the Roosters and South Sydney Rabbitohs. </p> <p>It is an exciting opportunity for the players to break new ground, but it has left many fans of the women’s game disappointed, as tickets for the men’s match were already sold out before the NRLW venue change was announced. A relatively early Friday evening start time of 5:40pm means there is some work to be done at NRL headquarters to ensure the crowd is encouraged to arrive early for what is likely to be an enthralling contest.</p> <p>With the competition set to increase to 10 teams in 2023, there is little doubt this second 2022 season will be captivating. The teams will be eyeing off this season as their best chance to win a premiership – before the four new teams enter the arena and begin snaffling talent. While professional women’s rugby league is still in its early stages, the contests over the next seven weeks will pave the way for that enduring legacy that has the potential to shape the international game for years to come.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/18/los-angeles-school-lawsuit-picking-cotton-slavery","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T01:26:47Z","webTitle":"Black parent sues after Los Angeles school project had students pick cotton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/los-angeles-school-lawsuit-picking-cotton-slavery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/los-angeles-school-lawsuit-picking-cotton-slavery","fields":{"headline":"Black parent sues after Los Angeles school project had students pick cotton","trailText":"The lawsuit against LA Unified says Rashunda Pitts’ daughter was humiliated by the lesson that was intended to teach about slavery","byline":"Dani Anguiano in Los Angeles","body":"<p>Los Angeles Unified, America’s second largest school district, is facing a civil rights lawsuit from a Black parent who says her daughter’s school taught students about slavery by having them pick cotton.</p> <p>Rashunda Pitts sued the school district and staff members at Laurel Span school in response to the incident that, according to the lawsuit, humiliated her daughter and left the now 14-year-old with extreme emotional distress and anxiety.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/11/louisisana-kindergarten-class-kicked-out-parents-same-sex-couple\"> Louisiana child kicked out of class because parents are same-sex couple</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The incident occurred in October 2017, according to the lawsuit, when Pitts spotted a cotton field at her daughter’s Hollywood school. She contacted school officials who informed her that her daughter’s class was reading the autobiography of Frederick Douglass and that the field had been planted to give the students “‘real life experience’ of what it was like to be a slave by ‘picking cotton’”, the lawsuit says.</p> <p>After Pitts shared her concerns that the project was “culturally insensitive”, school officials agreed, according to the suit. School leaders said they would remove the field but that they couldn’t do so within 24 hours as Pitts had requested, and that they would aim to by the end of the week or the following.</p> <p>But the school misrepresented that conversation in a statement to the press that contradicted what officials told Pitts, the lawsuit alleges, and sought to “cover up the discriminatory conduct”.</p> <p>“We regret that an instructional activity in the garden at Laurel School was construed as culturally insensitive,” the school said, adding that “tending to the garden” with fruits and vegetables had been a longtime tradition and was not used for historical reenactments. “When school administrators became aware of a parent’s concern about the cotton plant, they responded immediately by removing the plant.”</p> <p>Pitts’s daughter, who she says had become “quiet and reserved” in the weeks leading up to the incident, said she was afraid to tell her mother about the project because she feared her teachers would become upset and possibly “retaliate”, according to the suit.</p> <p>Her teacher did not require her to pick cotton, she told her mother, but she watched other students do so and “discussion of the project in school terrified her and she [was] horrified at the idea of having to ‘pick cotton’”. The school failed to ask parents for permission for the project, the suit says, or inform them.</p> <p>Pitts alleges the project, and the school’s response, amount to discrimination against her daughter on the basis of her race and sex. “She has uncontrollable anxiety attacks and has [experienced] bouts of depression when she thinks about the Cotton Picking Project,” the lawsuit states.</p> <p>Neither Pitts’s attorney nor Los Angeles Unified school district immediately responded to requests for comment.</p> <p>Similar projects around teaching slavery in schools have attracted widespread outrage.

He knows the love, respect, reverence of a prophet that lives in our hearts. He knew that,” Khan said. “So the anger I understood, but you can’t justify what happened.”</p> <h2>‘The Afghan people will assert their rights’</h2> <p>A year ago, Khan caused consternation in the west and among many Afghans when he welcomed the Taliban’s seizure of power, saying it was “breaking the chains of slavery”. He defended the Taliban’s treatment of women and girls, describing it as a local “cultural norm” and noting: “Every society’s idea of human rights and women rights are different.”</p> <p>One year on, women remain excluded from the Afghan workforce and girls over 14 are still banned from attending school. Khan however insisted that change had to come from within Afghanistan.</p> <p>“Eventually Afghan women, the Afghan people, will assert their rights. They are strong people,” he said. “But if you push the Taliban from the outside, knowing their mindset, they will just put up defences. They just hate outside interference.”</p> <p>Since losing a vote of no confidence in April, Khan said his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), had been the target of efforts by the new government and the security forces aimed at pushing it off the political stage.</p> <p>A top aide, Shahbaz Gill, was arrested on Tuesday and was hospitalised while in custody. Khan said he was beaten and “psychologically broken”.</p> <p>The Islamabad police said that Gill was arrested for inciting the public against state institutions, and “inciting the people to rebellion”. Khan said Gill was targeted because he had said army officers should not obey unlawful commands.</p> <p>“They are forcing him to say that I was the one who told him to say that,” the former prime minister said.</p> <p>A medical report on Gill said that he had arrived at the hospital with rapid breathing, noting that he was asthmatic. It also referred to “body aches” and “soft tissue tenderness” on his arm, lower back and buttock. He was reported late on Thursday to have been discharged from hospital and to be back in custody.</p> <p>The television channel that interviewed Gill prior to his arrest, ARY, has been shut down in some parts of the country.</p> <p>Khan said Gill’s arrest and the closure of ARY was part of a pattern under the current government of Shehbaz Sharif, who replaced Khan as prime minister.</p> <p>“What they’re doing to Gill is sending a message to everyone,” he said. “And they have scared our workers. Social media activists have been picked up and we have a very vibrant social media. They’re trying to sort of intimidate the people.”</p> <p>Pakistan also had a poor human rights record under Khan’s tenure, from 2018 to April this year, with extrajudicial killings of dissidents and frequent threats against journalists, especially female reporters who faced torrents of sexual abuse on social media.</p> <p>Khan blamed the excesses and disappearances on the counter-insurgency tactics of the security forces.</p> <p> “They were responsible for picking up people, but according to them they were involved in this insurgency, which was going on in Balochistan and the tribal area bordering Afghanistan. So they would blame that, with some justification, because you could not convict terrorists in the courts because you wouldn’t get witnesses,” Khan said.</p> <p>“In my time, we never tried to oppress the media. The only problem was that sometimes the … security agencies – three or four times we found out that picked someone up and immediately when we found out we would immediately have them released,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65100998c5761be95ba43a647e9eaf62be5a2fdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65100998c5761be95ba43a647e9eaf62be5a2fdc/0_0_3500_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pakistan’s former prime minister Imran Khan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pakistan’s former prime minister Imran Khan blamed the security forces for human rights abuses during his reign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saiyna Bashir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The free press advocacy organisation Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said the litany of abuses under Khan’s government was “endless”. But it added there was a new campaign to intimidate critical journalists.</p> <p>“There has been no let-up in the harassment of journalists since Khan’s replacement by Sharif as prime minister – quite the contrary,” RSF said in a statement.</p> <p>Khan is also facing a case against the PTI by the country’s election commission for illegal foreign campaign contributions. He did not deny the allegations but dismissed the case as politically motivated, saying rival parties, such as Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N), had not faced similar scrutiny.</p> <p>One of the founding members of PTI, Akbar Babar, filed a case against the party in November 2014, claiming irregularities in the handling of roughly $3m in foreign funding. Last month the Election Commission of Pakistan ruled that the PTI had received prohibited funding. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has been tasked to further investigate and the commission has summoned Khan on Tuesday. Experts say Khan can be banned from politics or his party can be banned if charges are proven.</p> <p>Khan blamed Washington for engineering the vote of no confidence that brought down his government, suggesting the US had helped persuade members of his party to defect.</p> <p>He has also blamed Pakistan’s military, which has long acted as kingmaker in the country’s political life. He was more circumspect in accusing the security forces in his interview with the Guardian, but said: “If they were not behind the conspiracy, they certainly could have stopped it because the intelligence agencies, the ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence] and MI [Military Intelligence], are international-quality intelligence agencies, and they certainly would have known what was going on.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/19/im-single-and-36-do-i-continue-to-focus-on-myself-prioritise-dating-or-resort-to-egg-freezing","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T00:57:25Z","webTitle":"I’m single and 36.

Ayahuasca in a jungle isn’t anything compared with birth, she said: if you love meeting new people wait until you see someone learn to talk. Like so many other parents, she hadn’t known what she’d find.</p> <p>That can make it feel it’s impossible to make the right decision. You asked how to work out your next steps – perhaps letting go of the notion of a “right” decision might be a helpful place to start. It sounds as though you have a lot of options, each simultaneously good and bad: that combination can make us feel under enormous pressure. As if there is one single choice which would deliver a wholly contented life, if only we could figure out which one it is. Decision panic tends to arise when each of our options have some appeal: it isn’t about avoiding an intolerable outcome but avoiding the sense that things could have been better. What strange creatures we are, that having a multitude of options with joys in each can feel like torment instead of relief.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/saved-for-later\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Saved for Later\" data-form-description=\"Weekly lifestyle and culture picks from Guardian Australia\" data-form-campaign-code=\"UK_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Get a week’s worth of must-reads, trends and pop-culture in your inbox\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sense that you can get it “right” is in some ways illusory; there’s no door behind which the right version of your life is waiting. There will be pain and joy in all possible futures – if you are a parent you will have moments where the other path seems to glow with freedom, and if you’re child-free you may wonder what could have been.</p> <p>But the joys we might have had shouldn’t distract us from the ones we have – it sounds as though you have a fulfilling and full life with a career and a strong sense of self; the question may not be how to get the right answer to this question, but how to find the space to celebrate the fact that each of your options contains a life you’d be proud to live. Perhaps in releasing some pressure to make the best decision, you’d be pleasantly surprised by how many you could love.</p> <p><em>This letter has been edited for length.</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Ask us a question</h2> <p>Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

The other affects WebKit, the underlying technology of the Safari web browser.</p> <p>For each of the bugs, the company said it was “aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited,” though it provided no further details. It credited an anonymous researcher or researchers for disclosing both.</p> <p>Anyone with an iPhone released since 2015, an iPad released since 2014 or a Mac running macOS Monterey can download the update by opening up the settings menu on their mobile device, or choosing “software update” on the “about this Mac” menu on their computer.</p> <p>Rachel Tobac, the CEO of SocialProof Security, said Apple’s explanation of the vulnerability meant a hacker could get “full admin access to the device” so that they can “execute any code as if they are you, the user”.</p> <p>Those who should be particularly attentive to updating their software are “people who are in the public eye”, such as activists or journalists who might be the targets of sophisticated nation-state spying, Tobac said.</p> <p>Until the fix was released on Wednesday, the vulnerabilities will have been classed as “zero-day” bugs, because there has been a fix available for them for zero days. Such weaknesses are hugely valuable on the open market, where cyberweapon brokers will buy them for hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars.</p> <p>The broker Zerodium, for instance, will pay “up to $500,000” for a security weakness that can be used to hack a user through Safari, and up to $2m for a fully developed piece of malware that can hack an iPhone without a user needing to click on anything. The company says its customers for such weaknesses are “government institutions (mainly from Europe and North America)”.</p> <p>Commercial spyware companies such as Israel’s NSO Group are known for identifying and taking advantage of such flaws, exploiting them in malware that surreptitiously infects targets’ smartphones, siphons their contents and surveils the targets in real time.</p> <p>NSO Group has been blacklisted by the US commerce department. Its spyware is known to have been used in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America against journalists, dissidents and human rights activists.</p> <p>Will Strafach, a security researcher, said he had seen no technical analysis of the vulnerabilities that Apple has just patched. The company has previously acknowledged similarly serious flaws and, on what Strafach estimated to be perhaps a dozen occasions, has noted that it was aware of reports that such security holes had been exploited.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/solomon-islands-secures-100m-china-loan-to-build-huawei-mobile-towers-in-historic-step","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T00:43:02Z","webTitle":"Solomon Islands secures $100m China loan to build Huawei mobile towers in historic step","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/solomon-islands-secures-100m-china-loan-to-build-huawei-mobile-towers-in-historic-step","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/solomon-islands-secures-100m-china-loan-to-build-huawei-mobile-towers-in-historic-step","fields":{"headline":"Solomon Islands secures $100m China loan to build Huawei mobile towers in historic step","trailText":"This will be the first loan from China since the Pacific country switched allegiance from Taiwan in 2019","byline":"Georgina Kekea in Honiara","body":"<p>The Solomon Islands government has secured a $66m (A$96m) loan from China to build 161 mobile communication towers, which will be built and supplied by Chinese telco giant Huawei.</p> <p>It is the Pacific country’s first loan from Beijing since it switched diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China in 2019 and is a significant bilateral development between the two countries, which signed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/the-deal-that-shocked-the-world-inside-the-china-solomons-security-pact\">secretive and controversial security deal</a> earlier this year.</p> <p>The Huawei move was celebrated by the Solomon Islands government as “a historical financial partnership” between the two countries that would “work closely to ensure the successful implementation … of the project”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/09/bill-to-delay-solomon-islands-election-until-december-2023-prompts-concern\">Bill to delay Solomon Islands election until December 2023 prompts concern</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The loan will come from the Exim Bank of China, which has offered a 1% interest rate.</p> <p>The use of Huawei in building and supplying the towers will alarm some in Australia, which has banned Huawei from government contracts to build infrastructure in Australia, citing security concerns.</p> <p>Huawei has become something of a global pariah amid security concerns over its links to the ruling Chinese communist government.

Once work on the Tina Hydro Project kicks in, the government’s debt to GDP will reach 30%. With the inclusion of the concessional loan from the Exim Bank of China, this will further increase the government debt to GDP percentage.

The Brazilian will be hoping to start against Wolves and his inclusion in the lineup could well spell disappointment for Son. Fitness permitting, Clément Lenglet is likely to fill in for the injured Cristian Romero and, with Sessegnon looking a good bet to make way for Ivan Perisic, Tottenham’s uncharacteristically early transfer dealings are already looking as sensible as they are shrewd. A second-half replacement for Hwang Hee-chan in his side’s scoreless draw against Fulham, it would also be no surprise to see Gonçalo Guedes make his first start for Wolves, and fellow big-money recruit Matheus Nunes could also feature. <strong>BG</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Tottenham v Wolves, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>2) Trio of Arsenal victories long overdue</h2> <p>The last time Arsenal won their opening three matches of the league season, they were in the middle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/may/16/newsstory.premierleague200304\">a 49-match unbeaten run</a>. At the start of the 2004-05 season, as Arsène Wenger’s side breezed past Everton, Middlesbrough and Blackburn by an aggregate scoreline of 12-4, few would have predicted that it would take (at least) 18 years for them to make such a strong start again. The list of Arsenal goalscorers across those three games reads like a truncated roll call of the club’s greatest players of the 21st century: Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Freddie Ljungberg, Robert Pires, José Antonio Reyes and Cesc Fàbregas, then still a goofy teenage prodigy. No pressure, then, on Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli. Arsenal finished second that season but, if they beat Bournemouth on Saturday, they are guaranteed to end the day top of the table. <strong>WM</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Bournemouth v Arsenal, Saturday 5.30pm</em></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aea169604c2312ad938fd97e9362a37f45c31908\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aea169604c2312ad938fd97e9362a37f45c31908/0_0_4780_3494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Granit Xhaka after scoring against Leicester last weekend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"731\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Granit Xhaka celebrates after scoring against Leicester last weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Howe’s defensive plan against champions</h2> <p>Pep Guardiola’s ominous warning that his already formidable Manchester City striker Erling Haaland is “step by step, only going to get better” has focused Newcastle fans’ minds on Eddie Howe’s likely defensive configuration on Sunday. Does the manager stick with his preferred back four and, if so, who out of Sven Botman, Dan Burn and Fabian Schär will drop to the bench? Last week all three played in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/brighton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">the 0-0 draw at Brighton</a>, but that was only because Burn switched to left-back to replace Matt Targett. On Sunday, though, Targett is expected to be fit enough for restoration to full-back, leaving Howe with a dilemma. He will surely plump for Schär and Botman, if only as that creates a nice right-footed/left-footed equilibrium. With Botman and Burn both left-footed, the dangers of a central defensive imbalance appear too great to risk. Alternatively, Howe could field a 3-4-3 formation featuring Kieran Trippier and Targett as wing-backs. <strong>LT</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Newcastle v Manchester City, Sunday 4.30pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>4) Onana, that’s the game</h2> <p>In the absence of a point or a goalscorer – it is now 50 days since Richarlison was sold to Tottenham – the prospect of Amadou Onana making his full Everton debut against Nottingham Forest captures the imagination at Goodison Park. The midfielder, a recent £33m signing from Lille, made a brief but highly eventful introduction to the Premier League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/aston-villa-everton-premier-league-match-report\">at Aston Villa last weekend</a>. Replacing Conor Coady in the 81st minute, he lost possession in the buildup to Villa’s winner in the 86th, created a consolation seconds later and went close to salvaging an unlikely draw in stoppage time. Frank Lampard absolved the Belgian of blame for Villa’s second goal – “I want midfield players that want to receive the ball and play forward,” the manager said – and Onana, who had barely trained for 10 days before the game while his transfer went through, certainly offered a glimpse of the dynamic midfield presence that Everton crave. <strong>AH</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Everton v Nottingham Forest, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>5) Soucek key to Hammers’ hopes</h2> <p>West Ham’s desire to add more dynamism to their midfield is no secret. They have looked at several players this summer, but change is yet to arrive. Flynn Downes, signed from Swansea, is one for the future and, with the chase for a domineering new midfielder proving frustrating, David Moyes still finds himself leaning on Tomas Soucek amid doubts over the Czech Republic international’s future. The situation is not ideal and Moyes needs Soucek to up his game when West Ham, who have lost their first two matches, host Brighton on Sunday. It is a huge test. Brighton’s flexible midfield will pose plenty of problems and West Ham will struggle if Soucek, who can be vulnerable against a high press, is off the pace. Declan Rice cannot do it alone. Soucek, whose scoring threat diminished last season, has to put himself about and find a way of rediscovering his form. <strong>JS</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5009b5618edd104450f453d4cacdfec3eb44231b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5009b5618edd104450f453d4cacdfec3eb44231b/0_254_2460_1789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tomas Soucek during training on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tomas Soucek during training on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Griffiths/West Ham United/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5.1) Taylor unfairly in spotlight</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/thomas-tuchel-suggests-anthony-taylor-should-not-referee-chelsea-again\">Thomas Tuchel’s lament</a> regarding the performance of the referee Anthony Taylor prompted a pile-on from the more paranoid, unhinged and entitled elements of Chelsea’s fanbase, more than 140,000 of whom have since signed a petition calling for the official to be precluded from taking charge of one of their fixtures ever again. Taylor will find himself unfairly placed in the spotlight when he officiates this match, his every decision subjected to intense scrutiny so that any small error can be pounced upon as “evidence” that he is in some way incompetent or corrupt. Even in the Premier League referees don’t get paid enough to put up with this sort of bullying and harassment. Until the serial whiners among the management ranks start getting properly punished with massive fines, suspensions or stadium bans, these officials – without whom the game cannot be played – would be well within their rights to down their whistles and go on strike. <strong>BG</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>West Ham v Brighton, Sunday 2.30pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>6) Bamford overshadowing any contretemps?</h2> <p>After last weekend’s technical area altercation with Tottenham’s Antonio Conte, goodness knows how Tuchel will react to Jesse Marsch at Elland Road. Away from the pitch the Leeds manager is open, engaging and unfailingly courteous but, down on the touchline, Marsch sometimes seems to think he is still the pesky enforcer he once was as a player. Such lightly controlled aggression does not always go down too well with his managerial counterparts, so an intriguing subplot could centre on the dugouts. Patrick Bamford will hope to pass a fitness test in time to eclipse thoroughly such a sideshow, though. Marsch’s key striker always aims to impress – and never more so than against the club which employed him between 2012 and 2017, in which time he appeared for six different teams during assorted loan stints while failing to make a single first-team appearance in a Chelsea shirt. <strong>LT</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Leeds v Chelsea, Sunday 2pm</em></p></li> </ul> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2022/aug/16/david-squires-on-antonio-conte-thomas-tuchel-and-ha-ha-land-premier-league\">David Squires on … Antonio Conte, Thomas Tuchel and Ha Ha Land</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>7) One man’s misery is one Mings’ chance</h2> <p>Having stripped Tyrone Mings of the Aston Villa captaincy and left him on the bench for their season opener, Steven Gerrard raised quizzical eyebrows when he picked the England international to start against Everton last weekend. While those outside the Villa camp can only speculate over the healthiness of Gerrard’s relationship with his former captain, the long-term achilles injury <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/15/diego-carlos-ruptured-achilles-aston-villa-centre-back\">suffered by Diego Carlos</a> ought to mean Mings features more prominently in his manager’s plans than he might have expected to a fortnight ago. The absence of Diego Carlos should prompt the return of Ezri Konsa to Villa’s starting lineup when they rock up at Crystal Palace, while the lesser-spotted Calum Chambers is also available for a recall. <strong>BG</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Crystal Palace v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>8) Barnes back to lift Leicester</h2> <p>For Leicester, good news has been in short supply of late but the return of Harvey Barnes from a knee injury has given Brendan Rodgers a timely boost. Leicester are yet to sign a senior outfield player this summer, while Barnes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/18/wesley-fofana-leicester-will-not-play-chelsea-interest-distraction-brendan-rodgers\">Wesley Fofana</a> and James Maddison have been the subject of inquiries from rival clubs this summer. There could be more positives if Leicester reach a deal with Maddison over a new deal, with the club keen to avoid a repeat of the situation they find themselves in with Youri Tielemans, who is out of contract next summer. “Both sides have to be able to find an agreement,” Rodgers said. “With James, with two years left, naturally the club would want to protect the asset. But it works both ways. Sometimes, everything goes on to the club. If a player – not saying James – doesn’t want to sign it, then it can be a stalemate.” <strong>BF</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Leicester City v Southampton, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07f5dd7460079e51e00bc694e7f95c9745a6afce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07f5dd7460079e51e00bc694e7f95c9745a6afce/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brendan Rodgers facing the media on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brendan Rodgers facing the media on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Battle of the forwards by the Thames</h2> <p>Fulham will be hoping it’s a case of “after the lord mayor’s show” for Brentford when they visit Craven Cottage a week after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/brentford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">their humiliation of Manchester United</a>. While this west London match-up may lack the spice of more high-profile derbies, Marco Silva was critical of his players’ lack of first-half intensity on a sweltering afternoon at Molineux. We can expect them to come roaring out of the traps in a match that could hinge on the respective performances of the rival centre-forwards, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ivan Toney. After his opening-day double, Mitrovic will be eager to make up for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/wolves-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">last week’s penalty miss</a>. Interestingly, Fulham’s designated penalty taker has missed nine out of 31 career spot-kicks, while Toney has a vastly superior record of just one miss from 24. <strong>BG</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Fulham v Brentford, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>10) Liverpool’s trip to basement boys</h2> <p>Forget a win or a draw, can Manchester United summon a credible performance in their third game of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/erik-ten-hag-makes-united-players-train-on-day-off-after-heavy-defeat\">already listing campaign</a>? With Liverpool their Monday evening visitors the obvious answer may be no, but as Jürgen Klopp’s team have drawn their first two games, maybe there is a glimmer of hope for Erik ten Hag’s side. While the United manager should not have to gee up his thus-far dismal players for a meeting with their arch-rivals, the same equation is true for Klopp, already four points behind Manchester City after only 180 minutes of football. Expect Cristiano Ronaldo to start once more despite his desire to leave, and for United’s fragile confidence to crumble should Liverpool get an early goal. If that occurs then the Old Trafford crowd will have to find its voice to try to offer what their team lacks badly: belief. <strong>JJ</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Manchester United v Liverpool,

Pass rumbling machinery and then descend 1,025 metres underground.</p> \n<p>The office in question is the only one of its kind in the southern hemisphere: the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory (SUPL), where researchers will hunt for dark matter, the invisible substance thought to comprise about 85% of the matter in the universe.</p> \n<p>The lab is officially open, and Guardian Australia recently visited with Prof Elisabetta Barberio, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Dark Matter Particle Physics.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/oct/10/waiting-for-a-ghost-the-search-for-dark-matter-1km-under-an-australian-town\">‘Waiting for a ghost’: the search for dark matter 1km under an Australian town</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is a half-hour descent via four-wheel drive, deep in the bowels of a working gold mine. John Bourne, the mine’s underground operational superintendent, steers us down a narrow tunnel, past pools of grey dripping wastewater, whirring fans that circulate air, and the remains of a historical shaft from the 19th century, with collapsed wooden beams and rusted metal. (The town of Stawell was founded in 1853, during the Victorian gold rush.) The miners are on lunch break – or, as they call it, crib – so there is less traffic underground than usual.</p> \n<p>Numbers scrawled onto the walls mark how deep we have descended. Bourne, who has been at Stawell since 1995, says the mine bottoms out at 1,640 metres, but is flooded at depths beneath the physics lab. “The lowest we work down to [for gold] is probably 400 to 500 metres,” he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"920cf0a969b3f8181b789f9ddee4a244c63e2218\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/920cf0a969b3f8181b789f9ddee4a244c63e2218/0_0_3500_2302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Elisabetta Barberio in the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory with a Sabre mock-up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Elisabetta Barberio with a mock-up of a Sabre, a sodium iodide core that will detect dark matter.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penny Stephens/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Halfway to the lab, Bourne stops the car and turns all the lights off. Our eyes try and fail to adjust to the darkness – it is overwhelming, almost solid, and it is difficult not to think about the hundreds of metres of rock above separating us from clear sky.</p> \n<p>This dark place is a fitting location to hunt for dark matter. Even though we can’t see it, “we are surrounded by dark matter all the time,” says Barberio, a physicist at the University of Melbourne.</p> \n<p>What exactly is it? Scientists are not entirely sure. They know dark matter is something that has mass, but does not absorb, emit or reflect light. They think it must hardly interact with ordinary matter – the visible stuff that we, Earth, stars and galaxies are made of. But if it does, Barberio and her colleagues want to see it. They are setting up a dark matter detector deep underground, where it will be shielded by rock against cosmic rays – high-energy particles from outside our solar system that rain down on Earth.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"548920313367c3e3f3f9085a0f14d250f3736cf0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/548920313367c3e3f3f9085a0f14d250f3736cf0/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Elisabetta Barberio near the entrance to the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Elisabetta Barberio near the laboratory entrance.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penny Stephens/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d86c092538fd8e5a96d808ac6ca9702155f90f33\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d86c092538fd8e5a96d808ac6ca9702155f90f33/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Superintendant of Mining John Bourne driving the vehicle to the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Bourne drives through the Stawell gold mine to the lab.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penny Stephens/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When we arrive at the lab’s entrance, the tunnel opens out into a high-ceilinged cavern. Above ground, it is a sunny, cloudless winter day – a brisk 11C. Below, it is balmy and the air is thick with humidity. The deeper underground you go, the hotter it gets – heat flows from the Earth’s interior toward its surface.</p> \n<p>Outside the lab, the ground is uneven and rocky, and our boots kick up dust with every step. Inside the lab, there are clean, bright cement floors and, surprisingly, air conditioning. We enter into a large rectangular room with ceilings around 12 metres high. It has all the makings of a regular laboratory: gas and electricity lines, a drainage area and shower for chemical spills. On the far side of the room, Barberio points out a nine-tonne overhead crane under which the detector will be mounted.</p> \n<p>The detector will consist of seven cylinders of sodium iodide crystal, encapsulated in copper tubes. These will be submerged in a liquid called benzene, and encased in 200 tonnes of steel.</p> \n<p>The aim is to detect a theoretical particle of dark matter known as a wimp – a weakly interacting massive particle. The idea is that a collision between a wimp – theorised to be around the size of an atom – and ordinary matter<strong> </strong>would result in energy detectable as light. The sodium iodide crystal should, in theory, flash if dark matter collides with it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"256eee3916e12013892ed6535d98f04da7a366a3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/256eee3916e12013892ed6535d98f04da7a366a3/0_0_3500_2125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Entrance of the Stawell gold mine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"607\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The laboratory is a half-hour descent via four-wheel drive deep in the bowels of the Stawell gold mine.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penny Stephens/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"740659b570f77a9537b796e2c39cd69b0ce984eb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/740659b570f77a9537b796e2c39cd69b0ce984eb/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The underground road into the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The underground road into the lab.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penny Stephens/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If an experiment like this were to take place on the surface of the Earth, Barberio says, the noise from cosmic radiation would drown out any true interactions between dark matter and the detector.</p> \n<p>Once the detector is running, staff will have to remove their safety gear and shower on entry, to minimise potential sources of radioactivity. Machinery will be vacuumed down to remove dust. The walls of the lab – bumpy and slightly soft to the touch – have been sprayed with shotcrete, a sealant which minimises the emission of radon, a radioactive gas, from the underlying rock. Will anything be banned from entry? “Bananas!” Barberio exclaims. Rich in potassium, they are slightly radioactive.</p> \n<h2>Trial and error</h2> \n<p>While astrophysicists can calculate how much dark matter there should be at large scale – within a galaxy, say – they are less certain about the size of each individual particle of dark matter. Think of it like estimating the number of jelly beans in a jar of known size – but you cannot see the jelly beans, and also are not sure how big they are.</p> \n<p>Detecting dark matter requires some trial and error, Barberio says. “If you can think about a billiard ball [representing an atom of ordinary matter] and your dark matter is another billiard ball … if [one] is too small, you will not be able to move the other, so you will not produce a signal.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"915c4e8c5d5c9266a8a324b1937087e40a8d9eb6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/915c4e8c5d5c9266a8a324b1937087e40a8d9eb6/0_0_3500_2258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mock-up of a Sabre (a sodium iodide core that will detect dark matter)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mock-up of a Sabre, a sodium iodide core that will detect dark matter.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penny Stephens/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Across the country, a separate experiment known as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/this-australian-experiment-is-on-the-hunt-for-an-elusive-particle-that-could-help-unlock-the-mystery-of-dark-matter-187014\">Organ</a> is hunting for an even smaller theoretical particle of dark matter. This particle, known as an axion, would be billions of times lighter than a wimp, says Dr Ben McAllister at the University of Western Australia.</p> \n<p>While the Stawell underground experiment is trying to observe collisions between dark and ordinary matter, axion detection aims to directly convert dark matter into light, McAllister says. Organ, Australia’s first dark matter detector, has already been able to <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq3765\">rule out the existence</a> of axions of certain sizes.</p> \n<p>There is evidence for dark matter in the movement of galaxies including our own. Most galaxies rotate too fast for the gravity only to come from ordinary matter, the theory goes, so there must be something invisible holding them together. Dark matter is like a “cosmic ghost”, McAllister says. “We can’t see, touch or feel it, but we can sense that it’s there.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Australia Weekend signup\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>“We’ve got computers, we’ve got modern medicine, we’ve got spaceships … We built all that stuff understanding just one-sixth of the matter in the universe.

The Italian project claims to have detected dark matter, but its findings have been controversial.</p> \n<p>The Italian detector has picked up a fluctuating signal that peaks each June and wanes in December, thought to correspond with Earth passing through a theoretical halo of dark matter. The direction of Earth’s orbit means its velocity in the galaxy also peaks in June – the faster Earth moves, the thinking goes, the more dark matter particles you detect.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b7c461fc32711b3cddf03f71f05eaf52eff9d5b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b7c461fc32711b3cddf03f71f05eaf52eff9d5b/0_0_3500_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Looking into the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory from the anteroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looking into the underground lab from the anteroom.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penny Stephens/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Other scientists are highly sceptical.

Doctors do not know the exact causes of cancer, and not every case or death is avoidable, but there are risk factors that can increase people’s chance of developing it.</p> <p>Now researchers at the University of Washington’s school of medicine have become the first to work out how risk factors contribute to cancer deaths globally.</p> <p>Smoking, alcohol use, and a high body mass index (BMI) are the biggest contributors. In total, risk factors are responsible for nearly 4.45m cancer deaths a year, according to the findings published in the Lancet that used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2019 study.</p> <p>That represents 44.4% of all cancer deaths worldwide. Half of all male cancer deaths in 2019 (50.6%, or 2.88m) were due to estimated risk factors, compared with more than a third of all female cancer deaths (36.3%, or 1.58m).<br><br>“This study illustrates that the burden of cancer remains an important public health challenge that is growing in magnitude around the world,” said Dr Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s school of medicine and a co-senior author of the study.</p> <p>“Smoking continues to be the leading risk factor for cancer globally, with other substantial contributors to cancer burden varying. Our findings can help policymakers and researchers identify key risk factors that could be targeted in efforts to reduce deaths and ill health from cancer regionally, nationally, and globally.”</p> <p>The leading risk factors globally for cancer deaths for both sexes were smoking, followed by alcohol use and high BMI.</p> <p>The biggest cause of risk-attributable cancer deaths for both women and men globally was tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer. These account for 36.9% of all cancer deaths attributable to risk factors.</p> <p>This was followed by cervical cancer (17.9%), colon and rectum cancer (15.8%) and breast cancer (11%) in women. In men, it was colon and rectum cancer (13.3%), oesophageal cancer (9.7%) and stomach cancer (6.6%).</p> <p>The five regions with the highest cancer death rates owing to risk factors were central Europe (82 deaths per 100,000 population), east Asia (69.8 per 100,000), high-income North America (66 per 100,000), southern Latin America (64.2 per 100,000) and western Europe (63.8 per 100,000).</p> <p>While not all cases or deaths are preventable, Cancer Research UK, the world’s largest independent cancer research organisation, says stopping smoking, cutting back on alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, enjoying the sun safely and eating a balanced diet can all improve the odds in your favour.</p> <p>Writing in a linked comment, Prof Diana Sarfati and Dr Jason Gurney of the University of Otago, New Zealand, who were not involved in the study, said preventing cancer by eradicating or reducing exposure to risk factors was “our best hope of reducing the future burden of cancer”.</p> <p>“Reducing this burden will improve health and wellbeing, and alleviate the compounding effects on humans and the fiscal resourcing pressure within cancer services and the wider health sector,” they said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/18/instagram-facebook-suspend-robert-kennedy-jr-anti-vax","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T22:15:53Z","webTitle":"Instagram and Facebook suspend Robert Kennedy Jr’s anti-vaccine group","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/instagram-facebook-suspend-robert-kennedy-jr-anti-vax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/instagram-facebook-suspend-robert-kennedy-jr-anti-vax","fields":{"headline":"Instagram and Facebook suspend Robert Kennedy Jr’s anti-vaccine group","trailText":"Critics calls move ‘too late too little’ after group repeatedly violated policies on Covid-19 misinformation","byline":"Staff and agencies","body":"<p>Instagram and Facebook have suspended a prominent anti-vaccine group led by Robert Kennedy Jr for repeatedly violating rules prohibiting misinformation about Covid-19.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/cdc-reset-covid-director-rochelle-walensky\">CDC director calls for ‘reset’ of agency amid criticism of Covid response</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The non-profit, Children’s Health Defense (CHD), is one of the most influential anti-vaccine organizations active on social media, where it has spread misleading claims about vaccines and other pandemic-related public health measures.</p> <p>Kennedy, a leading anti-vaxxer, has attracted controversy for repeatedly sharing falsehoods and was himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/10/instagram-removes-anti-vaxxer-robert-f-kennedy-jr\">booted from</a> Instagram in 2021.

She takes us to a 17th-century tale of Ayrshire witchcraft even as she makes use of PowerPoint presentations and improvised music.</p> <p>It is a fertile approach, one that gives a current edge to the story-book narrative. That is important because With the Devil’s Assistance is rather less about supernatural powers than it is about entrepreneurial women. It is to do with women’s marginalisation and repression – something reflected in the vast preponderance of women on her list of those executed for witchcraft around her native Ayr.</p> <p>The first surprise is that a show about <a href=\"https://southayrshirehistory.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/ayrs-mystery-witch-the-legend-of-maggie-osborne\">Maggie Osborne</a>, supposedly burned at the stake for indulging in the dark arts, begins with a lesson on Britain’s declining high streets. Chatting chirpily to the audience – even recording their responses – Cowie shows pictures of boarded-up shopfronts, closed metal shutters and lifeless town centres as she sounds the alarm bell for economic collapse.</p> <p>The connection she makes to the ghoulish past is via Marks &amp; Spencer in modern-day Ayr. It is, she amusingly suggests, just the kind of shop Maggie Osborne would have loved. More to the point, it is on the site of an inn known as Maggie Osborne’s House, which, legend has it, this shape-shifting woman erected in a single night with the help of the devil.</p> <p>Adopting the tone of the traditional storyteller, accompanied by accordionist, singer and pianist Neil Sutcliffe, she nonetheless defies convention by highlighting the mix of hearsay, suspicion and unsubstantiated evidence that could be enough to convict a woman whose real crime, she suggests, was not to use hidden powers to set off a fatal avalanche, but to brew her own ale and run a successful business.

I thought it was really good cricket from South Africa to realise conditions had changed and they could get on top and attack us a little bit.

Guys are wanting each other to do well, that’s what our team spirit is about.</p> <p>“We’re in a good position at the moment, we’re full of confidence, and we’ve got a bit of momentum with that partnership at the back end.

There <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/22/pamela-moses-prosecutor-drops-charges-memphis-tennessee\">have been</a> several examples, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/florida-felonies-voter-fraud\">including in Florida</a>, of illegal voting cases involving people who had been convicted of felonies that turn out to be people who were confused. People with felonies can make easy targets for prosecutors looking to make a voter fraud case since they are already being monitored.</p> <p>DeSantis used a press conference in Broward county on Thursday to champion the work of the office of election crimes and security, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/10/florida-election-crimes-office-voting-rights\">first-of-its-kind</a> office created this year and charged with investigating voter fraud. Peter Antonacci, the head of that office, said Thursday was a “special day”. “This is the day we begin taking fraud seriously,” he said. </p> <p>The move is “obvious intimidation and suppression to keep eligible Floridians from even trying” to vote said Blair Bowie, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group, who specializes in voting rights for people with felony convictions.</p> <p>After Florida voters lifted the lifetime voting ban for people with most felonies, Florida lawmakers passed a measure that made it enormously difficult for people to figure out if they could vote again. In litigation challenging that measure, Florida election officials testified that they would regularly monitor the voting rolls to flag people who were ineligible, Bowie noted.</p> <p>“It is Florida’s job to review voter registration applications when they are submitted and determine whether or not the person is eligible at that time,” Bowie said in an email. “The Florida Director of Elections swore under oath that they would check every registration for eligibility…every day. The first thing she said they would look for is the ineligible convictions (murder, sexual felonies) and that they would pull those registrations out”.</p> <p>“Florida could have kept that promise and easily denied these voter registrations, preventing ineligible voters from casting ballots in the first place. Instead, they are spending money prosecuting people after the fact,” she added.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2022/aug/18/trump-affidavit-fbi-hearing-weisselberg-pence-politics-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T20:24:40Z","webTitle":"Judge indicates willingness to release redacted Trump search affidavit – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/aug/18/trump-affidavit-fbi-hearing-weisselberg-pence-politics-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2022/aug/18/trump-affidavit-fbi-hearing-weisselberg-pence-politics-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Judge indicates willingness to release redacted Trump search affidavit – as it happened","trailText":"Justice department says release of document showing probable cause would jeopardize ongoing investigation","byline":"Chris Stein in Washington","body":"<div id=\"block-62fe996d8f0892f840b89da3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T20:24:40.585Z\">9.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Closing summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A federal magistrate judge is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/aug/18/trump-affidavit-fbi-hearing-weisselberg-pence-politics-latest-updates?page=with:block-62fe82a28f080eafb8918568#block-62fe82a28f080eafb8918568\">leaning towards releasing</a> at least part of the affidavit used to justify the search of Mar-a-Lago, which could shed light on what federal investigators hoped to find at <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s resort.

This year’s grades have fallen sharply from 2021’s peak, though they are not as low as those from the last comparable exam year, 2019.</p> <p>But what else did we learn from this year’s results?</p> <h2><strong>1 Mind the gap</strong></h2> <p>To reverse the cliche, a falling tide lowers all boats. This year’s exam results were down compared with those from 2021, regardless of the kind of school a student attended, but everyone did better than in 2019.</p> <p>The exams reduced the gap between independent students and their state-school counterparts but did not close it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-18-04:37:56/embed.html\" data-alt=\"The attainment gap between independents and state schools narrowed this year compared with 2021 but is bigger than in 2019\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-18-04:37:56/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Almost three in five private, fee-paying students (58%) achieved either an A* or an A, compared with 35% of those attending academies and 30.7% of those in state comprehensives. While that is a smaller gap than in 2021, it is worse than in 2019.</p> <h2><strong>2 The regional divide</strong></h2> <p>While the gap between regions is not as stark as the gap between school types, disparities remain.</p> <p>In every region grades dropped year on year, but they increased compared with 2019. However, while nearly 40% of students sitting their exams in the south-east and London – the two <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/uk-higher-regional-inequality-large-wealthy-country-1.862262\">most affluent</a> English regions – achieved A* or A grades this year, the same was true of just 31% of those sitting exams in the north-east.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-18-06:23:19/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Almost 40% of students in the south-east and London achieved A* or A grades this year, compared with 31% of those in the north-east\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-18-06:23:19/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>So while the gap between the north-east and London was slightly less than four percentage points in 2019, it is now 8.2 points (the north-east/south-east gap grew from 5.3 points to 8.7 points over the same period).</p> <h2><strong>3 Whither the English students in England?</strong></h2> <p>English is less popular than it once was in England.

Sociology has also grown in popularity; in 2017 it just made the Top 10, but it rocketed up the charts to become the fifth most popular subject among A-level students in England this year.</p> <p>Economics attracted more than 35,000 students in England in 2022, bringing it into the Top 10 for the first time.</p> <h2><strong>4 </strong><strong>Stem up, humanities down</strong></h2> <p>The English phenomenon is part of a broader trend towards science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem). The number of students taking Stem subjects – biology, chemistry, computing, design and technology, mathematics, physics and “other sciences” – rose by 3.5% compared with in 2019.</p> <p>Conversely, those choosing humanities subjects – the three English A-levels, geography and history<strong> </strong>– dropped by 3.3% in the same period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-18-07:24:26/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2022-08-18-07:24:26/embed.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The increase is most notable in computing, with 43% more students taking this subject compared with 2019. And though computing still attracts fewer girls than most Stem subjects, in both absolute and proportional terms, those numbers are growing. This year, the number of girls sitting the exam hit 2,000 for the first time, or 15.2% of the total.</p> <h2><strong>5 Testing times for girls</strong></h2> <p>The return to an exam-based marking system has favoured boys. While boys and girls saw their grades drop significantly, girls fared worse in terms of grade deflation.

We’re like so many other workers who have learned that it’s not a choice between suffering abuse or quitting. With a union, together, we can make needed improvements to our workplace.”</p> <p>The performers first launched the unionization campaign in March in response to the club security guards’ repeated failures to protect the dancers from abuse and threats, Actors Equity said in a statement. In a <a href=\"https://knock-la.com/strippers-strike-north-hollywood/\">petition</a> to management that month, 15 out of 23 dancers called for workplace safety improvements, including enforcing policies barring customers from filming them and lingering after the club closes for the night, and urging the bar to stop serving customers who become belligerent, the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-08-17/strippers-unionize-star-garden-north-hollywood-union-actors-equity-association\">LA Times reported</a>.</p> <p>After the dancers submitted that petition, most were barred from returning to work the next day, according to the paper, which interviewed eight dancers who said they were wrongfully terminated and reviewed signed affidavits submitted to the NLRB alleging that managers failed to protect them from unwanted touching. The workers have regularly picketed outside the establishment, telling arriving customers about their struggle for better working conditions and discouraging them from patronizing the establishment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"422ff20a1334e673dc2c0279d9705690dc792dc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/422ff20a1334e673dc2c0279d9705690dc792dc7/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Workers picketing outside the strip club demanding better working conditions.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers picketing outside the strip club demanding better working conditions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Antonia Crane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An attorney for the club did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday and club management could not immediately be reached.</p> <p>The Actors’ Equity Association president, Kate Shindle, said in a statement that the dancers have “reported consistent compensation issues – including significant wage theft – along with health and safety risks and violations”, adding, “They want health insurance and other benefits, like workers’ compensation. They need protection from sexual harassment, discrimination and unjust terminations.”</p> <p>Shindle said while some aspects of the Star Garden strippers’ jobs were unique, they have much in common with other dancers represented by the union: “We applaud their efforts to seize their collective power and unionize, like so many others across the country who are fed up with toxic workplaces. When they approached us for support, we did what unions should do: we said yes.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I hope this will help all other parts of the sex industry see that there is a benefit to being collectivized and to laying out specific job standards</p> <footer> <cite>Maxine Doogan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The move comes amid a wave of labor organizing and unionization efforts across the US, including by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/16/mcdonalds-sexual-harassment-retaliation-firings\">fast-food workers</a>, Starbucks employees, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/delta-flights-attendants-union-push\">flight attendants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/12/amazon-workers-union-push-north-carolina-kentucky\">Amazon workers</a>.</p> <p>Although the Star Garden workers would be the first strippers in Actors’ Equity’s 109-year history, the union noted that there was a history of labor activism among club dancers. In San Francisco, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/02/lusty-lady-unionized-peep-show-in-trouble\">strippers at the Lusty Lady</a> organized the Exotic Dancers Union in 1996 and were affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. That establishment closed in 2013.</p> <p>After the filing this week, which the union said was backed by a majority of Star Garden dancers, the NLRB will schedule an election for roughly 30 performers eligible to vote. If a majority of them support joining Actors’ Equity, the union will begin negotiating its first contract. The effort could be complicated by the fact that some of the strippers have not worked at the venue since March, which means the NLRB may have to determine they were wrongfully terminated before they can vote, the LA Times reported.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We’re no longer going to be discriminated against, oppressed, coerced, assaulted, or robbed on the shop floor</p> <footer> <cite>Antonia Crane</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Maxine Doogan, a longtime California sex worker rights advocate, said the Star Garden effort was a significant moment: “I hope this will help all other parts of the sex industry see that there is a benefit to being collectivized and to laying out specific job standards.”</p> <p>Doogan, who organizes with the with the Erotic Service Provider Legal, Educational and Research Project, noted that strippers have long faced challenges, including managers siding with violent customers or strippers having to pay high fees to perform at a club. “This is about having their work recognized as employees and to be issued all of those protections that contracted labor doesn’t get. It’s about your right to be able to negotiate for your own workplace safety.”</p> <p>Antonia Crane, founder of Strippers United, a group that has worked with the Star Garden strippers, said the union petition sent a powerful message. “We’re no longer going to be discriminated against, oppressed, coerced, assaulted, or robbed on the shop floor. Strippers are standing up and resisting.”</p> <p>She said she has been waiting years for this kind of victory: “Strippers sit at the crossroads of several kinds of oppression – complete powerlessness in the workplace and facing a culture of intimidation, misogyny, whorephobia, racism … This is a really important moment for labor and for feminism.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2022/aug/18/a-level-results-a-and-a-star-grades-fall-sharply","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T19:50:54Z","webTitle":"Number of top A-level grades falls sharply as north-south divide grows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/a-level-results-a-and-a-star-grades-fall-sharply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2022/aug/18/a-level-results-a-and-a-star-grades-fall-sharply","fields":{"headline":"Number of top A-level grades falls sharply as north-south divide grows","trailText":"As and A*s down 8.4 percentage points on last year’s teacher-assessed grades, amid warning of ‘stark’ private-state divide","byline":"Sally Weale, Pamela Duncan,  Rachel Hall and Carmen Aguilar García","body":"<p>The number of top grades at A-level has fallen sharply this year after a return to examinations, with warnings about large regional variations and a “stark” divide between the state sector and private schools, where pupils were almost twice as likely to get an A or A*.</p> <p>Results awarded in England, Wales and Northern Ireland revealed top grades down by 8.4 percentage points on last year’s record results, while A*s alone decreased by 4.5 points, in line with government plans to bring results gradually back to pre-pandemic levels.</p> <p>The attainment gap between the more affluent London and south-east regions and the north-east is growing, however.

nuclear power plant</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>After meeting </strong><strong>the UN </strong><strong>secretary general, Ant</strong><strong>ònio Guterres, in Lviv today, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the United Nations must ensure the security of the Zaporizhzhia</strong> nuclear power plant occupied by Russian forces, Reuters is reporting.</p> \n  <p>On Telegram, Zelenskiy wrote that he and Guterres had discussed the UN-brokered deal to unblock the country’s blockaded ports and ease a worsening global food crisis, but “particular attention was paid to the topic of Russia’s nuclear blackmail at the Zaporizhzhia NPP”.</p> \n  <p>“This deliberate terror on the part of the aggressor can have global catastrophic consequences for the whole world,” Zelenskiy wrote. “Therefore, the UN must ensure the security of this strategic object, its demilitarisation and complete liberation from Russian troops.”</p> \n  <p>Kyiv accuses Moscow, whose forces captured

According to local media outlets, at least one person has been killed and 18 others were injured in the attack. The strike follows <strong>yesterday’s attack on Kharkiv which killed at least seven people and wounded 16 others</strong>. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a block of flats was “totally destroyed … We will not forgive, we will take revenge.”</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia’s war on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> has reached a ‘strategic deadlock’</strong> a senior presidential adviser has said. “Russian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,” Oleksiy Arestovych said in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvAdMevcZbA\">video</a>. “What we are seeing is a ‘strategic deadlock.’”</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Russia has replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet</strong> after explosions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/ukraine-hints-it-was-behind-latest-attack-on-russian-supply-lines-in-crimea\">rocked the peninsula this week</a>.

Oleksiy Arestovych penned a lengthy Telegram <a href=\"https://t.me/O_Arestovich_official/2476\">post</a> on Wednesday, hitting out at fellow citizens for letting their emotions get the better of them and “turning on the cancellation to the fullest”.</p></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p><strong>Chinese troops will travel to Russia to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/china-to-send-troops-to-russia-for-joint-week-long-military-drills\">take part in joint military exercises</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/china-to-send-troops-to-russia-for-joint-week-long-military-drills\"> </a>“unrelated to the current international and regional situation”, China’s defence ministry has said.

We don’t want another Chernobyl,” Erdoğan said. It was the first visit to Ukraine by Turkey’s leader, who has been a key intermediary in negotiations with Russia.</p> \n<p>Zelenskiy said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It was taken over by Russian forces in March but is still being run by Ukrainians.</p> \n<p>The UN chief called on Russian forces to leave with their military equipment, amid fears that fighting around the site could lead to a deadly disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations of shelling the site.</p> \n<p>“The facility must not be used as part of any military operation. Instead, agreement is urgently needed to re-establish Zaporizhzhia’s purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,” Guterres said.</p> \n<p>Video footage <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trbrtc/status/1560318299363221506?s=20&amp;t=2FQN1K6GdZ7Etv_JOCaYqQ\">shared online</a> by a New York Times reporter showed at least five apparently military trucks parked inside the plant’s engine room near the turbo generator.</p> \n<p>In the hours before the international summit in western Ukraine, Russia announced it had deployed warplanes armed with hypersonic missiles to its Kaliningrad region, an enclave on the Baltic Sea that borders the EU and Nato members Poland and Lithuania.</p> \n<p>The commander of its Black Sea fleet has also been replaced, the Russian RIA news agency said, in one of the most high-profile military sackings since the invasion. It came after a series of humiliations for the fleet, including the sinking of its flagship Moskva cruiser and an attack on a key airbase in Crimea.</p> \n<p>Inside Ukraine, Russian forces stepped up attacks on Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, ahead of the summit in Lviv. In attacks overnight and early on Thursday morning, at least 11 people were killed and more than 40 injured and a residential block was destroyed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c07743e1-155e-40a0-9d41-48ba576aff79\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_F95wpM5BtE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site.</p> \n<p>Russian state media had already accused Ukraine of planning a “provocation” at the plant to coincide with the UN leader’s trip, raising fears that Russia’s military could be planning a “false-flag attack”.

International nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors, and contact with staff, all of which have been disrupted by the conflict.</p> \n<p>A second issue is shelling around the plant. According to Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear authority, the impacts from Grad missiles earlier this month were close to the spent fuel storage area, with the plant’s operator claiming Russian troops “aimed specifically” at the containers, despite the Russian military’s presence at the site.</p> \n<p>Russia accuses Ukraine of carrying out the shelling.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Guterres will travel to the Black Sea port of Odesa, a crucial gateway for Ukrainian grain to reach the rest of the world.

It squawks at her to “put sentimentality aside”, to let nature take its course and to discard the “wet, wide-eyed and very, very large” duckling that has appeared in her nest.

In the wild, there are worse things than being ugly.</p> <p>Directed at a stately pace by Ian Cameron, with a subtle and varied sound design by Georgina MacDonell Finlayson, The Not So Ugly Duckling stays surprisingly close to the Andersen original. Unlike the original, however, the performers sometimes break off to discuss the characters and deconstruct the plot, recalling school bullies and censorious teachers, as the forlorn duckling is used and abused on its journey into freezing winter.</p> <p>Whether such discussion is needed is a moot point. Andersen’s story already exists on a metaphorical level. Like an untold number of stories, from Cinderella to Great Expectations to Billy Elliot, it describes the progress of a misunderstood child who flourishes into an accomplished adult. The tale has such archetypal appeal, we can make our own connections. We don’t need anyone to spell it out.</p> <p>Clifford and MacDonell do, though, make a variation on a theme. The duckling might be trapped in the ice, as if frozen in time, its body a “disappointment”, but the play rejects the idea of transformation. The swan is not an ideal to aspire to, any more than a rich princess is superior to a poor servant girl.

There’s a sombre, poker-faced intensity to its formations and human pyramids, all set to the pulse of Ori Lichtik’s electronic score. Ten serious, stacked performers don’t demand or hog applause; there’s precious little razzle-dazzle. Although always impressive in its sculptural heft, it isn’t especially engaging.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"664f479f6cf7a5492e14ba7c099bfea0334156c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/664f479f6cf7a5492e14ba7c099bfea0334156c4/0_267_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"circa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But the skill is immense, the performers tussling with gravity in feats of balance and muscular control. In their three-storey human towers, only the occasional quiver of load-bearing thighs betrays the effort involved. Someone does handstands on another person’s head; a woman bounces between prone bodies, landing precisely on their shoulder blades. Except for interludes for rope, swing and a squirming aerialist doing the splits in her straps, there are almost no props. These bodies are the kit, beams and climbing frames.</p> <p>This show builds on Circa’s 2017 piece <a href=\"https://circa.org.au/show/humans/\">Humans</a>, but the title also suggests that humanity itself is in development. If this is the future, it’s an impressively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/18/concise-dictionary-of-student-slang\">hench</a> one: there’s core strength for days, and some of them could open a jar of pickled onions with their thighs or use their arms as an emergency girder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5ffeef44689570daf9ec1960f71a0d8bdf70a51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5ffeef44689570daf9ec1960f71a0d8bdf70a51/0_163_4231_2632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Circa: Humans 2.0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"622\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If a theme does emerge, it’s about trust. There’s nothing that is required more when depending on colleagues not to drop you from a great height. But tellingly, Lifschitz also builds in occasional fails, to remind you what’s at stake. A man twirls through the air only for someone to step aside and let him crash. A woman tries leaping from a man’s shoulders: he staggers but won’t let her launch. Circus runs on trust, to let you fly but keep you safe.</p> <p>Several routines end with one person being cradled in another’s arms.

Their fathers had played Currie Cup rugby together for Natal back in the 1980s but the kids’ game was cricket. They used to play it on the strip in front of the Erwees’ garage door, and they had three house rules. One was that if you hit it over the fence it was a six, another was that if you hit it into the flower beds it was a wicket, and the last was that before you started they both had to nominate who you they were going to be and then try to play like them, too.</p> <p>Olivier always used to choose Allan Donald, and Erwee, well, he used to want to be Gary Kirsten. “Many times I would not be able to get him out,” Olivier <a href=\"https://chadwickdrive.substack.com/p/sarel-erwee-the-optimist\" title=\"\">told the journalist CS Chiwanza</a>. “In the end, he would just retire and give me a go.” It’s a choice that raises all kinds of questions, the most obvious of them being: “Why?” He could have picked Herschelle Gibbs, Lance Klusener, even Jacques Kallis. But instead he went for Kirsten, the man who played some of the most bum-numbing innings in the history of the game: 275 off 642 balls at Durban in 1999, 210 off 525 at Old Trafford in 1998, 130 off 323 at Headingley in 2003.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/18/cricket-england-south-africa-first-test-day-two-report\">Ben Stokes gives England hope after South Africa build first Test advantage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What kind of a child grows up wanting to bat like that? It’s unnatural. Like choosing to do long division, or helping yourself to another plate of steamed vegetables.</p> <p>Well, we found out all about it on the second day at Lord’s, which felt like one long lesson in the merits of GazBall. Erwee batted for four hours or so, faced 146 balls, and scored 73 runs, although he’s one of those batsmen who seems to make time go more slowly, and the interminable afternoon session, when England seemed to be flat out of ideas about how to get him out, felt as if it might have stretched on into autumn. It was a fine innings, albeit one that a lot of people at Lord’s decided was best viewed from the TV screens positioned by the bars around the back of the ground.</p> <p>They will have been watching raptly down at the cricket green in Weybridge. Erwee has been playing in the Surrey Premier League since 2013 and warmed up for this series with a string of innings for Weybridge CC against sides such as Malden Wanderers and Reigate Priory. Which is not how you typically go about preparing to face up to England in a Test at Lord’s. Only a couple of weeks ago Erwee was batting against the mighty East Molesey CC, who, to be fair, do have an international attack, in that their opening bowler Andrew Westphal has won five caps for Mexico. East Molesey did better than England, and dismissed him for 35.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1de469a2c2fa8011b84e360995a93a7dbc213ed3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1de469a2c2fa8011b84e360995a93a7dbc213ed3/0_0_2446_1468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Stokes reacts as Sarel Erwee refuses to budge from the crease at Lord’s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Stokes reacts as Sarel Erwee refuses to budge from the crease at Lord’s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a sweet, strange story in an age when the brightest young players are taking the shortcut into franchise cricket; Erwee went the long way around. He spent years playing as a semi‑professional, while his friends in the game moved on ahead of him. He only got a start at Weybridge because David Miller had to drop out and suggested they get Erwee to replace him at the last minute. He did, scored four consecutive centuries, and has been a fixture ever since. He has played almost 100 games for them now. But it wasn’t exactly the career he had been dreaming of back when he was batting in front of his garage.</p> <p>Erwee is close mates with Jason Roy, has been ever since they spent time together at a cricket academy back in 2012. Roy ended up making his T20 debut for England just a couple of years later and spent the years afterwards lighting up international cricket while Erwee slogged away in South Africa’s domestic setup and spent his winters rattling off runs around the home counties.</p> <p>He has spoken a lot about how <a href=\"https://www.newframe.com/sarel-erwee-a-dolphin-in-calmer-waters/\" title=\"\">he ended up with depression</a> because he felt his career had stalled and said he almost quit the game in 2019, right around the time Roy won the World Cup, because he was so fed up waiting for a break that never came.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/aug/18/england-v-south-africa-first-test-day-two-live-score-updates-cricket\">England v South Africa: first Test, day two – as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then he hooked up with a good psychologist and, after working with them through the pandemic, ended up coming out of lockdown a better, hungrier player.

And you’ll see it in every sector of the economy, in education, in health, wider parts of the transport system, in all sectors, the private sector as well.”</p> <p>He also accused the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who has steadfastly refused to intervene, of trying to “flex his rightwing muscles” to try and secure a cabinet post under the next prime minister.</p> <p>On Thursday, many routes and stations were left with no services, while trains still running were only operating between 7.30am and 6.30pm.</p> <p>But according to Network Rail, 4,300 rail services were due to run on Thursday and Saturday, an increase on the number during previous strikes.</p> <p>However, the strike left some places, such as Portsmouth, Swansea and Blackpool, with no train services at all. </p> <p>Network Rail’s chief executive, Andrew Haines, said negotiations with unions were slow and painful, and there was “an absolute lack of clarity over what it would take for this strike to be called off”.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’re desperate to bring this to a resolution in a way that is affordable for the country and which avoids the pain for my colleagues.”</p> <p>Transport for London has told people to avoid travelling on the tube on Friday until 8am on Saturday.

What’s next in this sequence: 136, 162, 71, 106, 114?</p> <p>The answer is … 0. That’s what Jonny Bairstow scored yesterday, as the purplest patch of his long Test career was rudely interrupted by a fast straight ball from Anrich Nortje. One minute you’re racking up 589 for three times out, the next you’re being escorted off the field by Daddles the duck.</p> <p>Amazon’s All Or Nothing is the right title in the wrong sport. The Arsenal season covered in the latest series was neither all nor nothing – they finished fifth in the Premier League, exactly as expected – whereas almost every batter in world cricket is riding the all-or-nothing rollercoaster all the time. Directly before his 136, Bairstow made seven consecutive scores below 30. His Test average this year, when England are put in to bat, is 7.33. When England win the toss and field, it’s 121.33.</p> <p>The cape Bairstow couldn’t find yesterday was being worn by Ollie Pope, who looked more like a senior player than he ever had before. He was busy but not frantic, positive but not foolhardy, carefree but not careless. He hit only four fours off 87 balls yet still managed a strike rate of 70. He resumes this morning, on 61 not out, as England’s last hope of a respectable total.</p> <p>The South Africans won’t worry about Pope unless he doubles his tally. Their strike rate has been phenomenal: six wickets in 32 overs. Kagiso Rabada <a href=\"https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=bowling_strike_rate;qualmin2=150;qualval2=wickets;template=results;type=bowling\">needs fewer balls to dismiss a batter than any bowler in history</a> with 150 Test wickets. Marshall, Cummins, Trueman, Garner: every one a maestro, but none as good, by this yardstick, as the mighty Rabada. Yesterday he surgically removed England’s openers, then took a break and watched Nortje demolish the middle order. This morning they may well open together and have a race to a spot on the honours board.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T09:24:16.464Z\">at 10.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62fd133a8f083ef020e6f73b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T08:45:41.497Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Play starts at 10.30am BST, weather permitting, to make up some of the time lost yesterday.

Without providing more details, Shehab said the actions had led to an “outright insult and abuse of human dignity”.</p> <p>A translation of Shehab’s statement to the court, which was delivered during her first trial, was provided to the Guardian by The Freedom Initiative, a nonprofit based in the US that advocates for wrongfully detained prisoners in the Middle East and north Africa. It is not clear when precisely the statement was made.</p> <p>The statement includes several allegations of rights violations under Saudi law, and suggests Shehab may have faced physical or sexual violence, but does not make any explicit allegations of that nature. She cited violations of Saudi law that prevent “emotional or mental harming” and subjection to torture and inhumane treatment.</p> <p>In the statement, Shehab alleges that she was not given access to a lawyer after her initial arrest in January 2021 and was illegally held for 285 days before being referred to a court. Under Saudi rules, she should have been released after 180 days.</p> <p>Other new details of Shehab’s treatment include the allegation that she was held in solitary confinement for 13 days and was denied visits and phone calls from her family. An interrogator also threatened her with the “cancellation” of her studies.</p> <p>At one point, Shehab said an investigator wanted to include in her statement that Shehab was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Sunni Islamist movement that is considered a terrorist organisation in several Arab states including Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>“How can the investigator allow himself the opportunity to add in his own personal opinions?” she wrote.</p> <p>Shehab also invited the court to look into the “manner of investigation” used against her, which had included “corrupt practices” that led to “statements contrary to the free will of detainees, which is legally guaranteed”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/17/saudi-arabia-snitching-app-jailed-leeds-student-salma-al-shehab\">Saudi snitching app appears to have been used against jailed Leeds student</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shehab’s case has gained international attention as a result of the draconian sentence, which includes a 34-year travel ban after her 34-year prison sentence. The special terrorist court where she was tried alleged that Shehab had supported terrorist ideology because of her use of Twitter, including the fact that she followed the accounts of some dissidents.</p> <p>Twitter has declined to comment on the case. Saudi Arabia is a significant indirect investor in the company and Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who has expressed allegiance to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, owns 5% of the company’s stock.</p> <p>US state department spokesperson Ned Price this week said the Biden administration was “studying the case” and the sentence.</p> <p>“I can say as a general matter, exercising the freedom of expression and advocating for the rights of women should never be criminalised,” he said. He said that the US government does raise “specific cases” that come to the administration’s attention when they “run afoul of rights that should be universal” but did not specifically state whether the administration was advocating for Shehab.</p> <p>In her statement to the court, Shehab vigorously denied that her following of certain accounts on Twitter meant that she was sympathetic to their cause or in agreement with the individuals. She denied the charge that following individuals on Twitter was akin to giving the individuals “aid” and said she did not espouse any violent or terrorist ideology.</p> <p>“Following them may be out of curiosity or to see what they say, or to protect ourselves from their deception by becoming familiar with it. This does not imply support,” she said.</p> <p>She added: “I deplore all forms of extremism, violence, terrorism, and racism. This is evident in my posts and further evident in that I use my real name and put up pictures of my kids.” Having an account with about 2,000 followers meant she could not have the impact alleged by the court.</p> <p>Shehab was initially sentenced to six years in prison, and told she had to serve three. Later, after an appeal and new charges by the public prosecutor, the sentence was increased to 34 years.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/thunderstorm-deaths-corsica-italy-mediterranean","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T18:08:01Z","webTitle":"Thunderstorms in Corsica and parts of Italy leave seven dead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/thunderstorm-deaths-corsica-italy-mediterranean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/thunderstorm-deaths-corsica-italy-mediterranean","fields":{"headline":"Thunderstorms in Corsica and parts of Italy leave seven dead","trailText":"Girl, 13, among dead as violent storms strike after three days of intense rain in region","byline":"Kim Willsher in Paris and agencies","body":"<p>Violent thunderstorms with winds of up to 139mph (224km/h) have struck the Mediterranean island of Corsica and parts of Italy, killing seven people and leaving at least a dozen more injured.</p> <p>On Corsica, a 13-year-old girl died after a tree fell on a campsite where she was staying in the south, while a 46-year-old man was killed when a tree fell on a campsite bungalow in the northern town of Calvi.

Tourists were evacuated from the structure, which was cordoned off. The storm upended chairs and tables in St Mark’s Square and elsewhere, and swept away beach chairs on the nearby Lido.</p> <p>Winds rose suddenly and were calmed within five minutes, said Carlo Alberto Tesserin, the caretaker of the basilica and bell tower. “These were not usual winds for us,” Tesserin told the Associated Press.</p> <p>Cedric Boell, the manager of restaurant Les Gones Corses in northern Corsica, said: “We have never seen such huge storms as this, you would think it was a tropical storm.”</p> <p>Yolhan Niveau, 24, a wildlife photographer staying at a Corsican campsite near San-Nicolao in the north-east, said the storm had torn through the site, uprooting trees and damaging mobile homes. “There was no warning. ...

His books were bestsellers; his biographies of Harry Truman and John Adams both won Pulitzer prizes, and were taken up for TV by HBO. Two more of his books, on the creation of the Panama Canal and about Theodore Roosevelt’s early years, won the US National Book award.</p> <p>But McCullough was perhaps best known for his voice, as the narrator of documentaries, most notably Ken Burns’ epic series <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-civil-war/\" title=\"\">The Civil War</a> (1990) and the Disney film Seabiscuit (2003), about the 1930s sensation racehorse, and as host of the long-running PBS series American Experience.</p> <p>The American experience was at the core of everything McCullough wrote about, and his narrating voice, a gentle, high-pitched baritone made him sound like a relaxed teacher telling familiar stories.</p> <p>In 1998, when he received an honorary degree from his alma mater, Yale University, the citation said: “He gives us pictures of the American people that live, breathe and above all confront the fundamental issues of courage, achievement and moral character.”</p> <p>David was born in Pittsburgh, the son of Christian McCullough, president of the McCullough Electric Company, founded by David’s great-grandfather, and Ruth (nee Rankin), a leading figure in Pittsburgh society.

His teachers there included John O’Hara, John Hersey, Robert Penn Warren and, most influentially, the playwright Thornton Wilder, from whom he learned to maintain an “air of freedom” to avoid giving away a story to a reader; he applied this to his own writing, even though history’s outcomes are always thought to be known. He was also a member of the secret Skull and Bones Society, many of whose members have gone on to have a profound influence on history.</p> <p>At the Rolling Rock country club in Pittsburgh in 1951 he met Rosalee Barnes. After his graduation from Yale, they married. Intending to be a playwright, he took a job with the Luce magazines, including the newly launched Sports Illustrated, then worked for the US Information Agency and finally for American Heritage magazine, then published by Forbes.</p> <p>His first book came after he “stumbled” across the story of the 1889 Johnstown flood, a disaster that struck the steel town an hour east of his own hometown. The Johnstown Flood (1968) garnered excellent reviews, and McCullough decided to become a full-time writer. It took four years before his next book, The Great Bridge, was published; McCullough so immersed himself in Washington Roebling, the force behind the bridge’s construction, and one of the many killed in its construction, that he grew a beard exactly like Roebling’s.</p> <p>He followed that five years later with The Path Between the Seas (1977), the story of the Panama Canal, which won the National Book award as well as three other major history prizes, including the Francis Parkman. He served as an adviser to President Jimmy Carter on the treaty that handed control of the canal to Panama; Carter credited the book for making the treaty possible. Mornings on Horseback followed in 1981, winning his second National Book award.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a917e80b00249518a45dee855aaad891325ce67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a917e80b00249518a45dee855aaad891325ce67/0_130_3150_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David McCullough in 2008 in New York, at the premiere of John Adams, the HBO TV series based on his Pulitzer prizewinning biography of the second US president and starring Paul Giamatti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David McCullough in 2008 in New York, at the premiere of John Adams, the HBO TV series based on his Pulitzer prizewinning biography of the second US president and starring Paul Giamatti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Allocca/Starpix/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By then, Burns had acquired the rights to make a documentary based on The Great Bridge; he so loved McCullough’s voice that he used him as the narrator of Brooklyn Bridge – the first of six PBS documentaries McCullough narrated for Burns, including The Congress (1988), which McCullough also co-wrote, and The Civil War, where the narration served as a bridge between the two main interviewees, the homespun “Lost Cause” insights of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/01/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries1\" title=\"\">Shelby Foote</a> and the more revisionist takes of Barbara Fields. McCullough also narrated The Donner Party (1992), on the ill-fated pioneer group whose survivors resorted to cannibalism, for Ric Burns. </p> <p>The success of his narration led to his work on the series Smithsonian World, and then hosting and sometimes narrating American Experience, a total of 48 episodes between 1988 and 2001. He also served as an adviser to their programmes on Truman and Teddy Roosevelt, and returned in 2022 to narrate an episode on the history of jeans.</p> <p>He worked for 12 years on his biography of Harry Truman, which was published in 1992 and won his first Pulitzer, and second Parkman award. It was made into an HBO film, Truman (1995), starring Gary Sinise. He took nearly a decade to research and write John Adams (2001), which also won the Pulitzer, and was made into a hugely successful HBO miniseries starring Paul Giamatti as the US’s second president.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His narrating voice, a gentle, high-pitched baritone, made it all seem like a relaxed teacher telling familiar stories</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Both books were huge bestsellers. They dealt with presidents whose own achievements were overshadowed by predecessors who had led the nation through major conflict, and Truman in particular was criticised somewhat for its seeming partisanship for its subject. McCullough followed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/26/historybooks.features1\" title=\"\">1776</a>, about the year of the Declaration of Independence, an offshoot of his Adams research. It managed to be comprehensive while telling a story immediately recognisable from American myth.</p> <p>His later books were received with less acclaim. The Greater Journey (2011) was more a compendium of stories about Americans transformed by Paris, including some less familiar figures. He returned to determined battlers against nature with The Wright Brothers (2015), the story of their quest to fly.</p> <p>McCullough had always maintained a publicly neutral political stance, but before the 2016 US presidential election he made a short video for a Facebook page called Historians on Donald Trump, in which he called the soon-to-be president “unwise ... plainly unprepared, unqualified and, it often seems, unhinged”.

They’ve been detected in the Arctic, found in rain throughout the globe, and are estimated to be in 98% of Americans’ blood. New research has also found them in alarming levels in some food and the air.</p> <p>Though technology to remove the PFAS from the environment exists, researchers until now have not yet figured out how to totally decompose the chemicals after removal.</p> <p>The effectiveness of an emerging low temperature technique to break down PFAS is outlined in findings published on Thursday in <a href=\"https://www.science.org/\">Science</a>. “The fundamental knowledge of how [PFAS] degrade is the single most important thing coming out of this study,” said Will Dichtel, a Northwestern University researcher and co-author of the new study.</p> <p>The chemicals are often disposed of in methods that public health advocates have raised concerns about, like deep well injection or landfilling. They are also frequently incinerated, which evidence suggests only breaks apart the compounds, sending still dangerous pieces of PFAS into the air.</p> <p>“There is no way to dispose of PFAS that is benign, so there is a need for a method to get rid of PFAS in a way that does not still pollute,” said Brittany Trang, a Northwestern researcher and one of the study’s lead authors. </p> <p>PFAS are used to make thousands of consumer products across dozens of industries resist water, stains and heat. They are widely used because they are so effective, but those compounds that have been studied are linked to serious health issues like cancer, birth defects, liver disease, kidney problems, decreased immunity and high cholesterol.</p> <p>About 12,000 compounds comprise the PFAS class, and the method developed by researchers from Northwestern, University of California at Los Angeles, and Tianjin University is effective on one subclass, perfluorocarboxylic acids. It includes compounds commonly produced by industry or found in the environment, including PFOA and PFBA, that are highly toxic at low levels and have been used in products like waxes and food packaging.</p> <p>Every PFAS compound shares a common trait that has so far made them virtually indestructible – they have at least one carbon atom that is fluorinated. The new process “defluorinates” the compounds with a mixture of water and the dipolar aprotic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), leaving carbon and inorganic fluoride, two relatively harmless substances.</p> <p>Researchers say they expect their method could be broadened to address PFAS in other subclasses. In contrast to other methods used to attempt to destroy the PFAS, this approach requires low levels of energy, researchers say.</p> <p>“This method operates under mild conditions and makes benign products, and that makes it immediately promising for further study,” Dichtel said.</p> <p>The findings are preliminary and the method is far from being ready to be scaled up and applied on a commercial level, researchers stressed. The chemicals are found in water at very low concentrations, though at levels that are toxic, so they would first have to be removed from contaminated water using reverse osmosis, granular activated carbon or other filtration. Once the chemicals are concentrated in wastewater, the new method could be used to treat them.</p> <p>Dichtel, who said he has worked on developing methods to decompose PFAS for about seven years, called the findings “meaningful”.</p> <p>“We have never had a satisfactory answer to ‘What we are going to do with these and how can we clean our water’?” Dichtel said.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/environment_2022\">Tell us what you think about the Guardian’s climate reporting – it takes just 2 minutes</a></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/18/gm-soya-beans-greater-yield-global-food-security-boost","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T18:00:52Z","webTitle":"New GM soya beans give 25% greater yield in global food security boost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/18/gm-soya-beans-greater-yield-global-food-security-boost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/18/gm-soya-beans-greater-yield-global-food-security-boost","fields":{"headline":"New GM soya beans give 25% greater yield in global food security boost","trailText":"Trial is first successful demonstration of genetic engineering being used to directly target photosynthesis process","byline":"Hannah Devlin Science correspondent","body":"<p>Genetically modified soya beans designed to absorb light more efficiently produced a 25% greater yield in an advance that could significantly boost global food supplies.</p> <p>The field trials are the first successful demonstration that genetic engineering can be used to directly target the photosynthesis process in food crops.

Finance watchdogs should not be on the list","byline":"Nils Pratley","body":"<p>In a world of soaring energy bills, polluted rivers, labour shortages, plunging levels of business investment, strikes and an underfunded health service, give thanks for small mercies. At least we’re not worrying about the banks going bust.</p> <p>That assumption wasn’t necessarily safe when Covid struck in early 2020. The share prices of the likes of Lloyds Banking Group and NatWest halved almost overnight. </p> <p>That they’ve recovered all the lost ground can be explained by a few factors: the massive sums spent by government on furlough schemes, bounce-back loans and so on; the fact that unemployment, one traditional driver of lending write-offs, has remained low; and the higher interest rates that help banks’ lending margins.</p> <p>But maybe there’s another factor in the background. Perhaps the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the bit of the Bank of England responsible for policing the health of the financial system, has done a half-decent job.</p> <p>It’s still early days, of course. But, on the other side of the recession, the banking system should be infinitely better equipped to fund recovery than it was in 2008-09, when Northern Rock, HBOS, Royal Bank of Scotland had fallen like dominos.</p> <p>The PRA was created out of that crisis. The failed Financial Services Authority and its light-touch regime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/24/farewell-fsa-bleak-legacy-light-touch-regulator\">was disbanded in 2013</a> under George Osborne’s reforms. Big-picture regulation of the biggest banks and insurers was handed back to a beefed-up Threadneedle Street. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was formed to do the rest of the old FSA’s work – regulating markets, policing conduct, looking out for consumers and overseeing smaller financial firms.</p> <p>One can still point to shocking failings, naturally. Exhibit A would be the FCA’s oversight of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/19/uk-taxpayers-face-120m-compensation-bill-for-lcf-scandal\">London Capital &amp; Finance</a>, where the regulator was asleep at the wheel as savers, enticed by promises of fat but safe returns, lost their shirts.</p> <p>Then there was the FCA’s investigation into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/13/fca-report-into-rbs-branded-complete-whitewash\">the gouging of small and medium-sized business</a> by RBS’s GRG unit in 2008-13; it read like an exercise in buck-passing. But the financial architecture itself – the division of responsibilities between the PRA and the FCA – still seems sound. Nobody, surely, would want to re-create the unlamented FSA.</p> <p>Well, one person, it seems. The FT reports that Liz Truss, the Tory leadership frontrunner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/18/liz-truss-merge-financial-regulators-fca\">has a plan to merge the FCA and the PRA</a>, throwing the much-smaller Payments Systems Regulator (already part of the FCA) into the mix. This sounds a seriously bad idea.</p> <p>What problem is it trying to solve? As ever with the Tory leadership show, details around the wilder ideas are sketchy. This one seems to owe something to Truss’ reported desire to conduct a “war on technocrats” or to cut the Bank of England down to size.</p> <p>Or perhaps she just doesn’t like Andrew Bailey, the governor, or Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, both of whom seem alert to the risks in attaching a “growth” or “competitiveness” mandate to the job of financial regulation.</p> <p>If Truss has serious arguments to make, let’s hear them. But another round of institutional upheaval in financial regulation sounds like a futile revolution. Refinements are always possible but, unlike in 2008, the basic set-up hasn’t obviously failed.</p> <p>Messing about with the PRA would be particularly pointless. It is the one body capable of facing down self-interested bankers when they scream, as with the temporary ban on paying dividends to shareholders during the early months of Covid, that regulators are making their shares “uninvestable”.</p> <p>A prudential regulator should be prudent. Pressure from boardrooms and politicians to march to a “competitive” beat caused half the trouble with the old FSA.</p> <p>The cost of living crisis this winter is plainly the top priority for an incoming prime minister – then she can take her pick from any of the other enormous challenges for the UK economy listed above. A re-arrangement of financial regulatory bodies should not be on the list.</p> <h2>Not just another story</h2> <p>Note a detail in the tale of the US university student who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/18/us-student-bed-bath-beyond-shares-meme-stock\">made a $110m profit in a month</a> by buying shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, an ailing US homeware retailer thrust into the role of “meme” stock: the share price fell 25% soon after he sold.</p> <p>Jake Freeman bought at $5.50 in July, so would still have made very decent money if he’d got out at Thursday’s $19, rather the reported level of around $27 on Tuesday. He was either brilliant or lucky in his timing.</p> <p>The other important detail is that he started with a stake of $25m, courtesy of “friends and family”.

We suspect that the offender walked with the child across this area where we believe he sexually assaulted her.</p> <p>“The offender appears to have been hanging around the area prior to the offence and afterwards he made his way through the paths and streets of the Snipe estate possibly in the direction of Openshaw.</p> <p>“You will have seen footage in the press and if you haven’t, can I please ask you to look at these images to try and identify the person.”</p> <p>He urged members of the public to check CCTV, dashcam and doorbell footage for videos that might assist the investigation, but asked people not to speculate in social media posts.</p> <p>He added: “Obviously we are keen to speak to this male, described in the footage.

It operates ports in 78 countries on six continents including London Gateway and Southampton, and bought P&amp;O <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/feb/14/frontpagenews\">in 2006 for £3.3bn</a>.</p> <p>DP World had told a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/24/po-ferries-boss-says-800-staff-were-sacked-because-no-union-would-accepts-its-plans\">parliamentary inquiry that P&amp;O “had no future”</a> unless it sacked the workers. At a Commons hearing in March, Peter Hebblethwaite, the boss of P&amp;O, said the company had chosen to break the law and sack the 800 workers without notice or consultation because “no union could accept our proposals”.</p> <p>The staff were told in video calls on the ships that it was their “final day of employment” and ordered off the ferries.</p> <p>Hebblethwaite’s testimony prompted MPs to ask whether he was a “shameless criminal”, but he insisted he would “make this decision again”.</p> <p>However, Hebblethwaite told an industry conference in May: “We have not conducted ourselves on the day, or since, in anything like the way that has been suggested of me and us.”</p> <p>Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), on Thursday accused DP World of making “eye-watering profits … off the backs of P&amp;O illegally sacking hundreds of dedicated staff”.</p> <p>“DP World have been allowed to get away scot-free with behaving like corporate gangsters,” she said. “They are an insult to common decency.</p> <p>“Ministers should have stripped DP world of all their lucrative public contracts and severed all commercial ties with the company.”</p> <p>The TUC has written to the Insolvency Service, which is carrying out criminal and civil investigations into the company, saying its directors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/tuc-chief-calls-for-directors-of-p-and-o-ferries-to-be-disqualified-insolvency-service\">should be disqualified</a>.</p> <p>The Insolvency Service investigation is being watched closely by the government, which has said it is unable to take direct action against the directors of P&amp;O Ferries despite the company admitting to breaking the law.</p> <p>Boris Johnson had initially promised to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/23/boris-johnson-po-ferries-sackings-mps\">legal action in the courts against the company</a>, but a week later it emerged that this was not the case, and that the government would instead rely on the Insolvency Service investigation.</p> <p>Proposed legislation the government said would ensure P&amp;O and other ferry operators pay seafarers the minimum wage was outlined during the Queen’s speech earlier in May. However, port operators and the TUC both cast doubt on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/grant-shapps-law-seafarers-minimum-wage-queens-speech\">whether the proposed laws would have any effect</a> in practice.</p> <p>When it announced the sackings P&amp;O said it had “made a £100m loss year on year” which had been “covered by our parent DP World”.</p> <p>“This is not sustainable,” the company said. “Our survival is dependent on making swift and significant changes now. Without these changes there is no future for P&amp;O Ferries.”</p> <p>The company had asked the government for a £150m bailout after trade collapsed during the pandemic. However, the government turned down the request for help after it was reported to have paid out £270m in dividends to investors.</p> <p>At the time a DP World spokesperson said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/11/p-and-o-ferries-to-cut-1100-jobs-owner-pay-270m-dividends\">£270m of dividends related “to a delisting process</a>, which was announced pre-Covid-19 and which DP World is legally obliged to pay”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/18/former-champions-and-new-blood-gear-up-for-strongest-vuelta-a-espana-in-years","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T17:40:22Z","webTitle":"Former winners and new contenders gear up for strongest Vuelta in years | William Fotheringham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/18/former-champions-and-new-blood-gear-up-for-strongest-vuelta-a-espana-in-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/18/former-champions-and-new-blood-gear-up-for-strongest-vuelta-a-espana-in-years","fields":{"headline":"Former winners and new contenders gear up for strongest Vuelta in years","trailText":"Fewer time trials, steeper hills and three stages in the Netherlands await a heavyweight field in the year’s final Grand Tour","byline":"William Fotheringham","body":"<p>A shadow was cast over the Vuelta a España by Thursday’s withdrawal of Nairo Quintana as the Colombian prepared his appeal against a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/cycling-nairo-quintana-disqualified-tour-de-france-positive-tramadol-test\" title=\"\">positive test</a> for the painkiller tramadol during the Tour de France, but even without the 2016 race winner, the final Grand Tour of 2022 is set to be contested by the race’s strongest field in recent years.</p> <p>The unexpected return of the triple winner Primoz Roglic after his crash in the Tour de France means there will still be five previous winners in the field when the race begins in Utrecht on Friday – Alejandro Valverde (2009), Chris Froome (2011, 2017), Vincenzo Nibali (2010) and Lancashire’s Simon Yates (2018) being the others – along with three recent winners of the Giro d’Italia: the Londoner Tao Geoghegan Hart, his Ecuadorian Ineos teammate Richard Carapaz and the Australian Jai Hindley.</p> <p>When the Vuelta was relocated to its present late-season slot 27 years ago, the intention was that it would complete the year’s stage racing narrative by providing an opportunity for revenge or redemption for those who had missed the Tour or had fallen short. The world champion, Julian Alaphilippe, forced out of the Tour by injury, and his fellow Frenchman Thibaut Pinot – whose Tour was good but not great – fall into that category, as does the Irish sprinter Sam Bennett, who has looked increasingly marginalised at Bora-Hansgrohe this season.</p> <p>As the most talented riders appear in the World Tour at a younger age, the Vuelta is also seen as the best place for the big teams to blood new prospects, as was the case with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/13/tom-pidcock-grand-tour-debut-vuelta-a-espana-cycling\" title=\"\">Tom Pidcock in 2021</a>.

The first three days in the Netherlands – before a transfer to Spain on Monday – are as flat as it gets, although Bennett will get at least five possible chances at a stage win that would salvage a frustrating season for the 2020 Tour de France points winner.</p> <p>Nine of the 21 stages have difficult uphill finishes, beginning on stage six in the Basque country at Pico Jano, followed 48 hours later in Asturias by the monstrous Laviana, with its 17% slopes; the highest comes on the penultimate Sunday in the Sierra Nevada, topping out at more than 2,500m. There is a single individual time trial, at Alicante midway through, and a final bout of climbing in the Sierra de Guadarrama on the last Saturday.</p> <p>It’s the same formula as in recent years and it has worked well for Roglic in the last three editions, although the Slovenian’s form is impossible to gauge as he has not raced since quitting the Tour. On the other hand, Yates has shown well recently, winning the Vuelta Castilla y León in late July, while Hindley and the Portuguese João Almeida looked strong in the recent Tour of Burgos.</p> <p>A further twist in the Vuelta tale is cycling’s first relegation battle, with only 18 teams due to qualify for next year’s WorldTour. The next three weeks look vitally important for as many as six teams, with Froome’s Israel-Premier Tech, the Belgians of Lotto Soudal, Valverde’s Movistar and Yates’s BikeExchange-Jayco among them, along with Cofidis of France and the American squad EF Education-EasyPost, who now more than ever need their climber Hugh Carthy to build on his third place overall of 2020.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/17/brad-pitt-foundation-settlement-owners-faulty-post-katrina-houses","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T17:34:47Z","webTitle":"Brad Pitt foundation agrees on $20.5m settlement to owners of faulty post-Katrina houses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/brad-pitt-foundation-settlement-owners-faulty-post-katrina-houses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/brad-pitt-foundation-settlement-owners-faulty-post-katrina-houses","fields":{"headline":"Brad Pitt foundation agrees on $20.5m settlement to owners of faulty post-Katrina houses","trailText":"Lawsuit was brought by owners after Pitt’s supposedly sustainable, flood-proof homes were plagued by mold, leaks and rot","byline":"Wilfred Chan","body":"<p>It sounded like a dream come true, complete with a handsome prince riding to the rescue: the construction of 109 new, sustainable, flood-proof and affordable houses in New Orleans’s Hurricane Katrina-ravaged Lower Ninth Ward, all thanks to movie star Brad Pitt. </p> <p>But the houses that were built fell far short of Pitt’s 2006 promises: they were plagued by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/03/brad-pitt-post-katrina-housing-project-went-horribly-wrong\">mold, electrical fires and unclean water</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday, 13 years after Hurricane Katrina victims started moving into the buildings, Pitt and his foundation agreed to a settlement that will pay $20.5m to homeowners whose properties began to deteriorate almost as soon as they bought them.</p> <p>The residents filed the lawsuit against Pitt and his charity, Make it Right, in 2018, after the now defunct charity allegedly ignored their complaints and then vanished as the houses continued to decay.</p> <p>The proposed settlement has led to “tears of joy” among the long-suffering flood victims, Ron Austin, the lead attorney in the class action lawsuit, told the Guardian. “You’re talking about a group of people who didn’t have an option to move and buy or rent a second home. This was their life savings and they were living in something that was deteriorating quickly around them. So they’re relieved and grateful.”</p> <p>All the money in the settlement will go to the renovation and repair of the houses, Austin said. “There won’t be any windfalls in individuals’ pockets.”</p> <p>Global Green, a Brad Pitt-linked environmental non-profit that was not named in the lawsuit, said in a statement that it had agreed to provide $20.5m to “fund a program to rectify defects in the original as built conditions of homes” and to “resolve the litigation”. </p> <p>“I am incredibly grateful for Global Green’s willingness to step up and provide this important support for the Lower Ninth families,” Pitt said in a statement. “We collaborated in the early days post-Katrina and we are very fortunate to have Global Green’s generous continuing commitment to help address the challenges around these homes and others in need.”</p> <p>The proposed settlement was filed in the civil district court for the parish of Orleans and is awaiting judicial approval.</p> <p>Pitt announced the Make It Right project to great fanfare in 2006. The plan was to hire a cast of famous architects to build flashy, environmentally sustainable houses at the center of Hurricane Katrina’s catastrophic flooding, and sell them to flood victims below cost – starting at $150,000. The Hollywood icon boasted that the houses were “a proof-of-concept for low-income green building nationally, maybe even worldwide”.</p> <p>But that dream quickly fizzled. The eye-catching architecture was ill-suited to the torrential rainfalls of New Orleans: some of the houses had flat roofs and were missing basic features like rain gutters, overhangs, covered beams and waterproof paint – causing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/03/brad-pitt-post-katrina-housing-project-went-horribly-wrong\">mold, leaks and rot</a> soon after they were built. While Pitt’s charity initially made repairs, residents say the firm forced them to sign non-disclosure agreements, before cutting off contact and disappearing altogether. That left the residents – many of them low-income first-time homeowners – trapped in their decaying homes yet unable to sell.</p> <p>Pitt has long denied responsibility for the debacle. A source close to the actor told the Guardian in February that “Brad got involved at the beginning to help the people of the Lower Ninth Ward, and obviously it was upsetting to see what had happened once he had stepped back from the project and others took over.”</p> <p>Austin said that despite years of anguish, many of the homeowners have never stopped admiring the actor.</p> <p>“They were not happy that it seemed he was trying to get out of his obligations. Obviously, when someone makes you a promise and you believe in them, and when they try to walk away from that, you’re going to be disappointed,” he said. “But they were never not fans of Brad Pitt. He’s an icon of a guy.”</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was updated on 18 August to add comment from Brad Pitt and Global Green.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/19/scott-morrison-had-a-penchant-for-secrecy-and-centralising-power-here-are-four-examples","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T17:30:53Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison had a penchant for secrecy and centralising power – here are four examples","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/19/scott-morrison-had-a-penchant-for-secrecy-and-centralising-power-here-are-four-examples","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/19/scott-morrison-had-a-penchant-for-secrecy-and-centralising-power-here-are-four-examples","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison had a penchant for secrecy and centralising power – here are four examples","trailText":"Even before we learned the former PM was appointed to five extra ministries without telling anyone, there were warning signs of his need for control","byline":"Paul Karp","body":"<p>This week we learned Scott Morrison was appointed to five extra ministries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/18/scott-morrison-apologises-to-karen-andrews-following-calls-from-senior-coalition-figures\">without his colleagues’ knowledge</a> – but there were signs earlier in his prime ministership that he wanted to keep information secret and centralise power.</p> <p>Morrison in 2019 arranged it so that he could hold meetings with anyone and treat them as cabinet-in-confidence.

Instead, we have swapped socialising for screens. But what a terrible swap this has been. Increasingly sophisticated and all-pervasive algorithms are designed to sow division among us and create strong emotion, and our physical isolation from each other means these emotions don’t get a chance to cool or soften in the way they can when we interact face to face.</p> <p>Add to this the increased anxiety about “going outside” or having people in your home, or spending time with anyone “not in your bubble” (in both senses of the word), then you have a recipe for feeling alienated from your fellow humans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/22/you-cannot-sneeze-in-public-any-more-without-risking-glares-but-ive-just-eaten-this-bowl-of-hot-wings\">You cannot sneeze in public any more without risking glares – but I’ve just eaten this bowl of hot wings | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rather than settling into the divide, I’ve been thinking lately: what small acts can I do that might reduce the gaps between us? How can I shift the bad vibes that seem all around? Where do I – and you! – have the power to bridge this division?</p> <p>There are a couple of small things that are within our control to change that could have a major impact on the way we come together as a society to solve big problems. But in order to solve big problems, we need to get more practised at interacting with people who have opposing points of view.</p> <h2><strong>Not having an opinion on everything</strong></h2> <p>It used to be that most people had strong opinions on one or two areas of interest (high-speed rail! Coaching strategies at the Essendon Football Club!) but in the last 10 years the world has started inviting our opinions on everything, even on things we don’t know much about.</p> <p>This accelerated when popular online platforms tied news to social media and we had the option of commenting on every single post on our friends’ pages, which means we are essentially invited to have an opinion on everything.</p> <p>But having an opinion on everything is not natural or normal.</p> <p>The great Roman Stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius said almost 2000 years ago: “You always own the option of having no opinion. There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can’t control. These things are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone.”</p> <p>Leave them alone!</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you put down your weapons, relax and have nothing to prove, then you can work towards a consensus on the big issues</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Having a strong opinion on everything creates a volatile, febrile atmosphere where you are constantly stating, defending and arguing your opinion, often on platforms such as Twitter where context has been collapsed<strong> </strong>in 280 characters.</p> <p>The opinion becomes tied to the ego, your opinion <em>becomes</em> you – and so an attack on your opinion is an attack on the very fibre of your being. So, vigilant and anxious, you must defend opinion as you would defend yourself. This then creates a binary: people who agree with you are good and people who disagree are bad.</p> <p>By leaving things alone, by not getting worked up, we are not adding to the toxic load of disagreement, hate and fury online, which of course seeps into people’s real life.</p> <h2><strong>Be </strong><strong>OK with being wrong</strong></h2> <p>It’s liberating when you relinquish the need to be right all the time. The ability to wheel back on your positions, to take in new information, to see a different point of view, be curious about alternatives, to say “I was wrong” or “I’ve changed my mind” is to erode those hard binaries, the Us vs Them that so many of us have found ourselves stuck in over the last few years. When you put down your weapons, relax and have nothing to prove, then you can work towards a consensus on the big issues. How can there be real change in society when people don’t listen to each other or have an empathetic approach to other positions?</p> <h2><strong>Breaking bread with people you disagree with</strong></h2> <p>If there’s something that’s really gone out of style, it’s having people over for dinner parties and the night ending in passionate political debate.</p> <p>It used to happen a lot, and although the arguments (Iraq! Socialism! Carbon rationing!) would get heated, it would rarely be unbearable. Most guests and their hosts could handle an opposing point of view and not let it ruin their night. In fact, opposing points of view were necessary to make for good table discussion and facilitate genuine intellectual and ideological shifts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/16/i-was-longing-for-beatnik-freedom-so-i-took-an-overnight-bus-to-yamba\">I was longing for beatnik freedom – so I took an overnight bus to Yamba | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in the last few years I’ve spoken to scores of people who now just won’t talk politics with those who have an opposing view. Whole members of their social circle are on non-speaking terms because their political views raise their hackles. Any conversation has to be kept mild and superficial so as to stop the geyser of political convictions from exploding and making everyone upset.</p> <p>Over the last few years, many of us have lost our ability and tolerance to withstand opposition and remain friendly with the opponent. It’s no surprise there has been a real decline of the dinner party. Walking on eggshells or having everyone agree with you all the time makes for a dull evening.</p> <p>But breaking bread with people you disagree with and disagreeing civilly is a crucial step to understanding different points of view and sharpening your own rhetorical skills, convictions and capacity for persuasion when arguing your own corner.</p> <p>Like any suggestion, keeping an open mind has its limits. There is a time to listen to other points of view, and also a time to take a stand. Taking a more conciliatory approach to other views doesn’t mean accepting, say, injustice, fascism or climate change denialism. (Or as EE Cummings and others have said: “Don’t be so open minded that your brains fall out.”) </p> <p>But the increasingly rigid way we hold ourselves apart from “them”, the unyielding position of being right can only win over so many, before the “them” becomes immovable and hardened.</p> <p>“We must love one another or die”, wrote WH Auden in a despairing poem written in response to the start of the second world war. It’s always been our only way. </p> <p>• Brigid Delaney is the author of <strong> </strong>Reasons Not to Worry (Allen and Unwin) about how using Stoic philosophy can make you more chill.

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jay-carmichael\">Jay Carmichael</a>’s novel Marlo – set in Melbourne in the 1950s – he attempts a correction, breathing into sharper focus the gay men demonised and criminalised as “sexual perverts” in the annals of Australia’s past.</p> <p>Carmichael’s popular debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/27/from-cow-stories-to-the-history-of-humanity-what-you-should-read-in-may\">Ironbark</a>, was shortlisted for 2016 Victorian premier’s unpublished manuscript award – and was so deftly written it made Christos Tsiolkas jealous. It was a cutting, artfully restrained tale of a young gay man coming of age in a small country town, enduring grief, a crisis of identity and unfulfilled desires. Similar themes populate the author’s second book, Marlo, which also centres a young gay man, Christopher, who has uprooted from the “quiet pastures” of regional Victoria for the bustle of the city.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/05/every-version-of-you-by-grace-chan-review-would-you-want-to-live-in-the-metaverse\">Every Version of You by Grace Chan review – would you want to live in the metaverse?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Christopher is a reserved, solitary figure. His mother dead and father absent, he’s in search of belonging, though he finds Melbourne hostile: “a space that was not intended for me”. He knows there are people like him, men with similar hungers – he reads about them in the paper: “<em>Turned in by an anonymous witness. Arrested by police. Charged with committing an act of gross indecency with each other</em>.” In Marlo, faithful to Australia’s punitive past, homosexuality is not only illegal (in Victoria, anal sex was punishable by death until 1949; it remained a crime until 1981) but seen as a “gross indecency”, a medical anomaly, something abhorrent.</p> <p>Despite this, Christopher remains perpetually searching. He is introduced to the city’s queer nooks and venturing into the gardens where men have sex in the shadows – while avoiding those who will arrest or beat them for it. But it is only upon his meeting Morgan, a gay Indigenous man, that he truly finds “a connection in an otherwise alien landscape”. They start a tentative relationship and Marlo’s focus – and enduring appeal – is the slackening and pulling taut of its tensions: of two men attempting to cleave for themselves a sense of safety and normalcy.</p> <p>Marlo<em> </em>is framed by real historical material: court snippets and photographs populate the novel – albeit in a somewhat haphazard and dislocated manner. More subtle and affecting are the absences we’re guided to: history’s lacunae, records that never survived or perhaps went unwritten. When Christopher burns his amorous love letters to Morgan, fearing them evidence of sodomy, he laments that “the only words that remained” of their lives would be those of newspaper headlines. He rages against it: “the words, the ink – the heavy ink – coated my tongue, clouded my eyes like cataracts.”</p> <p>Yet Carmichael does not allow his lovers to succumb to tragedy, trauma, death – motifs of the “bury your gays” trope of queer characters. (The trend predates even Marlo’s era, when prohibitions against glorifying homosexuality in literature forced writers to demonise or kill off their gay characters.) In his author’s note, Carmichael quotes Dennis Altman’s Homosexual, regarding how “most attempts to see homosexuality in a broader context have tended to reinforce social opprobrium and homosexual misery”.<strong> </strong>Christopher and Morgan face tribulations but they are not defined by or sacrificed to them.</p> <p>Carmichael’s prose achieves a quality seemingly ordinary but desirable in fiction: it is recognisable. His restrained tempo feels like a sine wave – its pace oscillating, never dragging or rushing – while his imagery remains simple, clear: groups of people scattered on lawn “as if confetti”; a man’s seductive wink “a lure trawling deep water”. It’s a shame the author falters in his trust of the reader occasionally, over-explaining and denuding a sentence (when a character drags on a cigarette, for example, we’re told “closed eyes suggested equilibrium, while a lengthy exhale of white smoke conveyed pure relief”). It can feel at times like reading by numbers.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/saved-for-later\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Saved for Later\" data-form-description=\"Weekly lifestyle and culture picks from Guardian Australia\" data-form-campaign-code=\"UK_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Get a week’s worth of must-reads, trends and pop-culture in your inbox\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is an air of hesitancy sometimes, too. Morgan’s experience as an Indigenous gay man is handled sensitively yet we learn little of his family, culture, country or language – as if Carmichael is wary of overstepping. The author does touch, lightly but effectively, on intersectional marginalities and the ignorance of white society via the naivety of his protagonist. One of Marlo’s more astute pieces of dialogue intertwines the ostensible romance of their first encounter with the reality of the racial power dynamics of the era. As Morgan explains to Christopher, an Indigenous man would not lightly refuse a white man’s interest: “I didn’t think I’d ever see you again, then you invited me on the train ride home – and, well, I couldn’t say no.”</p> <p>Carmichael’s control and poetic timbre are Marlo’s strengths, and there’s doubtless influence here from the works of Tsiolkas and Patrick White. But compared with Ironbark, which stemmed so viscerally, and so poignantly, from memoir, the novel feels less grounded, thinner (quite literally: Marlo is a slim read). It is still affecting. Carmichael writes how there is no “holistic account of the lived experiences” of gay men in the 40s and 50s: “Such lives must largely be inferred.” Marlo, then, is a rebuke, disrupting archival stasis to bring alive two lovers – men who to history may have been mere statistics.

If you let things go they’ll get worse and basically you see that your life expectancy will decline.”</p> <p>Sitka said it is “frightening” to feel as if the “health system is collapsing around you” while entering old age, especially as she has no children to advocate on her behalf.</p> <p>Yates said no pensioner should need to beg to be bulk billed for a life-saving treatment. If GPs charge patients for an appointment to access antivirals “I think that is appalling and unethical,” he said.</p> <p>“These antivirals have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of death and severe symptoms. To place that at risk for a $40 copayment is morally bankrupt, unethical and should be publicly called out. I also think it should be treated as a breach of professional standards.”</p> <p>GP and president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Adj Prof Karen Price, said Yates’s comments “are unhelpful and sadly reflect upon why we have a workforce shortage, when such a complex issue as healthcare funding is reduced to a simple issue of blame”.</p> <p>“Mr Yates is sadly falling into the common trap of blaming GPs for years of underfunding by the commonwealth,” she said. “I am surprised he has done so given his own sector in aged care has suffered the same fate, which resulted in a royal commission showing decades of poor policy, cost cutting and failing standards. </p> <p>Price said GPs are doing their best to run practices amid rising costs and inadequate Medicare rebates.</p> <p>“Each GP has to make difficult billing decisions based on their individual circumstances. The college would be more than willing to meet with Mr Yates and talk through the pressures being faced by GPs and general practice teams across Australia. But now is not the time to criticise GPs or threaten them with expulsion or any other punishment.”</p> <p>Asked if all GPs should be required to bulk bill patients needing antivirals, given it is vulnerable people who are eligible for them, the Australian Medical Association vice-president and Sydney GP, Dr Danielle McMullin, said: “GPs do everything we can to make sure that our vulnerable patients in particular don’t have cost barriers to access.”</p> <p>“But GPs have been required throughout this pandemic to repeatedly put their hands into the pockets of their businesses to keep their practices running,” she said.</p> <p>“There were a number of occasions where for vaccines we are required to bulk bill, for a long time for telephone consults we were required to bulk bill, and it’s an unsustainable plan to constantly require and to force general practitioners to discount their services.”</p> <p>She said patients concerned about the price of an appointment should discuss it with their GP.</p> <p>“It is challenging to have to have a conversation about money with your doctor, but if finances are a barrier, then do talk to your GP and sometimes on a case-by-case basis bulk billing can be discussed. GPs really do want to help.”</p> <p>RACGP vice-president and GP, Dr Bruce Willett, said while pharmacist groups may point to the cost of GP consultations as a reason why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/11/selling-covid-antivirals-over-the-counter-could-compromise-patient-safety-australian-doctors-say\">Covid-19 antiviral treatments should be available from community pharmacies</a> without a prescription, this would be “a recipe for disaster”.</p> <p>“Covid-19 oral antiviral treatments are not without risk,” he said. “GPs are the key to safely prescribing these treatments to all patients. We have a strong and, in many cases, longstanding connection with our patients and we know their health history, including existing health conditions or other factors which may impact their eligibility for the treatments.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/timor-leste-warns-it-will-work-with-china-if-australia-insists-on-pumping-timor-sea-gas-to-darwin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T17:30:52Z","webTitle":"Timor-Leste warns it will work with China if Australia insists on pumping Timor Sea gas to Darwin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/timor-leste-warns-it-will-work-with-china-if-australia-insists-on-pumping-timor-sea-gas-to-darwin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/timor-leste-warns-it-will-work-with-china-if-australia-insists-on-pumping-timor-sea-gas-to-darwin","fields":{"headline":"Timor-Leste warns it will work with China if Australia insists on pumping Timor Sea gas to Darwin","trailText":"<strong>Exclusive:</strong> President José Ramos-Horta says his country’s leadership ‘has to make decisions … if necessary a trip to China’","byline":"Christopher Knaus","body":"<p>Timor-Leste’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/timor-leste-presidential-election-jose-ramos-horta-wins-in-landslide\">president, José Ramos-Horta</a>, has warned his nation will seek Chinese support if Australia and Woodside Energy fail to back a gas pipeline between the resource-rich Timor Sea and his country’s southern shore, rather than Darwin.</p> <p>Ramos-Horta has warned Timor-Leste – Australia’s neighbour and ally – would “absolutely” look to Chinese investment to secure what he says is the “national strategic goal” of piping gas from the Greater Sunrise fields to his nation’s coast.

They do not deserve universities that are starved of money","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>If ever there was a cohort of school leavers who deserved congratulations on their A-level results, it is surely the class of 2022, who received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/a-level-results-2022-what-we-know-so-far\" title=\"\">their grades</a> on Thursday. No group of sixth formers in postwar Britain has suffered a more disrupted education than they have. The Covid pandemic left prolonged and ineradicable marks on their schooling. It ruptured their teaching and disturbed their study, their exams and their university applications. It also had an often traumatic impact on their home lives, those of their families and friends, and their own development into young adults. There were also very many direct sufferers from the virus itself, although relatively fewer serious cases.</p> <p>In spite of all this, the 2022 A-level class have made the grade. They should wear their achievement as a generational badge of honour. This is also the conclusion to be drawn from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/live/2022/aug/18/a-level-exam-results-day-2022-live-ucas-university-clearing\" title=\"\">the results</a> in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as a whole. Nearly 426,000 students had their university places confirmed on Thursday. This is a slight fall from last year, but it is also overwhelming evidence that there remains huge public demand for higher education in modern Britain, which the pandemic and its associated disruptions has done little to deflect. Significantly, demand is higher than ever among the most socially disadvantaged students too, whose acceptance numbers went up, not down. In the 2020s, education remains the springboard to social mobility.</p> <p>This year’s grades were lower overall than in 2021. The top A and A* grades were down by 8.4%. This is unsurprising, since these 2022 grades were based on exams, while those of 2021 were not. The system, in short, is correcting itself. Teacher assessment has always tended to be more generous, and the generosity of teachers in the private school system was particularly marked in 2021 in comparison with the relatively more demanding state sector. Grade inflation certainly needs to be monitored everywhere that it occurs, but it does not discredit the system, and it is wrong to pretend that it does.</p> <p>Those who are concerned about the education system should look instead at the social and geographical divides in these results. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/there-is-very-little-to-celebrate-about-these-a-level-results-inequalities-just-got-worse\" title=\"\">a shameful gap</a>, as ever, between the privileged private and underprivileged state sectors, with students at the former almost as twice as likely to get an A or A*. But there are important <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/a-level-results-a-and-a-star-grades-fall-sharply\" title=\"\">geographical disparities</a> too, with a widening attainment gap between the relatively prosperous south-east and London compared with the north-east. This reflects longstanding disparities in investment. It confirms that levelling up the life chances of this and the next generation has a long way to go.</p> <p>This is a transitional year for higher education in Britain after Covid’s disruptions. But a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/why-a-level-results-far-from-return-pre-covid-normality\" title=\"\">transition to what</a>? Not pre-Covid conditions. Both secondary and higher education instead seem candidates for government spending cuts this winter. The underinvestment just noted in the north-east is likely to be replicated elsewhere in the coming years. Universities, which are heavily dependent on domestic <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-62237170\" title=\"\">fee income</a> that the Treasury will not want to increase (and may try to cut), are already facing a real-terms decline as inflation moves above 10% and fees remain frozen. This will increase the pressure on them to expand their overseas student intake, where higher fees apply. School leavers and their families rightly continue to see university education as the route to a better life. Government policy ensures that universities will struggle to meet public demand.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/19/bosch-rockit-review-a-sentimental-and-cheesy-byron-bay-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T17:30:52Z","webTitle":"Bosch & Rockit review – a sentimental and cheesy Byron Bay drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/19/bosch-rockit-review-a-sentimental-and-cheesy-byron-bay-drama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/19/bosch-rockit-review-a-sentimental-and-cheesy-byron-bay-drama","fields":{"headline":"Bosch & Rockit review – a sentimental and cheesy Byron Bay drama","trailText":"Luke Hemsworth and Rasmus King aren’t to blame for the problems in this film, about a surfing drug dealer and his son who are forced to move after a bushfire","byline":"Luke Buckmaster","body":"<p>Having amassed bad debts and upset the wrong people, a protagonist with a habit of making poor decisions goes on the run and relocates to a small town, hoping to start afresh – until the past inevitably catches up. This evergreen story trajectory is once again rehashed, in Tyler Atkins’ cloying and sometimes flat-out cheesy film Bosch &amp; Rockit. Opening with the words “inspired by true events”, Atkins goes on to demonstrate why these words tend to mean very little: a well-crafted, entirely fictitious feature can feel much more plausible than a goofily executed one – like Bosch &amp; Rockit – claiming some connection to reality.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzQ_1dFnsE0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DzQ_1dFnsE0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Early in the runtime the titular father (Bosch) and son (Rockit), played by Luke Hemsworth and Rasmus King, hit the beach, catching waves in a tender scene bathed in dawn’s early light, piano keys and stringed instruments providing soft orchestral accompaniment.<em> </em>As if the moment weren’t idyllic enough, Atkins cuts to a school of dolphins in the water, swimming in unison.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/11/6-festivals-review-schmaltzy-coming-of-age-drama-goes-for-the-heartstrings\">6 Festivals review – schmaltzy coming-of-age drama goes for the heartstrings </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Right after this … the shark attacks! Just kidding; that’s a different movie and one I might have enjoyed more. And, yes, I made this <em>exact same joke</em> (except it involved a crocodile instead of a shark) in my review of the coming-of-age drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/11/6-festivals-review-schmaltzy-coming-of-age-drama-goes-for-the-heartstrings\">6 Festivals</a>, which also stars King. My intention isn’t to repeat myself but to make a link between the gooey sentimentality in both films. King is a vibrant presence with great potential, and a preternatural ability to appear healthy despite being exposed to dangerous amounts of cheese. The faults in both these films aren’t his – and the same can be said of Hemsworth, who won’t be winning any acting awards as Bosch but is still convincing as a thickheaded and selfish, yet rascally blokey bloke.</p> <p>While 6 Festivals is consistently wishy-washy, some of the dialogue exchanges in Bosch &amp; Rockit feel as though they belong in different movies. Sometimes the characters speak as though they might be relatives of Johnny “Spit” Spitieri from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/10/gettin-square-rewatched-david-wenhams-show-stealing-johnny-spitieri\">Gettin’ Square</a>. In one scene Bosch cuts himself and exclaims, “Oh, you fuckin’ cunt!” Young Rockit hears him and spits back: “Oy, cunt, watch ya fuckin’ tongue!” </p> <p>At other times, the dialogue is closer to the tone of Nicholas Sparks. “I’ve made a lot of mistakes but you’re the best thing that ever happened to me,” Bosch tells his son in one scene. In another, Rockit explains where his name comes from by stating “My dad likes to say it’s because I’m out of this world.” <em>Cringe.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d612b6e689567458dc1231ff250d62ae3d0eda9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d612b6e689567458dc1231ff250d62ae3d0eda9e/0_1_5318_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rasmus King\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A vibrant presence with great potential’ … Rasmus King.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bosch is a drug dealer and surfer who leaves town, Rockit in tow, when a bushfire hits his property and he loses his stash. The pair’s relocation to Byron Bay is a significant event in their lives but there’s little sense of stakes, and to the audience it feels as though the film is merely exchanging one picturesque coastal location for another.</p> <p>Atkins uses these settings as pretty scaffolding for otherwise ordinary scenes – such as Rockit eating hot chips with a love interest named Ash-Ash (Savannah La Rain). Immediately afterwards, Atkins cuts to a pair of whales majestically turning in the water. The director lays it on thick, in other words. But it gets worse: the young pair continue talking until dusk, beneath an orange-pink sky, with Ash-Ash delivering a sad speech about never meeting her father and how her biological mother “got really sick and couldn’t take care of me”.</p> <p>At this point, having been exposed to so many dolphins and whales, and all that dewy-eyed dialogue, I thought I could no longer be surprised by this film’s cheesiness. I was wrong. The scene ends with Rockit asking Ash-Ash to “stay a little longer — just ’til we catch a shooting star”.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Bosch &amp; Rockit is in cinemas around Australia now</em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/19/follow-the-sun-where-to-holiday-to-escape-australias-third-la-nina","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T17:30:52Z","webTitle":"Follow the sun: where to holiday to escape Australia’s third La Niña","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/19/follow-the-sun-where-to-holiday-to-escape-australias-third-la-nina","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/19/follow-the-sun-where-to-holiday-to-escape-australias-third-la-nina","fields":{"headline":"Follow the sun: where to holiday to escape Australia’s third La Niña","trailText":"Parts of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania are less likely to see wet weather heading into the warmer months","byline":"Caitlin Cassidy","body":"<p>Australia may be about to experience a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/eastern-australia-faces-wet-weather-and-flooding-with-70-chance-of-third-consecutive-la-nina\">rare third La Niña</a> this spring, but the outlook is sunnier – literally – for parts of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania.</p> \n<p>The Bureau of Meteorology issued an alert on Tuesday for above-average rainfall through to December for around two-thirds of the nation, including the east coast, due to a negative Indian Ocean dipole and warmer than average waters in Australia’s north.</p> \n<p>But there are large parts of the country, particularly in the west, that are likely to escape prolonged wet weather in the warmer months.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d0dfc9b865df17c79b6e002f7c59b1660972222\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0dfc9b865df17c79b6e002f7c59b1660972222/0_0_1085_726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rain forecast median national season, September - November 2022\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>“September to November rainfall is likely to be above median for most of Australia, but below median for western Tasmania and parts of north-western and south-western Western Australia,” the BoM projected in its latest climate outlook.</p> \n<p>“September to November maximum temperatures are likely to be above median for the tropics, parts of the west and Tasmania, but below median for much of the southern mainland.”</p> \n<p>The Weatherzone meteorologist Ben Domensino said Western Australia and parts of South Australia were likely to experience the least rain due to lower median rainfall in spring.</p> \n<p>He said the average rainfall in Perth during spring was around 150mm, typically one of the driest times in the south-west.</p> \n<p>“Western Tasmania, on the other hand, is usually quite wet,” he said, averaging around 400mm in some parts.</p> \n<p>“Everywhere over the eastern half of Australia except western Tasmania has above average chance of exceeding high rainfall.

It was about stubborn fat in areas that wouldn’t budge. It said no downtime, no surgery and … I drank the magic potion, and I would because I’m a little vain. So I went for it – and it backfired.”</p> <p>Evangelista, 57, said she had tried various methods to correct the rare post-procedural complication, known as paradoxical adipose hyperplasia. She had two rounds of liposuction and, at one point, she stopped eating.</p> <p>“I was so embarrassed, I’d just spent all this money and the only way I could think of to fix it was zero calories, and so I just drank water. Or sometimes I would have a stick of celery or one apple,” she said. “I was losing my mind.”</p> <p>Paradoxical adipose hyperplasia, which is rare, occurs when freezing fat cells engenders a reaction in fatty tissue which causes the cells to expand rather than break down.</p> <p>Evangelista said she is now “trying to love myself as I am”, but still regrets the procedure. “If I had known side-effects may include losing your livelihood and you’ll end up so depressed that you hate yourself … I wouldn’t have taken that risk.”</p> <p>She said she still suffered the psychological effects from the botched surgery, but had received help from her friends.</p> <p>“Am I cured mentally? Absolutely not,” she said. “But I’m so grateful for the support I got from my friends and from my industry … You’re not going to see me in a swimsuit, that’s for sure. It’s going to be difficult to find jobs with things protruding from me; without retouching, or squeezing into things, or taping things or compressing or tricking.”</p> <p>In the images for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/vogue\">Vogue</a>, taken by the veteran photographer Steven Meisel, Evangelista looks recognisably glamorous, although notably covered up. The model was keen to make clear this was not an accurate representation.</p> <p>“That’s not my jaw and neck in real life – and I can’t walk around with tape and elastics everywhere,” said Evangelista in the interview. “You know what, I’m trying to love myself as I am, but for the photos … Look, for photos I always think we’re here to create fantasies.”</p> <p>Evangelista was one of the original supermodels – in 1990 she famously quipped “we don’t wake up for less than $10,000 a day” – but the reality behind the glamour of this era is now being divulged.</p> <p>After Kate Moss spoke out about her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jul/24/kate-moss-desert-island-discs-cocaine-use-johnny-depp\">experiences as a young model</a> on Desert Island Discs in July, Evangelista also shared a story of taking a modelling contract in Japan when she was 16.</p> <p>“I went to the agency and it was all, ‘take your clothes off, we need your measurements’, but they already had my measurements,” she said. “They wanted me naked and it wasn’t a ‘would you do nudes’ conversation, it was a ‘you will do nudes’. I left and called my mother and she said, ‘Get out now and get to the embassy.’ So that’s what I did, and they got me home.”</p> <p>The model originally talked about her experiences with CoolSculpting on Instagram in September 2021. She then sued Zeltiq Aesthetics, the company behind CoolSculpting, citing grievous injuries, for $50m (£42m). <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/linda-evangelista-cosmetic-lawsuit-settled-intl-scli/index.html\">The suit was settled last month</a> for an undisclosed amount.</p> <p>This Vogue cover is the second high-profile shoot she has completed in the past year. In July, she appeared in advertising for the luxury brand Fendi, also shot by Steven Meisel.</p> <p>In a statement to Vogue, a US-based representative for Zeltiq said: “We are pleased to have resolved this matter with Ms Evangelista.</p> <p>“Our focus continues to be on empowering confidence by providing safe, reliable aesthetics products and services backed by science. CoolSculpting is an FDA-cleared, non-invasive treatment for visible fat bulges in nine areas of the body.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/18/raf-is-unashamed-of-its-diversity-targets-says-head-of-recruitment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T17:28:31Z","webTitle":"RAF is ‘unashamed’ of its diversity targets, says head of recruitment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/raf-is-unashamed-of-its-diversity-targets-says-head-of-recruitment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/raf-is-unashamed-of-its-diversity-targets-says-head-of-recruitment","fields":{"headline":"RAF is ‘unashamed’ of its diversity targets, says head of recruitment","trailText":"Maria Byford defends policy and MoD says ‘no standards will be lowered’ after concerns fighting strength could be undermined","byline":"Caroline Davies","body":"<p>The woman in charge of RAF recruitment has said she is “unashamed” of a policy that critics claim could mean women and people from ethnic minorities being prioritised over white men.</p> <p>Air Vice-Marshall Maria Byford said she had “slowed” down the recruitment process for all candidates after figures showed the RAF was not hitting diversity targets.</p> <p>Her comments followed the resignation of an unnamed female group captain, who ran the recruitment department at RAF Cranwell, apparently over concerns the fighting strength of the RAF could be undermined by “impossible” targets, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/raf-pauses-job-offers-for-white-men-to-meet-impossible-diversity-targets-12674409\">Sky News reported</a>.</p> <p>An MoD spokesperson said: “No standards will be lowered for any group to get into the RAF. Basic training courses will be full when they commence. There is no threat to the RAF’s operational effectiveness.”</p> <p>Byford, chief of staff personnel and one of the most senior females officers in the air force, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/raf-diversity-targets-recruiting-chief-tkjsfcch6\">told The Times</a> she had slowed down the recruitment process ahead of a meeting of the RAF board next month.</p> <p>The board meeting would look at ways to use “positive action” legally so recruits could potentially be selected on merit, their gender or ethnicity if they passed the basic requirements to join the service, she said.</p> <p>“I want the best people. So I need the best people to join to achieve the best they can during their service career and we get … what we need from an operational capability perspective. And if I can include more women and more people from different backgrounds in that I think I have a better service in the long run. We are unashamed about doing that because I think that’s a good thing,” she told The Times.</p> <p>She said the RAF had been “just shy” of meeting its diversity targets for recruitment this year of 25% women and 12% people from ethnic minorities, falling short by 5 percentage points and 4-5 percentage points respectively. So, she said, she had asked her recruitment team based at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire to stop filling up the training courses until early September.</p> <p>The board would “not necessarily” prioritise women and minority-ethnic recruits over white men, she said, responding to critics who have accused the RAF of “wokery” and policies that are “little short of an illegal campaign of institutional sexism and racism against white male officers”.</p> <p>She also disputed allegations that the RAF’s operational requirements could be affected by the diversity drive. The RAF aims to increase the proportion of female recruits to 40% by 2040 and that of people from ethnic minorities to 20%, which are more ambitious goals than the army or Royal Navy.</p> <p>The military overall is raising its targets for recruiting more people from ethnically diverse backgrounds, according to an official MoD race action plan <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/08/17/military-prepares-new-push-diversity/\">seen by the Telegraph</a>.</p> <p>The document reportedly calls for “more ambitious targets … to tackle under-representation” by March. But it is said to have provoked a row within the government. One military source reportedly accused the Ministry of Defence of pursuing a diversity “obsession” at a time when Britain faced its gravest threat since the second world war, the Telegraph said.</p> <p>An MoD spokesperson said: “We maintain a laser focus in our response to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and our operations are always top priority. We also work to broaden the diversity of our armed forces to reflect the society they serve and to create an inclusive work environment that retains top talent.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-rare-earths-mining-them-cant-cost-the-earth","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T17:25:52Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on rare earths: mining them can’t cost the Earth | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-rare-earths-mining-them-cant-cost-the-earth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-rare-earths-mining-them-cant-cost-the-earth","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on rare earths: mining them can’t cost the Earth","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> It will be no good if in transitioning to climate neutrality, large tracts of the planet are left uninhabitable by the mining of key raw materials","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>Rare earth elements may be in short supply but they are not rare.

Crucially, climate solutions – such as solar energy, wind energy and electric vehicles – depend on rare earth elements, which have unique magnetic and luminescent properties. The trouble is that their production and disposal is environmentally destructive. It is worrying, therefore, that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/363c1643-75ae-4539-897d-ab16adfc1416\" title=\"\">European Union this week</a> said that it wants lower regulatory barriers to mining raw materials needed for a green transition.</p> <p>To get to net zero, Europe will require up to <a href=\"https://www.mining-technology.com/analysis/critical-metals-supply-gap-europe/\" title=\"\">26 times</a> the amount of rare earth metals in 2050 compared with today. Demand is also increasing because of digitalisation. The EU, like the UK, is dependent on imports, while the geopolitics of supply chains are increasingly unstable. China is the world’s largest producer of rare earths. Russia is the fourth-largest supplier. The west views this as a <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3168231/us-china-trade-will-bidens-call-break-free-china-rare-earths\" title=\"\">significant</a> potential threat to its security of supply. Given Russia’s attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/15/gas-blackmail-how-putins-weaponised-energy-supplies-are-hurting-europe\" title=\"\">weaponise</a> its gas supplies, this is not an unreasonable belief.</p> <p>Consumers would notice if supplies were disrupted. Rare earths are critical to clean energy technologies used today; every Toyota Prius has more than <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/cars/article/2009-09/your-prius-hogging-all-rare-metals/\" title=\"\">9kg (20lb) of lanthanum</a> in its battery. It’s not only the future of the planet at stake, it’s the future of our defence too. Nato is almost 100% dependent on rare earth imports from China. A US Virginia-class <a href=\"https://www.baks.bund.de/sites/baks010/files/working_paper_2019_13.pdf\" title=\"\">submarine</a> requires about four tonnes of rare earth materials. China has been willing to use key minerals as a political weapon. After tensions between <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html\" title=\"\">Beijing and Tokyo</a> boiled over in 2010, China blocked rare earth exports to Japan.</p> <p>Mining for rare earth minerals generates large volumes of toxic and radioactive material. The transition to climate neutrality cannot mean replacing a reliance on dirty fossil fuels with a dependence on raw materials, the extraction of which leaves large tracts of the Earth uninhabitable.

Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/iphone/iPhone_12_PER_Oct2020.pdf\" title=\"\">iPhone 12</a> is made from 98% reused rare earths.

This cannot end up costing the Earth. China established its dominance over the rare earths industry because of lax environmental regulations and a cheap workforce. It has paid a high price.

His five-year-old grey mare, Alpinista, had just held off a strong challenge from Tuesday, this year’s Oaks winner, to win the Group One Yorkshire Oaks. She will now head to Longchamp in less than two months as one of the favourites for the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe.</p> \n<p>It is hard to imagine a more popular winner. Prescott has sent out more than 1,300 winners since taking over the licence at Newmarket’s historic Heath House stable in 1970, when he was the youngest trainer in racing’s HQ by 19 years. Prescott has won Group Ones in Britain, Ireland, Germany and France, saddled the two-year-old Spindrifter to win no fewer than 13 times in 1980, and worked his way through 10 Cuban cigars a day for decades until finally – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/attheraces/status/889894948383985665?s=21&amp;t=cV3BzvSxBJGVvS0EWJ6nyA\">and somewhat apologetically</a> – giving up five years ago.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/horse-racing-baaeed-juddmonte-stakes-york\">Baaeed stays unbeaten with Juddmonte Stakes win but finish line is in sight</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Until now, though, the famously engaging master of Heath House has not had a horse with a genuine chance to win European racing’s showpiece event. “We had Foreign Affairs [in 2001],” he recalled. “We supplemented him for a jolly. He won the Magnet here and finished second in the Ebor, then the owners played up their money and they had a fantastic time.”</p> \n<p>Alpinista, however, is a genuine contender, and the living embodiment of Prescott’s famous care and patience with his horses, having progressed with every run for the last two seasons. She had only a length in hand of Tuesday at the line, but never seemed likely to surrender the lead after Luke Morris sent her on about two furlongs out.</p> \n<p>Two years ago, Alpinista finished five lengths behind Love in the same race so Thursday’s win highlighted her improvement since, completing what is now a five-race winning streak at Group One level that includes a defeat of Torquator Tasso, the subsequent Arc winner, in Germany last season.</p> \n<p>“She’s a marvellous filly, she’s improved all the time and her great gift is that she’s very straightforward,” Prescott said. “She goes on more or less any ground, you can hold her up or make the running. She’s not worrying, she’s not boiling over, she’s not off her grub, she’s not lame – all the things that these horses do, so far, we’ve escaped. It’s like people, if they’re very straightforward, it’s amazing what you can do.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c2ff1ceb3e8abbeb14f1c5e3f42bd253bbe186b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c2ff1ceb3e8abbeb14f1c5e3f42bd253bbe186b/0_0_3141_2306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Mark Prescott after the Yorkshire Oaks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"734\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Mark Prescott after the Yorkshire Oaks.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugh Routledge/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Like several of the best horses to pass through Prescott’s hands, Alpinista runs in the green and white colours of Kirsten Rausing, who has owned five generations of the mare’s family. In an unusually open Arc market, she is now one of just three horses at single-figure odds – assuming that Baaeed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/17/horse-racing-baaeed-juddmonte-stakes-york\">Wednesday’s International Stakes winner</a>, misses the race – and can be backed at around 8-1, just behind Titleholder (6-1) and Torquator Tasso (7-1).</p> \n<p>“I think she’ll go straight to the Arc,” Prescott said. “She’s just good enough to go close. It’s there, you’ve got a chance, and therefore you must go. I just wouldn’t want it very, very soft. It’s been dry for so long now that I’m expecting a swimming race, but there you are.”</p> \n<h2>TV tips for Friday</h2> \n<p>It is 15 years since Kingsgate Native became the last juvenile to win the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes and eight two-year-olds have tried and failed to emulate him since. Few arrived on the Knavesmire with such obvious claims at The Platinum Queen, though, and Richard Fahey’s filly is an excellent bet for Friday’s feature race at around 3-1.</p> \n<p>The Platinum Queen has won three times from four starts to date and picked up £38,190 in prize money for the Middleham Park Racing syndicate which owns her. That has effectively been gambled on her run in Friday’s race, as her supplementary entry cost £40,000. The only blip on her record so far was a no-show in the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot, when she got an early bump and failed to recover.</p> \n<p>But <strong>The Platinum Queen (3.35)</strong> has built on that experience in two subsequent wins and gets 22lb from the favourite, Royal Acclaim.

This is how we see it, 16 August</a>).</p> <p>The island of Taiwan has indeed been inhabited by humans for thousands of years, but the Han Chinese only started settling there in the late 13th century. This hardly counts as “ancient times” in terms of the 3,200-year recorded history of China (dating from the earliest Chinese written documents, the <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/memoryoftheworld/registry/511\" title=\"\">oracle bone inscriptions</a>), not to mention the much, much earlier history of continuous settlement in mainland China, for which there is ample evidence in archaeological records.</p> <p>In any case, political boundaries have been fluid throughout history, and part of being a mature culture involves understanding that point.

In ancient times, Taiwan was inhabited entirely by Austronesians who found their cultural links to the island peoples to the south and east. When the Dutch set up their small colonial operations in southern Taiwan in the early 17th century, occupying a tiny area, there was little Chinese presence on the island.</p> <p>After the Dutch were ousted by Chinese rebel forces, looking for a safe haven, Taiwan remained on the very edges of Chinese rule for a century and a half. It became a nominal province only at the end of the 19th century, and then grudgingly so. When Japan defeated China in the first Sino-Japanese war (1895), Beijing handed over Taiwan (but not its north-east provinces) to Japan “in perpetuity”.

For some, selling your shareholdings in fossil fuel companies to someone else might be appropriate.

In fact, the board has also gone further and won’t own any debt issued by those companies to invest in any future exploration.</p> <p>The board’s current investments represent less than a third of 1% of the total fund.

Consent documents described “a series of stand-alone buildings, including a lodge for visitor accommodation for up to 24 guests, accommodation pod for the owner, together with associated lodge management buildings, infrastructure, landscape treatment, water features and meditation space”.</p> <p>Plans for the meditation pod were scrapped from the final proposal, but the earthworks required to build the lodge would still cover more than 73,700 sq metres (18 acres) of land. The structure was designed by the Japanese architects Kengo Kuma and Associates, who created the Tokyo Olympic stadium.</p> <p>Thiel’s proposal was to build the lodge at Mount Alpha, which is classed as an “outstanding natural landscape” in New Zealand, and subject to special protections.

That is why they are dangerous”.</p> <p>One bank board member also told the Guardian the UK also risked “looking a bit silly internationally” by rowing back on financial crisis-era reforms. “There’s quite a risk that people say, ‘Well, what are they doing, here, you know? Can’t they make up their mind?’</p> <p>“Most people think that we should be focusing on the substance, not on the structure,” the board member said, adding that the City was unlikely to welcome further uncertainty after Brexit.</p> <p>Any plans to reintegrate the supervisors is likely to raise eyebrows, just as the UK steels itself for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/17/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis-recession-looms\">another economic downturn sparked by surging inflation. </a>The decision could also face criticism if it results in job and cost cuts that risk further neutering the UK regulators. The PRA has about 1,350 staff, while the PSR operated with about 130 employees. The FCA is the largest of the three with approximately 4,000 employees.</p> <p>While tensions continue to rise between politicians and the Bank of England over the latter’s alleged inability to keep rising prices under control, some suggested that Truss may also be responding to the City’s own frustrations with the FCA for alleged inefficiency and its willingness to intervene “aggressively” on behalf of consumers.</p> <p>But while Cable acknowledged that both the FCA and PRA “have had their critics”, the financial system was far more stable and able to withstand “considerable stress” and that mis-selling scandals were “now very rare”.</p> <p>Cable also warned that an overhaul would lead to unnecessary disruption and costs, at a time when the FCA<strong> </strong>is already facing criticism over poor resourcing and its failure to protect consumers who caught up in more recent scandals including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/03/neil-woodford-investors-sue-administrators-of-collapsed-fund\">the collapse of Neil Woodford’s investment fund</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/19/uk-taxpayers-face-120m-compensation-bill-for-lcf-scandal\">the minibond firm London Capital &amp; Finance</a>.</p> <p>“The adage ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ has force here especially as the machine was so difficult to assemble,” Cable said.</p> <p>“The financial regulators already have a problem holding on to staff who are constantly being poached by the firms being regulated with the offer of better pay packages.

He was well into his 80s when he finally admitted that the cheerful schoolboy character who would become his most famous creation – <a href=\"https://www.petitnicolas.com/\" title=\"\">Le Petit Nicolas</a> – was a way of dealing with a period in his life that he described as “a little tragic”.</p> <p>The adventures of Little Nicolas and his band of oddly named friends, all firmly anchored in 1960s France, were “a way to revisit the misery I endured while growing up while making sure everything came out just fine,” Sempé said. “You never get over your childhood. You try to sort things out, to make your memories prettier. But you never get over it.”</p> <p>Far from dwelling on that misery, Sempé, as he signed his work and was widely known, was a man who, as Le Monde said, “could make the world giggle”.</p> <p>Celebrated in France as one of the country’s finest cartoonists, Sempé featured in many national publications but was largely unknown to the English-speaking world until the New Yorker commissioned him to produce a cartoon for its cover in the late 1970s. He would subsequently produce 106 of the magazine’s covers, a figure unrivalled by any other artist.</p> <p>The adventures of Le Petit Nicolas, the boy Sempé created with René Goscinny, who wrote the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/asterix\" title=\"\">Astérix</a> series, have appeared in more than 30 languages, and were adapted for a full-length <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/26/petit-nicolas-review?CMP=gu_com\" title=\"\">feature film</a> starring Valérie Lemercier in 2009 (released in the UK in 2012) with a sequel in 2014.

Marsan handed her infant son to foster parents but took him back when he was three to live with her and her new husband, Ulysse Sempé, a travelling salesman, who was an alcoholic. Jean-Jacques’ stepfather, who sold anchovies and pickles from a bicycle, would return home from work by way of the local bars, sparking inevitable rows that often ended in violence and flying crockery.</p> <p>“There were always fights, always arguments, always debts and sudden home moves … I lived with mad people. They were completely mad … my parents, poor things, they did what they could really. I don’t blame them for a second, they got by as best they could …,” Sempé told his biographer Marc Lecarpentier in 2019.</p> <p>He dropped out of school aged 14 – having already been absent for the previous two years because of the second world war – and later lied about his age to join the French army, saying later it was “the only place that would give me a job and a bed”. His short spell in the military was less than glorious, however, and he admitted he was confined to the barracks prison on more than one occasion for not paying enough attention while on guard duty or other minor misdemeanours. When his real age was discovered he was discharged and he moved permanently to Paris, where he would live for the rest of his life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26c6a6dea9053cf9673d72d8b0f3b3cf8536a178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26c6a6dea9053cf9673d72d8b0f3b3cf8536a178/420_3_5211_3539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Yorker covers by Sempé from March 1987 and October 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Yorker covers by Sempé from March 1987 and October 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: New Yorker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was a lifelong jazz fan, having discovered the French pianist and bandleader Ray Ventura, who helped popularise the genre in France, while listening to the radio aged six, and later Duke Ellington, and had dreamed of being a jazz pianist. Instead, Sempé began drawing aged 12, at first small Mickey Mouse figures, and continued through his teens, sending cartoons to be published in the local paper Sud Ouest while working with little enthusiasm or success as a door-to-door sales person delivering toothpaste powder on his bike, then as a wine broker and a personal valet.</p> <p>In 1954, he met Goscinny – best known for creating the Astérix series with the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/27/albert-uderzo-obituary-asterix\" title=\"\">Albert Uderzo</a> – in the office of the Belgian weekly Le Moustique, which published their work. The pair became friends and began collaborating to produce Petit Nicolas cartoons.</p> <p>“He [Goscinny] was my first Parisian friend … that’s to say my first friend,” Sempé said later. “He came up with a storyline in which the boy Nicolas told of his life with his friends, all of whom had bizarre names … and off we went. René had found the formula.” The first Le Petit Nicolas story appeared in the Sud Ouest Sunday edition in 1959, with the first book published in 1960 and four further volumes following.</p> <p>As well as his covers for the New Yorker, Sempé’s cartoons appeared regularly over an entire page in Paris Match and in other national French publications, including L’Express, Le Figaro, Le Nouvel Observateur (L’Obs), Le Parisien and Télérama.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/11/le-petit-nicolas-illustrator-jean-jacques-sempe-dies-aged-89\">Le Petit Nicolas illustrator Jean-Jacques Sempé dies aged 89</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An English edition of the Le Petit Nicolas series, translated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/18/anthea-bell-obituary\" title=\"\">Anthea Bell</a>, appeared in 1978.

The Treasury is examining options to alleviate the cost of living crisis, which include extending the existing energy bills support scheme established by the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in May. On Thursday, the energy industry united behind its own proposal for a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/18/industry-unites-behind-plan-for-crisis-fund-to-control-soaring-energy-bills\">deficit tariff scheme</a>” to freeze prices at current levels by plugging the gap between wholesale costs and what consumers pay. Here, we examine the merits of the scheme.</p> <h2>What is being proposed?</h2> <p>Energy UK, the industry body for companies that sell electricity and gas to homes and small businesses, is proposing commercial banks put money into a state-backed fund. Retail suppliers could then draw on this fund to freeze customer bills at £1,971 – the current price cap – for two years. The debt built up by suppliers would be repaid by consumers, either through a surcharge on bills or from general taxation over a 10-15 year period. This would protect consumers from an immediate hit, while stopping more suppliers going bust – 29 energy companies have collapsed during the crisis. Many were squeezed by rising wholesale costs they were unable to pass on to consumers because of the price cap. One catch is the scheme would take time to set up, and it may not be ready until next year. Energy UK is suggesting ministers would need to find other money to help households during the coming winter.</p> <h2>Who has suggested this?</h2> <p>Various iterations of this idea have been examined and proposed, but the latest initiative was put forward by ScottishPower and E.ON at a meeting between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/11/boris-johnson-energy-firms-bills-profits-windfall-taxes\">Boris Johnson and industry last week</a>. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/centrica-and-octopus-back-plan-to-freeze-uk-energy-bills-for-two-years\">Centrica, which owns British Gas, and Octopus</a> lent their weight to the scheme and on Thursday Energy UK, which counts some of the industry’s biggest players including EDF and Ovo among its membership, came out in support.</p> <h2>What are the risks?</h2> <p>The scheme could be very costly, with some estimates of as much as £60bn. The amount would depend on the length of time the fund is in place and the extent to which gas prices continue to rise. They surged again this week on concerns over potential shortages in Europe this winter in the fallout from the invasion of Ukraine. Russia has reduced the gas it supplies to Europe, and there is a risk it could turn off the taps completely. The involvement of commercial banks also risks handing huge fees, paid for by taxpayers, to the bankers involved in creating the fund. However, the government may prefer this option to funding the scheme via the Treasury.</p> <h2>Is this a good deal for taxpayers?</h2> <p>This will depend on the terms of the deal and how many households are helped – if all 29 million UK households were supported for a year it could cost nearly £60bn if gas prices stay high. If the Treasury chose to create a fund itself, rather than relying on commercial banks, it would have to raise money through government bonds, exposing the taxpayer to future risks in the bond markets during a predicted recession. However, if the Treasury can persuade the banks to take on some of the risk of suppliers defaulting on the loans, it could limit the exposure for taxpayers and present a more palatable option in a highly uncertain energy market.</p> <h2>What other options are available?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sunak has said if he becomes prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/26/sunak-promises-scrap-vat-on-fuel-bills-pm-dramatic-u-turn-leadership-truss\">he will scrap VAT on fuel bills</a>, which will cost about £12bn and hand all consumers £200. His Tory leadership rival, Liz Truss, favours tax cuts and scrapping green levies, although that will only lower bills by £150. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, has suggested reducing the energy price cap by £400 from January through removing an allowance that suppliers can charge consumers. Labour has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/14/labour-announces-plan-to-freeze-energy-price-cap-with-reinforced-windfall-tax\">the price cap rises</a> expected in October and January should be scrapped, and funded by backdating the windfall tax – introduced earlier this year on oil and gas companies – from May to January.</p> <h2>Will ministers like the idea?</h2> <p>A similar proposal from suppliers was rejected earlier this year in favour of Sunak’s support package, which was part-funded by a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators. However, predictions for energy bills have since worsened amid rising wholesale gas costs and make further intervention look increasingly inevitable. The tight timeframe before winter bills kick in could prove a block to the deficit fund plan, at least in the short-term.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/aug/18/cedric-titcombe-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T16:37:50Z","webTitle":"Cedric Titcombe obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/18/cedric-titcombe-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/18/cedric-titcombe-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Cedric Titcombe obituary","trailText":"<strong>Other lives</strong>: Painter who created carnivalesque worlds full of raw energy","byline":"Pat Roberts","body":"<p>My friend and one-time neighbour Cedric Titcombe, who has died aged 81, was an art teacher and artist who worked in many media, producing mostly paintings and drawings but also stone carvings, sculptures, prints, and even masks and kites.

He went on to organise summer exhibitions that showcased the work of Gloucestershire artists in Gloucester’s then-deserted dock buildings, returning to teaching in 1989 at the city’s further education college as well as its Guildhall Arts Centre.</p> <p>Cedric also worked as a life-drawing model and carver of gravestones, and designed his own typeface, Titcombe Bold, although he was the only person who ever used it. </p> <p>He is survived by the children from his marriage, Lucy, Cass, Ben and Sophie, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/18/deshaun-watson-suspension-fine-nfl-union-settlement","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T16:32:12Z","webTitle":"NFL hits Deshaun Watson with 11-game ban and $5m fine after sexual misconduct claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/18/deshaun-watson-suspension-fine-nfl-union-settlement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/18/deshaun-watson-suspension-fine-nfl-union-settlement","fields":{"headline":"NFL hits Deshaun Watson with 11-game ban and $5m fine after sexual misconduct claims","trailText":"Deshaun Watson has been fined $5m and suspended for 11 games after a settlement was reached between the NFL and the players’ union","byline":"Tom Lutz in New York","body":"<p>Deshaun Watson has been fined $5m and suspended for 11 games after a settlement was reached between the NFL and the league’s players association over the quarterback’s future.</p> <p>The Cleveland Browns quarterback was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/deshaun-watson-suspension-cleveland-browns-quarterback\">given a six-game suspension</a> earlier this month by an independent adjudicator after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/18/deshaun-watson-text-message-therapist-deposition\">allegations of sexual misconduct</a> involving more than two dozen women.

He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/15/houstontexans-settle-deshaun-watson-misconduct-claims\">so far settled with 23 of the women</a> who have filed lawsuits against him. Last week, Watson issued an apology to the women involved. But despite saying he took “accountability” for his actions Thursday, Watson maintained he was not guilty of any wrongdoing.</p> <p>“I’ll continue to stand on my innocence, just because you know settlements, and things like that happen doesn’t mean that a person is guilty for anything. I feel like a person has an opportunity to stand on his innocence and prove that, and we proved that from a legal side, and just going to continue to push forward as an individual and as a person,” he said.</p> <p>The NFL says the $5m will go to “non-profit organizations across the country that educate young people on healthy relationships, promote education and prevention of sexual misconduct and assault, support survivors, and related causes”. The Browns and the NFL will also contribute a further $1m each towards the organizations.</p> <p>The 11-game suspension means Watson will be available to return for the Browns’ game against his former team, the Houston Texans. The three-time Pro Bowler requested a trade away from the Texans and sat out the whole of the 2021 season as he settled his grievances with the team and dealt with his legal issues.</p> <p>The 26-year-old is one of the most talented players in the league, and several teams were interested in trading for him despite the serious allegations against him. Watson eventually joined the Browns, where he signed a fully guaranteed five-year, $230m contract. In May, two of the women who accused the quarterback of sexual misconduct said they were offended by the sums involved in his contract.</p> <p>“It’s just like a big screw you,” Ashley Solis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/24/deshaun-watson-accusers-hbo-interview\">told HBO’s Real Sports</a>. “That’s what it feels like.

He was taken into council care in 1954 when he was eight years old, with his younger brother, Fred, aged six, but never understood why. As far as he could remember, they had been quite happy at home living near Lambeth Walk in Kennington, south London, where Bill was born. His father, Thomas Milner, was a corn and cereals warehouseman, and his mother, Alice (nee Skeggs), worked at United Dairies at Vauxhall. </p> <p>The brothers were placed in Wood Vale in Norwood, a large Victorian institution housing more than 200 children. They ran away only to be brought back to the home, where they were punished – strapped and made to stand in a corner for hours.</p> <p>After some months they were moved to Shirley Oaks in Surrey, an even larger establishment run by London county council (LCC). They lived in cottages of 10 run by a house mother. It was a better place, and near woods and open fields, which Bill loved. Eventually, Bill told his brother that they should knuckle down and accept that they would never be going home.</p> <p>Bill attended Sedgehill comprehensive school in Lewisham. He hated playing football and often deserted the pitch, preferring to explore wildlife in the long grassy borders of the playing field. Later, on an outward-bound survival course in Dartmoor, Bill, about 14 years old, went off alone and discovered a nearby family farm, where he offered to help out for a week. The farmer wanted to give Bill a paid job but he had to to finish his education. Bill became a prefect but, later, after a serious altercation with the head, he was expelled.</p> <p>At 16, Bill worked as an apprentice blacksmith and welder, and lived at an LCC hostel, a Grade–II-listed pagoda, in Blackheath. He loved it there, especially the large garden where he looked after various animals. However, Bill did not take to the work, and, instead, did general labouring, including as a brickie’s labourer. He was promoted to chargehand and worked for Harry Neal building contractors throughout the 1970s and into the 80s.</p> <p>Bill’s dry humour and wiliness in his dealings with the outside world helped him to overcome bouts of depression. Uppermost, his interest in nature prevailed. Bill had a mental breakdown in 1984, and, during this period, met Jane Keane, who became his partner. She helped link Bill to therapeutic treatment and support in south London.</p> <p>At last, Bill had a permanent home, in Telegraph Hill, south-east London, with Jane, a jazz and blues singer with Mess of Blues, a band of which I was also a member. Bill was our unofficial roadie and we became friends. His characteristic gruffness gradually mellowed, as wider friendships<strong> </strong>grew.</p> <p>Bill is survived by Jane. His brother, Fred, predeceased him.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/18/ryan-giggs-tells-court-ex-girlfriend-kate-greville-was-happy-persisted","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T16:23:35Z","webTitle":"Ryan Giggs tells court ex-girlfriend was ‘happy that I persisted’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/ryan-giggs-tells-court-ex-girlfriend-kate-greville-was-happy-persisted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/ryan-giggs-tells-court-ex-girlfriend-kate-greville-was-happy-persisted","fields":{"headline":"Ryan Giggs tells court ex-girlfriend was ‘happy that I persisted’","trailText":"Former footballer testifies that Kate Greville was ‘happy’ when he turned up unannounced at her gym","byline":"Josh Halliday North of England correspondent","body":"<p>Ryan Giggs has told a court his ex-girlfriend was “happy” when he sent her repeated messages and turned up unannounced at her gym upon their relationship breaking down.</p> <p>The former Manchester United and Wales footballer said that Kate Greville was “happy that I fought for us and that I persisted” when he pursued her after a fallout.</p> <p>The trial had heard how Giggs sent “constant” messages to Greville and her friends and would turn up unannounced at her home, workplace and gym when she blocked his phone number.</p> <p>Asked by his barrister, Chris Daw QC, to describe Greville’s reaction to his repeated contacts when they had got back together, Giggs said: “Just happy that I fought for us and that I persisted.”</p> <p>Daw asked how Greville had felt on one of the occasions that the former Wales manager turned up at her gym.

I have been to some of the most dangerous places in the world, confronting murderers ... but I have never felt as scared as I did in a remote home in rural Wiltshire. I didn’t feel safe to leave my house or walk my dog. I didn’t feel safe to wear certain clothes and didn’t even feel safe inside my own home.”</p> <p>After the hearing Traquair issued a statement in which she said conviction rates in stalking cases were “shockingly low”.</p> <p>She added: “I don’t know if I will ever feel safe. The only thing that would have made me feel safe temporarily is if he was jailed. I was informed that the probation report said he did not admit or acknowledge the crime and he had a distorted view of me. That is extremely worrying to hear.</p> <p>“Stalking cases must be handled differently and I’d suggest that from day one suspected stalkers should be psychologically assessed, because they are demonstrating obsessive fixated behaviour towards one person.</p> <p>“Prevention is better than cure. And it should be absolutely standard that they undergo treatment if found guilty of stalking. The whole system needs an overhaul – from police training, to sentencing.</p> <p>“Stalking is the crime most likely to result in rape, murder or serious harm, according to experts, and yet it seems it is one of the most overlooked crimes, with shockingly low conviction rates.”</p> <p>Barrett denied stalking or harassing his neighbour and claimed it was she who had become fixated on him. He was previously handed a restraining order to not contact Traquair or to enter or look into her property.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/18/roy-hackett-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T16:08:14Z","webTitle":"Roy Hackett obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/roy-hackett-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/roy-hackett-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Roy Hackett obituary","trailText":"Campaigner who was one of the organisers of the 1963 Bristol bus boycott, which helped usher in the Race Relations Act","byline":"Kehinde Andrews","body":"<p>In April 1963 Roy Hackett, who has died aged 93, stood in the middle of Fishponds Road in Bristol to block the entrance to the city’s main bus station. His mission, as one of the organisers of the <a href=\"https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/stories/bristol-bus-boycott/\" title=\"\">Bristol bus boycott</a>, was to draw attention to the Bristol Omnibus Company’s refusal to employ black and Asian people as conductors and drivers.</p> <p>The boycott, which Hackett planned with three fellow campaigners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/01/paul-stephenson-the-hero-who-refused-to-leave-a-pub-and-helped-desegregate-britain\" title=\"\">Paul Stephenson</a>, <a href=\"https://jtojhumanrights.org.uk/local-stories/local-stories-posts/owen-henry-and-the-windrush-generation/\" title=\"\">Owen Henry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/17/guy-reid-bailey-the-man-who-sparked-the-bristol-bus-boycott-and-then-fought-to-desegregate-housing\" title=\"\">Guy Reid-Bailey</a>, lasted for four months until the company caved in. The rigidly enforced colour bar – which had been encouraged and supported by the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-21574799\" title=\"\">Transport and General Workers’ Union</a> – was perfectly legal. Hackett’s mobilisation is credited with helping to persuade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\" title=\"\">Harold Wilson</a>’s Labour government to introduce the first piece of anti-racist legislation in Britain: the Race Relations Act of 1965.</p> <p>Although there were threats to Hackett from some members of the public, there was widespread support for the boycott, including from the local MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/14/tony-benn-obituary\" title=\"\">Tony Benn</a> and from Wilson, who was then leader of the opposition. Eventually negotiations took place between the bus company, which claimed it did not want to enforce the colour bar, and the TGWU, which had backed it on the basis that it protected jobs for “local” people. The talks led to a vote among bus workers that came out in favour of lifting the edict in late August 1963, and the following month Raghbir Singh became Bristol’s first non-white bus conductor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"841b520b3c2945d40d3f6091d5cc47d5144a117b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/841b520b3c2945d40d3f6091d5cc47d5144a117b/0_358_5477_3288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roy Hackett’s role in the Bristol bus boycott has been commemorated in a mural in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roy Hackett’s role in the Bristol bus boycott has been commemorated in a mural in Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olumedia/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hackett was born in the Trench Town area of Kingston in Jamaica, where he tried various jobs, including working in a drug store, on a coffee plantation and selling insurance, without being able to make a decent living. In 1952, at the age of 24, he decided to move to the UK to seek better opportunities. </p> <p>Arriving by ship in Liverpool, initially he lived what he described as a “dog’s life”, mainly due to the difficulty in getting a job and the reluctance of so many landlords to provide housing to black people. </p> <p>When things failed to work out in Liverpool he moved first to Wolverhampton and then to London, where he found a labouring job with the engineering firm Taylor Woodrow.</p> <p>In 1956 he moved westwards with Taylor Woodrow to become a construction worker helping to build the Hinkley Point power station in Somerset, before switching to the Sir Robert McAlpine company in Llanwern, south Wales. There he worked mainly as a labourer on building sites but also spending time as a “teaboy” in conjunction with the soon-to-be-famous pop star Tom Jones, a lively presence who gently irritated him with his constant singing.</p> <p>On arriving in Bristol, Hackett was forced to spend his first night in the city sleeping in a doorway after being turned away by a succession of landlords. When he did find lodgings in the St Pauls district it was with a cousin, Irving Williams, sharing a room with him and three other men. </p> <p>It was in Bristol that Hackett befriended a local black activist, Owen Henry, a travel agent, “who gave me a lot to think about and said we should form something to tackle the council’s attitude towards the black population” – especially in relation to housing and employment.</p> <p>In 1962 the pair, along with two others, Clifford Drummond and Audley Evan, became founding members of the Commonwealth Coordinated Committee, meeting in the Speedy Bird cafe on Sundays, where they would “drink fish tea and Red Stripe beer and listen to calypso music with a paraffin heater to keep warm”.</p> <p>With Hackett as public relations officer and Henry as chairman, by 1963 the committee had brought into its orbit Paul Stephenson, a British-born, mixed-heritage social worker who became its president and spokesperson. When Reid-Bailey, then a young member of the CCC, reported that he had applied for a bus conductor job and had been turned down on account of his colour, Stephenson, Hackett, Henry and Bailey decided to spring into action by forming a new body, the West Indian Development Council – and the bus boycott came into being.</p> <p>Allied to his lifelong work in construction, Hackett remained a fearsome campaigner and continued organising in the community long after the victory of 1963. He maintained his involvement with the CCC, now known as the Bristol West Indian Parents and Friends Association, and through it campaigned for better housing and employment conditions for black people in the city. He and the CCC were also involved in organising the St Pauls festival in Bristol, which began in 1968 and ran for a number of years until it morphed into the annual <a href=\"https://www.stpaulscarnival.net/\" title=\"\">St Pauls carnival</a>. </p> <p>A humble man, Hackett was pleased by the level of respect he was accorded in Bristol in his later years, mentioning with pride that his grandson’s school had a picture of him on the wall. He also remained committed to supporting the black community in Bristol, joking that “a lot of young people ask me if I can help them and I always say yes – as long as I can sit in the shade”.</p> <p>Half a century after the boycott, the union Unite, successor to the TGWU, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-21574799\" title=\"\">apologised</a> for its wrongdoing, and the following year, 2014, Hackett and the other surviving organisers attended the unveiling of a commemorative plaque at Bristol bus station. In 2019 a mural featuring him was painted on a wall in the city by the artist Michele Curtis, although the wall collapsed in 2021 and there is a crowdfunder appeal to have it restored. In 2020 Hackett was appointed MBE.</p> <p>He is survived by three children, Dawn and Clive from his 1959 marriage to Ena, which ended in divorce, and Claudette, from a previous relationship.</p> <p>• Lurel Roy Hackett, activist, born 19 September 1928; died 3 August 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/aug/18/poll-liz-truss-lead-conservatives-tory-leadership-race-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T16:07:43Z","webTitle":"New poll gives Liz Truss 32-point lead in Tory leadership race – UK politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/aug/18/poll-liz-truss-lead-conservatives-tory-leadership-race-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/aug/18/poll-liz-truss-lead-conservatives-tory-leadership-race-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"New poll gives Liz Truss 32-point lead in Tory leadership race – as it happened","trailText":"YouGov survey suggests 66% of party members will vote for the foreign secretary over Rishi Sunak","byline":"Nicola Slawson","body":"<div id=\"block-62fe5dfa8f083ef020e7026f\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T15:58:25.959Z\">4.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">End of day summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Liz Truss is set to win the Tory leadership contest by a decisive margin next month, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/liz-truss-set-to-win-tory-leadership-race-by-decisive-margin-sky-news-poll-reveals-12675498\">according to an exclusive Sky News poll</a></strong>.

Trade union leaders, including those usually loyal to the Labour leader, have reacted with fury to the picket line ban.</p> <p>The campaign, Labour for labour, has been launched with Sam Tarry, who was sacked as shadow transport minister for attending a picket line with striking rail workers. Other MPs supporting it include Zarah Sultana, Jon Trickett and Dawn Butler.</p> <p>Tarry said that by firing shadow ministers such as himself for standing on picket lines, Starmer was “in danger of driving a wedge between Labour and the millions of working people desperate for real relief” in the cost of living crisis.</p> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are seven million trades unionists in Britain - we need their votes to win power.</p> </blockquote> <p>Momentum wants members to pass motions in their constituency Labour party (CLPs) to send to Labour conference at the end of September, with the aim of forcing the party’s leadership to instruct shadow ministers to attend picket lines.</p> <p>The left-wing campaign organisation also said it was confident that the conference would see trade unions and party member delegates unite against Starmer’s position, in a major blow to his authority.</p> <p>The series of ongoing strikes in response to the cost of living crisis have posed a headache for Starmer, who has seen his instruction not to attend picket lines ignored by multiple shadow ministers, including Lisa Nandy, a Labour whip, Nav Mishra, and shadow employment rights minister Imran Hussain.</p> <p>Zarah Sultana MP said the cost of living crisis was getting worse while the Tory government “sits on their hands”.</p> <p>She continued:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a party, Labour should stand with workers standing up for their jobs and livelihoods, by backing an inflation-proof pay rise and getting down to picket lines.

Sunak has said he would cut taxes but only when inflation is back under control.</p> <p>But the IFS said in the next financial year – 2023–24 – borrowing was likely to increase by £23bn, because the government would need to uprate benefits and pensions in line with a higher inflation rate at a cost of £4bn and also pay £54bn in higher debt interest on inflation-linked bonds. The spending increases would only be partly offset by a £34bn increase in tax revenues as a result of rising inflation.</p> <p>The thinktank said there would be additional pressures, probably running into tens of billions of pounds, to continue to support households struggling with higher energy bills and to compensate public services for the impact of higher than expected inflation.</p> <p>In a new report published today, the IFS said Truss and Sunak needed to recognise the even greater than usual uncertainty in the public finances. Pressures on public services would be more acute, higher spending than planned looked “inevitable” and tax revenues would depend on the length and depth of the recession being forecast by Threadneedle Street.</p> <p>The thinktank said additional public borrowing in the short term was not necessarily a problem – and might be appropriate to fund targeted support, but large permanent tax cuts on the scale being mooted during the Tory party’s hustings would exacerbate “already substantial pressures” on the public finances unless matching spending cuts were also implemented. In reality, “significant” spending increases were likely to be needed in face of high inflation, it added.</p> <p>Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS<em> </em>and an author of the report, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality is that the UK has got poorer over the last year. That makes tax and spending decisions all the more difficult. It is hard to square the promises that both Ms Truss and Mr Sunak are making to cut taxes over the medium-term with the absence of any specific measures to cut public spending and a presumed desire to manage the nation’s finances responsibly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read more from this story here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/18/uks-10-inflation-casts-doubt-on-truss-and-sunaks-tax-cut-promises\">UK’s 10% inflation casts doubt on Truss and Sunak’s tax cut promises</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62fdf6798f080eafb8917dca\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T08:45:30.998Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Liz Truss set to win Tory leadership race by decisive margin, according to poll</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Liz Truss is set to win the Tory leadership contest by a decisive margin next month, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/liz-truss-set-to-win-tory-leadership-race-by-decisive-margin-sky-news-poll-reveals-12675498\">according to an exclusive Sky News poll</a>.</p> <p>The foreign secretary has a 32-point lead over her rival, Rishi Sunak, in the poll, which was published today.

Front-loaded scheduling and a weaker than usual crop of August releases led to last weekend’s box office total being the <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/08/box-office-bullet-train-bodies-bodies-bodies-pete-davidson-1235091498/\">lowest since May</a>. But it’s a month that has often provided simple genre pleasures, especially on the heels of such overpriced indulgence (previous Augusts have given us Searching, Don’t Breathe and You’re Next), and after last week’s brutally effective survival thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/10/fall-review-wildly-effective-survival-thriller-delivers-seat-edge-suspense\">Fall</a> (which also tanked, natch), this Friday’s similarly taut Beast works as another refreshing post-tentpole balm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/17/look-both-ways-review-lili-reinhart-netflix\">Look Both Ways review – Lili Reinhart shines in Netflix’s Sliding Doors homage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s got a costlier price tag than Fall ($36m v just $3m) and tracking suggests it might struggle to be profitable but if audiences do venture back out to the multiplex to see it, they’ll probably be as entertained as I, a no-frills B-movie pitched just right after so many A-movie counterparts got it so wrong. Like 2019’s slick summer surprise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/12/crawl-review-alexandre-aja-horror-film\">Crawl</a>, it’s another to-the-point R-rated creature feature, light on plot and heavy on thrills, and this time it’s a lion doing the stalking and Idris Elba doing the trying not to die. Despite Elba’s prolific nature, it’s still rare for him to take the lead (he’s usually within an ensemble or sharing top billing) and Beast awards him ample screen-time to show us why he deserves more of it. Like in the underrated 2017 adventure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/14/mountain-between-us-review-toronto-film-festival-tiff\">The Mountain Between Us</a>, he’s hugely believable in hyper-competent, high-stakes survival mode and here, he’s forced to figure a way out of a nightmarish trap when a South African vacation goes horribly wrong.</p> <p>He’s taking daughters Norah (Leah Sava Jeffries) and “Mer” (Iyana Halley) away to remember their late mother in her homeland, meeting up with an old friend, wildlife biologist Martin (Sharlto Copley). But after some mercifully brief exposition, things go even further south when the group comes into contact with a particularly aggrieved lion.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQMc7Sq36mI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oQMc7Sq36mI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Beast isn’t going anywhere you can’t predict from the trailer or even a simple logline but it’s a straight line confidently drawn, directed with more flair that one often gets from such material. The Icelandic film-maker Baltasar Kormákur, no stranger to meat and potatoes action movies having made Contraband, 2 Guns and Adrift, is keen to do more than just point and shoot and together with the Oscar-winning cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (whose illustrious career includes films such as Dangerous Liaisons, Interview with the Vampire and Big Fish), they add surprising finesse to straightforward action sequences. There’s a string of intricate, if often cheated, “oners”, swirling tracking shots that take us in and around characters and locations in ways we don’t expect. It’s not exactly 1917 but it’s refreshing to see a piece of pulp such as this squeezed so carefully, involving us in the horror of it rather than leaving us at a distance.</p> <p>At a tight 93 minutes, the pace barely has time to slacken and despite the familiar family soap setup, Ryan Engle’s efficiently spare and mostly grounded script doesn’t get bogged down by maudlin monologuing. It’s a machine and little more but Elba refuses to be just a cog within it, enthusiastically showing off his often underused movie star wattage, an actor who doesn’t need to rely on clumsy exposition to turn an action lead into a real person, the specificity of his never-not-on facial emotions doing that instead. Newcomers Halley and Jeffries are both impressive naturals and the script affords them more to do than just watch and scream, allowing them a central role in trying to figure out how to survive such chaos. And while the trailers suggested otherwise, the VFX lion is more convincing than so many other pricier effects I’ve seen lately helping to make those seat-edge standoffs just that little bit more suspenseful.</p> <p>In the advertising for 2011’s Liam Neeson wilderness thriller The Grey, audiences were teased with the promise of the star fighting a wolf with his bare hands but the resulting film smartly denied us such goofiness, instead offering a stark and dour treatise on life and death. The final trailer for Beast reached similar virality after showing us the sight of Elba punching a lion (which in turn led to <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2022/08/idris-elba-beast-movie-lion-attack-survive-punch.html\">Slate</a> asking zoologists: would that really work?) and while yes we do see it and yes it makes a bit more sense in a less serious-minded movie, it’s also a little <em>too</em> far, tainting an ending that feels anticlimactic and rushed. It’s a “moment” for sure and might be a rousing one for some, but it didn’t work for me, pushing the film into a realm of ultra-silliness that it had managed to avoid before that.</p> <p>August might be a washout so far for the industry but Beast couldn’t be arriving at a more apt time, a thrilling, if throwaway, reminder of the fun to be had while watching a B-movie bringing its A-game.</p> <ul> <li><p>Beast is out in US cinemas on 19 August and in the UK on 26 August</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/monkeypox-vaccine-extra-doses-biden","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T16:05:46Z","webTitle":"Biden administration to distribute extra 1.8m monkeypox vaccine doses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/monkeypox-vaccine-extra-doses-biden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/monkeypox-vaccine-extra-doses-biden","fields":{"headline":"Biden administration to distribute extra 1.8m monkeypox vaccine doses","trailText":"Government will also support mass vaccination events for at-risk communities and offer more antiviral treatment for those infected","byline":"Gloria Oladipo","body":"<p>The Biden administration will accelerate the distribution of monkeypox vaccines by providing an additional 1.8m doses, as well as taking other steps to address the rapidly spreading disease amid criticism of the government’s slow response.</p> <p>The new doses will <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/politics/monkeypox-vaccine-response-biden-administration/index.html?bt_ee=1oL0Bx9YFga8Q%2FJ3hkbPh5ixYyQjvyAkcwv4UETKyCuR%2FTYRaAc%2BGEJZQ4A8Cnl%2B&amp;bt_ts=1660828440188\">accelerate</a> the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) previous timeline, and HHS also announced a new program to coordinate additional doses for states and local health departments organizing mass events for at-risk communities, said the White House monkeypox response coordinator, Bob Fenton, during a morning briefing on Thursday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/cdc-reset-covid-director-rochelle-walensky\">CDC director calls for ‘reset’ of agency amid criticism of Covid response</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moreover, the administration will offer an additional 50,000 courses of antiviral treatment for people who test positive.

Under the agreement, he is expected to serve a five-month prison term at New York’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/19/rikers-island-abject-neglect-chaotic-conditions-deaths\">notorious Rikers Island</a> jail.

Weisselberg began working for Trump’s father, Fred Trump, in 1973 and no one outside the Trump family knows more about its business. “They are like Batman and Robin,” Jennifer Weisselberg, the ex-wife of Allen Weisselberg’s son Barry, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/nyregion/trump-organization-cfo-allen-weisselberg.html\">told the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Prosecutors alleged that the company gave untaxed fringe benefits to senior executives, including Weisselberg, for 15 years. Weisselberg alone was accused of defrauding the federal government, state and city out of more than $900,000 in unpaid taxes and undeserved tax refunds.</p> <p>Under state law, punishment for the most serious charge against Weisselberg, grand larceny, could have carried a penalty as high as 15 years in prison. But the charge carries no mandatory minimum, and most first-time offenders in tax-related cases never end up behind bars.</p> <p>The tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization are punishable by a fine of double the amount of unpaid taxes, or $250,000, whichever is larger.</p> <p>Trump has not been charged in the criminal investigation.

She achieved global fame during the 1950s for her long-distance challenges, becoming the first woman home in two cross-Channel races, and breaking records for the 29-mile River Nile race and the 32-mile Lake Ontario race. She was only the third person to complete the latter route.</p> <p>In later years, she taught hundreds of children to swim in her hometown of Grimsby, Lincolnshire. The publication of Brenda’s biography in 2015 saw a resurgence in interest in her achievements, and three years later she was awarded a British Empire Medal. Ever modest, Brenda said: “I enjoyed myself, but other people have done more important things.”</p> <p>She was born in the family home in Grimsby where she would live for her entire life, the youngest daughter of Enid (nee Winship) and Albert Fisher, a trawler skipper. Aged nine, Brenda suffered from such severe sunstroke that it paralysed one side of her body. Determined not to let it affect her, she learned to swim – taking up a sport her older brother, Buster, and sister, Jessie, were hooked on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"12828f64ecacf5bd5dbd24a901dbbceb237374bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12828f64ecacf5bd5dbd24a901dbbceb237374bd/0_0_4790_5996/799.jpg\" alt=\"Brenda Fisher being coated with grease by her trainer, Herbert McNally, in preparation for her 1951 Channel race – as she clambered ashore after her record-breaking swim, she asked ‘Will someone tell my dad?’\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brenda Fisher being coated with grease by her trainer, Herbert McNally, in preparation for her 1951 Channel race – as she clambered ashore after her record-breaking swim, she asked ‘Will someone tell my dad?’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under their coach, Herbert McNally – known as Mr Mac, and himself a champion swimmer – Brenda initially trained in speed, not distance. Private lessons cost one guinea. “He was very strict,” she recalled. “I wasn’t allowed to go to the cinema; I had to train.”</p> <p>This involved spending hours in the cold water of Grimsby docks. It was when Buster, at 16, and Jessie, 15, swam the River Humber in 1938 that breaking records entered the Fishers’ lives; Buster became the youngest male to complete the crossing and Jessie the first female. Soon afterwards, Brenda began distance training. </p> <p>She took part in more races, and won the 1948 Morecambe Bay challenge, but a family tragedy focused her sporting prowess. Buster and Jessie had made a pact to take on “the big one” – the Channel – but the second world war intervened and, Buster, aged 21 and in the RAF, was shot down and killed in action. His sisters continued swimming in his honour and in 1951 were both accepted for the Channel race.</p> <p>They trained hard, but when Jessie developed appendicitis she had to withdraw. Brenda, now 24 years old, was to go it alone. At 7.29am on 17 August that year, she entered the water at Cap Gris-Nez, France. “I was fed hourly on sugar and chocolate – a welcome break in the steady grind of crawl strokes,” she recalled. “I was never told of the progress I was making; all I wanted was to get across.”</p> <p>With a stroke count of 25 per minute, increasing to 30 nearing Dover, Brenda clambered ashore, the first woman home, in 12 hours 42 minutes – breaking the existing world record by 32 minutes. Her first words were: “Will someone tell my dad?”</p> <p>A publicity whirlwind followed for the new queen of the Channel. She took to the stage at that year’s Royal Command Performance, and was named the sportswoman of the year. Back in Grimsby, she was given the highest possible honour – a tug was named after her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93dba4f261d41ad3db6f9943acb4c6c8bc1cb7ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93dba4f261d41ad3db6f9943acb4c6c8bc1cb7ab/0_0_5895_1617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brenda Fisher, fifth from left, with competitors in the 1951 cross-Channel race lining up at Cap Gris Nez in France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"274\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brenda Fisher, fifth from left, with competitors in the 1951 cross-Channel race lining up at Cap-Gris Nez in France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1954, Brenda became the second woman to swim the Channel twice, home in just under 15 hours, and the first woman ashore. Her celebrity status was set, the media buzzed with coverage of her achievement – and there was more to come.</p> <p>In April 1956, she was the fastest woman home in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ILpJUSbUM\" title=\"\">that year’s River Nile race</a> and placed fourth overall. Four months later, she was on the front pages again, having completed a solo swim of Lake Ontario, Canada, in 18 hours 51 minutes, breaking the existing record by more than two hours. “I was determined to conquer it,” she said. “I thought ‘I’ll show the world what Britain is made of.’”</p> <p>By 1957, having become the face of Quaker Oats and met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/17/archive-1977-king-elvis-presley-anniversary%0D\" title=\"\">Elvis Presley</a> during a television recording, Brenda still held the Channel record and wanted to try it again. After nine hours in the water and just five miles from Dover, she was forced to withdraw with seasickness – and her record was beaten. Aged 31, she bowed out of competitive swimming: “I knew I’d had enough.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"960c8f929a855bfc2c490757027ac3f0d93191bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/960c8f929a855bfc2c490757027ac3f0d93191bd/0_0_765_956/400.jpg\" alt=\"Brenda Fisher bowed out of competitive swimming in the late 1950s and went on to coach youngsters and advise other long-distance swimmers\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brenda Fisher bowed out of competitive swimming in the late 1950s and went on to coach youngsters and advise other long-distance swimmers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On leaving Nunsthorpe primary school aged 14, Brenda had trained as a shorthand typist and worked for a while in the offices of <a href=\"https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/nostalgia/fifa-world-cup-arthur-drewry-1758673\" title=\"\">fish merchant and football administrator Arthur Drewry</a> on Grimsby docks, and later for the Ross food group. Although there were prizes on offer for competitive swimming, most of the money was swallowed up in training and travel; at one point a group of local businessmen set up a fund to cover the cost of her expenses and kit such as lanolin.</p> <p>When she married the professional footballer Pat Johnston in 1954, the couple purchased a sweetshop in Grimsby, and ran it together in between their sporting commitments. Through local clubs and schools, Brenda also spent years coaching youngsters and advising long-distance swimmers, as an advocate for the sport. The Channel Swimming Association described her as “one of the true open-water pioneer swimmers of the 20th century”.</p> <p>Brenda’s name remained well known in Grimsby, and when I interviewed her for the Grimsby Telegraph on the 60th anniversary of her Channel swim, we got talking about collaborating on a biography, and became firm friends during the research and writing of Blonde In Deep Water. With renewed interest in her career, a blue heritage plaque was erected within sight of the dock she had trained in.</p> <p>Pat died in 1971 and Jessie in 1994.

But they may also be ashamed and desperate to change. Helping them is the only way to prevent more victims, says forensic psychologist Rebecca Myers","byline":"Rebecca Myers","body":"<p>“I’ve got a list of questions I’d like to ask you about your sexual offending against children, if that’s OK,” I say. “You might find some of them … ” I pause, unable to find the words, “ … a bit detailed and personal.” The grizzled old man sitting in front of me nods, but does not make eye contact. I don’t know who is dreading the interview most, him or me.</p> <p>This was the first time I had been left on my own, in a cell, in a maximum-security prison, with a man convicted of serious sexual offences. It would be far from my last. I have spent the 25 years since that day in the mid-90s, when I was just 22 years old and in possession of a shiny new psychology degree, assessing, treating and researching men who commit sexual offences, including sexual murder.</p> <p>I was drawn into forensic psychology because, like most people, I found crime interesting. Essentially, though, I wanted to understand why offenders behaved as they did; how they made decisions that had such appalling, long-term consequences for their victims. And to figure out exactly how they differed from the rest of us.</p> <p>I’ve learned that men who commit sexual offences can be deceitful, manipulative, cruel, deluded, distorted and damaged. But also, that they can be remorseful, ashamed, introspective, funny, polite and willing to try to stop their harmful behaviour. I’ve learned that there is usually a combination of identifiable underlying reasons why they commit their crimes, even if the offences appear to come out of the blue. These can include a backdrop of trauma and abuse (although not always), difficulties in relationships with others, distorted thinking about women, children and sex, unhelpful personality traits, poor problem-solving and coping skills, and again, often but not always, an interest in, or a capacity to be aroused by, sexual violence.</p> <p>In my job, I’ve heard about the most disgusting and degrading things that human beings do to one another, and in the tiniest detail – and it is always tough to hear it, to read the files and to look at the photographs. Occasionally I’ve met a victim, which is one of the very hardest things about the job.</p> <p>Over the years I’ve learned to try to leave the work at the prison gate when I go home. I approach each case as a puzzle to be solved, assimilating and analysing the information to try to understand what happened. The cognitive task helps me to detach and to lessen my emotional reaction. I don’t eat when I read files – it can make me feel sick – and now that files are electronic, I don’t look at them anywhere else in the house but my office, in order to keep a degree of separation between the offences and my life.</p> <p>Still, the offences inevitably spill over. As much as I consider myself hardened – as I think most of us who work in this field do – some crimes affect me more than others, for example those that relate to the ages and genders of my own children. I also have the occasional flashback, or bad dream, where sometimes I’m the murderer myself and I’m reliving an offence.</p> <p>Over the years I’ve become more suspicious of people generally. I first spotted it in my early 20s when engaging with prisoners in intensive treatment; I became wary of men in bars, friends’ boyfriends, people on trains or buses at night. I started to notice strangers with children – constantly on alert, like an overactive smoke alarm – for evidence of kidnap or abuse in harmless situations such as in a park or supermarket. When I had my own children, I became hyper-vigilant and overprotective – shunning male babysitters, unable to let my children go into public toilets on their own, cautious of male sports coaches.</p> <p>I am acutely aware of my own safety. I fear walking on my own in the dark, or even alone in the day on a country path with my dogs. Seeing a lone male in the countryside without a dog would cause my senses to prickle. But I think most women and vulnerable people experience these fears, particularly in dark and isolated places. I don’t know how much more affected I am because I’ve worked with the perpetrators of serious sexual violence, but I do try to do all the right things to cope – peer supervision, counselling, exercise. Undoubtedly, “gallows” humour with colleagues is an effective way to decompress, too.</p> <p>Despite all of this, I’ve kept doing the work because I believe it is vitally important to try to prevent further victims of serious sexual and violent offences. And the work is extraordinary and complex, bringing intellectual challenge, self-analysis, purpose, a sense of achievement and altruism, and an array of interesting, dedicated colleagues into my life.</p> <p>I also do it to help the men themselves. Just about all of the offenders I’ve ever met don’t want to offend again, and most sexual offenders do not reoffend. They want to be useful members of society. However, released sexual offenders face many barriers to this: stigma, ostracism, lack of work, housing, friends, family, human connection. For the minority of sex offenders who do reoffend, it is exactly these types of problems that make it more likely that they may do so.</p> <p>Men who have committed sex offences are released every day in the UK – we typically do not lock people up and throw away the key. As difficult as it might be, an openness to the possibility that these kinds of offenders can change, and a mindful tolerance of them, would help those who are to be released live safely in our society. That – and many more resources both in prison and in the community to manage them. In my view, these things would contribute to reducing the likelihood of further victims – surely the most important thing?</p> <p>I never predicted that I would discover that the thinking styles of many of the men I treated in prison were not that different from my own. For example, needing to be the first or best at something or struggling to trust a partner in a relationship. Ultimately, I realised that underneath it all, they were simply human beings: people who had committed dreadful crimes, yet who were essentially just people.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rebecca Myers is a forensic psychologist who has worked with serious offenders for more than 25 years, and the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/inside-job-9780008538484\">Inside Job: The Life of a Prison Psychologist</a></p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/jair-bolsonaro-covid-misinformation-charge-brazil-police","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T15:02:52Z","webTitle":"Police call for Bolsonaro to be charged for spreading Covid misinformation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/jair-bolsonaro-covid-misinformation-charge-brazil-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/jair-bolsonaro-covid-misinformation-charge-brazil-police","fields":{"headline":"Police call for Bolsonaro to be charged for spreading Covid misinformation","trailText":"Brazil’s federal police ask supreme court to charge president over bogus claims in October 2021 social media broadcast","byline":"Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro","body":"<p>Brazilian federal police have called for President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jair-bolsonaro\">Jair Bolsonaro</a> to be charged with spreading fake information about a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 680,000 of his citizens, including bogus claims of a link between Aids and Covid vaccines.</p> <p>Bolsonaro’s anti-scientific response to a disease he called “a bit of a cold” has been internationally condemned and the subject of a congressional inquiry in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/20/jair-bolsonaro-crimes-against-humanity-inquiry\">the far-right populist was accused</a> of deliberately delaying vaccine purchases and promoting quack “cures” such as hydroxychloroquine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/27/outrage-brazil-jair-bolsonaro-avoids-five-charges-related-to-covid-response\">Outrage in Brazil as Jair Bolsonaro avoids five charges related to Covid response</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Wednesday night a senior federal police investigator was <a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2022/08/17/pf-ve-crime-de-bolsonaro-por-live-em-que-o-presidente-associa-vacina-da-covid-com-risco-de-pegar-hiv.ghtml\">reported</a> to have written to the supreme court asking for Bolsonaro to be questioned and charged with the crime of incitement, when someone encourages another person to commit an offense.</p> <p>That alleged crime, which is punishable with up to six months in prison, relates to a notorious social media broadcast in October 2021 which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/facebook-takes-down-bolsonaro-video-over-false-vaccine-claim-2021-10-25/\">was subsequently removed</a> by YouTube and Facebook.</p> <p>In the deleted transmission, Bolsonaro falsely claimed face masks – the compulsory use of which he repeatedly flouted – had been responsible for many of the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic.</p> <p>“[The president] in a direct, spontaneous and conscious manner disseminated the disinformation that victims of the Spanish flu had in fact died as a result of bacterial pneumonia caused by the use of masks, instilling in viewers’ minds a veritable disincentive to their use in the fight against Covid at a time when the use of masks was compulsory,” the police report said.</p> <p>In the same live broadcast Bolsonaro <a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/fato-ou-fake/coronavirus/noticia/2021/10/22/e-fake-que-relatorios-do-governo-do-reino-unido-sugerem-que-vacinados-contra-covid-tem-desenvolvido-aids.ghtml\">falsely claimed</a> government studies in the United Kingdom suggested fully vaccinated people were developing Aids “much faster than expected”.

It meant that our throats got larger, which enabled us to extend the sounds we could make beyond animalistic hooting and howling. Suddenly, we could talk. We could develop a vocabulary. We could sing.</p> <p>This development marked the birth of music, yet we really know only about relatively recent developments in that enormous history. The world’s oldest known musical instrument – a <a href=\"https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/instruments/flute/worlds-oldest-instrument-neanderthal-flute/#:~:text=The%20Neanderthal%20Flute%2C%20found%20in,the%20Idrijca%20River%20in%201995.\">Neanderthal flute</a> carved from the bone of a bear, found in 1995 in a Slovenian cave – is just 50,000 years old. The oldest piece of written music is far younger: a spry 4,000 years old. What remains of it is little more than notes on how to tune a lyre – certainly not enough for anyone to pull a melody from it.</p> <p>To find the oldest known complete song, you need look back just 3,400 years. Composed of lyrics, musical notation and tuning instructions for a Babylonian lyre carved into a clay tablet, it is called <a href=\"https://www.heritageforpeace.org/the-hymn-to-nikkal/\">Hymn to Nikkal</a>, or Hurrian Hymn No 6. Archaeologists found it in the early 1950s – alongside almost three dozen other, incomplete, Hurrian hymns – during an excavation at the Royal Palace of Ugarit in what is now northern Syria.</p> <p>Despite being a complete song, Hymn to Nikkal has been a subject of controversy since it was published in full in 1968. Most disagreements centre on how to play it: the Hurrian language in which the song was written still mystifies archaeologists. It is a challenge that the Germanic-Nordic experimental folk collective Heilung have taken on with their forthcoming third album, <a href=\"https://heilung.bandcamp.com/album/drif\">Drif</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea298588a0d6aafe6fd81dd36a9dbf38893233a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea298588a0d6aafe6fd81dd36a9dbf38893233a0/0_267_5397_3238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heilung performing in Berlin in 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As old as time … Heilung performing in Berlin in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Hoensch/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We’ll leave the scientific battle to the scientists,” says instrumentalist and producer Christopher Juul. “You’ll find five different versions of that song from five different people. How we write music is never with the point of view of: ‘We have the answer; this is exactly how it is.’ What we want to do is create an atmosphere where you can feel how it was [in ancient times].”</p> <p>Heilung know what they are talking about when it comes to ancient music. Juul and vocalist Maria Franz met through Viking re-enactment societies and formed Heilung alongside Kai Uwe Faust, a Viking-inspired tattoo artist, in 2014. Since then, the band have set themselves the goal of “amplifying history”. Their two previous studio releases, Ofnir and Futha, resurrect the music of Viking, iron age and bronze age cultures, inspired in part by an extensive library of artefacts and texts owned by Franz, who is also the band’s archivist – and their live shows extend that historical fascination with their costumed theatricality and tribe-sized lineups.</p> <p>“I think that we can learn something by looking backwards,” says Juul, speaking alongside Franz in a video call from his home studio in Copenhagen. “A lot of what we do is about respecting the ground under our feet and, also, some basic human emotions that I think – if you are too busy, living in this too-hectic reality – might get lost to you. Turning back time also slows time down.”</p> <p>That predilection towards ancient sounds makes perfect sense when co-lead singer Franz reveals that Juul was the son of a goði: a priest of Norse paganism. “In Scandinavia, it’s still an accepted religion to work within the old beliefs,” Juul says. “My father married people and baptised children. We did the blót” – a Norse pagan ritual to mark the start of the summer and winter half-years – “twice a year. It was completely normal.”</p> <p>Franz grew up near Borre national park: a Viking burial ground in southern Norway. “Those grounds are the reason why I am who I am today,” she says. “It’s a beautiful place. I always used to dream about how Viking people would live there and dress, and how they would fall in love and how they would fight for their village.”</p> <p>On Drif, Heilung broaden their horizons beyond their usual landscape of Nordic and Germanic cultures. There is a serenade called Tenet, which hums ages-old folk melodies inspired by the<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21419050/tenet-explained-sator-square-nolan\"> Sator Square</a>, an ancient Roman palindrome excavated in various places around Europe, and which inspired Christopher Nolan’s film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/25/tenet-review-christopher-nolan-head-scratchingly-ambitious\">Tenet</a>. The song Urbani was sung by soldiers in the Roman Army, while Buslas Bann is a 13th-century Icelandic curse.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVbc_Fwbt50\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SVbc_Fwbt50?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video for Anoana from new album Drif</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Nikkal, Heilung’s interpretation of Hymn to Nikkal, is the album’s penultimate track. The band based it on the 1984 academic paper A Hurrian Musical Score from Ugarit: The Discovery of Mesopotamian Music by <a href=\"https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/guillemin-marcelle\">Marcelle Duchesne-Guillemin</a>, a pioneer of ancient music theory. She believed that the piece contained intervals that, together, form a two-part harmony. It was a perfect fit for Heilung, with their two vocalists. The result is three of Drif’s most hypnotic minutes, as otherworldly as it is beautiful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/07/kronos-quartet-david-harrington-violin\">‘A truce with the trees’: Rebecca Solnit on the wonders of a 300-year old violin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One known fact about the song is its dedication to Nikkal: the wife of the moon god worshipped in the ancient Middle East. “Most songs are created as a way to remember,” says Juul. “We’ve seen it in Iceland, where people have composed these incredibly long songs that repeat over and over again, created as a way to detail a lineage. I’m pretty sure that a song like Hymn to Nikkal would have been written down to teach adults and children about this subject: this moon goddess.”</p> <p>For millennia, the history of music was sustained solely through word of mouth. Generations have always passed songs down to the next generation, be it spoken, written or recorded. So, is there a through line – are there echoes of Hymn to Nikkal in modern popular music? Franz laughs. “No. The rhythm in that text is just so weird; it’s so alien. I’ve never heard anything like it.”</p> <p>Hence, for Heilung, the preservation of Hymn to Nikkal is all the more important. “My wish is that people will really feel the emotion behind the ancient pieces we are reinterpreting,” she continues, “because we’re travelling through the whole spectrum of human emotion. Music is one of the tools that we can use to reconnect with ourselves, our surroundings and the people around us.”</p> <p>• Drif is released on Season of Mist on 19 August.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/18/scientists-discover-how-mosquitoes-can-sniff-out-humans","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T15:00:49Z","webTitle":"Scientists discover how mosquitoes can ‘sniff out’ humans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/18/scientists-discover-how-mosquitoes-can-sniff-out-humans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/18/scientists-discover-how-mosquitoes-can-sniff-out-humans","fields":{"headline":"Scientists discover how mosquitoes can ‘sniff out’ humans","trailText":"Unlike most animals, mosquitoes can pick up on odours via several different pathways, study suggests","byline":"Sascha Pare","body":"<p>Whether you opt for repellant, long sleeves or citronella coils, the dreaded drone of a mosquito always seems to find its way back to you.</p> <p>Now researchers say they have found the mechanism behind the insect’s ability to home in on humans.</p> <p>Humans give off a fragrant cocktail of body odour, heat and carbon dioxide, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/27/how-mosquitoes-find-us-in-the-dark-daniel-glaser\">varies from person to person</a> and mosquitoes use to locate their next meal. While most animals have a specific set of neurons that detect each type of odour, mosquitoes can pick up on smells via several different pathways, suggests the study, <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00927-8\">which is published in the science journal Cell</a>.</p> <p>“We found that there’s a real difference in the way mosquitoes encode the odours that they encounter compared to what we’ve learned from other animals,” said Meg Younger, an assistant professor of biology at Boston University and one of the lead authors of the study.</p> <p>Researchers at the Rockefeller University, in New York, were baffled when mosquitoes were somehow still able to find people to bite after having an entire family of human odour-sensing proteins removed from their genome.</p> <p>The team then examined odour receptors in the antennae of mosquitoes, which bind to chemicals floating around in the environment and signal to the brain via neurons.</p> <p>“We assumed that mosquitoes would follow the central dogma of olfaction, which is that only one type of receptor is expressed in each neuron,” said Younger. “Instead, what we’ve seen is that different receptors can respond to different odours in the same neuron.”</p> <p>This means losing one or more receptors does not affect the ability of mosquitoes to pick up on human smells. This backup system could have evolved as a survival mechanism, the researchers say.</p> <p>“The mosquito <em>Aedes aegypti</em> is specialised to bite humans, and it is believed that they evolved to do that because humans are always close to fresh water and mosquitoes lay their eggs in fresh water. We are basically the perfect meal, so the drive to find humans is extremely strong,” said Younger.</p> <p>Ultimately, the researchers say, understanding how the mosquito brain processes human odour could be used to intervene in biting behaviour and reduce the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue and yellow fever.</p> <p>“One major strategy for controlling mosquitoes is to attract them to traps to remove them from the biting population. If we could use this knowledge to understand how human odour is represented in the mosquito antennae and brain, we could develop blends that are more attractive to mosquitoes than we are. We could also develop repellants that target those receptors and neurons that detect human odour,” said Younger.</p> <p>Dr Olena Riabinina, from the Insect Neuro Lab at Durham University, who was not involved in the research, said: “We already knew that mosquitoes are hard-wired to bite humans, but this research tells us that their olfactory system is different and more complex than we thought. Interventions based on this new information could be very promising.”</p> <p>Dr Marta Andres Miguel, from University College London, who was also not involved, said: “This is a remarkable discovery not only from a fundamental biology perspective, but also from a disease-control perspective, as it opens new paths for the development of novel tools to control mosquitoes, either to attract them to traps, or to repel them and avoid human biting.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/18/i-thought-drink-and-drugs-enabled-my-creativity-julia-cameron-on-the-drama-behind-the-artists-way","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T15:00:49Z","webTitle":"‘I thought drink and drugs enabled my creativity’: Julia Cameron on the drama behind The Artist’s Way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/18/i-thought-drink-and-drugs-enabled-my-creativity-julia-cameron-on-the-drama-behind-the-artists-way","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/18/i-thought-drink-and-drugs-enabled-my-creativity-julia-cameron-on-the-drama-behind-the-artists-way","fields":{"headline":"‘I thought drink and drugs enabled my creativity’: Julia Cameron on the drama behind The Artist’s Way","trailText":"When even Hunter S Thompson tells you to take it easy, you must be overdoing it.

In practice, everyone makes exceptions. But, in the more than 30 years in which Julia Cameron has started her day by writing down three pages of stream-of-conscious thoughts, she has only ever missed one. That was years ago, when she was travelling to New York from her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, over several flights. Her cherished morning routine was lost in transit. The impact of the disruption is what Cameron, 74, remembers.</p> <p>“I felt scattered and disorganised, and unable to think clearly,” she says, sounding dismayed all these years later. Then she brightens. “I realised: oh my God, the morning pages really shaped my life.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/14/the-artists-way-at-30-alicia-keyes-pete-townsend-and-the-surprising-re-birth-of-a-creativity-classic\">The Artist’s Way at 30: Alicia Keys, Pete Townshend and the surprising re-birth of a creativity classic </a> </p> </aside>  <p>She started the habit in her 30s, just after her divorce from film director Martin Scorsese, as she battled alcoholism and cocaine addiction – and raised their baby daughter. In all this chaos, she settled on three handwritten pages as an achievable target, no matter how difficult it might seem.</p> <p>Cameron’s morning pages have, also, of course, shaped the lives of millions of others. They are a central tenet of her bestselling book The Artist’s Way: a publishing phenomenon that still connects with people 30 years after it was first published. The book is a practical guide to “creativity as a spiritual practice” and has sold more than 4m copies since it came out in 1992<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Over the 12-week course it lays out, Cameron leads the reader through exercises to “discover and recover” their inner artist, which she believes is often buried by factors such as fear of judgment or shame. Much of the strategy and advice in the Artist’s Way is common sense, such as protecting time for creativity and prioritising play. But Cameron’s whimsical, idiosyncratic voice elevates it beyond the obvious.</p> <p>On the page, she is compassionate and cajoling, convincing you of your capability and jollying you along with anecdotes about her Hollywood years. I’m not surprised to find that Cameron is just as lively and engaging in person – but I am touched by the interest she shows in me.</p> <p>She has even dressed up for our call, her berry-coloured lipstick matching her glasses and her hair in a loose up-do. I apologise for my own relative scruffiness. “I wanted to look particularly nice,” Cameron says. “Then I woke up this morning, and I thought, ‘Oh dear! My hair is all awry!’”</p> <p>She recently revisited her 2006 memoir Floor Sample, now published for the first time in the UK. “I found myself feeling that maybe it’s time to give people a glimpse of the artist behind The Artist’s Way,” she says.</p> <p>“I was able to take a look at exactly how very resilient I had been as an artist. I hadn’t allowed adversity to stop me.” It’s true that in reading Floor Sample I was flabbergasted by the turbulence, hardship and angst that Cameron has endured over her life – as well as the matter-of-fact, even sanguine way she recounts it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At the Washington Post, she wrote snappy, stylish pieces on everything from nail polish to politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Growing up in Libertyville, Illinois, Cameron was the second-eldest of seven children, born to parents who treasured music and literature. She was only allowed to watch films that received an A-grade for decency – but she could read whatever she liked, fostering a passion for writing.</p> <p>Living in Washington, in her early 20s, Cameron talked her way into an office job at the Washington Post, and then a byline. She became known for snappy, stylish pieces on everything from nail polish trends to politics. When her bosses suggested she might like to do her actual administrative job, she quit to freelance.</p> <p>Her big break came when she interviewed the children of the Watergate conspirator E Howard Hunt, a scoop for Rolling Stone. She had a hot new career and a new journalist crowd, “many of them heavy drinkers”. Cameron fitted right in, to such an extent that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/11/hunter-s-thompson-gonzo-writer-photographer-pa-chloe-sells-hot-damn-colorado-cabin\">Hunter S Thompson</a> told her she might like to cut back on the booze. “Five nights out of six, you are the best date in town,” she says he told her. “But on that sixth night …”</p> <p>But drinking had become central to Cameron’s identity as a hard-nosed, hard-living reporter and her mounting sense of herself as an aspiring spiritual artist. </p> <p>Striving for control, she imposed rules: no hard spirits, don’t drink and write – unless she had amphetamines to keep her lucid. “I thought that the drinking and the drug use were enabling my creativity … We have a mythology that tells us artists should be drunk and in pain.” But by 1976, she had graduated to cocaine – and married Scorsese.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f5b06e6d3f5c09d05ea97d59c07aa71a5f1272f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f5b06e6d3f5c09d05ea97d59c07aa71a5f1272f/0_0_2750_1709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert De Niro, Julia Cameron and Martin Scorsese at the premiere of Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore at Cannes in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"621\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert De Niro, Julia Cameron and Martin Scorsese at the premiere of Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore at Cannes in 1975.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frat/Backgrid</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They met when Cameron was sent to profile the then up-and-coming director. The commission was spiked after their interview concluded in his hotel suite (where she zhooshed up the script for Taxi Driver). Cameron writes in her memoir that she knew within seconds of meeting Scorsese that they would marry; she even called her mother to say so, halfway through their interview.</p> <p>Their daughter Domenica, an artist, was born within a year of their wedding. The relationship tarnished Cameron’s reputation as a journalist – one editor advised her to get a divorce – but it led to opportunities in screenwriting. Had she stayed married to Scorsese, The Artist’s Way would not have been written, says Cameron. “He was very generous; he shared his films with me and wanted to use my talents – and I was delighted to do that … I would have spent my time aiding and abetting and helping him.”</p> <p>But Cameron’s escalating reliance on alcohol and cocaine – plus Scorsese’s highly public affair with Liza Minnelli while making New York, New York – put pressure on the marriage. They divorced the following year, after Cameron was hospitalised with a nervous breakdown.</p> <p>She finally hit rock bottom and got help.<strong> </strong>“When I started getting sober, I was told that I had to pray,” Cameron says. “I said: ‘Prayer? Not me!’</p> <p>“They said: ‘You must believe in something.’ I thought about it and then I realised that I believed in a line from Dylan Thomas: ‘The force that through the green fuse drives the flower’, that particular creative energy that makes something grow to be a petunia or a pansy …</p> <p>“It struck me as being far more benevolent than the concepts of God that I had grown up with.” The thought freed her own tortured artist, facilitating free and full expression; she has been sober for 44 years.</p> <p>God looms large in The Artist’s Way as – Cameron explains – a shorthand for some kind of creative force or higher power working through us, and the strange synchronicity and mysticism of making art. Now, when she writes her morning pages, Cameron will explicitly address “the Great Creator” or “Little Julie”, her younger self, and ask for guidance. “Then I listen, and I write down what I hear.”</p> <p>That has included past directives to go to New Mexico (“this was before New Mexico was chic”), and even which route to take there; she went on to split her time between there, Los Angeles and New York.</p> <p>In the late 80s, she began to test her approach on her fellow “blocked” artist friends and students of the creative writing programmes she was teaching in New York. When her course notes were passed around, Cameron began to circulate photocopies, then selling them for $20.</p> <p>Word of mouth led them to be picked up by what is now an imprint of Penguin; the first run was just 9,000 copies. On Zoom, triumph glints behind Cameron’s glasses. “They thought: ‘It’s a little teeny California woo-woo book.’ It was only once we had sold about 100,000 copies that they said: ‘Maybe we should pay some attention to this.’”</p> <p>Was she surprised by the response? No, she says – not because of ego, but because of the wide range of test subjects she had had in her creativity workshops. “Lawyers, judges, sculptors, actors, writers, housewives, accountants, ballerinas – all were finding that they opened up to their creativity through using the tools.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"53af0824f40353e4705ecea85bbdbd880a93e8f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53af0824f40353e4705ecea85bbdbd880a93e8f0/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“What I say is: you’re falling in love with yourself,” she says. “When you write your three pages, you’re sending a telegram to the universe, saying: ‘This is what I like. This is what I want more of. This is what I want less of.’”</p> <p>She advises doing the pages immediately on waking, before your mental defences are up (and certainly before looking at your phone) – and only three pages. Any more feeds the ego, she says, in itself a block to free creativity.</p> <p>However, “There is no wrong way to write morning pages,” says Cameron. “It can be as negative as you wish, as positive as you wish, about an issue which is deep or shallow.”</p> <p>My unbroken streak of morning pages is nowhere near Cameron’s, but, even in my stints of three weeks or so, I have found that they settle me for the rest of the day, a bit like going for a run first thing. The effect is to bring whatever might be rolling around in your subconscious mind out into the open: whether latent desires or uncomfortable truths. For instance, Cameron mentions someone who was forced to confront their problem drinking after realising all their daily pages mentioned a hangover.</p> <p>The other pillar of The Artist’s Way is “artist’s dates”: a weekly sojourn, specifically to inspire. Like the morning pages, it is simple to do and<strong> </strong>hard to maintain. But, with consistency and commitment, Cameron swears, “It does transform lives.”</p> <p>“One of the things I really love is that it forces you to take ownership of your creativity,” the actor Ito Aghayere tells me. Aghayere stumbled upon Cameron’s book in 2018, while feeling adrift not long after moving to LA; within six months, she had landed a CBS show. Most recently, she has appeared in Star Trek: Picard.</p> <p>She says the book changed her life: “It’s an existential journey into rediscovering that sense of possibility that we can all engage with, no matter what industry you’re in … I’ve bought so many copies for friends.”</p> <p>It’s not just the conviction of Cameron’s celebrity following that is telling, it’s the diversity. Fans include Patricia Cornwell, Reese Witherspoon, Pete Townshend, Alicia Keys and John Cleese, while Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat Pray Love, has completed the entire course at least three times. </p> <p>Cameron is always being confronted by the impact she has made. “People will come up to me and say, ‘Here’s the book that I wrote’, or ‘the necklace that I made’, or ‘I have my own one-woman show now’. I’m so grateful to think that my work has been a building block in someone else’s.”</p> <p>No one is exempt. Underpinning The Artist’s Way is Cameron’s belief that everyone is creative and capable of becoming more so. “We all have an inner spark,” Cameron says – and her books give us permission to pursue it. “What I have found is that people read The Artist’s Way with a sense of relief: ‘Oh, so I’m not crazy.’”</p> <p>Could she imagine her own life without the morning pages?</p> <p>“No,” she answers, with certainty. “And I don’t want to.”</p> <p> • This article was amended on 21 August 2022 to remove a personal detail. </p> <p><em>Floor Sample: A Creative Memoir by Julia Cameron (Souvenir Press) is out in the UK now.

But the folk at Wolverhampton Wanderers have signally calmer dispositions than the uber-rattled Darwin Núñez. Disappointing draw with the Cottagers? No need to fret, fuss and feud! Let’s simply respond by quietly and efficiently breaking the club transfer record for one of the most talked-about young midfielders in Europe! And there we have it, spirit restored at a stroke. All tranquil again, and no need to be putting the nut on anyone quite yet.</p> <p>Matheus Nunes of Sporting is the latest player to come careering, in more ways than one, down the Jorge Mendes Highway, that well-trodden toll road that runs direct from Portugal to the west Midlands. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/18/transfer-roundup-wolves-sign-nunes-fulham-agree-terms-with-kluivert\">This particular journey</a> has cost Wolves an initial £38m, plus five million of your continental euros in potential add-ons, should stuff happen. The fee exceeds Wolves’ previous biggest outlay, the €35m they paid Porto for Fábio Silva, who is now on loan at Anderlecht where he’s already scored more goals (five) in six appearances than he did for Wolves (four) in 63. That’s very promising news for Wolves in the long run, and yet they wouldn’t be human if those stats somehow didn’t make their teeth itch. It’s OK to be unsure how to process this sort of stuff.</p> <p>Silva was very young when he arrived at Molineux, though – he’s still only 20 – but more will be expected from the get-go of 23-year-old Nunes. He’s already helped Sporting to their first Portuguese title in nearly 20 years, while Pep Guardiola has described him as “one of the best players in the world today”. Given that Manchester City were sniffing around the all-action, sashay-happy midfielder as a result, and Liverpool had shown serious interest too, this is something of a coup for Wolves. The only slight downside for supporters is the almost certain knowledge that the club will only be able to hang on to Nunes for so long – the words “it’s the right next step for me!” betray that state of affairs in plain sight – but they’ll enjoy him while it lasts, and it’s not as though there won’t be plenty more fresh meat hurtling down the JMH soon enough.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“It has been a crap start, we can’t say that enough” – Leipzig sports director Oliver Mintzlaff isn’t mincing his words after two draws from their first two Bundesliga games.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cca503676c763083fd01531b56f3edd3e577f4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cca503676c763083fd01531b56f3edd3e577f4e/0_0_5392_3592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At least Timo is back, eh?

an anxious lead-up to collecting his grades on Thursday morning.</p> <p>“I didn’t sleep last night,” he said, after opening his results at Temple Moor high school in Leeds. “I think last time I checked my phone it was four in the morning. I felt sick last night just thinking about all the mistakes I did in the exams.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/a-level-results-a-and-a-star-grades-fall-sharply\">Number of top A-level grades falls sharply as north-south divide grows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But he need not have worried. He managed a B and three Cs, allowing him to study law and politics at the University of Law in Leeds. Though Savage was one of the third of students who missed out on their top choice of course, having hoped to do a master’s integrated degree, he was pleased nonetheless.</p> <p>He said: “My mocks were a bit higher and it’s infuriating that in some subjects I was a couple of marks away from the grade boundary. Law was a bit lower than I thought but it’s fine, I’m not complaining.”</p> <p>This year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/live/2022/aug/18/a-level-exam-results-day-2022-live-ucas-university-clearing\">the north-south divide in attainment has worsened and Yorkshire was one of the lower-performing regions</a>. This disparity has been put down to the impact of Covid, as some places, particularly poorer areas, were harder hit.</p> <p>While education at all levels suffered, this cohort of A-level students had the additional challenge of having not done exams since their year 6 Sats and having missed their GCSEs, which were assessed by teachers based on their school work and mock grades.</p> <p>For Jess Peers, who earned a place studying environmental management at Manchester University, and Jake Sterling, who is going on to do a degree apprenticeship in quantity surveying at Leeds Beckett University, the stress of future-altering exams was huge.</p> <p>“But it was worth it,” 18-year-old Peers said, collecting her As and Bs.</p> <p>Sterling agreed, adding: “My grades are higher than I was expecting and higher than I got in my GCSEs.”</p> <p>Matthew West, the school principal, said the pandemic had been tough for school, having to adapt to decisions made at a national level.</p> <p>“There were numerous stories around policies or instructions or decisions being made the day before they had to be enacted, stuff coming through at midnight, for example, and I think the fallout is that it has bred a divide between school leaders and the policymakers, which needs to come together for the sake of young people,” he said.</p> <p>“And now there is the added issue of funding. I’m going to go into this next year with not enough money and that’s before we consider fuel and energy price rises.”</p> <p>He said he would have to look at the affordability of school trips and whether less-popular subjects would need to be cut.</p> <p>“We’ve got over Covid but we’ve come back into a completely different climate. The government is saying we can have a world class education system and we can do it on the cheap. But you can’t. There’s not an economy in the world that’s done it on the cheap.”</p> <p>Nevertheless, he was “fiercely proud” of this cohort of students for balancing part-time jobs, sports and other extracurricular activities with their studies. He said: “I think they’re amazing with what they’ve done. They didn’t use Covid as an excuse to give up and not try, they’ve really got stuck into it and they’ve got their rewards today.”</p> <p>Savage said he would be celebrating with a Nando’s later, while Peers was planning to go out with friends.</p> <p>Sterling added: “If I say what I’m doing tonight I’ll be in trouble … so I’ll keep my mouth shut!”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/18/wesley-fofana-leicester-will-not-play-chelsea-interest-distraction-brendan-rodgers","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T14:54:15Z","webTitle":"Fofana will not play if Chelsea interest becomes distraction, says Rodgers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/18/wesley-fofana-leicester-will-not-play-chelsea-interest-distraction-brendan-rodgers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/18/wesley-fofana-leicester-will-not-play-chelsea-interest-distraction-brendan-rodgers","fields":{"headline":"Fofana will not play if Chelsea interest becomes distraction, says Rodgers","trailText":"Leicester’s manager has said he will leave Wesley Fofana out of the side if he is affected by the pursuit of Chelsea, from whom a new bid in excess of £80m is expected","byline":"Ben Fisher","body":"<p>Brendan Rodgers has said he would not hesitate to omit Wesley Fofana from his squad if he felt the defender was affected by Chelsea’s sustained transfer pursuit but made it clear the Frenchman has not submitted a transfer request. Leicester have rejected two bids from Chelsea and are expecting a third that could be worth more than £80m, which would make him the most expensive defender in the world. Leicester are reluctant to sell Fofana, who is thought to be keen on joining Chelsea.</p> <p>Rodgers is keen to keep Fofana, with whom he has held numerous conversations since Chelsea’s interest has heightened. Leicester’s public stance is that Fofana is not for sale and they are determined not to lose the defender this window. However it may be difficult for Leicester, who need to offload players to strengthen, to turn down a record-breaking offer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/arsenal-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">Gabriel Jesus brace helps Arsenal outgun Leicester in six-goal thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Leicester manager acknowledged that the external noise surrounding the player could be destabilising. “Mentally he is fine, but as you can imagine for a 21-year-old with the spotlight on you, [the] talking about what you maybe can earn at another club, where you can play, it’s a challenge, that’s the honest answer. He’s been absolutely brilliant since his first day here.</p> <p>“You have to remember these are very young guys. For some of them it’s the first time they’ve experienced these situations. There can always be disruption but the idea is to keep the group focused. The minute the window shuts it all ends but while we’re in this period it’s challenging.”</p> <p>Asked whether he would leave Fofana out of his team to face Southampton on Saturday if the defender were not in the right frame of mind, Rodgers replied: “Yes, 100%. If the players aren’t totally focused and committed to the club and being here, or for whatever reason just aren’t in the right mindset, that won’t help us. We have to ensure everyone is really focused in order for us to play the best game we can. I will always assess that after the sessions.”</p> <p>Fofana has shone since joining Leicester from Saint-Étienne two years ago and has impressed following his return from a leg fracture. Chelsea are keen to sign him to replace Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rüdiger, who left the club on free transfers this summer. “It’s a challenge for any player, in particular young one, but he knows he’s loved here and this is an important step for his career, being here at Leicester and having more development, but it’s natural when other clubs are interested in you because of your talent, and especially with the money that comes with that,” Rodgers said. “It certainly makes you think, that’s for sure.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/18/sarah-sherman-review-snl","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T14:37:31Z","webTitle":"Sarah Sherman review – Saturday Night Live star’s queasy comedy hour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/18/sarah-sherman-review-snl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/18/sarah-sherman-review-snl","fields":{"headline":"Sarah Sherman review – Saturday Night Live star’s queasy comedy hour","trailText":"Sherman’s show, pitched between anti-comedy, performance art and body horror, leaves no doubt why she’s also known as Sarah Squirm","byline":"Brian Logan","body":"<p>Delightfully weird, says the pre-publicity.

Sarah Sherman – Long Island native, featured player on Saturday Night Live – delivers to the fringe one of those late-night, is-this-really-happening? shows that feel like a fever dream.

There’s certainly nothing straight about the show, which feels substantially made up on the hoof, as the 29-year-old keens at reviewers to give her five stars, squawks about “Saint Arthur’s Seat” in a bad cockney accent and weighs up the relative virtues of haggis and her “pussy”.</p> <p>There are one or two recognisably comic set-pieces: a riff sending up her home town’s civic pride, in a thick Noo Yawk accent; another on the labyrinthine ways her well-networked dad will find you a job. There’s a guided meditation set-piece, the joke of which – as conventional as Sherman gets – is that her narration is profoundly unsoothing, and sexually unsettling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/18/the-bush-review-summerhall-edinburgh-environmental-action\">The Bush review – one-woman show about collective green action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the US, Sherman occasionally performs under the nom de guerre Sarah Squirm, and the second half here does exactly what it says on that tin. A series of DIY video animations illustrate a guess-what-you’re-looking-at quiz, in which the answers range from haemorrhoid blood, “pimple pop cream cheese” and turd emerging from an anus. Heartily though I sympathise with the politics of Sherman’s pushback against the prettifying of the female body, I averted my eyes from much of this stuff, not laughing but blanching.</p> <p>But hey, it’s a strong flavour, and the image-making, when not completely gross, is often vividly strange – as when Sherman-on-screen makes Gaudi-esque sandcastles with her vagina.

Here is a history of the last four central bank governors, courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/revolving-door-turkeys-last-four-central-bank-chiefs-2021-10-08/\">Reuters</a>:</p> \n  <p><strong>Murat Cetinkaya</strong>’s early months as governor in 2016 were the last time when Turkey’s inflation rate was within an official target range around 5%. Throughout 2018 he faced rising price pressures and lira depreciation that culminated in a full-blown currency crisis, which was driven by a diplomatic dispute over the release of a US pastor, the threat of US sanctions and emerging worries over Erdogan’s influence over monetary policy.</p> \n  <p>Analysts said Cetinkaya was too slow to head off the crisis. By the time he raised the key policy interest rate to 24% in September of 2018, the economy was falling into a deep downturn that would bring an end to years of the strong economic growth that had come to define Erdogan’s leadership since 2003. However, He held policy steady and brought about a sharp fall in annual inflation through most of 2019.</p> \n  <p>Weeks after becoming governor, <strong>Murat Uysal</strong> - who had been Cetinkaya’s deputy - began an aggressive easing cycle that brought the policy rate as low as 8.25% in 2020, from 24%. The cuts, combined with a boom in state-bank lending, helped ease financial stresses as the coronavirus pandemic hit. But with inflation rebounding, Uysal reversed course and began tightening again in his last few months at the central bank.</p> \n  <p>A former finance minister and long-time member of Erdogan’s AK Party, <strong>Naci Agbal</strong> took the reins on an explosive weekend in Turkish politics. A day after the appointment, Albayrak, Erdogan’s son-in-law, announced his resignation as finance minister with a message on Instagram. Reuters later reported that Agbal had met with Erdogan days earlier to warn that the Albayrak-Uysal policy of currency interventions left the central bank’s reserves vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>Agbal quickly emerged as a respected inflation hawk and his short stint was dominated by aggressive rate hikes that picked up where Uysal left off. The lira rallied in response and some foreign investors edged back into Turkish assets after years of fleeing. Days before he too was fired early on a Saturday, Agbal raised rates one last time to 19%.</p> \n  <p>An ex-banker, <strong>Sahap Kavcioglu</strong>’s arrival at the bank was met with a sharp market sell-off in which the lira briefly lost 15% of its value before recovering some losses.

He told the PA news agency:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Using taxpayers’ money to satisfy the anti-union agenda of the Tory party and seek to break the trade unions is shameful and means the dispute will be prolonged indefinitely as the train companies don’t lose a penny as a result of the industrial action and therefore have no incentive to settle the disputes.</p> \n   <p>Instead of waging an ideological war against rail workers, millions of voters would rather that the Government allow for a fair negotiated settlement.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>A Department for Transport spokesperson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yet again, for the sixth time since June, union leaders are opting to inflict misery and disrupt the day-to-day lives of millions instead of working with industry to agree a deal that will bring our railways into the 21st century.<br><br>It’s clear strikes are not the powerful tool they once were and union chiefs are no longer able to bring the country to a standstill as, unlike them, the world has changed and people simply work from home.</p> \n   <p>All these strikes are doing is hurting those people the unions claim to represent, many of whom will again be out of pocket and forced to miss a day’s work.</p> \n   <p>We urge union bosses to do the right thing by their members and let them have their say on Network Rail’s very fair deal, which will deliver the reforms our rail system urgently needs.

The frantic clanging of metal on metal at its furthest tip, however, is new.</p> <p>Built in 1982, the jetty was designed to host not just two import terminals for chemicals but also one for liquefied natural gas (LNG), shipped in on tankers from the US. With cheap Russian gas beating LNG for price, those tankers never arrived. Two adjacent plots of land, reclaimed from the North Sea to make space for industry, instead attracted rare warblers and bitterns.</p> <p>But as Russia’s war in Ukraine upends decades of German energy policy, getting LNG tankers to dock on the Hooksiel jetty is suddenly a matter of national priority.</p> <p>Wilhelmshaven, the nearby historic port city, has become emblematic of a two-fold, seemingly contradictory promise made by Germany’s government: that it can import LNG to compensate for throttled gas imports from Russia at record speed, belying a reputation for bureaucratic plodding; and that the jetty into the North Sea will carry LNG – a polluting fossil fuel – for only a short time, soon to be replaced with a more climate-friendly substitute.</p> <p>Wilhelmshaven is one of five floating LNG terminals Germany is rushing to build by the end of the year, creating infrastructure that a <a href=\"https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en/press-releases/news-19-07-2022.html\">study in July by the Fraunhofer Institute</a> argued would be vital to avoid cold homes and closed factories this winter not just in Germany but across all of Europe as Vladimir Putin turns off the tap.</p> <p>The Höegh Esperanza, a 300-metre long tanker converted into a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit and chartered by the German government at a mooted cost of €200,000 a day, will dock at the jetty and turn liquid back into gas at a rate of about 10 hours per tanker load.</p> <p>Roughly 80 tankers are expected to arrive at Wilhelmshaven each year, substituting half of the gas imports the German energy company Uniper used to have from Russia, or 8% of Germany’s overall gas usage before the start of the war.</p> <p>Shortly after Russian troops crossed on to Ukrainian soil in the spring, the talk was that building LNG terminals would take three to five years. Now politicians are confident the terminal and its connecting pipeline can be built in seven months, with works finishing on 21 December and gas flowing the day after.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b194f9fcf79e7608ccd33a5f95419beb912be36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b194f9fcf79e7608ccd33a5f95419beb912be36/0_218_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holger Kreetz, of Uniper\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holger Kreetz, of Uniper, on a ferry trip to the construction site of the LNG terminals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Selim Sudheimer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Uniper, which is managing the build, is only slightly more cautious, saying windy weather in the colder months could yet delay completion until the second half of the winter.</p> <p>Behind-schedule building projects, such as Berlin’s new airport and Hamburg’s Elbphilharmonie concert hall, have in recent years busted myths of German efficiency. The LNG terminals are trying to buck the trend by instead emulating the model behind the creation of Tesla’s new Gigafactory in Brandenburg, with building works already starting while permit applications are still being scrutinised.</p> <p>“Everything that’s usually done step by step, we are now doing in parallel,” said Holger Kreetz, Uniper’s chief operating officer for asset management, on a boat trip to the far end of the Hooksiel jetty at the start of the week.</p> <p>Environmental impact assessments, usually a requisite step, are simply being skipped. The economic affairs minister, Robert Habeck, a Green party politician and self-proclaimed “biggest porpoise fan in the government”, has shrugged off concerns that building works could disturb the endangered aquatic mammals basking in Jade Bay. Ensuring Germany was no longer blackmailable by Putin had to take priority, he said.</p> <p>Germany’s about-face from Russian natural gas pipelines to shipped-in LNG will not just test the political credibility of the Greens. “It’s hard to admit, but we probably wouldn’t have got around to building these terminals so quickly if it wasn’t for the war,” said Olaf Lies, the centre-left Social Democrat environment minister for the state of Lower Saxony. “To an extent, what is happening in Wilhelmshaven now also shows up the political failures of the past. We got too comfortable and neglected other projects we should have tackled.”</p> <p>The hope is that Europe’s energy crisis could be an opportunity to take strides towards a greener future rather than be a setback for its climate targets, said Lies, who insisted that the Hooksiel jetty would host a “molecule terminal” rather than one specific to LNG.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78ce886705f17691bae1a2182bf70521e9172d28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78ce886705f17691bae1a2182bf70521e9172d28/0_154_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The replenishment ship Berlin of the German Navy is pictured in an urban neighbourhood in Wilhelmshaven.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The replenishment ship Berlin of the German Navy is pictured in an urban neighbourhood in Wilhelmshaven.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Selim Sudheimer/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Germany has committed to being greenhouse gas-neutral by 2045, the pipelines on the North Sea coast would soon not be pumping LNG but green hydrogen, produced by using renewable electricity to drive an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen, Lies said in an interview.</p> <p>Some of the green hydrogen would be produced in Wilhelmshaven, where Uniper is converting a phased-out coal plant into an electrolyser. The rest would be imported via the new terminal infrastructure.</p> <p>Open Grid Europe, the company connecting the terminal to the national gas grid, said its pipelines were 100% hydrogen-compatible barring some additional insulation before a switch over. Tests are proceeding to establish whether a natural underground salt dome outside Wilhelmshaven, where German emergency crude oil supplies have been stored since the 1970s, could hold hydrogen.</p> <p>“The big energy exporters of tomorrow aren’t going to be those countries rich in natural gas, but the ones that have plenty of wind, sun and water,” Lies said, painting a picture of his home town’s reinvention as a renewable energy hub for imports from Australia, South America and Africa. “Green Wilhelmshaven” brochures have already been printed.</p> <p>Among Wilhelmshaven’s residents some scepticism remains. The coastal city north of Bremen is a place of superlatives: the largest hub for Germany’s military, which coordinates its maritime forces from here; the country’s only German deepwater port; and the largest import terminal for crude oil, pumped all the way down into the industrial heartland in the Rhine valley. It was here that a sailors’ revolt against the Kaiser’s orders in October 1918 set off a chain of events that swept away the old German empire.</p> <p>But triumphant highs in Wilhelmshaven’s history have been swiftly followed usually by humiliating lows. After emerging as a pirate stronghold in the 14th century its fortress was destroyed by the Hanseatic League. Flourishing as the hub of the German imperial navy under the rule of Kaiser Wilhelm II, it was cut down to size by the restrictions of the Versailles Treaty.

Are we certain Germany will switch to hydrogen then?

But as the best performances regularly demonstrate, Kafka Fragments needs no visual enhancement to cast its spell, and Prohaska and Faust’s recording is among the best of what has become one of Kurtág’s most frequently recorded works.</p> <p>But the competition is fierce, and good though this new version is, I think I still marginally prefer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/feb/17/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2\">Juliane Banse’s 2006 recording with the violinist Andras Keller</a>. Banse’s silvery, flexible sound seems to match these elusive little pieces better than Prohaska’s richer tone, though as you would expect from one of the world’s greatest violinists, Faust’s contribution is exemplary. And masterpieces such as Kafka Fragments can certainly bear many different interpretative approaches.</p> <h2>This week’s other pick</h2> <p>The Berlin-based label Bastille Musique has already issued a recording of <strong><a href=\"https://www.universaledition.com/luke-bedford-3982#biography\">Luke Bedford’s</a> </strong>opera Through His Teeth, and its first batch of releases in the UK includes <strong>Besilvering, </strong>a disc of his instrumental music, played by members of the Holst-Sinfonietta, conducted by Klaus Simon.<strong> </strong>The 11 works span almost two decades of Bedford’s composing career, from the octet Man Shoots Strangers from Skyscraper, composed while he was a student in 2002, to the 2019 Hornpiece Solo, and including Wonderful No-Headed Nightingale of 2012, part of his trilogy of “Nightingale” pieces.

But would he rather have stayed a doctor?","byline":"Xan Brooks","body":"<p>Stop me if I’m rambling, says the director George Miller, perched on his stool like some saloon-bar raconteur, half-drunk on the joys of film history and lit theory. He has covered Buster Keaton and Joseph Campbell, Indigenous art and the Queen of Sheba. He says we don’t even know whether the Queen of Sheba was real, but she’s real in the legends and what’s more real than a tale? “We’re creatures of story, we’re hardwired for story. That’s how we make sense of the world.”</p> <p>Miller – soft-spoken and stocky; 77 as of last March – is best known for his dystopian Mad Max pictures, but his CV is eclectic and he has tackled all sorts. Tearjerkers (Lorenzo’s Oil, 1992), comedies (The Witches of Eastwick, 1987), kids’ capers (Happy Feet, 2006; Babe, 1995), you name it. Most good movies, he reckons, come from a similar place.

Babe is the agent of change. He relinquishes self-interest for the greater good. But when I said this, people were aghast, they looked at me like I was crazy. They said: ‘But George – it’s a talking pig.’”</p> <p>We are in the wings of the Cannes film festival. Miller is here for the premiere of Three Thousand Years of Longing, his latest change-of-pace whiplasher that may turn out to be part of a wider pattern. Based on an AS Byatt novella, it is a fairytale romance so earnest and open-hearted that it all but dares the viewer to laugh at it. Three Thousand Years of Longing stars a pointy-eared Idris Elba as the mystical Djinn and a bespectacled Tilda Swinton as a lonesome professor. The Djinn says that he can grant the professor a wish. But she is too savvy, too wary; she keeps second-guessing herself. “This wishing is a hazardous art,” she complains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f81926833f40b252db2d4006cee1cb360b330a15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f81926833f40b252db2d4006cee1cb360b330a15/0_0_2575_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Babe, 1995 film\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Agent of change’ … Babe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Pictures/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What would Miller’s wish be if he ran into a djinn? Argh, he says, he doesn’t know. The Djinn can’t grant immortality or end human suffering. Everything else would probably wind up feeling weird. “Let’s imagine I want to win the 100-metre dash and break the record at the Olympics. So I make that wish and I go and do it. It would mean nothing because it’s unearned, it’s hollow.” He thinks some more. “So I wish for my film to play really well at Cannes tonight. But if it doesn’t, that’s OK – it’s a problem of the work.”</p> <p>Miller was brought up in Queensland, Australia, by Greek immigrant parents, and for a time in his 20s he was leading two lives like Clark Kent: working as a doctor at St Vincent’s hospital in Brisbane one week, shooting his low-budget pictures the next. But naturally, he says, there was a pattern here, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/13/mad-max-40the-anniversary-how-low-budget-original-remains-film-making-feat\">Mad Max at 40: how the low-budget original remains a film-making feat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Oh, I definitely would not be making films in the way I make them had it not been for medical school. First of all, it’s all about point of view. As a doctor, you’re looking at the complete human being, down a microscope or on an X-ray or as part of a collective. Viscerally, intellectually, spiritually, anthropologically. And then, on a practical level, it’s invaluable. The first night-shoot reminded me of night sessions on emergency. Problem solving. Thinking on your feet. Never knowing what was coming through the door. So I had a lot of practice before I went on a movie set.”</p> <p>Miller made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/13/mad-max-40the-anniversary-how-low-budget-original-remains-film-making-feat\" title=\"\">his first Mad Max picture</a> in 1979, casting a pre-stardom Mel Gibson as law enforcement’s last soldier and dressing the suburbs of Melbourne as a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The film was a smash and it made Miller’s career. And this was surprising to him because he assumed that he had blown it.</p> <p>“The film was a complete disaster to me in terms of what I wanted to do,” he recalls. “I really thought I wasn’t cut out to make films. My partner, Byron Kennedy, and I had raised a pretty meagre budget from our closest friends from school. So there was an obligation to get them back their money. It was a terrible thing if we didn’t do it. We had no money for an editor, so I cut the film myself for a year. And every day for a year I was faced with the evidence of what I hadn’t done, what I’d failed to do. Why did I put the camera there? Why didn’t I ask the actors to go faster? Every day facing this film, this wreck.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd51e798d23fdd5a1dba44936167592307ef5898\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd51e798d23fdd5a1dba44936167592307ef5898/0_0_2982_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mel Gibson in Millers Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mel Gibson in Miller’s Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apologies, he says. He’s started rambling again. Long story short, the film was released and different audiences projected their own myths upon it. “In Japan, they saw it as a samurai film. The French called it a western on wheels. In Scandinavia, it was a Viking movie. And I was smart enough to know that this wasn’t as a result of anything I’d done consciously. If the work had gone smoothly I might have fallen victim to hubris.”</p> <p>Miller went on to shoot two Mad Max sequels in the 80s. In 2015, he resurrected the concept for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/17/mad-max-fury-road-review-mark-kermode\" title=\"\">the thunderous Fury Road</a>. Now he’s working on Furiosa, a Fury Road origins tale, with Anya Taylor-Joy in the old Charlize Theron role. This, I tell him, is the most obvious pattern. The director might flirt with djinns and penguins and talking pigs, but Mad Max is his first love, his life’s work. Or is that too big a claim?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>‘When I said Babe was a hero on a journey, people looked at me like I was crazy. They said: ‘But George – it’s a talking pig.’’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Too big!” he says. The only Mad Max spin-off he ever deliberately planned to make is Furiosa, the new one, just because it seemed to make total sense. All the others, he insists, were happy accidents or sudden arrivals, like those patients who blew through the emergency room door. “It’s like John Lennon says: life is what happens when you’re making other plans. I have all kinds of other plans. But somehow I keep going back to Mad Max.”</p> <p>Here’s a question a djinn might ask. Does Miller think he has been of more value to the world as a film-maker than he would have been as a doctor?</p> <p>“Oh,” he says. “Well, I think I have a bit of authority to answer this one. Because I have a twin brother, John, who I went through medical school with – and he’s still practising. He’s about to retire at the end of this year. And he’s a really excellent doctor. I’m not saying that because he’s my brother. He’s everything you’d wish for in a doctor. He’s treated three generations of the same family. Expats come back to Australia to see him. He’s involved in community health, in preventing diseases. I would not have been anywhere near the doctor that he is. I would have been OK. But not compared to him.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65a894b01548adad5aaf418eaf6cf03a28ad939f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65a894b01548adad5aaf418eaf6cf03a28ad939f/0_0_4500_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Idris Elba as Djinn in Three Thousand Years of Longing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Idris Elba as Djinn in Miller’s film Three Thousand Years of Longing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elise Lockwood/MGM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The publicist needs to wrap things up. Miller waves her away; he is still chewing over this one. “The only way I can justify it, what I do, is that there’s a social obligation in telling stories,” he says. “So, I would hope that people get some value out of them. And it’s happened to me twice – once in the US and once in Australia, where a young woman has come to me and said: ‘I’ve just had a baby girl and I want to call her Furiosa.’ So, maybe that means something.” He grimaces. “But can that be balanced up against the work of my brother? I don’t know. Probably not.”</p> <p>It’s funny, he says. The last person who asked him anything remotely like this was his father, 50 years ago, when he dropped out of medical school. “‘Why do you want to give up medicine to make movies? Isn’t medicine better?’” Miller didn’t have a good answer for his dad that day. He is not altogether convinced that he has one now. “So that’s the real life’s work,” he says. “Five decades thinking about that one question.”</p> <p>• Three Thousand Years of Longing is released in Australia on 1 September and the UK on 2 September.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/18/benjamin-mendy-said-he-had-slept-with-10000-women-trial-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T13:49:33Z","webTitle":"Benjamin Mendy said he had slept with 10,000 women, rape trial hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/benjamin-mendy-said-he-had-slept-with-10000-women-trial-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/18/benjamin-mendy-said-he-had-slept-with-10000-women-trial-hears","fields":{"headline":"Benjamin Mendy said he had slept with 10,000 women, rape trial hears","trailText":"Manchester City defender accused of raping woman in his bedroom before making boast in October 2020","byline":"Helen Pidd North of England editor","body":"<p>The Manchester City defender Benjamin Mendy told one of his alleged victims he had slept with 10,000 women, his rape trial has heard.</p> <p>The 28-year-old Frenchman made the boast to a woman after raping her in his bedroom, having confiscated her phone at his Cheshire mansion, Chester crown court heard on Thursday.</p> <p>The woman – the first of seven to go to police to accuse the footballer of rape or sexual assault – said she believed she had been locked in the room after Mendy told her she could not get out and promised to give her phone back if she stripped naked.</p> <p>In a police video interview played to the jury at Chester crown court, the woman, then a 24-year-old teacher, said she met Mendy at Parea, a bar in Alderley Edge, an affluent Cheshire town, on 11 October 2020. </p> <p>When the bar closed, she and some friends went back to Mendy’s home in nearby Mottram St Andrew, where she was confronted by the footballer after he saw her using Snapchat on her phone.</p> <p>She claims he told her that she could not put pictures of his house on social media, as he had already been fined £200,000 for having lockdown-breaking parties.

The audiences were so excited because they thought it was the last time we were ever going to play. I mean, I thought it was, too.</p> <p><strong>Middleton</strong> Our career trajectory was on a downward path. We were genuinely surprised our gigs were suddenly busy because we were splitting up. I don’t have regrets about breaking up. It was like coming out of the Big Brother house; we’d been living in this bubble for 10 or 12 years. We needed to stop and do our own thing, and then start appreciating what we’d done.</p> <p><strong>Moffat</strong> When we did re-form it was because we genuinely had a passion for making something that sounds new, rather than trying to recapture our youth. I mean, you’ve heard early Arab Strap records; who would want to recapture <em>that</em> youth? I spent most of my time moaning about my fucking terrible romantic life.</p> <p><strong>I’ve always thought </strong><strong>Packs of Three</strong><strong> would make a good national anthem for Scotland. Would your heart soar or groan to hear the Hampden crowd bellowing out the best opening line in popular music [“It was the biggest cock you’d ever seen / But you’ve no idea where that cock has been”] before international football matches? </strong><em>Paul4Jags</em></p> <p><strong>Moffat</strong> It’s a song about sexually transmitted diseases, HIV tests and rampant promiscuity. I grew up in the 80s with the “don’t die of ignorance” campaign. In my formative years as a sexually curious teenager, sex could literally kill you. And that was terrifying. So I don’t think Packs of Three would make for a very good national anthem to be sung before a football game, no.</p> <p><strong>Middleton</strong> The chorus to The First Big Weekend might work, though.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff45622497a9b4e2f80cc30f002ee8455233c15d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff45622497a9b4e2f80cc30f002ee8455233c15d/0_0_2489_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arab Strap\" width=\"1000\" height=\"992\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Picnics repulse me’ ...

I used some samples from a certain popular series of sci-fi films and that was highly illegal. The music was the only good thing about those Star Wars prequels, and I love John Williams. I did it as a tribute to his music.</p> <p><strong>Middleton</strong> I also love Aidan’s album with Bill Wells.</p> <p><strong>Moffat</strong> Malcolm’s last album, Bananas, was great. And there’s a lot of great songs on his first album; I’m particularly fond of The King of Bring.</p> <p><strong>Besides music and joviality, what would you bring to a picnic? </strong><em>vammyp</em></p> <p><strong>Moffat</strong> To be honest, I wouldn’t turn up. Picnics repulse me. I would probably bring a book or a really good pair of earphones so I didn’t have to talk to anyone.</p> <p><strong>Middleton</strong> I’d bring a picnic blanket with foil underneath so the damp doesn’t seep through, an ice box to keep your beer or cider cool, a plate of sandwiches and some games for kids.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/03/return-arab-strap-sex-death-eternal-preoccupations-hedonism\">The return of Arab Strap: ‘Sex and death are our eternal preoccupations’</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Your early records caught the mood of the 90s: the culture of heavy drinking, drug-taking and casual sex.

Gibbs-White is Forest’s 16th close-season signing as they continue to revamp their squad after promotion to the Premier League.</p> <p>Wolves rejected two previous bids from Forest for Gibbs-White but considered their third offer too good to turn down given the player is understood to have been reluctant to extend his contract beyond 2024. Forest will pay an initial £25m for Gibbs-White, plus about £10m in add-ons dependent on league appearances and if Forest avoid relegation. On top of that £35m package, Forest would have to pay further add-ons if they were to record a top-half finish or qualify for Europe. Wolves have also inserted a 15% sell-on clause in the deal.</p> <p>The 22-year-old shone in the Championship last season on loan at Sheffield United, though coincidentally he missed the penalty that meant Forest reached the playoff final. The deal for Gibbs-White means Forest have twice broken their transfer record this window, previously paying £17.5m to sign Taiwo Awoniyi, who scored his first goal in Sunday’s victory over West Ham, from Union Berlin.</p> <p>Gibbs-White, who has made 15 Premier League starts, has been Steve Cooper’s main attacking target all summer and the Forest manager will be relieved to land a player with whom he previously worked at Swansea and with England youth teams. Gibbs-White was part of the England Under-17s squad that won the World Cup under Cooper in 2017.</p> <p>After Forest’s first top-flight win in 23 years against West Ham on Sunday, Cooper said the volume of signings was a “necessity” given the turnover of players this summer. Five key loanees, including Djed Spence and James Garner, returned to their parent clubs, the former later joining Tottenham in a £20m deal. The arrival of Gibbs-White means Forest are not pursuing Brighton’s Neal Maupay despite making an offer for the striker last week.</p> <p>Wolves also broke their transfer record on Thursday to sign the Sporting Lisbon midfielder Matheus Nunes on a five-year contract in a £38m deal. The 23-year-old has eight caps for Portugal and is expected to be part of their squad at the World Cup in Qatar. Bruno Lage is expected to target another striker despite the arrival of Gonçalo Guedes from Valencia and also has a full-back and centre-back on his list of priorities.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/18/swedish-gaming-giant-buys-lord-of-rings-and-hobbit-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T13:33:27Z","webTitle":"Swedish gaming giant buys Lord of the Rings and Hobbit rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/18/swedish-gaming-giant-buys-lord-of-rings-and-hobbit-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/18/swedish-gaming-giant-buys-lord-of-rings-and-hobbit-rights","fields":{"headline":"Swedish gaming giant buys Lord of the Rings and Hobbit rights","trailText":"Embracer buys Middle-earth Enterprises which controls intellectual property rights to Tolkien’s most famous works","byline":"Mark Sweney","body":"<p>The company that owns the rights to JRR Tolkien’s works, including The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, has been bought by the Swedish gaming firm Embracer Group, which has hinted it could make spin-off films based on popular characters such as Gandalf, Aragorn and Gollum.</p> <p>Embracer has acquired Middle-earth Enterprises, the holding company that controls the intellectual property rights to films, video games, board games, merchandise, theme parks and stage productions relating to Tolkien’s two most famous literary franchises.</p> <p>The deal also includes “matching rights” in other Middle-earth-related literary works authorised by the Tolkien Estate and HarperCollins – primarily The Silmarillion and The Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth – which were published after Tolkien’s death in 1973.</p> <p>When the business was put up for sale by the Saul Zaentz Company, which acquired its rights from the heirs and estate of Tolkien and HarperCollins in 1976, it was expected that Amazon would buy it to build its own Middle-earth empire.</p> <p>In 2017, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/13/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-tv-show-confirmed\">paid $250m (£208m) for the rights</a> to make a big budget prequel to Lord of the Rings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/19/until-now-audiences-have-only-seen-the-one-ring-details-announced-for-lord-of-the-rings-tv-show\">called Rings of Power</a>, which is to have a global release on its Prime Video service on 2 September.</p> <p>Amazon negotiated directly with Tolkien’s estate to make the series, as the original rights deal struck by Saul Zaentz in 1976 did not include control of making a TV series of more than eight episodes.</p> <p>Embracer, which already holds the licence to publish board games and card games based on LOTR and The Hobbit after its acquisition of Asmodee Group earlier this year, says it is to open up more “transmedia opportunities” for the assets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/10/how-east-yorkshire-shaped-tolkiens-lord-of-the-rings-fantasy\">Dreaming shires: how East Yorkshire shaped Tolkien’s Middle-earth fantasy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Middle-earth Enterprises has financial interests in future works including Rings of Power; the Warner Bros animated film The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim to be released in 2024; and Electronic Arts’ mobile game The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Embracer said: “Other opportunities include exploring additional movies based on iconic characters such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Gollum, Galadriel, Eowyn and other characters from the literary works of JRR Tolkien, and continuing to provide new opportunities for fans to explore this fictive world through merchandising and other experiences.”</p> <p>Embracer is primarily involved in making PC and console games.

However, the scheme could create a debt pile of up to £50bn, far greater than alternatives including <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-labour-energy-bills-freeze-b2144893.html\">Labour leader Keir Starmer’s £29bn plan</a> to freeze the price cap.</p> <p>The intervention of Energy UK, which counts the industry’s biggest players among its membership, including EDF Energy, Ovo and National Grid, will add further weight to the proposals, which were first floated earlier this year.</p> <p>The Treasury is assessing ways to support households with the cost of living crisis this winter, with plans to present the incoming prime minister with a menu of options once the contest to replace Boris Johnson concludes on 5 September.</p> <p>The energy regulator Ofgem is due to announce the level of the next industry price cap on 26 August. Experts expect annual bills to hit £3,582 from 1 October and then top £4,000 from January.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed this week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/15/centrica-and-octopus-back-plan-to-freeze-uk-energy-bills-for-two-years\">Centrica and Ovo supported the idea</a>, which had been presented to government by fellow suppliers ScottishPower and E.ON.</p> <p>Dhara Vyas, Energy UK’s director of advocacy, said: “Energy bills are set to remain high for the foreseeable future so it will be crucial to put something in place that will shield customers from these. A government-backed loan scheme could help do just that by spreading the costs from an exceptionally volatile few months over a much longer period.</p> <p>“The high cost of energy, driven by record wholesale gas prices that continue to rise, is unavoidable at present. Suppliers need to recoup these costs otherwise we will see more of them go out of business, adding more expenses and disruption to customers. But this way we can tackle further increases before they hit customer bills.”</p> <p>The scheme would take time to set up, with details unlikely to be finalised until early next year. Vyas said that in the meantime, the most practical way of providing urgent support this winter would be an increase in the existing support scheme announced by Rishi Sunak in May.</p> <p>Energy UK argues an increase in the funds handed out through to the energy bills support scheme – which will cut £400 from bills for all households for a six-month period from October – is the quickest way of “providing the support urgently needed by customers ahead of Christmas”.</p> <p>Robert Buckley, of consultancy Cornwall Insight, said a similar initiative to the deficit fund had been successfully implemented in Spain. “It depends how the fund is structured, who you support and for how long. But this mechanism is proven and has been used effectively in other jurisdictions and I’m sure could work here,” he said.</p> <p>Energy UK’s letter also called for the establishment of an expert energy panel to study long-term ways of keeping bills affordable for households and businesses. And it wants the government to consider setting up a dedicated department of energy. The industry is under the remit of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.</p> <p>Separately on Thursday, Ofgem said it had decided not to alter how it covers the cost of supplier failures.

The pain pulses as if my heart has migrated to my foot, but instead of blood it is pumping razor blades. I have had my fair share of pain over the years. I have broken my back and had impacted wisdom teeth, but I have never felt anything this excruciating.</p> <p>“How have I done this?” I ask myself over and over. I went to bed with a normal toe; now, it is purple and has doubled in size. I assume I must have knocked it in the night and broken it, so I visit my local hospital, where a nurse takes one look at my bulbous toe and says: “It’s gout.” </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/\">Gout</a>! I have <em>gout</em>. What’s next? Bunions, piles, cataracts? I’m 35. I’m too young for this.</p> <p>Gout is an inflammatory form of arthritis that causes sudden, severe joint pain. Your body makes uric acid when it breaks down purines, chemical compounds found in your body and the food you eat. If the kidneys fail to filter enough uric acid from the blood, it eventually crystallises in the joints and can prompt the immune system to hit the emergency button, causing a flare-up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cca547ef54541fa4735e1e21583e57a1e8332c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cca547ef54541fa4735e1e21583e57a1e8332c8/0_0_8192_5464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Lavelle: ‘I have gout.

Bunions, piles, cataracts?’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A sore toe, it turns out, is a classic symptom of gout. Long seen as the “disease of kings”, because of its association with Henry VIII, gout is considered almost comical: something that affects rich, portly old men. Although there is a link with diet, there is a strong genetic predisposition to the condition.</p> <p>Until six months ago, Todd Ashley, 26, was a fit and healthy software engineer living in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He cycled, climbed and played football; he followed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/19/could-flexitarianism-save-the-planet\">flexitarian diet</a>, eating mostly vegetarian food unless he was eating out and had limited choices. He was hardly a stereotypical candidate for gout. Then he had his first attack. Now, the pain means he struggles even to take Harvey, his miniature poodle, for walks.</p> <p>Ashley’s gout, like mine, began in the big toe. “It was just a little bit of swelling at first, then a lot of pain at night, to the point where I was elevating my foot with all the pillows I could find in the house. It was excruciating,” he says.</p> <p>I have had only one significant flare-up since my visit to the hospital in May, plus a month or so of residual twinges in my toe, which I calm by submerging my foot in ice water. Ashley’s experience has been more challenging: “I’ll get a flare-up; things will be really painful, particularly at night. Then things will subside and I’ll think everything is on the up and things are getting better. A few days will go by, then it’ll flare up again.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"40e940852ae13e366599964570744517e3003896\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40e940852ae13e366599964570744517e3003896/350_890_2337_3110/751.jpg\" alt=\"Todd Ashley who has gout at the age of 26.\" width=\"751\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Todd Ashley who has gout at the age of 26.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Todd Ashley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before his first attack, Ashley went on a bender at a stag do: “We were drinking pretty heavily and sleeping two or three hours a night and we were fairly dehydrated. So I sort of blame that bachelor party.”</p> <p>Before my flare-up, my book publisher took me out for a fancy meal and drinks, which I later blamed for my night of agony. However, the condition doesn’t quite work like that.</p> <p>Eating foods that are high in purines, such as shellfish, red meat and offal, and drinking alcohol can increase the likelihood of a gout attack – more purines means more uric acid, and more uric acid means more painful crystals. But, says Mark Russell, a clinical research fellow at King’s College London: “For most people, it’s not something they’ve done; it’s genetically determined. The idea that this is a condition that you’ve done to yourself, or that it’s just down to bad diet, is definitely not true.”</p> <p>The good news is that gout is treatable. It is possible to lower the level of uric acid in your blood by steering clear of purine-loaded foods, while ibuprofen can be used to manage flare-ups. Russell says the best preventive treatment is medication such as allopurinol, which lowers the level of uric acid in your blood.</p> <p>The need to take lifelong medication is a bitter pill to swallow, but more and more young people face this reality. An NHS study analysed 15 years of patient data, from 1997 to 2012, and found that, although most gout patients were still 60 or older, the number of patients aged between 20 and 30 had <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/gout-started-affect-growing-numbers-5681926\">increased by 30%</a>. NHS Digital statistics show that <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11111167/Binge-eating-lack-exercise-lockdown-triggered-huge-increase-gout.html\">234,000 people were admitted to hospital</a> with gout from 2021 to 2022.</p> <p>Why? “Some of that will be due to things like obesity becoming more common,” says Russell. “Other conditions that come under what we call ‘the metabolic syndromes’, including blood pressure and diabetes, have become more common – and they are very strongly associated with gout.” However, he adds that more research into these age groups is needed. Research shows that gout is far more common in men than women, with <a href=\"https://advancesinrheumatology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42358-019-0067-7\">more than 94% of people in the US</a> with gout being male. Still, young women do get it.</p> <p>Cassie Place, 22, from Yorkshire, experienced her first episode of gout when she was 19. She was at greater risk than most women of her age because she has Bartter syndrome – a group of rare conditions that affect the kidneys – of which <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1147437/\">gout is a complication</a>. She had her first flare-up after taking a course of diuretics. “I woke and my big toe felt like it was on fire. It was really red and swollen and I couldn’t walk,” she says. As a delivery driver, she needs to walk, lift and carry. In fact, she still does her job even when in pain. “I just feel like I can’t afford to take time off,” she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/jan/06/gout-is-on-the-rise-and-its-not-just-gluttonous-sovereigns-who-get-it\">Gout is on the rise – and it’s not just gluttonous sovereigns who get it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While gout has often been seen as a bit of a joke, it is not: it is painful and it shortens life. A 2017 study found that people with the condition are <a href=\"http://blog.arthritis.org/gout/gout-risk-premature-death/\">25% more likely to die prematurely</a>. “I feel like it’s not taken seriously. And the pain that you’re going through, people sort of underestimate it,” Place says.</p> <p>Is it time we changed the name? Crystalitis, anyone? “I was at a trivia night on Monday and our team name was ‘No Gout About It’, so I don’t take the name too seriously,” says Ashley. “But I do agree that a lot of people I’ve talked to downplay how serious it can be. Versus if I hear somebody say ‘rheumatoid arthritis’, it has a much different reaction.”</p> <p>One benefit of having a lifelong condition at a premature age is a heightened sense of empathy. When I was younger, I used to bite my bottom lip in frustration as I waited for my hobbling grandmother to catch up on our walk around the supermarket. She had arthritis in both knees and her hands. Only now do I feel her pain.</p> <p>The alarming thing about gout is that only <a href=\"https://www.kch.nhs.uk/news/public/news/view/37955\">one-third of people</a> with the condition take preventive medication. So, if you are reading this and are young, fit and healthy and have dismissed an attack of gout as an anomalous blip in an otherwise ailment-free existence, easily remedied by lifestyle changes, think again. If you leave gout untreated, it can become chronic and more painful, spreading to other joints and even leading to kidney failure. Swallow your pride – and your medicine.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/18/ron-desantis-andrew-warren-lawsuit-florida-wokeness","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T12:59:06Z","webTitle":"Florida governor Ron DeSantis sued by state attorney suspended for ‘wokeness’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/ron-desantis-andrew-warren-lawsuit-florida-wokeness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/ron-desantis-andrew-warren-lawsuit-florida-wokeness","fields":{"headline":"Florida governor Ron DeSantis sued by state attorney suspended for ‘wokeness’","trailText":"Andrew Warren, a twice-elected Democrat, files lawsuit for ‘abuse of power and unlawful suspension’","byline":"Richard Luscombe in Miami","body":"<p>The power of Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, to purge elected officials who disagree with him will be challenged in a federal lawsuit filed by a state attorney suspended for “wokeness”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/liz-cheney-concession-call-trump-harriet-hageman\">Liz Cheney releases call to Trump-backed opponent who said she didn’t concede</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrew Warren was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/04/ron-desantis-suspends-andrew-warren-prosector-abortion-ban\">removed</a> as Hillsborough county state attorney on 4 August after saying he would not enforce a new 15-week abortion ban or prosecute providers of gender transition treatment for young people.</p> <p>In a press conference announcing the suspension, DeSantis, seen as a likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, attacked Warren’s “woke agenda” and “flagrant violation of his oath of office” for refusing to enforce the law.</p> <p>Warren, a twice-elected Democrat, hit back on Wednesday with a lawsuit filed in federal court in Tallahassee. In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewWarrenFL/status/1559911172756934657\">a Twitter post</a> announcing the move, he said he was taking action “against Ron DeSantis’ abuse of power and unlawful suspension”.</p> <p>In a video message, he added: “The governor has broken two laws.

Compared with 2019, things look a little more positive, but for students who have seen friends and siblings benefit from the record grades of the past two years, this is likely to provide little reassurance.</p> <p>Ofqual had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/sep/30/gcse-and-a-level-pupils-to-be-awarded-fewer-top-grades-in-2022-says-ofqual\">warned</a> that this would be a “transition year”, with results marked leniently while maintaining an active effort to bring grades more in line with pre-pandemic levels. We were told that plans to give students advance notice of topics to revise and less rigid grade boundaries would be enough to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the nation’s schools. But, as with most government plans and promises when it comes to education, this so-called safety net for students who had already faced intense upheaval to their learning, turned out to be anything but.</p> <p>Exam board guidance arrived months after schools had already finished teaching entire course contents and, with national disparities between the richest and poorest pupils <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/16/no-improvement-in-school-attainment-gap-in-england-for-20-years-report-says\">more pronounced</a> than ever, it remains unclear how giving all pupils advance warning of topics could have helped to close the class gap as opposed to simply deepening the pre-existing and deep-rooted inequalities in education. To add insult to injury, some students still faced questions they were told <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/magazine/news/general/gcses-2022-fine-boards-over-exam-paper-errors-say-mps\">wouldn’t come up</a>, along with material never before included in exams, mistakes more than half of teachers believe negatively affected their pupils, according to one recent <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/magazine/news/secondary/gcse-results-2022-over-half-teachers-warn-atrocious-exam-aid-impact\">study</a>.</p> <p>As a teacher in one of the country’s most deprived boroughs, it is clear to me that the government’s plans to rectify the problems caused and exacerbated by the pandemic fell drastically short. Some students from wealthy families and affluent areas experienced almost two years of consistent, supported home learning with ample resources, calm home environments and highly educated parents with the time and money to invest in their children’s learning.</p> <p>For others, like those in my community, young people faced the brutal impacts of financial instability, unemployment and poverty. Families and children were left alone to grapple with a lack of resources. With the government’s <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/government-laptops-coronavirus-pandemic-pledge-b1830764.html\">promise of laptops</a> for deprived children mostly going undelivered, I know of many households where multiple siblings were forced to learn from one mobile phone, with very limited data. With parents torn between <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/parentinginlockdowncoronavirusandtheeffectsonworklifebalance/2020-07-22\">work and childcare</a>, and free school meals abandoned (until a young footballer came along and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/free-school-meals-marcus-rashford-b2043250.html\">convinced the government</a> it might be a good idea to feed the nation’s poorest children during a pandemic), it is hardly surprising that today’s results point to a huge attainment gap that is only getting worse.</p> <p>This year, private schools once again have the highest percentage of top grades, with 58% of A-level pupils achieving As and A*s – 27.3 percentage points <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/live/2022/aug/18/a-level-exam-results-day-2022-live-ucas-university-clearing\">higher than students</a> in secondary comprehensives. With the competition for universities so intense this year, it is hard to envisage a future which doesn’t see these disparities continuing to trickle into higher education, as the most competitive courses become even more dominated by those from wealthy backgroundsThis status quo renders true social mobility nothing but a pipe dream, something Conservative leadership candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak seem woefully ill-equipped to address. Instead, both have focused on bizarre ideas such as the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/uk-news/sunak-truss-education-artificial-intelligence-conservatives-b2141652.html\">use of artificial intelligence</a> in schools, and have displayed a near-obsession with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/08/truss-and-sunak-ideas-on-education-are-sugar-rush-policymaking-says-expert\">return of grammar schools</a> – neither of which do anything to tackle the insurmountable challenges facing the nation’s schools.</p> <p>Teachers like me are worried about what today’s results mean for the young people still recovering from two years of chaos.

We have a big group of users and the health risks are there. But they are less serious than alcohol, cocaine or heroin, for example.</p> <p>“We have a debate about whether we should regulate ecstasy or not and this shop leads the discussion towards how we would do it and have a setting to encourage people to think about what that would look like.

Under Indian law, after 14 years some prisoners can be released on remission provided they fulfil certain criteria relating to their age and conduct.</p> <p>Bilkis Bano, and her husband were not told that the men were going to be released.

I trusted the system and I was slowly learning to live with my trauma. The release of these convicts has taken from me my peace and shaken my faith in justice,” Bano said in a statement issued through her lawyer on Wednesday.</p> <p>The attack took place during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/01/india.lukeharding1\">2002 anti-Muslim pogrom</a> in Gujarat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/hatred-bigotry-and-untruth-communal-violence-grips-india\">‘Hatred, bigotry and untruth’: communal violence grips India</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Indian Muslims, the release has stirred up the horrors of the anti-Muslim riots. In three days more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died and hundreds of Islamic monuments were destroyed or vandalised.</p> <p>On 3 March 2002, a mob raped Bano in a village near Ahmedabad. She was 19 and pregnant. Her mother was also raped and her three-year-old daughter was killed. Bano only survived because the mob thought she was dead.</p> <p>In all, 14 members of her family were attacked. Only Bano, a nephew and one other man survived. The bodies of six of her relatives were never found. It took a long struggle in the courts before the men were finally convicted in 2008.</p> <p>The decision to release the men was made by the Gujarat government, which is ruled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). It has triggered outrage among the opposition.</p> <p>For many BJP critics, it was another insult to Indian Muslims, who already feel marginalised and targeted by the BJP and Hindu fringe groups.</p> <p>Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition Congress party, said the decision made a mockery of Narendra Modi’s speech on Independence Day earlier this week when the prime minister urged Indians to change their mentality towards women and spoke of “<em>nari </em><em>shakti</em><em>”</em> or women’s power.</p> <p>“It is important that in speech and conduct, we do nothing that lowers the dignity of women,” Modi said.</p> <p>Gandhi <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1559771163592499201\">tweeted</a> on Wednesday: “Prime Minister, the entire country is seeing the difference between your words and deeds.”</p> <p>Asaduddin Owaisi, a Muslim politician, also condemned the release. “The country is watching how the BJP gives only lip service to women’s empowerment and respect for women. But when it comes to Muslim women, they forget them.”</p> <p>Some legal experts say the release goes against guidelines stipulating that the remission policy is not for convicted rapists and murderers. Others say all prisoners are entitled to it once they have served 14 years.</p> <p>“This is a decision of a majoritarian penal state and signals impunity for hate crimes,” said the lawyer and human rights activist Vrinda Grover. “The message is clear for women – the state will unleash the wrath of the law selectively … Religion seems to be a criterion for rewarding convicts with early release from prison.”</p> <p>For the Bano family, the legal grey areas and political row are not uppermost in their minds. They wonder if they will ever feel safe again, with her rapists returning to their villages nearby.</p> <p>Their dismay has been compounded by the men being welcomed with garlands and sweets as they left jail.</p> <p>Bano said: “I appeal to the Gujarat government, please undo this harm. Give me back my right to live without fear and in peace. Please ensure that my family and I are kept safe.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/live/2022/aug/18/a-level-exam-results-day-2022-live-ucas-university-clearing","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T12:07:43Z","webTitle":"A-level results 2022: top grades fall but 180,000 get first choice university places – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/live/2022/aug/18/a-level-exam-results-day-2022-live-ucas-university-clearing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/live/2022/aug/18/a-level-exam-results-day-2022-live-ucas-university-clearing","fields":{"headline":"A-level results 2022: top grades fall but 180,000 get first choice university places – as it happened","trailText":"First A-level students to sit exams since 2019 have got their results","byline":"Gemma McSherry","body":"<div id=\"block-62fe289d8f080eafb891803a\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T12:00:22.228Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That’s it for our live coverage on A-Level results.

This year has seen a growth in the number of 18-year-olds in the population, which will continue for the remainder of the decade, and creates a more competitive environment for students in the years to come.</p> <p>“While many will be celebrating today, there will be some who are disappointed.

They wanted a chance to prove themselves. Students were full of praise for teachers and staff in their schools and colleges who had helped them prepare but they spoke of wanting that rite of passage to earn their results in their own right. It was therefore really gratifying to see that exams and assessments took place.”</p> <p>Noting that the exams “went smoothly” this year, she said that “because the same rules apply to everyone, exams and formal assessments are the best way to measure what students know, understand and can do”, enabling consistency across schools and assessments.</p> <p>An “unprecedented package of support” had been put in place to help students who hadn’t had the chance to take public exams before and who have experienced disruption to their learning, she said.</p> <p>This included changes to course work, advanced information in February about topics that would appear in exams to make them “less daunting” and help focus revision, and changed timetables to enable at least a 10-day gap between the first and last exams in a subject to reduce the risk of illness impacting results. “Students told me they preferred the timetable like this,” she noted.</p> <p>“We want to get back to pre-pandemic standards as we all take steps to get back to normality but it was important to me as chief regulator to balance our objectives of maintaining standards with promoting public confidence in exams and qualifications. In the interests’ of this year’s students we didn’t want to do it in one go. Instead the approach taken to grading reflects a midpoint between summer 2019 and summer 2021 to recognise the disruption students have faced,” she said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T08:37:04.375Z\">at 9.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62fdf5f88f0892f840b8955b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T08:19:38.701Z\">9.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We want to hear from school leavers, teachers and parents about their experience of this cohort’s results .</p> <p>Whatever your story, and wherever you’re headed next, please get in touch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/share-your-reaction-and-experiences-on-a-level-results-day-2022\">here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-62fde8b88f0892f840b89511\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T07:43:30.894Z\">8.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Education secretary says 'majority' of students will get first choice university places</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking on BBC Breakfast, the education secretary has said the “majority” of students will get their first choice university place, and are not being crowded out by a deferred cohort.</p> <p>When asked if deferred applications would lead to more competition for university places, James Cleverly said: “We should remember that there has been an increase in the number of courses, and as you say the number of 18-year-olds has been increasing, but so has the number of university courses.”</p> <p>Cleverly said that the number of deferments as a percentage of the overall applications is “very low, something around 6.5% from memory” and said students are “predominantly” competing with “other people that took exams this year” meaning the vast majority of university places will be for students who have sat exams this year.</p> <p>Cleverly added that there had been a “tighter set of results than last year” with the return of exams, but said: “We have got to remember that the majority of students will probably be getting into their first choice institution, that is incredibly good news.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T07:54:59.417Z\">at 8.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62fde82e8f083ef020e6fc80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T07:21:37.066Z\">8.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>According to PA News, the total number of students accepted on to UK degree courses has decreased 2% on the same point last year, with 425,830 taking up places so far, initial Ucas figures show.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T07:22:15.263Z\">at 8.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-62fd00548f0892f840b88e7a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-18T07:11:21.704Z\">8.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning.
