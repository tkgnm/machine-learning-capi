On election night in 1997, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVvWE6V9ulE\" title=\"\">footage</a> of a defeated Michael Portillo instantly came to symbolise an end to 18 years of Conservative rule. The opening <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4As0e4de-rI\" title=\"\">ceremony</a> of the 2012 Olympics is still fondly recalled by millions as a portrait of Britain as it could be at its best – optimistic, diverse and proud without being pompous about it. On Sunday, it was the turn of the Lionesses’ substitute hero, Chloe Kelly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/sports-bra-photo-england-womens-euros-win-chloe-kelly-goal-celebration\" title=\"\">waving</a> her England shirt above her head in a state of near-delirium.</p> <p>As Kelly wheeled joyfully away at Wembley, after scoring the winning goal against Germany, she did so before a record attendance for any Euros final – men’s or women’s. In the rest of the country, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/england-victory-in-womens-euro-2022-final-draws-record-tv-audience-of-17m\" title=\"\">close to 20 million</a> were watching the match on television, in pubs or in fan zones. In footballing terms, Kelly’s extra-time scrambled finish delivered a historic triumph – the first international trophy won by a senior England team since 1966. But the significance of the moment goes well beyond that immediate context.</p> <p>This spectacularly successful tournament, which gripped the imagination of so many young girls (and boys), can now act as a catalyst for transforming lazy assumptions about women’s sport. Investment in the Women’s Super League – and the professionalisation of the game – has raised technical standards exponentially, creating a spectacle that proved its worth on a global stage. As politicians catch up with the implications of a remarkable summer, it seems certain that more will now be done to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-lionesses-blazing-a-trail-for-womens-football\" title=\"\">make sure</a> that all girls get the opportunity to play football at school. But the lesson of these Euros – that greater resources can unleash extraordinary reserves of untapped potential – should not be confined to women’s football.</p> <p>The triumphal progress of England’s women has also served to showcase a model of affordable football that democratised access to the national game. Crowds were more diverse in every respect, and mums and dads could bring daughters and sons to a match without maxing out their credit cards. Generation Z attended in large numbers. A more female audience gave stadiums a convivial feel that was a world away from the <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/england-vs-italy-police-riot-gear-break-up-england-fans-arrests-euros-final-1098789\" title=\"\">sulphurous</a> atmosphere surrounding the Euro 2020 men’s final between England and Italy. As the women’s game seeks to capitalise on what is surely a tipping point in its history, this freshness and inclusive ethos can be one of its key and distinctive assets.</p> <p>Most inspirationally of all though, the summer of the Lionesses achieved a parity of esteem and respect in a world that men fenced off as their own for so long. Both before and after Sunday’s final, England’s impressive captain, Leah Williamson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/womens-football-and-society-has-changed-williamson-hails-euro-impact\" title=\"\">expressed</a> a hope that the past few weeks can be transformational not only for women’s football, but for wider gender equality. In terms of pay, as well as residual expectations and stereotypes at work, there is still some way to go before that dream is realised. But as the England squad paraded the Euro trophy on Monday in front of a packed Trafalgar Square, and David Baddiel suggested that the Football’s Coming Home song should be “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/time-to-retire-three-lions-anthem-after-euro-2022-win-says-david-baddiel\" title=\"\">retired</a>”, it did feel as if these footballers are shifting the dial in a way that transcends sport. Along with memories that will last a lifetime, that achievement is their gift to the millions of girls who fell in love with them this summer.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/02/us-hails-antipodean-adventure-and-australia-silent-as-second-spy-satellite-set-to-launch-from-new-zealand","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T17:30:29Z","webTitle":"US and Australia to launch second joint spy satellite from site in New Zealand ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/02/us-hails-antipodean-adventure-and-australia-silent-as-second-spy-satellite-set-to-launch-from-new-zealand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/02/us-hails-antipodean-adventure-and-australia-silent-as-second-spy-satellite-set-to-launch-from-new-zealand","fields":{"headline":"US and Australia to launch second joint spy satellite from site in New Zealand ","trailText":"Some in space industry bewildered by Australia’s lack of fanfare about the launch of the satellites, which will be used to collect intelligence for allied nations","byline":"Tory Shepherd","body":"<p>A second spy satellite built by Australia and the United States is scheduled for liftoff on Tuesday from a launch site in New Zealand.</p> <p>The first of the two satellites, which will be used to collect intelligence for the allied nations, launched two weeks ago.</p> <p>The Australian Department of Defence did not announce the successful launch of the first satellite or the launch date of the second.</p> <p>US spy agency, the <a href=\"https://www.nro.gov/Launch/\">National Reconnaissance Office</a>, has been celebrating the “Antipodean Adventure”, which features a crocodile, a rocket and an eagle on its logo.</p> <p>Some in the space industry are bewildered by the lack of information and fanfare on the Australian side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/26/top-gun-for-hire-why-hollywood-is-the-us-militarys-best-wingman\">Top Gun for hire: why Hollywood is the US military’s best wingman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Malcolm Davis, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s senior analyst and resident space expert, said there is a “very different culture” in the US military, which actively promotes its work, and the Australian military, which is “closed off”.</p> <p>“It’s not just these particular satellites, it’s an attitude within Defence that they’re very closed off,” he said.</p> <p>“The Americans are very forward.

This cannot go on","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>The Victorian writer and mountaineer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Stephen\" title=\"\">Leslie Stephen</a> – the father of Virginia Woolf – called the Alps “the playground of Europe”. And so they have been, in winter and summer alike, for many generations. But with excessive warming now placing some of the Alps’ most iconic summits <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/heatwaves-put-classic-alpine-hiking-routes-off-limits\" title=\"\">out of bounds</a>, for how much longer can the freedom of Europe’s playground continue?</p> <p>The basic problem is the warming of the Alps. Snowfall this past winter – especially in the southern Alps – was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2022/jun/30/snowy-alps-distant-memory-unless-we-act-climate-crisis\" title=\"\">down by two-thirds</a> from what was once considered normal. The loss of snowmelt is a direct cause of this summer’s brutal drought in the Po valley. Last month, Swiss scientists found that weather balloons were having to rise to 5,184 metres (over 17,000ft), well above the very highest peaks, before they finally reached <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/25/switzerland-freezing-point-record-high-alpine-summits\" title=\"\">freezing point</a>.</p> <p>The central Alps are badly affected too. This year, the snow had all gone by the start of July, at least a month earlier than the previous record. There is <a href=\"https://www.20min.ch/story/bergtouren-am-matterhorn-wegen-schneemangel-zu-gefaehrlich-203807925820\" title=\"\">no snow</a> on the now closed Matterhorn summit. Meanwhile, the rapid melting of the Theodul glacier nearby has meant that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/melting-alps-theodul-glacier-switzerland-italy-border-shifts\" title=\"\">the Italian-Swiss border itself</a>, which traditionally follows the drainage divide between north and south, has had to be shifted significantly in Italy’s direction as the glacier has shrunk.</p> <p>Higher temperatures mean less ice, including less permafrost; less ice means more rockfalls; and more rockfalls mean more fatalities. The worst accident this summer has been on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/05/within-five-minutes-everything-changed-town-mourns-victims-of-glacier-tragedy\" title=\"\">Marmolada glacier</a> on the northern slopes of the highest peak in the Italian Dolomites. Eleven climbers were killed when a block of ice and rock plummeted down the glacier without warning. The Marmolada has lost 80% of its volume since 1950, and may disappear altogether in another 15 years. Other Alpine glaciers face similar fates, with widening crevasses causing further dangers.</p> <p>Half of all mountaineering accidents in France occur on the highest mountain in the Alps, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/travel/overcrowded-and-more-dangerous-mont-blanc-faces-a-crisis.html\" title=\"\">Mont Blanc</a>. So dangerous has the main route from Chamonix up Mont Blanc become that in June many local guides <a href=\"https://explorersweb.com/mont-blanc-climbing-closed/\" title=\"\">suspended all ascents</a> after another rockfall fatality. Traditionally, Alpine climbers have set off in the early hours to ensure that conditions are frozen and firm. That is now frequently impossible because temperatures are too high, adding to the danger.</p> <p>The other problem is the attrition of mass tourism in this increasingly fragile environment. Three years ago, many were shocked by pictures from the Himalayas of climbers queueing to ascend the final ridge of Mount Everest. Similar scenes have long been familiar in the Alps too.</p> <p>Around <a href=\"https://wwf.panda.org/discover/knowledge_hub/where_we_work/alps/problems/tourism/\" title=\"\">120 million tourists visit</a> the Alps in a typical year. Most visitors stay in the valleys and hotel complexes. Many others choose a widely proliferating variety of outdoor activities. One Chamonix guide accuses tourists of climbing Mont Blanc simply for a selfie on the summit. In 2019, a ban had to be imposed on <a href=\"https://mairie.saintgervais.com/interdiction-datterrissage-au-sommet-du-mont-blanc-pour-les-parapentistes/\" title=\"\">paragliders</a> landing there.</p> <p>In the Alps, the 21st century’s increasingly head-on collision between industrial tourism and the climate crisis is destroying some of the very environments that have attracted so many to the high mountains in the first place, as well as generating ever larger numbers of accidents. To close the playground of Europe would be unenforceable and unfair, as well as economically devastating. But without collective self-denial and behaviour change, an already bad situation will simply get worse.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/01/heineken-reports-jump-in-sales-and-says-prices-will-rise-further","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T17:15:54Z","webTitle":"Heineken puts prices up by 8.9% and warns of more rises to come","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/01/heineken-reports-jump-in-sales-and-says-prices-will-rise-further","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/01/heineken-reports-jump-in-sales-and-says-prices-will-rise-further","fields":{"headline":"Heineken puts prices up by 8.9% and warns of more rises to come","trailText":"Dutch brewer records better than expected profits as consumers flocked back to bars and restaurants","byline":"Joe Middleton","body":"<p>Heineken has reported better than expected profits after putting up the amount it charges for its drinks by an average of 8.9% and has warned prices will continue to rise in the year ahead.</p> <p>The Dutch brewer, whose eponymous beer is Europe’s bestselling lager, recorded a 37% year-on-year jump in revenue to €16.4bn (£13.7bn) in the six months to July.</p> <p>It said that despite the rising prices it was selling more beer than before the pandemic, and it also benefited from customers switching to more expensive products. </p> <p>Thanks to favourable trading conditions as consumers flocked back to bars and restaurants, the volume of drinks sold was up 0.8% compared with the same period in 2019.

Two weeks before them he fractured a foot. He limped into the athletes’ village in a protective boot. ButFraser wanted far more than simply being able to compete and somehow, through the pain, he worked to achieve it. On Monday he became an individual Commonwealth Games champion, winning gold on the pommel horse. He seized his first individual medal by working his way through a smooth, precise and near faultless routine, winning with a score of 14.833.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/sebastian-coe-commonwealth-1500m-attempt-jake-wightman\">Sebastian Coe inspired Commonwealth 1500m attempt, says Wightman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fraser’s biggest rival in the pommel horse final was Rhys McClenaghan, Northern Ireland’s defending champion, who had qualified in second place but with significant room to improve his difficulty. McClenaghan, who was initially barred from competing here by the International Gymnastics Federation because they are licensed to compete for Ireland in international competition, is one of the best pommel horse workers in the world. But Fraser had set the bar extremely high, and one significant form break took away McClenaghan’s chances of gold. He recovered to score 14.1 and take the silver medal.</p> <p>“That medal was for Max [Whitlock],” said Fraser. “I’m really happy for that. To deliver a routine in a Commonwealth finals is difficult in itself, so to walk away as the champion, I’m over the moon.”</p> <p>Fraser later said that Whitlock, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/08/commonwealth-games-gymnastics-gold-max-whitlock-georgia-mae-fenton\" title=\"\">lost out to McClenaghan</a> at the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in 2018, sent him a text saying simply: “OMG, you legend.”</p> <p>Meanwhile England’s Jake Jarman continued his breakout competition by winning his third gold medal, following up his team and all-around medals with the best floor routine of his career. He outclassed the field with a world-class score of 14.666, far above Felix Dolci of Canada, who scored 14.166 for silver. England’s Giarnni Regini-Moran took bronze.</p> <p>“I can hands down say that was probably the best routine I’ve done in my career,” said Jarman. “I’ve done a lot of floor qualifications in big competitions and I’ve messed up a few times. To make a final is amazing, to deliver a routine when it really matters, it means so much to me.”</p> <p>More success followed for England when Georgia-Mae Fenton retained her uneven bars title from 2018, scoring 13.9. On the rings Courtney Tulloch also retained his title, scoring 14.4 to edge out Sokratis Pilakouris of Cyprus by 0.1 point.</p> <p>In the women’s vault competition Shannon Archer became the first Scottish female gymnast to win a medal at a Commonwealth Games by claiming bronze.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/01/archie-battersbee-court-refuses-further-postpone-end-of-life-support","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T17:07:19Z","webTitle":"Archie Battersbee: court refuses to postpone withdrawal of life support","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/01/archie-battersbee-court-refuses-further-postpone-end-of-life-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/01/archie-battersbee-court-refuses-further-postpone-end-of-life-support","fields":{"headline":"Archie Battersbee: court refuses to postpone withdrawal of life support","trailText":"Judges say termination should not be suspended beyond midday on Tuesday as UN considers case of 12-year-old","byline":"Haroon Siddique Legal affairs correspondent","body":"<p>The court of appeal has refused to postpone the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from 12-year-old Archie Battersbee beyond midday on Tuesday, rejecting an application by his parents.</p> <p>Hollie Dance, 46, and Paul Battersbee, 57, from Southend-on-Sea in Essex, had asked the court to extend a legal stay on the decision by a high court judge allowing treatment of Archie, who suffered a catastrophic brain injury on 7 April, to be stopped. The couple have been fighting a legal battle against Barts NHS trust since May, asking that their son be allowed to die as “natural” a death as possible.</p> <p>Speaking outside the Royal London hospital after the verdict, Dance said they would challenge the ruling. She said: “We made a promise to Archie, we will fight to the end. And Archie’s still fighting.</p> <p>“If [Tuesday’s] the last day then so be it, but we will be applying to the supreme court.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/31/archie-battersbee-life-support-to-end-on-monday-despite-mothers-pleas\">The latest hearing was granted</a> after a rapporteur for the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (CRPD) submitted a request, following an application by Archie’s parents, that he continue to receive life support treatment while it considered his case. The UK government then wrote a letter urging the court to consider the request.</p> <p>But giving the court of appeal’s judgment, Sir Andrew McFarlane, sitting with two other judges, said: “Every day that [Archie] continues to be given life-sustaining treatment is against his best interests… I concluded that there should be no stay other than a short stay for the parents to take stock and consider whether they want to make any further application to the supreme court.”</p> <p>Archie sustained brain damage when, his mother believes, he choked while taking part in a viral social media challenge. Dance made an appeal to parents on Monday to make sure their children do not take part in dangerous viral challenges.“Please, please, parents, have the conversation with your children because I know there’s a whole new lot of online challenges,” she said.</p> <p>“I don’t want any parent out there to have what we’ve been going through and I definitely don’t want to see any more children losing their lives.”</p> <p>The Royal London hospital in Whitechapel, east London, had been intending to end his treatment at 2pm on Monday, following previous judgments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/15/archie-battersbee-parents-lose-fight-to-keep-son-12-on-life-support\">by the high court </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/25/archie-battersbee-doctors-can-stop-life-support-treatment-judges?CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium\">court of appeal</a> but the deadline was suspended while the fresh appeal was heard. </p> <p>Edward Devereux QC, representing Archie’s parents, argued that the court had “no discretion” to ignore the CRPD or the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, which it based its request on, as doing so “would be in flagrant and unacceptable breach of international law”.</p> <p>He asked the court to grant a stay to allow the CPRD to consider Archie’s case or, given the uncertainty as to how long that would take, to grant a stay of within a week to seek information from the committee as to the likely timescale for its decision.</p> <p>Fiona Paterson, for Barts NHS trusts, said it would not be a breach of international law to ignore the request as the relevant treaty had not been incorporated into domestic law through legislation.</p> <p>The court of appeal agreed with Paterson. McFarlane said: “This is an unincorporated international treaty. It is not part of the law of the United Kingdom … it is not appropriate for this court to apply an unincorporated international treaty into its decision-making process.”</p> <p>He added that, for the same reasons, it was not appropriate for the court to determine whether the UK government was in breach of the convention.</p> <p>Dance said on Monday that Archie had been “let down” by Britain’s healthcare system. She said: “In this country there’s no options: it’s either Archie’s conscious or he dies, that’s it. In other countries there are so many options. You’ve got ... stem cell treatment, you know, there are so many options available.</p> <p>“Over in the UK it’s ... execution of your child and that’s it. It’s disgusting, it’s a let-down.”</p> <p>Before giving their decision, the judges had expressed concern at how long it might take the CPRD to consider the case. They noted that the committee usually sits only twice a year and that the government had six months to respond to its request.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"First Edition

Of course she could do the job.</p> \n  <p>“I think it is time for a lot of things to be on more of an equal footing. Whether it is my niece only being able to play one football session in school, whereas the boys play three, or girls who are playing at the same level as the men on a fraction of their pay.</p> \n  <p>“For me, there has to be an increase in investment across the game, and when it comes to coaching into the men’s game it has to be a pre-requisite for successful teams. I think it is time for those changes to happen. You’ve got to invest in not only free access for the kids, but also coaching, because seeing Sarina on the touchline last night I think is immense for any young girl who aspires to grow up being a coach. We need to invest in female coaches as well.</p> \n  <p>“I am super proud of Sarina. She is an an immense human being who carries the pressure so well and delivers in so many different ways. I’m sure for her winning the title with her home nation was immense, but she realised last night how massive football is in this country. She is so humble, she is knowledgeable, she is wise and she is experienced, and most importantly, she is a fantastic person.” </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6b9c0bfdebe7a9a3f06aae2e6e6443045e61d9d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6b9c0bfdebe7a9a3f06aae2e6e6443045e61d9d/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piccadilly Circus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T12:28:23.528Z\">at 1.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e7c5198f08af33ff4a50df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T12:21:23.416Z\">1.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The players are leaving the stage now</strong> for what I’m guessing is another day (or week) of celebrating. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e7c47b8f08730a1f7f53bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T12:20:38.423Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>So here is a lovely fun fact for you.

In particular there is discussion over whether the referees overlooked what is being referred to as a “clear case of handball” in the 25th minute of the match. Fury spills out of the tabloid Bild. Under the headline: ‘Anger over the Scandal Referees’ <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/fussball/frauen-em-wut-auf-die-skandal-schiris-maulkorb-fuer-den-var-80871466.bild.html\">the paper writes</a>, it was “clear to see that the England player, Leah Williamson played the ball at shoulder height, with her hand”.</p> \n  <p>It accuses the referee Kateryna Monzul, of failing to view it as a handball, whilst the video referees Paolo Valeri and Pol van Bockel, came to the joint conclusion that it was not a punishable move, “So they did not even check the scene!” Bild declares.</p> \n  <p>The tabloid confronted Monzul about her decision after the match, with the question: “What happened in the 25th minute with England’s handball?” Monzul, it said, “shrugged her shoulders and stretched her arms out wide in an apologetic way and left. No explanation.” </p> \n  <p>The tabloid then proceeded to confront Valeri after the end of the match in the Mixed Zone. His response, it said: “Non posso dire niente, mi dispiace” - or “I can’t say anything, I’m sorry”. Bild interprets this more bluntly in German as: “Sorry, I’ve been muzzled”.</p> \n  <p>It accuses British press of refusing to even <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/fussball/frauen-em-britische-presse-verschweigt-den-neuen-wembley-betrug-80872584.bild.html\">discuss the issue</a>.</p> \n  <p>Later in a widely broadcast media interview, Germany’s trainer Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, was also critical of the decision: “At this level in a final of the European Championships something like this should not happen,” she said. “I would like for there to be a discussion about this. But what I don’t want is that it is overlooked.”</p> \n  <p>In a separate commentary, Bild goes so far as to compare what it calls the “fraudulent” outcome, with the Wembley defeat of Germany’s men to England at the <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/fussball/frauenfussball-deutschland-verliert-das-finale-gegen-england-80869230.bild.html\">1966 World Cup</a>.</p> \n  <p>Germany is crying with our football women, and is annoyed about this new Wembley fraud! With this 1:2 defeat after an extension, we have been defrauded again almost 56 years after the scandal around the Wembley goal,” it writes.</p> \n  <p>Spiegel referred to the “commotion which reigned in connection with a hand ball” which it said might have turned the game in Germany’s favour. It quoted Voss-Tecklenburg as graciously saying that whilst Germany should have been granted a penalty kick, in her opinion, England was a worthy victor after the 120 minute match. “They played themselves into the hearts of many people,” she said.</p> \n  <p>Die Zeit said it was clear that the match “could have ended differently, had the referee, Kateryna Monsul, recognised Leah Williamson’s handball in the 25th minute. According to the rulebook it should have led to a penalty kick, maybe even a red card. But neither the referee who is anyway normally rather overwhelmed, nor her video assistants wanted to admit they had seen anything. Which led to quite a discussion afterwards.”</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, Germany is unsurprisingly already looking to next year’s World Cup to get its revenge.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T10:36:32.779Z\">at 11.36am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e7a9ba8f08af33ff4a4fb6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T10:26:27.175Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Our very own Suzy Wrack is at Trafalgar Square</strong> for the celebrations of the Lionesses winning!

But that’s OK, we enjoyed it. When you have these accomplishments it’s really good to have a party.”</p> <p>It was a passage that summed up England’s manager rather well. Wiegman may come across as an austere, stern figure on the touchline and her businesslike manner has quickly imprinted itself on the new European champions since her arrival last September. But there is a much lighter side, too, and it has been evident in the way her team play: industry setting the path for invention and the kinds of flourish that sent England off into an evening that was worth the sunglasses and sore heads.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2022/aug/01/fans-celebrate-england-womens-euro-triumph-london-in-pictures\">Fans celebrate England women’s Euro triumph in London – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She has achieved the unprecedented feat of back-to-back continental titles with different countries and nobody does that purely by playing bad cop. It is true that unsentimental decisions helped to shape her wins in both 2017 and 2022; few will need reminding of the way she dropped her captain, Mandy van den Berg, two games into the Netherlands’ campaign five years ago and the omission of Steph Houghton raised plenty of eyebrows this time. But Wiegman has created the happiest, closest-knit England camp in recent memory and it has helped them to eke out huge results when, as against Spain and in the final on Sunday, matches have been at risk of getting away from them.</p> <p>“She’s the missing ingredient England were looking for,” the captain, Leah Williamson, told a huge Trafalgar Square crowd after the squad had taken the stage. “She has brought us all together. She is a special person and puts us first as human beings.”</p> <p>It has been a common refrain. Wiegman has transformed the way England’s players relate to each other, Beth Mead pointing out that honesty and mutual respect have grown in tandem since her arrival. “We trust now that what we say to each other is for the best and that it won’t go outside the group – it’s become easy to speak to each other,” Mead said before the final.</p> <p>That is priceless when difficult words need to be offered; it also adds another dimension to the level of enjoyment players can take in winning through a monumentalcollective effort. Dutch dressing rooms have a reputation for being forthright and, with her national team and her adopted country, Wiegman has transferred the better elements of that.</p> <p>“She wants everybody on the same page,” said Baroness Sue Campbell, the Football Association’s director of women’s football. “When we interviewed her we knew we were getting the best tactical and technical coach in the world. What we didn’t know was that we were getting this exceptional human being.” Campbell admitted she felt winning Euro 2022 could be a tall order for Wiegman in light of her appointment’s timing; perhaps the idea they had employed an alchemist felt too good to be true.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe08113aa3273472e2f82fe279e4173c7567cb68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe08113aa3273472e2f82fe279e4173c7567cb68/0_226_4925_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alessia Russo and Ella Toone of England celebrate with the trophy at Wembley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alessia Russo and Ella Toone of England celebrate with the trophy at Wembley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given the arduousness of England’s 50-year journey to this point, though, there is something surreal about the fact Wiegman has helped them to clear their biggest step in a mere 11 months. The raw materials had been present under Hope Powell, Mark Sampson and Phil Neville; all of those coaches produced at least some results that confirmed the Lionesses’ regular presence as contenders but none, for different reasons, could haul them over the line. Wiegman has tied up the loose ends to form a sleek, formidable unit and the question now is how far England can progress with her at the helm.</p> <p>In 2019 Wiegman’s Netherlands side fell agonisingly short of backing up their Euro 2017 title with a stunning World Cup win. They were deservedly beaten by USA but it was hardly a letdown: a young squad had not been expected to win their home tournament two years previously, in which they routed a desperately disappointing England at the semi-final stage, and remained a longish shot to go the distance in France. This summer’s last-eight finish under Mark Parsons felt more akin to their natural resting place; nobody could realistically have taken them further but this England generation still feel they have a distance to travel.</p> <p>It can do no harm that the next World Cup is less than a year away. England will enter it with momentum, a rock-solid team spirit and a team of proven operators in perhaps the planet’s strongest league. They can keep themselves honest with a tough-looking away fixture against Austria in September, knowing a draw would guarantee they top qualifying Group D, and then move to the task at hand in Australia and New Zealand. The buildup to that tournament should hit fever pitch on these shores now: Wiegman will have enjoyed a honeymoon extending to almost two years but there is little chance she or England will bask for too long in the glow.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/01/the-lionesses-were-astounding-in-a-tournament-that-had-the-wow-factor\">The Lionesses were astounding in a tournament that had the wow factor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The way she talks is quite interesting,” the FA’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said. “Because it’s not just about success on the pitch, it’s about that legacy. She’s just a really transparent person with really strong values.”</p> <p>The famously humble Wiegman will spend her summer camper van holiday eschewing the glitz and the glare. Talk of an honorary damehood may be realised in time but whether it hits home is another matter. “I think she would probably turn it down because she is just not that person,” said Lucy Bronze. “I think she would be so embarrassed if we try and push for it. We want it to be about the team and it starts with Sarina. It’s going to be hard for her to fight off the attention now.”</p> <p>There is still some more partying to be done but the sense is that, under Wiegman, England have only just got to work.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/01/marion-rousse-tour-de-france-femmes-annemiek-van-vleuten","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T16:48:34Z","webTitle":"Marion Rousse hails success of ‘proper women’s Tour de France’ | Jeremy Whittle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/marion-rousse-tour-de-france-femmes-annemiek-van-vleuten","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/01/marion-rousse-tour-de-france-femmes-annemiek-van-vleuten","fields":{"headline":"Marion Rousse hails success of ‘proper women’s Tour de France’","trailText":"The race director was delighted with the impact the Tour de France Femmes had made – but insists there is still work to be done","byline":"Jeremy Whittle","body":"<p>There were not one, but in fact, two historic moments in women’s sport at the weekend.

The various incarnations of the women’s race have endured exile, underfunding and mockery, until finally, after years of reluctance, the Tour promoters ASO were browbeaten into launching this year’s event.</p> <p>There are other major women’s races – the Women’s Tour in Britain and the Giro Donne in Italy – but the Tour de France is the pinnacle of the sport, the global showcase of elite cycling. Now plans are afoot to make the Tour Femmes bigger, better and significantly more competitive.</p> <p>While the men’s Tour has survived world wars, pandemics and crippling doping scandals, women’s cycling has existed in a sporting hinterland. It’s to the great credit of those athletes and campaigners who lobbied so hard, for so long, that Van Vleuten was able to stand, in a <em>maillot jaune</em>, on the final podium.</p> <p>What started in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe and finished on a gravel track was only the beginning. “I was always sure of one thing with this race,” said the Tour Femmes director, Marion Rousse. “It wasn’t a gift that we were giving to women’s cycling, to create a women’s Tour de France. They simply deserve it and you see the proof each day, with different scenarios in the race. And even though it’s the first year, it’s a proper Tour de France, with the caravan, the crowds, placards, flags – it’s great. It gives me shivers when I see it.”</p> <p>The Tour Femmes has three more years on its contract with title sponsor Zwift. “It’s important in this first year to see the reception from the public, the media, the audience, the sponsors,” Rousse said. “They don’t know with a new race how things will go, but it’s already impressive on all levels. We’re making women’s cycling a part of everyday life. We’ve met the challenge and clearly it’s going to grow in the next years.”</p> <p>There is talk already of increasing the number of riders in each team and of more racing days next year, including an individual time trial and visiting the Alps and Pyrenees.</p> <p>“We’ve already learned a lot,” Rousse said. “There are some questions to answer – some things we can improve on for next year. But looking at the popular success, the size of the TV audience, the interest in the race, the quality of the racing, it’s going to get bigger in the coming years.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2adc135f239cb7bbfc9661af44b759b4694b6868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2adc135f239cb7bbfc9661af44b759b4694b6868/0_14_5204_3123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marion Rousse, Tour de France Femmes director, is interviewed during the Tour de France Femmes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marion Rousse said the Tour de France Femmes has ‘met the challenge and is clearly going to grow in the next years’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But she acknowledges there are significant issues to be resolved to enable the event to grow. It also has to establish greater depth through the women’s peloton, and generate a higher level of competition throughout. With some riders taking time off work to compete and others riding for free, there is a need for greater investment in the teams themselves.</p> <p>“Although women’s cycling has evolved, the economic model remains fragile,” Rousse said. “It’s still an amateur milieu, for sure, and one hopes that, thanks to the audience, to the fact that the race is on TV in 190 countries around the world, and because it’s the Tour de France, that the sponsors will be encouraged to invest in women’s teams.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/23/womens-tour-de-france-returns-to-boost-cyclings-latest-breakaway\">Women’s Tour de France returns to boost cycling’s latest breakaway</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the immediate future, it is clear that from now on the three-week Tour de France will morph into a month-long festival of road racing, celebrating both men’s and women’s cycling. As the women’s race develops, the globalisation of the men’s race continues unabated with the 2022 podium featuring a Danish winner, a Slovenian runner-up and a veteran Welshman, Geraint Thomas, placing third.</p> <p>Jonas Vingegaard’s success was celebrated by thousands of fans in Copenhagen’s Tivoli Gardens, while Tadej Pogacar headed straight to the Tour Femmes to support his partner Urska Zigart, who was racing for Team BikeExchange. Next year the Grand Depart for the men will be in Bilbao for two stages looping through the Basque Country before the peloton enters France.</p> <p>The Tour Femmes meanwhile will start on 23 July as the men’s race ends in Paris and, according to Rousse, will remain in its current format of a week of racing. “You can’t build a race of 10 days or three weeks on the spot,” she said. “You need to develop it progressively. For now it’s eight days.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/01/african-nations-set-to-make-the-case-for-big-rise-in-fossil-fuel-output","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T16:44:53Z","webTitle":"African nations expected to make case for big rise in fossil fuel output","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/african-nations-set-to-make-the-case-for-big-rise-in-fossil-fuel-output","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/01/african-nations-set-to-make-the-case-for-big-rise-in-fossil-fuel-output","fields":{"headline":"African nations expected to make case for big rise in fossil fuel output","trailText":"Exclusive: leaders expected to say at Cop27 they need access to their oil and gas reserves despite effect on global heating","byline":"Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent","body":"<p>Leaders of African countries are likely to use the next UN climate summit in November to push for massive new investment in fossil fuels in Africa, according to documents seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>New <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/14/africa-gas-exploration-climate-disaster-un-reserves\">exploration for gas</a>, and the exploitation of Africa’s vast reserves of oil, would make it close to impossible for the world to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>However, soaring gas prices have made the prospect of African supplies even more attractive, and developed countries, including EU members, have indicated they would support such developments in the current gas shortage.</p> <p>The Guardian has seen a technical document prepared by the African Union, comprising most of Africa’s states, for the “second extraordinary session of the specialised technical committee on transport, transcontinental and interregional infrastructure and energy committee”, a meeting of energy ministers that took place by video conference from 14 to 16 June.</p> <p>The five-page document, and accompanying 25-page explanation, indicates that many African countries favour a common position that would inform their negotiating stance at the Cop27 UN climate summit, scheduled for this November in Egypt, which would entail pushing for an expansion of fossil fuel production across the continent.</p> <p>The document states: “In the short to medium term, fossil fuels, especially natural gas will have to play a crucial role in expanding modern energy access in addition to accelerating the uptake of renewables.”</p> <p>Member states of the African Union will meet again, in Addis Ababa, this week to confirm the stance to be taken. They are expected to argue that Africa must be allowed to benefit from its fossil fuel reserves, as rich countries already have done, and that developed countries by contrast must take the lead on sharp cuts to their emissions.</p> <p>However, environmental campaigners from across the continent fear that the exploitation of gas and oil in Africa would bust global climate targets, prevent the development of renewable energy in Africa, and instead of being used for the benefit of ordinary people, would enrich multinational corporations, investors and the elite in some countries.</p> <p>Mohamed Adow, the director of the thinktank Power Shift Africa, said it would be a mistake for Africa to opt for fossil fuels instead of moving straight to renewable energy. “Africa is blessed with abundant renewable energy, in sun and wind. Africa should not be shackled to expensive fossil fuels for decades,” he said.</p> <p>Lorraine Chiponda, the coordinator of the Africa Coal Network, said: “The prospect that African leaders are presenting and pushing for gas developments and investment is overwhelming and reckless given the climate impacts that threaten the lives of millions of people in Africa having seen worsening droughts and hunger, recurring floods and cyclones. Fossil fuel projects have neither solved energy poverty in Africa where 600 million people still live in energy poverty nor brought any socio-economic justice to African people.”</p> <p>The International Energy Agency warned last year that no new fossil fuel developments could take place if the world was to stay within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels. Recent extreme weather, including heatwaves and wildfires in Europe and North America, has intensified fears that the climate crisis is progressing faster than had been anticipated.</p> <p>African countries are also expected to be among the most damaged by the impacts of the climate crisis. Drought is already afflicting a large swathe of the Horn of Africa at present, and millions of people are “marching toward starvation”, the World Food Programme has warned.</p> <p>But the soaring price of gas, driven by war in Ukraine and the recovery from the Covid pandemic, has spurred many countries to see a potential bonanza in the unexploited reserves remaining in Africa. Research by the Guardian earlier this year revealed scores of “carbon bombs” – fossil fuel reserves that if exploited could put the global climate targets well out of reach.</p> <p>Fatima Ahouli, regional coordinator of Climate Action Network Arab World, said leaders seeking new fossil fuel exploitation were contributing to a new form of colonialism.</p> <p>“Calling for more and new exploitation of fossil fuels in Africa is driven by the same hungry countries who only see Africa as a goldmine,” she said.</p> <p>Gas in Africa is set to become of the flashpoints of the Cop27 climate talks. The EU has indicated it would support the production of gas in Africa, as it urgently seeks new sources of gas following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent threats to gas exports from Russia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mary Robinson, the chair of the Elders group of former statespeople and high-ranking business leaders, has also weighed in on the issue, controversially telling the Guardian earlier this year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/07/let-africa-exploit-natural-gas-reserves-mary-robinson\">African countries must be allowed to use their gas</a>, though she insists it must be for domestic use, for electricity and as a clean cooking fuel, rather than being exported to the EU.</p> <p>About 580 million people in Africa still lack access to electricity and modern energy.</p> <p>Adow said exploiting gas in Africa would merely lock countries into a high-carbon future.

And yet, despite the outpouring of kind words in his memory, Russell may still be the most underappreciated icon in NBA history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/bill-russell-dead-boston-celtics-obituary\">Bill Russell, NBA superstar and civil rights activist, dies aged 88</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before recognizing his wider impact, it’s worth laying out Russell’s basketball credentials. To begin with, Russell is the winningest player in NBA history and it’s not even really close. During his 13 seasons in the league, he led the Boston Celtics to 11 NBA championships, including eight consecutive titles from 1959 to 1966. No other team has ever won more than three consecutively.</p> <p>Russell, of course, would never claim that <em>he</em> won those championships – the Celtics won them. He was the consummate team player who took pride in performing the glamourless but productive duties which ultimately won games. Russell once wrote, “The most important measure of how good a game I played was how much better I’d made my teammates play.” Even opponents seemed to notice how nice it looked to play with Russell: he was named the regular-season MVP five times during the era in which the award was determined by players’ votes.</p> <p>Russell’s fortes were his rebounding and (especially) his defense. He played in an era before Defensive Player of the Year awards –they didn’t even record blocks and steals when Russell played – but it’s safe to say he would’ve won several. Hall of Fame point guard Bob Cousy won six championships with Russell and said he played with “animal intensity”. Russell also understood that the mental component of basketball (and of defense, in particular) can be as important as the game’s physical aspects. “Remember that basketball is a game of habits,” he observed. “If you make the other guy deviate from his habits, you’ve got him.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9e2c96b7f061ebe6281897cccc4e19479df8d7fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e2c96b7f061ebe6281897cccc4e19479df8d7fb/0_0_3000_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Russell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Russell speaks during a DNC fundraiser attended by then-US president Barack Obama at the Boston Center for the Arts in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Russell also had a knack for playing at his best when it mattered most. During his first championship run in 1957, <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2017/06/04/bill-russell-coleman-play-leadership/\">Russell blocked Jack Coleman</a> in the final minute of regulation in the deciding Game 7 to keep the Celtics in the game and allow them to eventually win the title. In another Game 7 that also went to overtime, in 1962, Russell scored 30 points and grabbed 40 rebounds, leading his team in both categories. In fact, Russell seemed to keep a secret gear just for Game 7s: his teams were 10-0 in such games throughout his career, an NBA record. Russell never won an NBA finals MVP (the award was only introduced in his final season), but the fact that the NBA eventually named that trophy after him demonstrates how inextricably linked Russell’s play was with championship excellence.</p> <p>However, while the on-court accolades establish Russell has one of the greatest players to ever touch hardwood, it was his activism off the court that made him a legend. Russell was the NBA’s first Black superstar at a time when legalized racial segregation still existed in much of the country. The Civil Rights Act wouldn’t be passed until Russell’s eighth year in the NBA.</p> <p>Russell’s celebrity didn’t insulate him from the issues facing the rest of the country. He was subjected to racism throughout his career, even in Boston, the city he represented for 13 years: vandals once broke into his Massachusetts home and covered the walls with racist graffiti. Such bigotry and intimidation tactics, however, never prevented Russell from taking a stand against the injustices around him. In 1961, he boycotted a game in Kentucky after a white waitress refused to serve two of his Black teammates at a coffee shop. In 1967, Russell appeared alongside boxer Muhammad Ali to express his support for Ali’s refusal to serve in the Vietnam War. Russell’s record of civil rights advocacy is substantial.</p> <p>And so, despite his countless athletic achievements, <em>that</em> is probably Russell’s most significant legacy: his commitment to using his platform as basketball star to amplify his political actions. The NBA outperforms other sports leagues when it comes to addressing social issues in a head-on way, and that is a consequence of Russell’s early example. Every time <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/us/politics/lebron-james-trump-black-voters.html\">LeBron James combats election misinformation</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNf51XAZZo0\">Steve Kerr advocates for gun control</a>, they’re following a trail blazed by Russell. Russell’s on-court accomplishments may never be touched, but his off-court legacy is in good hands.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/01/more-than-1m-people-in-england-waiting-for-non-hospital-care-leak-reveals","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T16:35:02Z","webTitle":"More than 1m people in England waiting for non-hospital care, leak reveals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/01/more-than-1m-people-in-england-waiting-for-non-hospital-care-leak-reveals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/01/more-than-1m-people-in-england-waiting-for-non-hospital-care-leak-reveals","fields":{"headline":"More than 1m people in England waiting for non-hospital care, leak reveals","trailText":"Some of those waiting for community health services<strong> </strong>are facing delays as long as 120 weeks","byline":"Denis Campbell Health policy editor","body":"<p>More than 1 million people are waiting months, and sometimes years, for out-of-hospital care for back pain, foot problems and hearing loss, a leaked NHS England document reveals.</p> <p>While most of those waiting are adults, almost 300,0000 of them are children and young people who are seeking help with problems such as delayed development and long-term conditions.</p> <p>The total number of people in England on the “hidden” waiting-list for care from community-based health services rose from 900,000 in January to 1.05m in May, the Health Service Journal reported.

I was anxious but hyped. I was working at Wembley, which helped keep me distracted because I was always talking to people. When you are a player you can influence things but watching on from the stands, when you are so invested and want them to do well, is horrible.</p> \n<p>When Germany’s best player gets injured in the warmup and there is a first-minute goalmouth scramble but Mary Earps claims it, you think: “This is our time.” I never thought we were going to lose; I just did not want it to go to penalties because it’s 50-50 then. We were all so deflated when the equaliser went in but once we weathered the storm I felt really confident. I said before the game that England would win 2-1 in extra time. I probably should have said that louder.</p> \n<p>I got there at 1pm and it was packed; Olympic Way was full of people, the atmosphere was so joyous. I got into the ground really early and I was quite high up, so I got to hear people’s reaction when they walked in. Quite a lot of this audience had not been to Wembley or a women’s game before. I sat back and listened to everyone coming in and saying: “Wow!” This tournament has had the wow factor; it has gripped the nation. It was a nice environment, safe and inclusive – everything that you want for a major event.</p> \n<p>It is brilliant that we had a victory parade on Monday because that is not a given. It gives women’s sport visibility and legacy. Those players deserve that celebratory moment and it is great for them to see that. It is fantastic that people have come out but it is right they do. England have just won a European Championship and the team are legends and will continue to have that status for the rest of their lives. The Lionesses were absolutely astounding, the best team in the competition. They have gone from strength to strength. It is their time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e01ce8b0a1e41066b3868b2c7bc8a18423ff9c0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e01ce8b0a1e41066b3868b2c7bc8a18423ff9c0/0_304_5460_3277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Lucy Bronze, Jill Scott and Keira Walsh celebrate in Trafalgar Square\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Lucy Bronze, Jill Scott and Keira Walsh celebrate in Trafalgar Square</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Cameron/The FA/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>My good friend Jill Scott enjoyed herself, from the moment she came on to entertain the lip readers to being on stage in Trafalgar Square and beyond. We had a video call while she was at the victory party and everyone was, unsurprisingly, having a good time. She recognises big moments, knows when to celebrate and knows how to make everyone around her feel special and have a great time. She is a fantastic role model. I am so proud of them but most of all for Jill: she has bronze and silver but now she has gold, and no one deserves it more.</p> \n<p>There was no shortage of sunglasses among the squad the morning after the night before. The adrenaline for the players means they do not usually go to bed until 4am after a game, so after winning a European Championship an all-nighter and getting some food on the way to the victory parade is the bare minimum. It is how it should be done by those who have made history.</p> \n<p>Football needs to build on the momentum and capitalise on the opportunity. It starts over again. This tournament has provided packed stadiums and record-breaking television audiences but there is plenty of work to be done. It should be every girl’s right to play. Only 63% of schools offer girls the opportunity to play football in PE. We have to aim high from grassroots to international football; we need consistent attendances in the Women’s Super League and England games to keep the momentum going. The final was the hottest ticket around. It would have been easier for me to get a ticket to the final of the men’s European Championship last summer than Wembley on Sunday – that is the potential of the women’s game.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2022/aug/01/fans-celebrate-england-womens-euro-triumph-london-in-pictures\">Fans celebrate England women’s Euro triumph in London – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It will be exciting to see how the team go from here under Sarina Wiegman, especially with a World Cup less than 12 months away. She has done an incredible job in a relatively short space of time since taking over. Nothing negative has come out of the camp about her. You only usually hear the bad stuff but she has the respect of everyone. It seems as if the players adore her.</p> \n<p>It is a credit to her that all the players knew what they were doing. There was never any stress or anxiety; they constantly played with calmness and belief. The attitude of a team reflects the leadership, and this England side are the mirror of their manager. Everyone has the ability to give instructions, to try to have a gameplan but the best coaches simplify it and make it look easy. She has done that. all the squad knew their roles and responsibilities, and it has all come together. That is what good leadership does.</p> \n<p>I want to say a massive congratulations to this England squad and staff. They have inspired the nation and future generations. They deserve everything they receive.

Horrified by what she saw, a lab technician reported Davies to the SSPCA, which has investigative and prosecution powers, and which alerted the police.</p> <p>Davies kept the terriers, which were unchipped and not registered with a vet, in filthy kennels in an outhouse next to his estate cottage. He also pleaded guilty to firearms offences after police seized a shotgun, rifle and ammunition lying scattered around the buildings without being properly secured.</p> <p>The carcasses of three dead birds of prey were also found during the police search, along with equipment potentially linked to bird of prey persecution.

whole of Yorkshire, a council leader has said.</p> <p>On Monday the leaders of York city council and North Yorkshire county council joined the levelling up secretary, Greg Clark, to sign a “historic” deal that brings a radical shake-up of local government in the area.</p> <p>It will involve <a

government said, £540m over 30 years.</p> <p>Keith Aspden, the Liberal Democratic leader of York city council, praised the deal, pointing to it being more funding per head of population than other devolution settlements.</p> <p>It should also be seen as a step towards something bigger, he said, adding: “Some of us have long had aspirations for a Yorkshire mayor that would represent a population and have a scale that would have undeniable clout in Whitehall and with the government.”</p> <p>Instead there is currently a South Yorkshire mayor and a West Yorkshire mayor, now to be joined by a

Throughout his piece he puts forward this very instrumentalist view of sanctions, but says not a word about the ethical component.</p> <p>If you learned that a friend was engaging in deeply immoral behaviour, you may well confront them on it, and if they persist you may choose to distance yourself. I doubt if anyone would think that withholding friendship will force them to change; you just don’t want anything to do with them any more. You no longer operate in a shared moral universe.</p> <p>I think there are a great number of people in this country who would rather suffer high fuel costs than buy Russian gas – on moral grounds. Of course, the problem with ethical sanctions is where to draw the line; if Russia, then why not Saudi Arabia, China or Israel? This is often a grey area, not least because we in the “enlightened west” are far from being morally pure. But invading a neighbouring country, unprovoked, is as unequivocal a violation of the international order as you can find, and it should not be tolerated, whatever the cost.<br><strong>David Sutherland</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• Mr Jenkins’ well-argued article misses the point. Although he correctly points out that “the interdependence of the world’s economies, so long seen as an instrument of peace, has been made a weapon of war”, he entirely misses the fact that the sanctions regime orchestrated against Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine is primarily targeted at breaking Russia’s interdependence – its supposed integration – in the world economy. Just as Angela Merkel foolishly believed integrating Russia into the world economy by importing its conveniently priced gas would reduce the threat, so now too many, Mr Jenkins included, fail to see that sanctions are effectively decoupling Russia from the world economy. The “cheap” energy from Russia has come at an enormous cost. But better to pay that cost now than to wait until Russia is eyeing Lithuania or Poland.<br><strong>Scott Blau</strong><br><em>Keighley, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>• When I was reading Simon Jenkins’ piece about the sanctions against Russia, my wife was crying about the 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war murdered in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/ukraine-donetsk-olenivka-prison-bombing-russia-war\" title=\"\">Russia’s shelling of Olenivka prison</a> in the Donetsk region. Those were Azov servicemen, who defended Mariupol. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins might be absolutely right about the economic price of sanctions, but this one-dimensional, gas-heated view misses something important. The sanctions are not just a tool to hammer Russia’s economy “back to the stone age”, but rather a way to demonstrate solidarity with the Ukrainian people. </p> <p>Switching sanctions off while continuing weapon supplies? Come on, it is like treating a broken limb with painkillers, but not using any firm bandages. The situation is getting painful and more difficult to handle for Russia. The sanctions, combined with Ukrainian successes on the battlefield, make Russia more inclined towards peace talks. Here, 400km from the frontline, we see Russia losing face.</p> <p>Since 24 February, Ukrainian citizens see the world in black and white. While our people die from Russian missiles, there’s no room for “Yes, but …” We just don’t get that. We have a right to ignore all those “buts”. </p> <p>I would like to thank the UK for its help and pray that the conflict ends with our victory.<br><strong>Bohdan Kisil</strong><br><em>Kyiv, Ukraine</em></p> <p><strong>• </strong><em><strong>Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Bamford, 44, a self-styled “green entrepreneur”, claimed Manheim secretly siphoned millions of dollars from the business and Bamford sought damages of $13.8m (£11.3m).</p> <p>Bamford is the son of Anthony Bamford, the billionaire peer and chairman of JCB – and a major donor to the prime minister, Boris Johnson. Lord Bamford’s Daylesford estate reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/30/boris-and-carrie-johnson-host-wedding-party-on-tory-donors-estate\">hosted Johnson’s wedding party on Saturday</a>.</p> <p>The Guardian last year reported on the legal case, which shone a light on one of Britain’s wealthiest families, revealing how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/22/green-cards-cannabis-strip-club-jcb-heir-legal-battle-jo-bamford\">Bamford admitted to using a company email account to order cannabis</a> and send unspecified “inappropriate, explicit photographs”.</p> <p>The case also appears to reveal how Jo Bamford structured his relationship with the business in order to minimise his tax bill in Britain. The court said: “Bamford was interested in holding his interest through an entity rather than personally, which he believed would help minimise his taxes in the United Kingdom.”</p> <p>The Delaware court’s memorandum opinion – a 125-page judgment dated 24 June this year – has found that Manheim must repay $2.4m plus interest to the company for “excess management fees” and some expenses found to be “not entirely fair”, and that he breached his responsibilities as a director of the company.</p> <p>However, the court denied Bamford’s request to pass control of the company to him and his fellow plaintiff, according to the judgment. According to the filing, Bamford failed to prove Manheim was guilty of fraud or negligent misrepresentation but all of the main parties were criticised by the court.</p> <p>Bamford’s lawyers said he has filed a motion asking the court to increase the amount Manheim must pay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9f98fd1bac98c2731b9e80e56fa761060cd5633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9f98fd1bac98c2731b9e80e56fa761060cd5633/18_171_3308_1986/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wrightbus chairman Jo Bamford speaking as Translink unveils Northern Ireland’s first sustainable fuel cell buses powered by wind energy at its Milewater Service Centre in Belfast on 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Bamford is a grandson of the JCB founder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The judgment is likely to raise further questions over the conduct of Bamford, whose family wealth and connections have helped him become a big player in the green economy, particularly around hydrogen. In 2019 he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/11/wrightbus-close-rescue-deal-after-last-ditch-talks\">rescued the Northern Ireland bus-maker Wrightbus</a> with plans for it to build buses fuelled by hydrogen from Ryze, his distribution company, and he has started a fund that aims to raise £1bn to invest in hydrogen projects.</p> <p>The court found that Bamford, as well as the other key witnesses, had his “credibility impeached successfully on various points”.</p> <p>Lawyers for Bamford said that all steps taken by him in relation to his tax liabilities were appropriate and consistent with US tax law.</p> <p>The trial gave a rare insight into the world of the super-rich. Bamford was described as a collector of classic Ferraris, and rare pheasants, and he admitted ordering cannabis using a work email. In the case, Bamford successfully challenged some of Manheim’s expenses, including visits to a strip club called Delilah’s Den, charges related to a ski holiday injury, and fees paid to a director who the court found acted as a “stooge” for Manheim.</p> <p>The trial also revealed a previously unreported plan by Bamford to buy the Neverland ranch once owned by Michael Jackson, who died in 2009. The purported plan for Bamford to buy the 1092-hectare (2,700 acres) site was discussed in 2013, the court papers show.</p> <p>During cross-examination, Bamford’s lawyer asked Manheim about “Project Peter Pan”. Manheim responded by asking whether she was referring to the “buying the Michael Jackson ranch thing”. Emails referred to in the trial suggest that Bamford got to the stage of assessing non-disclosure agreements related to a potential sale. It is unclear how far Bamford progressed with a potential purchase, and his lawyers did not respond to questions about it.</p> <p>The case centred on Delaware Valley Regional Center (DVRC), a company set up in 2012 to provide US green cards to wealthy foreign investors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7305ed54efaae7400e4f9407d02f0566bd1d83c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7305ed54efaae7400e4f9407d02f0566bd1d83c1/48_80_3380_3820/885.jpg\" alt=\"Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, waves from an excavator during his visit to the JCB factory in Vadodara this year.\" width=\"885\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, waves from an excavator during his visit to the JCB factory in Vadodara, India, this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The programme was structured as genuine infrastructure investment, building roads in Pennsylvania, but the investment returns were meagre: expert testimony cited in court suggested that annual returns after fees were a negative 1.41%, meaning investors lost money. However, it appears the true benefit of the controversial programme was to grant investors access to coveted “green cards”, which confer residence rights in the US.</p> <p>In exchange for $500,000 apiece, which was invested in local road and public transport projects, plus a fee to DVRC, wealthy foreigners could apply for fast-track visas to live and work in the US.</p> <p>The four-day trial in June 2021 detailed how a once-close friendship deteriorated. The two men socialised and holidayed together and were godfathers to each other’s children. The court found that Bamford was “strapped for cash following disagreements with his father” in late 2017, and so looked to DVRC to pay out dividends.</p> <p>Tensions between Bamford and his father, Lord Bamford, started when the father refused to start planning for the son to take over at the head of JCB, the court documents suggest. The manufacturer of diggers and other construction machinery is one of Britain’s biggest private companies, and the Bamfords have used their estimated £4.3bn fortune to exert political influence. JCB and Lord Bamford were among the biggest donors to Boris Johnson and the Brexit campaigns, and Jo Bamford has personally lobbied Johnson for pro-hydrogen government policy.</p> <p>Bamford asked the court to terminate Manheim’s control over the company, but the court denied the request. “The plaintiffs have come nowhere close to proving facts that would support such an extraordinary remedy,” the judge wrote.</p> <p>DVRC operated under the EB-5 programme, which allowed wealthy foreigners to effectively buy the right to live and work in the US. EB-5 is now suspended for new applicants after criticism from senators that – though legal – it presented a national security risk.</p> <p>Through his lawyers, Bamford has previously defended his involvement in the EB-5 scheme as an entirely lawful business.</p> <p>Bamford’s lawyers declined to comment on the record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Manheim said: “I am tremendously proud of DVRC’s accomplishments over the past 10 years enabling and supporting projects that created tens of thousands of jobs and vastly improved south-eastern Pennsylvania’s rails and roads.</p> <p>“I regret, and am still perplexed, that Mr Bamford pursued four years of fruitless litigation, causing the expenditure of millions and millions of dollars in legal fees, in an effort to increase his profits and seize control of the company.</p> <p>“I am very grateful, and not surprised, that the court has rejected the majority of Bamford’s claims and his attempt to take control of the company.

I didn’t think I could come back out and do another 1500m at champs. Not even dealing with the pressure but mentally getting up for it, the warm-up, the rounds.

There’s no reason why you want to do an 800m.’”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/01/leicester-will-not-be-exploited-despite-transfer-unrest-insists-brendan-rodgers","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T16:00:27Z","webTitle":"Leicester will not be ‘exploited’ despite transfer unrest, insists Brendan Rodgers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/leicester-will-not-be-exploited-despite-transfer-unrest-insists-brendan-rodgers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/01/leicester-will-not-be-exploited-despite-transfer-unrest-insists-brendan-rodgers","fields":{"headline":"Leicester will not be ‘exploited’ despite transfer unrest, insists Brendan Rodgers","trailText":"Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle are all eyeing Leicester players but the club’s manager has insisted they want to hang on to their stars despite a difficult financial situation","byline":"Ben Fisher","body":"<p>Brendan Rodgers has insisted Leicester will not be “exploited” as Premier League rivals continue to chase their players. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/chelsea-marc-cucurella-manchester-city\">Chelsea intend to test Leicester’s firm stance</a> that Wesley Fofana is not for sale and Newcastle plan likewise with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/transfer-news-leicester-city-reject-newcastle-40m-bid-james-maddison\">James Maddison, having had a bid rejected last week</a> of about £40m.

Now, as ballots drop on Conservative members’ doorsteps, the race is being deemed all but over.</p> <p>The most telling sign for this is when ambitious ministers keen to keep their jobs come out with their 11th hour endorsements for Liz Truss, having waited to make sure they will pick the winning horse.</p> <p>The race has also begun to follow a more predictable playbook. Like Boris Johnson, Truss launched her campaign late and limited early media appearances and thus opportunities for gaffes. Like Johnson, her thick-skinned campaign has been solid boosterism.</p> <p>Rishi Sunak’s began as pragmatism and seriousness – like Jeremy Hunt – but he has since been forced to throw out ever more red meat to catch up with his rival, similar to how Hunt ended his final weeks of campaigning.</p> <p>But Sunak’s campaign is not giving up and MPs quietly say the race might be closer than expected. It is true the narrative of Truss’s sure victory bears some closer examination. Her lead has been commanding in the YouGov polls of party members – about 24 points – but the last poll was on 21 July.</p> <p>It found that 31% of the membership intend to vote for Rishi Sunak, while 49% intend to vote for Liz Truss. A further 15% currently don’t know.</p> <p>But the Conservative membership is difficult to poll – though YouGov have an excellent track record. Polling before the Johnson-Hunt result in 2019 correctly predicted the result but gave Johnson a much higher margin of victory than he got.</p> <p>MPs from both Truss and Sunak’s camps are conducting their own polling of association members. Most think Truss is on course to win but will stress the vote is very soft. Many MPs described their ad-hoc local polling of members as neck-and-neck with a significant number undecided.</p> <p>One said they did not think ballots would be returned as quickly as in previous years, despite the conventional wisdom that members return their ballots within days, which would have given Sunak just days to turn his fortunes around.</p> <p>Another MP said their older members were by-and-large breaking for Sunak and younger members for Truss, suggesting older members were less likely to take part in online polling. The other indication that the race might be tighter than expected is a poll of Conservative candidates that put just a point between the pair.</p> <p>One former cabinet minister said they had done an informal poll of their members, finding almost an even split, with a third undecided. Even then, the electorate is unpredictable – members may not say they are backing a rival candidate if they know their MP is backing another.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is one thing hugely in Truss’ favour, regardless of polling. She has the momentum. Often polls showing a candidate is the frontrunner have their own way of becoming self-fulfilling prophecies.</p> <p>Truss now has a flood of endorsements from cabinet ministers such as Nadhim Zahawi and Brandon Lewis who think they can see which way the wind is blowing. Penny Mordaunt, who finished third in the leadership race, declared her support for the foreign secretary ahead of Monday’s hustings in Exeter.</p> <p>Sunak was the candidate who once had that momentum – bringing on board Grant Shapps, Dominic Raab and Jeremy Hunt as big name backers who thought they were picking the winning horse. That might be a sign to everyone in this race that the wind can still change very quickly.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/01/fans-revel-england-womens-euro-win-trafalgar-square","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T15:56:44Z","webTitle":"‘It will help with equality’: fans revel in England women’s Euro win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/fans-revel-england-womens-euro-win-trafalgar-square","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/01/fans-revel-england-womens-euro-win-trafalgar-square","fields":{"headline":"‘It will help with equality’: fans revel in England women’s Euro win","trailText":"Thousands join team in Trafalgar Square in London to hail victory described as a turning point","byline":"Geneva Abdul","body":"<p>Thousands of England supporters old and new poured into Trafalgar Square on Monday, chanting and waving flags after the Lionesses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report\">won the Euro 2022 tournament</a> in a victory described as a turning point for women’s football.</p> \n<p>For Nev Walters, who was with his three daughters in the crowd – his eight-year-old, Tess, propped on his shoulders – it was important for them to see a team that had achieved so much.</p> \n<p>“I wanted them to see what can be done,” said Walters, who was astonished to learn only days ago that women were not allowed to play on Football Association-associated grounds until 1971. “I wanted them to be able to see something they can aspire to.”</p> \n<p>While his daughters do not play football, he said: “If you take that sentence ‘women can’t play on Football Association grounds’ and you replace the word ‘women’ with the words ‘black’ or ’Jewish person’, you’ve got a sentence so outrageous you can barely say it.</p> \n<p>“It was just tolerated, I can’t actually believe it.

In 2020, four in 10 Americans have reported symptoms of anxiety or a depressive disorder, compared with one in 10 in 2019. “It may help explain why for that one month last year, everyone on the internet suddenly started singing sea shanties,” the Last Week Tonight host said on Sunday evening. “It was clearly a collective cry for help.”</p> <p>But despite widespread awareness of the problem, people looking for help are encountering a system “that’s just not set up to provide it”.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtIZZs-GAOA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jtIZZs-GAOA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>For one thing, there’s overwhelming demand for a short supply of mental health professionals. According to the American Psychological Association, in 2021, 65% of psychologists reported that they had no capacity for new patients. A Senate report found that more than half of Americans who need mental healthcare do not receive it, with higher rates for minorities. Oliver pointed to one Black man in an NBC News report, who said he couldn’t find a Black male therapist “for my life”.</p> <p>“Wow, ‘I couldn’t find a Black man for my life’ isn’t something you expect to hear about finding a therapist,” Oliver said. “It’s something you more expect to hear about the crowd on January 6th or all 10 seasons of Friends.”</p> <p>“Across the board, whether in small towns or big cities, we don’t have enough mental health professionals,” he said, a gap that has proven attractive to Silicon Valley. Tech companies such as Woebot, Talkspace and Chatbot “claim to hook you up with therapists and in some cases, medication,” said Oliver. “They’re basically Uber, but for your brain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/25/john-oliver-us-inflation-crisis\">John Oliver on the causes of the US inflation crisis: ‘An unprecedented perfect storm’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“And look, there is nothing inherently wrong with teletherapy,” he continued. “In theory, it can help fill in some of the very real gaps in access” but “the reality of these services has often been deeply underwhelming”. The company Cerebral, for example, became subject of a federal investigation over whether it <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-03-11/cerebral-app-over-prescribed-adhd-meds-ex-employees-say\">over-prescribed controlled substances</a> like Adderall.</p> <p>“It is clear mental health apps are not going to save us here, because they’re not dealing with the main underlying issue,” Oliver said, as they “can’t suddenly hire more clinicians if not enough exist. And that shortage speaks to a mental healthcare system that is so dysfunctional, it seems almost designed to prevent people from accessing it or providers from entering the field.”</p> <p>This is despite so-called “parity” laws at the state and federal levels, which require insurance companies to reimburse for mental healthcare at the same rate as other health services. Nevertheless, Oliver pointed out, insurance companies have found ways to deny coverage, such as through “ghost networks”, which are lists from insurance providers padded with clinicians who either don’t take new patients or are no longer in the coverage network.</p> <p>Insurance companies have also overturned coverage in the middle of treatment; Oliver pointed to the case of one Ohio family left on the hook for $88,000 of their own money after insurance deemed inpatient care for their suicidal teenager to be “medically unnecessary”.</p> <p>“If you’re wondering how insurers can get away with that sort of thinking,” Oliver explained, “it’s partly because the government has, to this point, done shockingly little when it comes to enforcing parity laws”. Federal and state agencies rarely penalize insurance plans – the Labor Department closed just 74 parity investigations in fiscal year 2021, finding violations in only 12; state-level enforcement have levied fines just 13 times since 2017, “which is absolutely pathetic”, said Oliver. Public insurance such as Medicare and Medicaid also reimburse community health providers, whose own funding has deteriorated, at “woefully insufficient” levels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jun/27/john-oliver-roe-v-wade-drought\">John Oliver on end of Roe v Wade: ‘We’re in uncharted territory’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Basically from top to bottom, we significantly underpay mental health professionals,” Oliver said, “many of whom do difficult, high burnout work”.</p> <p>Overworked, underpaid, struggling to make ends meet unless they practice in a high density, high wealth area – “therapists are in a no-win situation here”, Oliver added, referring to a news clip in which anonymized mental health providers say they’re being run into the ground by low reimbursements. “For what it’s worth, it is just not a great sign that insurance companies are now so powerful that mental health providers feel like they have to go on the news like they’re in witness protection after seeing someone get whacked.”</p> <p>The costs of not addressing the crisis are high: mental health problems drive homelessness and force people into contact with the criminal justice system. “It is often said the correctional facilities have become the largest providers of mental healthcare services in our country,” Oliver said. “Basically, we’ve gone from warehousing people with mental illness in buildings that felt like prisons,” such as the sanatoriums of the early 20th century, “to warehousing them in actual prisons instead. It’s very much the new look, same great taste of America’s failures.”</p> <p>How to fix it? “Clearly, this is an absurd way to operate a healthcare system, and for the umpteenth time, I would argue single-payer healthcare is the way to go,” Oliver said. In lieu of that political non-starter, it’s strengthening and enforcing mental health parity laws – such as in California, which in 2020 passed a measure requiring insurance companies to base decisions of “medical necessity” on current standards, not criteria they impose themselves.</p> <p>“In the past, so much of the problem here was that people would not ask for help. And thankfully, that’s now less of an issue,” Oliver concluded. “But now when people do reach out for help, we’re just not in a position to give it to them. If we want to be a society that truly respects and values mental health, we have to respect and value mental healthcare, and that means supporting the people who deliver it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/01/keir-starmer-and-piers-morgan-among-new-list-of-britons-banned-from-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T15:50:36Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer and Piers Morgan among new list of Britons banned from Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/keir-starmer-and-piers-morgan-among-new-list-of-britons-banned-from-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/01/keir-starmer-and-piers-morgan-among-new-list-of-britons-banned-from-russia","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer and Piers Morgan among new list of Britons banned from Russia","trailText":"Politicians, businesspeople and journalists barred as Russia seeks to control narrative on Ukraine invasion","byline":"Pjotr Sauer","body":"<p>Russia has banned 39 senior British politicians, businesspeople and journalists from entering the country, including the Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, the former prime minister David Cameron and the presenter Piers Morgan.</p> <p>“It was decided to include on the Russian ‘stop list’ a number of British politicians, businessmen and journalists who contribute to London’s hostile course aimed at the demonising of our country and contributing to its international isolation,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement published on its website on Monday.</p> <p>“Given London’s destructive drive to spin the sanctions flywheel on far-fetched and absurd pretexts, work on expanding the Russian stop list will continue,” the ministry added.</p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the shadow levelling up secretary, Lisa Nandy, are also on the list.</p> <p>The journalists banned include the Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, as well as British journalists working for the BBC, the Sunday Times, the Economist, the Daily Telegraph and Sky News.</p> <p>Moscow banned dozens of British journalists, media figures and defence figures from entering the country in June in what the foreign ministry said was a response to western sanctions and the “spreading of false information about Russia”.

It’s the kind of baffling half-message you might whisper to someone while they are asleep, just to mess with their dreams. Liz Truss wowed an audience of Leeds Tories by telling them “a woman is a woman”, while <a href=\"https://mol.im/a/10998697\">Rishi Sunak pledged in the Mail on Sunday</a> that he would reverse the “recent trends to erase women via the use of clumsy, gender-neutral language”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/camillahmturner/status/1546793200978911232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No gender neutral loos here....

Many things, from the economy to the climate, have taken an extremely dark turn. How could any person of serious intent be concentrating on “clumsy, gender-neutral language”?</p> <p>Maybe it doesn’t matter what I think, since I’m not choosing the next prime minister; except you know who agrees with me? Tory members. The pollsters Opinium did <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Samfr/status/1546960872744124416?s=20&amp;t=PblXotz9serO9T0weEpExg\">salience research on a 500-strong sample of Conservative members</a>, to find out which issues they were most passionate about. Trans issues, which had been posed as two separate questions (participation in sport and rights more generally), came in at 26th and 27th, in a list of 28. Is it because they have already been whipped into a frenzy about migrant crossings – the second biggest issue – and voters, like milk, can’t be frothed twice? Or is it because there is a cost of living crisis – by far the subject of greatest concern – with such serious hardship looming that not even the triple-locked are viewing the coming months with anything but dread? Who on earth do these politicians think they are, that they can steer this country into the rocks and then make the wreckage look more festive with their spiteful fireworks?</p> <p>Duh, my mistake. They are not trying to distract their own voters; there likely won’t be a vote on the leader anyway. Rishi Sunak, if his flustered chatter and petrified fake laugh were anything to go by on Monday’s Today programme, will have conceded within a week, leaving Liz Truss to be anointed. It’s just a tawdry play to divide the left, so that instead of building a coherent critique of this shambles of a government, instead of laying out a platform on which they are united, Labour MPs are signing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/observer-letters\">open letters</a> to each other about drivel. Let us know when we can eat any of these confected controversies, or warm our hands setting fire to them.</p> <p>Sun Tzu doubtless puts this more pithily, but progressives, everywhere: if you are chasing a stick Liz Truss threw for you, you are chasing the wrong stick.</p> <p>• Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They are humans, they have the same rights as the rest of us, and abortion is murder,” he said.</p> <p>Republican lawmakers have been accused of setting out to confuse people and suppress votes.</p> <p>“The ballot mentions a state constitutional right to abortion funding in Kansas, but that funding has never really been on the table,” said Mary Ziegler, a US abortion law expert from the University of California, Davis.</p> <p>“Historically, in Kansas primaries, turnout is lower for Democrats and Independents … so the timing was probably designed to give the yes vote a boost,” she said.</p> <p>Will the result accurately reflect Kansans’ beliefs?</p> <p>“In 2021, 60% of<a href=\"https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/22/poll-shows-kansas-residents-skeptical-banning-abortion-all-cases/6878658001/\"> </a>Kansas voters said they <a href=\"https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/22/poll-shows-kansas-residents-skeptical-banning-abortion-all-cases/6878658001/\">did not want an absolute ban on abortion</a>. So I would think that most Kansas voters, if they knew what this was, would not be in favor of it,” Ziegler said.</p> <p>Misinformation abounds. On Wednesday, the Church of the Resurrection in Leawood hosted an informational event, inviting Great Plains Planned Parenthood, an obstetrician-gynecologist, and Kansans For Life to talk.</p> <p>It’s one of the world’s biggest methodist churches, and the founder, the Rev Adam Hamilton, discussed a questionnaire it had distributed, receiving over 4,000 responses. The state vote represents abortion as a binary issue, but survey respondents were mainly in the middle – not for a total ban nor for no limits, he said.</p> <p>What followed was mixed messaging. In a pre-recorded message by Kansans for Life, communications director Danielle Underwood spoke about third trimester abortions, taxpayer funding for abortion, lack of regulation and no parental consent for youth abortions in Kansas – none of which are the law of the land in Kansas.</p> <p>“Either we have a limit to the abortion industry, or no limits. That’s what the amendment says,” said Underwood.</p> <p>“I come at this analysis as a lawyer,” rebutted Emily Wales, chief executive of Great Plains Planned Parenthood. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1b00c8a2e3ea912380f16734f130275450786181\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b00c8a2e3ea912380f16734f130275450786181/178_361_1146_1433/800.jpg\" alt=\"Seth Simmons, 37, stands in his front yard with his daughter and his yes sign.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seth Simmons, 37, stands in his front yard with his daughter and his ‘yes’ sign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Seth Simmons</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We do have regulated abortion.

The campaign knows that answer chimes well with Kansans.</p> <p>“You’ve got my vote!” said Ron Barnhart, 80, a retired doctor. </p> <p>Around the corner, Tom Bruce, 72, said he was voting no. “I don’t trust the Kansas legislature to do the right thing. Abortion is already restricted enough here,” he said.</p> <p>Driving from Johnson county to meet more canvassers in the working-class and more ethnically diverse area of Wyandotte county, the purple signage of the yes campaign gives way to the yellow and black sunflowers of no.</p> <p>There, a 58-year-old pre-school teacher, who asked not to be named, said she was in a moral conundrum.</p> <p>“I’d rather not do a yes or a no,” she said, wringing her hands. “I just keep saying it’s a little human being – I’m a Catholic.”</p> <p>“But I also keep on thinking about what happened to that little girl, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/indiana-investigates-abortion-doctor-10-year-old-rape-victim\">who was 10, and was forced to travel</a> for an abortion after being raped.

Strong on the ground, in the air and, sometimes, in attack, she complemented Leah Williamson perfectly.</p> <h2>Leah Williamson (defender) 9</h2> <p>An impressive captain who reverted to her natural central defensive role, pushing Alex Greenwood to the bench on the eve of the tournament. Her Franco Baresi-esque positioning proved so exceptional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/england-captain-leah-williamson-making-her-mark-without-having-to-tackle\">she rarely needed to resort to tackling</a>. The perfect partner for Bright.</p> <h2>Rachel Daly (defender) 7</h2> <p>Was preferred to Demi Stokes and Jess Carter at left-back and, a difficult game against Spain apart, did well as a right-footer in a not entirely familiar role. No one would have guessed Daly operates as a forward for her club, Houston Dash.</p> <h2>Keira Walsh (midfielder) 9</h2> <p>A strong contender for player of the tournament. The midfield anchor held things together while also changing games courtesy of her defence-splitting passes. Without Walsh it is hard to imagine England would have won the tournament.</p> <h2>Georgia Stanway (midfielder) 8</h2> <p>Revelled in a box-to-box role alongside Walsh and, although not a natural No 8, did very well. Possibly fortunate not to have been sent off for a second yellow card in the final but otherwise Bayern Munich’s new midfielder adapted seamlessly. And who can forget her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/20/england-spain-womens-euro-2022-quarter-final-match-report\">winning goal in the quarter-final</a> against Spain?</p> <h2>Fran Kirby (playmaker) 9</h2> <p>The Chelsea player did not have quite the impact the desired in the final but played an enormous part in getting England there.

Her six goals in five games helped sweep England to Wembley, with that achievement magnified by Mead’s position wide on the right. The Arsenal forward showed excellent control, adhesive touch and adroit finishing, all of which terrified opponents.</p> <h2>Ellen White (forward) 7</h2> <p>The goals dried up for England’s record scorer but she did much unsung hard work very well, pressing assiduously and leaving defenders exhausted by the time she was replaced by super-sub Alessia Russo. It was not through sentiment she started every game.</p> <h2>Lauren Hemp (forward) 8</h2> <p>By her own admission the Manchester City left-winger did not always hit top form but her pace and incisive deliveries persistently ruffled right-backs. A world-class player in the making she is, rightly, one of the first names on the team sheet.</p> <h2>Alessia Russo (forward) 9</h2> <p>The Manchester United player will be ever synonymous with her backheeled goal against Sweden. Talk about a gamechanging substitute. And to think that before the tournament critics fretted whether there was sufficient attacking cover for White. Appeared in all six games from the bench, scoring four goals, with only Mead and Alex Popp (six apiece) registering more.</p> <h2>Chloe Kelly (forward) 9</h2> <p>It was touch and go whether the Manchester City winger would recover from the ACL injury that had sidelined her for almost a year. But recover she did and Kelly provided a Brandi Chastain moment by whipping off her shirt after scoring the extra-time winner against Germany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3694ad1ad80123f8214fc00e9c46a519af318aaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3694ad1ad80123f8214fc00e9c46a519af318aaa/0_225_4440_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ella Toone’s cool finish against Germany after coming off the bench set England on the path to victory in the final at Wembley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ella Toone’s cool finish against Germany after coming off the bench set England on the path to victory in the final at Wembley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leila Coker/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ella Toone (forward) 9</h2> <p>Another gamechanger from the bench.

She spent most of the tournament on the bench but was liberated from it for the final five minutes of the final and also appeared against Spain.</p> <h2>Jess Carter (defender) 6</h2> <p>Daly’s solidity at left-back ensured the Chelsea full-back was restricted to a solitary second-half appearance against Northern Ireland from the bench.

Allison, who has died aged 90, was at the time what the BBC still quaintly described as its court correspondent, and what less reverent observers called Gold Microphone in Waiting. But he was at least a working journalist, rather than the retired naval officers or old Etonian courtiers of yore.</p> <p>Royal press officers were not completely new. The first had been appointed in 1918 and Allison would be the seventh, though the monarchy had done without one for most of the 30s and through the second world war.</p> <p>But the institution and its inhabitants were appearing increasingly fusty and hidebound, not helped by the 21-year reign of Cmdr Richard Colville, known as the Abominable No Man, who did not see it as his duty to communicate information to the media and customarily left his office in mid-afternoon to return to a home unfurnished with a telephone. Colville, the son of an admiral, was famous for telling a Canadian journalist who had the impertinence to ask him a question: “I am not what you North Americans would call a public relations officer.”</p> <p>By the time he retired in 1968, loyal crowds were beginning to decline in numbers at public events and the Queen’s private secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/27/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Martin Charteris</a>, along with the Duke of Edinburgh, decided that a new style was needed. Allison, clean-cut, televisual and experienced in the ways of the trade, was part of a more professionalised approach. </p> <p>Awestruck, the BBC reported Allison’s appointment by pointing out that the new press secretary lived in a three-bedroomed semi in Twickenham. Allison himself saw no reason to move into a palace-provided apartment and continued to commute to work every day.</p> <p>The son of Dorothy (nee Doyle) and Percy Allison, he had been brought up on the south coast and was educated at Weymouth grammar school and then Taunton’s school in Southampton, before becoming a district reporter on the Hampshire Chronicle for five years.</p> <p>He joined the BBC as a reporter in 1957, going freelance for a period before rejoining the corporation and becoming a specialist correspondent. As a sports reporter he covered the Munich Olympic Games in 1972 and also went on royal tours for four years.</p> <p>In the BBC’s then style, Allison was courteous and never irreverent. He had already published an illustrated booklet about the Queen and had interviewed the Duke for a programme about industrial innovation, so was not an unknown quantity to the palace, even if some members of the household were suspicious of the appointment of an outsider who was also a journalist. So was ITV at seeing a BBC rival being chosen.</p> <p>“During my time as press secretary I retained my professional integrity and I never knowingly told a lie. If somebody had a scoop I wouldn’t spoil it. I didn’t say: if you have got it I’ll release it to everybody,” he told the royal biographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/apr/12/guardianobituaries.politicsphilosophyandsociety\" title=\"\">Ben Pimlott</a>.</p> <p>In fact, because he knew both palace and press, Allison was both a straightforward and a trusted source, willing to answer even impertinent questions. He answered not only for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh but also their offspring, including Prince Charles, whose marital intentions were already becoming a source of media obsession. “Every working day of my five years at the palace there was a question of who [he] would marry,” Allison told Pimlott. The nearest he came to a steer to the media was when speculation that Charles would marry Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg was at its height and he issued a statement saying that there was no truth in reports of an imminent announcement: a neat tactic.</p> <p>In retrospect, the period was a halcyon time for the royals, clear of scandal and with a still compliant and non-intrusive media. Allison’s first task was to help organise coverage of the supposedly fairytale wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips, and his last before leaving the palace five years later was the Queen’s silver jubilee celebrations, during which she toured every one of her 16 realms deploying the innovation of walkabouts to greet the crowds.</p> <p>Unlike his predecessors, Allison saw the job as a career move, not a vocation, and in 1978 he left – made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order – to return to his old interest in sport. He presented a half-hour weekly Thames Television programme on winter sports for five years and was also the channel’s controller of sport and outside broadcasts. Later he went freelance, setting up his own media companies and he was also a director of corporate affairs for Bafta, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, in the 90s.</p> <p>His service to the royals included a series of books, including Charles, Prince of Our Time, in 1978, The Royal Encyclopaedia, co-authored with Sarah Riddell, in 1991, and The Queen: 50 Years – a Celebration in 2001. He was also ITN’s consultant on the royal family from 1991.</p> <p>He married twice, first in 1956 to Maureen Macdonald and, after her death in 1992, the following year to Jennifer Loy Weider, a New Yorker whom he met on a cruise while recovering from a heart bypass operation.</p> <p>There were two daughters from his first marriage and a son from the second.</p> <p> • Ronald William Paul Allison, press secretary, born 26 January 1932; died 26 July 2022</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/01/interest-rates-are-rising-so-why-are-mortgage-rules-being-scrapped","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T15:26:20Z","webTitle":"Interest rates are rising – so why are mortgage rules being scrapped?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/01/interest-rates-are-rising-so-why-are-mortgage-rules-being-scrapped","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/01/interest-rates-are-rising-so-why-are-mortgage-rules-being-scrapped","fields":{"headline":"Interest rates are rising – so why are mortgage rules being scrapped?","trailText":"Analysis: Bank ruling that borrowers no longer have to show they can afford steep repayment hikes raises questions over how to curb excessive borrowing","byline":"Phillip Inman","body":"<p>From today, there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/bank-of-england-plans-to-remove-interest-rate-check-for-mortgages\">one less barrier to obtaining a mortgage</a>.

Instead, those that worry about excessive borrowing, especially by people on modest incomes, should consider an overall framework that still includes many other checks.</p> <p>Bailey said he was convinced lenders could be “more efficient” without sacrificing safety. “Having now got a body of evidence running back seven years or so now, we were able to take a much more substantial judgment on the effectiveness of the tests,” he said.</p> <p>The backdrop to the decision is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/31/era-of-soaring-house-prices-is-ending-as-central-banks-raise-rates\">a sharply slowing housing market</a> that ministers are concerned will rob the economy of vital thrust if it weakens further.

And while mortgage rates remain low by historical standards, the size of the loan needed to buy 90% of the average home has never been higher.</p> <p>Covid-19 has provided another twist to the property market story, with lenders coming under pressure from rising levels of mortgage distress.

Ni China affairs correspondent","body":"<p>Britain’s House of Commons foreign affairs committee is planning a visit to Taiwan later this year – probably in November or early December – despite rising tensions in the region, the Guardian has learned.</p> \n<p>Sources say the trip – which was originally scheduled for early this year but was postponed due to one member of the delegation testing positive for Covid – was intended to show Britain’s support for the democratically run island, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/china-and-taiwan-whats-behind-the-tensions-in-30-seconds\">China considers its own</a>.</p> \n<p>It comes as London’s relationship with Beijing continues to deteriorate. Last week, the Conservative leadership candidates, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, articulated their tough positions on China. And China’s ambassador to the UK accused some British politicians of “peddling the fallacy of the so-called China threat” <a href=\"http://gb.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/dshdjjh/202207/t20220730_10730647.htm\">in a video remark</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/24/sunak-to-promise-curbs-on-china-as-uks-biggest-long-term-threat\">Sunak to promise curbs on China as UK’s ‘biggest long-term threat’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tensions have been rising in the Taiwan strait in recent weeks after reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/nancy-pelosi-confirms-asia-trip-but-does-not-mention-taiwan\">a possible trip to Taipei by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi</a>. Beijing has repeatedly warned against such a move and has threatened to take “decisive actions” if the trip goes ahead. Pelosi is now on a trip to Asia, where she has scheduled stops in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and South Korea.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6fa854e2-e1b5-4536-915d-1ee6cc6813ec\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tykhJbhXPKA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Saturday, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) conducted “live-fire exercises” near Pingtan island off Fujian province, according to the official Xinhua news agency. China’s maritime safety administration warned ships to avoid the area. The drills also came ahead of the 1 August PLA founding anniversary.</p> \n<p>During their fifth phone call last week, China’s president, Xi Jinping, warned the US president, Joe Biden, not to “play with fire” over Taiwan. On Monday, China’s spokesperson said its military <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/china-military-nancy-pelosi-visit-taiwan\">would “not sit idly by”</a> if Pelosi went ahead with the Taiwan trip.</p> \n<p>Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the foreign affairs select committee, is expected to lead the delegation to Taiwan later this year. But as he extended his backing to Truss over the weekend, there was speculation he may be given a cabinet-level job in her administration if she wins the race in September. But even if this happened, one source said, the trip would go ahead “whoever becomes the next chair”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/xi-jinping-tells-joe-biden-not-to-play-with-fire-over-taiwan-in-two-hour-call\">Xi Jinping tells Joe Biden not to ‘play with fire’ over Taiwan in two-hour call</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is unclear whether the British delegation would meet Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen. Details of the trip are being hammered out, including the dates of the visit, sources have suggested. In the past, the Taiwanese leader has personally welcomed delegations from the European parliament and members of the US and Czech senates.</p> \n<p>The move is yet another sign that London is strengthening its ties with Taiwan as it now regards China as a long-term threat to the UK. Officially, Britain continues to stick to its “one-China policy”, which recognises Beijing as the sole legal government of China, but it keeps ties with Taiwan on an unofficial level.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Truss, the foreign secretary, has in recent months urged western countries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/29/chinese-invasion-of-taiwan-would-be-catastrophic-miscalculation-liz-truss\">ensure Taiwan can protect itself from China</a>. In June, she remarked in an interview that the UK should provide Taiwan with weapons – a comment that surprised some of her fellow MPs and colleagues, the Guardian understands.</p> \n<p>The Taipei representative office in London declined to comment on details of the potential visit when approached by the Guardian, but it said Taiwan “welcomes any opportunities to strengthen its relations with Britain, including through visits from the UK”.</p> \n<p>The foreign affairs committee said it “has had a longstanding intention to visit Taiwan, within the context of its inquiry into the tilt to the Indo-Pacific”. But it declined to comment on the details of the visit “due to security concerns and in line with normal practice”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/aug/01/factory-growth-china-uk-eurozone-home-sales-markets-inflation-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T14:44:39Z","webTitle":"UK

Bulgarian prosecutors have linked previous attacks to Russian operatives.</p> <p>Gebrev fell into a coma in 2015 and western authorities and intelligence agencies believe he was poisoned with the nerve agent novichok by officers from Russian military intelligence, the GRU. He said this weekend’s fire was likely to be their work as well.</p> <p>Gebrev said he had spoken to his director of security, who reported an alarm system was triggered at the warehouse in the moments before the blast, suggesting an intrusion. Guards on the scene were preparing to investigate when they heard a huge explosion. Nobody was hurt.</p> <p>He said there should be CCTV recordings that would show any intruders, but that so far police and investigators had been unable to enter the premises due to the possibility of further explosions. He said he hoped a proper investigation would start on Monday evening.</p> <p>Gebrev said the warehouse contained munitions meant for African countries that had been ordered several years ago but the buyers had not followed through with payment. He declined to specify the types of weapons or their value.</p> <p>Gebrev’s apparent targeting by the GRU has led many to believe he must be involved in arms supplies to Ukraine. Last year, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/world/europe/arms-merchant-russia-assassination-squad.html\">told</a> the New York Times in an email his companies had been involved in shipping weapons to Ukraine, something he had previously denied.</p> <p>Now, he again insisted he had not had any dealings with Ukraine since the signing of the Minsk peace deal in late 2014 that led to a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. He said he had not provided any arms deliveries to the country since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whatever the reason, Gebrev has apparently made powerful enemies in Russia. Between 2011 and 2020, blasts hit four warehouses and production facilities linked to his company. Last year, the Bulgarian foreign ministry expelled a Russian diplomat over suspected Russian involvement in the blasts, and called on Moscow to help with the investigation.</p> <p>Bulgarian prosecutors said there was a “reasonable assumption” the four blasts were linked to the poisoning attempt on Gebrev. His son and a company director also fell into a coma.</p> <p>“I almost died,” said Gebrev, recalling the attack in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/18/i-almost-died-arms-dealers-poisoning-may-be-linked-to-skripals\">a 2019 interview with the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>The investigative website Bellingcat has <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/09/04/gebrev-survives-poisonings-post-mortem/\">released evidence</a> suggesting a team of GRU agents was in Bulgaria at the same time as the poisoning.</p> <p>Gebrev said Russian diplomats were “the tip of the iceberg” and complained that Bulgarian authorities had not been able to bring any of the cases to court.</p> <p>“It’s been 11 years since the first explosion and nobody has been punished for this,” he said. <br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2022/aug/01/nichelle-nichols-groundbreaking-figure-black-women","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T14:41:32Z","webTitle":"Nichelle Nichols was my hero and a groundbreaking figure for Black women | Mikki Kendall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/01/nichelle-nichols-groundbreaking-figure-black-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/aug/01/nichelle-nichols-groundbreaking-figure-black-women","fields":{"headline":"Nichelle Nichols was my hero and a groundbreaking figure for Black women","trailText":"The death of the Star Trek actor leaves behind a hugely important legacy both on the small screen and in space","byline":"Mikki Kendall","body":"<p>Nichelle Nichols was my hero. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/31/nichelle-nichols-lt-uhura-star-trek-dies\">Her death on Saturday at 89</a> was the passing of an icon who changed the world, and then kept fighting to make the future in our imaginations and in reality, a better brighter place for Black girls. When I was a kid around eight or nine, I would watch reruns of Star Trek and imagine myself as a space traveler. I even loved the fact that our first names were so similar. To me, she was the epitome of cool and I eagerly watched every moment she was on screen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/31/nichelle-nichols-lt-uhura-star-trek-dies\">Nichelle Nichols, who played Lt Uhura in original Star Trek, dies aged 89</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But because I was a kid, I didn’t really grasp how groundbreaking her work on the show was, as by the time I saw it, she was one of many images of Black womanhood. For me she was the one that resonated because I was fascinated by space, but of course I saw everyone from Diahann Carroll to Jackée Harry on screen. My world was one where images of Black womanhood were everywhere. It wasn’t that I thought racism didn’t exist, but the world in which Black women were only depicted as maids was never my reality. The media landscape that would have taught me that there was nothing for girls like me but servitude was changed by Nichelle Nichols.</p> <p>When Nichols broke those barriers for Black women as Lt Uhura on the original Star Trek, I didn’t exist yet, and though I can study Jim Crow and can understand in the abstract how hard it was for her, I will never know the world that couldn’t stand the sight of her. But because of her, I feel no need to dim my light. And that’s true for so many Black women in America and around the world.</p> <p>In conversation with the writer NK Jemisin after the news broke, we talked about how sad it is, and about Nichols’s impact on Jemisin’s career. “Without Nichelle Nichols I might have never been a writer, certainly not the kind of writer I am now,” she said. And that’s the thing about trailblazers like Nichols: they create an environment in which the path they opened is widened by those that they affected. Jemisin is widely regarded as one of the best writers of our generation, and though Nichols may not have realized what she wrought in the moment, I hope she knows in some beautiful afterlife that she helped make that possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0b400a6226ddcb2a45826edee627ebdb062795e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0b400a6226ddcb2a45826edee627ebdb062795e/0_113_4606_2763/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nichelle Nichols in 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nichelle Nichols in 2017</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We talked about her impact on us specifically, but we join Whoopi Goldberg, Mae Jemison and millions of others in grieving and gratitude. Though Nichols always gave credit to the Rev Martin Luther King Jr for talking her out of leaving the show, I am quietly convinced that Nichols stood her ground because she wasn’t going to let herself be forced out. She famously had no problem standing up to William Shatner on set when they butted heads. And in later years she advocated heavily for more diversity in the space program, telling ABC audio in a 2016 interview:</p> <p>“Nasa recruited me, hired me to recruit women and minorities for the space shuttle program. And until that time there were no people of color even considered,” she explains, adding with a laugh, “and after that, we were all over the place!</p> <p>“I interviewed quite a few young women that were interested in that and simply didn’t think they had a chance. And one interview with me and they knew they did.”</p> <p>For decades after Star Trek ended, Nichols was known for being encouraging, strong, and razor sharp. She was funny and sweet, and her work was always a presence in any conversation about science fiction or media representation. She was a cultural force that no one could ignore even when she wasn’t technically the focus in a conversation about the importance of inclusion and diversity. Her impact on others ran so deep that she was cited as an example by academics, activists and anyone who knew anything about the world as it had been and wanted to make the world the best it could be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/26/star-trek-actor-nichelle-nichols-free-conservatorship\">‘Free Nichelle’: protesters want to liberate Star Trek actor Nichelle Nichols from conservatorship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s one of the reasons fans struggled with the idea that she would not always be available to meet at conventions or that she might need more support and protection as she aged. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/26/star-trek-actor-nichelle-nichols-free-conservatorship\">When the conservatorship was announced</a>, it was a blow to many, but given what her manager was allegedly able to do to her finances, I can’t help but wish we could have shown up for her the way she showed up for all of us.

But we were lucky to have had her, to have been graced for as long as we were with her spirit and love. Perhaps the best way we can honor her is to strive as she did to make the world better, to remake our future into something utopian where the real Black Girl Magic is Black girls’ dreams coming true without having to battle so hard to be seen as human and worthy of respect and care. Nichelle Nichols was the hero that we needed, and hopefully we can all live up to the gifts she gave us.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/01/sweet-caroline-sound-of-sporting-success-womens-euro-2022","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T14:38:52Z","webTitle":"Good times never seemed so good!

Along with the use of direct violence, Palestinians and veterans say the military governing body is an integral part of a system of oppression.</p> <p>“We were told in training that everything we were doing for the Palestinians was basically generous, a favour. We didn’t question the bigger picture, like why there are no decent hospitals in the territories, so people have to travel,” said Carmel, who first served in the Gaza Israeli-Palestinian military coordination office, and then in the restive city of Jenin in the north of the West Bank.</p> <p>“The army raids your house at 2am and then at 8am you still have to get in line for hours for a permit for the most basic administrative stuff,” he said. “I think that’s something a lot of Israelis don’t realise. It’s not the carrot and the stick, it’s the stick and the stick. It’s the same thing.”</p> <p>Testimonies from military conscripts who served in Cogat offices during the past decade have for the first time been collected by <a href=\"https://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/\">Breaking The Silence</a>, an NGO established by IDF veterans which for nearly 20 years has given discharged soldiers the opportunity to recount their experiences in confidence – and give the Israeli public an unvarnished understanding of what enforcing the occupation entails.</p> <p>The verified accounts of several dozen interviewees – including Carmel, who now works for the organisation – have been gathered in a new, <a href=\"https://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/inside/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Military_rule_testimony_booklet.pdf\">freely available booklet</a> titled Military Rule. It is accompanied by <a href=\"https://gisha.org/en/the-permit-regime-testimonies/\">testimonies from residents of the blockaded Gaza Strip</a> collected by <a href=\"https://gisha.org/en/\">Gisha</a>, an NGO focusing on Palestinian freedom of movement.</p> <p>While putting together the project, Breaking the Silence’s interviewers found that repeated themes began to emerge: the use of collective punishment, such as revoking an entire family’s travel permits; the extensive network of Palestinian agents cooperating with Cogat’s Civil Administration, which governs parts of the West Bank; the considerable influence of Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/20/land-beyond-road-forbidden-israeli-settler-shepherds-displacing-palestinians\">illegal settler movement</a> on the Civil Administration’s decision-making processes; and arbitrary or baseless blocks on goods allowed in and out of Gaza.</p> <p>“The level of power and control we have was astonishing,” said a 25-year-old man who served in 2020-2021 at Cogat’s headquarters near the Beit El settlement north of Ramallah.</p> <p>“I found out we were responsible for approving weapons permits for the Palestinian security forces, which is one of those details you don’t really think about until the stack of paperwork is front of you. It’s little realisations like that, every day, that makes the scale of the occupation really dawn on you.</p> <p>“And we had access to so much information. I didn’t know how deep and wide-ranging the data collection is. Sometimes I was bored, so I’d type in random Palestinian ID numbers and see what came up. I could see everything about their lives: families, travel details, sometimes employers.</p> <p>“I remember once my commanding officer pulled up the screen to show me the file of one of the highest-ranking Palestinian officials, just for fun. That was mind-blowing.”</p> <p>In a statement, a Cogat spokesperson said: “We regret all attempts to cast doubt upon the work and the integrity of the organisation’s staff, and we firmly reject all attempts to ascribe the organisation’s efforts to one or another political agenda.</p> <p>Cogat “always conscientiously examines and handles cases involving deviations from the procedures, the law, or orders. Such cases are exceptions and do not reflect the practices of the Civil Administration”.</p> <p>Another common theme across the testimonies is the psychological impact of surrendering autonomy to the armed forces, even in bureaucratic settings.</p> <p>“I went to the army thinking, ‘I’ll do my service and help change things for the better from the inside’. But as soon as I arrived I became part of the system,” said a 24-year-old woman who served at Cogat’s headquarters in 2017-2018.</p> <p>“Sometimes I’d have the choice to finish early for the weekend: my superior would never mind if I did that. Or, I could stay until 5pm and actually continue helping the Palestinians waiting to give me their papers. My wants conflicted with their needs. I can’t put my finger on when or why, but my behaviour started changing.</p> <p>“I thought Breaking the Silence was just for combatants, but I went to an exhibit and saw that there was testimony from a girl who also served in my unit.</p> <p>“You just do what you’re told to do in the army, but you only see small fragments of the whole. It has been a long journey to understand what I did during my military service and what it meant.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/01/michael-deakin-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T14:28:58Z","webTitle":"Michael Deakin obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/01/michael-deakin-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/01/michael-deakin-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Michael Deakin obituary","trailText":"Producer behind popular TV programmes on serious social issues, and documentaries with David Frost and Jonathan Dimbleby","byline":"Anthony Hayward","body":"<p>Michael Deakin, who has died aged 83 of a lung infection after suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, was an executive producer and editor of documentaries at Yorkshire Television in the 1970s. His work there made him responsible for some of ITV’s most powerful programmes on social issues.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1328782/index.html\" title=\"\">Johnny Go Home</a> (1975), which he made with the producer and director John Willis, was a tale of runaway children on the streets of London, highlighting a national scandal and shocking viewers. The idea for the documentary came to Deakin when he stepped out of an editing suite in Soho at 3am after working on an Alan Whicker programme and found young boys huddled in the doorway.</p> <p>Willis and Di Burgess, the researcher, followed Annie and Tommy, and the story of children surviving through theft and prostitution made uneasy viewing. An unnerving twist came during filming when the crew heard about the murder of a 19-year-old Scot called Billy who had been among those they filmed at a hostel.</p> <p>As a result, the documentary became a two-parter, with Willis and his crew following the police investigation that ended with three men serving life sentences for the killing. They also filmed the arrest of the hostel’s owner, Roger Gleaves, who called himself the Bishop of Medway and was subsequently jailed for sexual offences against young boys.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Johnny Go Home, about runaway children in London, was shown on either side of the News at Ten and had 10 million viewers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Deakin came up with the title Johnny Go Home, a variation on the classic television play Cathy Come Home, and the documentary was shown with dramatic impact either side of the News at Ten, attracting 10 million viewers and winning a Bafta award.</p> <p>When Deakin and Willis wrote a book about the documentary (Johnny Go Home, 1976), Gleaves failed in a criminal libel action against them.</p> <p>Willis – who, like others, saw Deakin as an encouraging “enabler” – subsequently had him as his executive producer on Goodbye Longfellow Road (1977), about poor housing conditions, The Case of Yolande McShane (1977), including police film of a woman trying to persuade her mother to kill herself, and The Secret Hospital (1979), on mentally ill patients at Rampton and a unit providing “the way out”.</p> <p>Deakin also oversaw the award-winning Kitty: Return to Auschwitz (1979), about a Birmingham hospital radiographer going back to the Nazi concentration camp she had survived, and some of Antony Thomas’s early documentaries, such as The Arab Experience (1975) and The Good, the Bad and the Indifferent: A Personal View of the Church of England (1976).</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/01/sir-david-frost\" title=\"\">David Frost</a>, Deakin was responsible for major interviews with the Shah of Iran (1979) and the Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin (1980), as well as the 13-part A Prime Minister on Prime Ministers (1977-78), with Harold Wilson analysing his predecessors.</p> <p>He was also executive producer of powerful political documentaries presented by Jonathan Dimbleby such as In Evidence: The Bomb (1980) and The Eagle and the Bear (1981), on US-Soviet relations.</p> <p>A reputation for making serious popular programmes led Deakin to join TV-am, ITV’s first breakfast franchise holder, with Frost – one of the “Famous Five” presenters, alongside Anna Ford, Angela Rippon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/michael-parkinson\" title=\"\">Michael Parkinson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jan/11/robert-kee-obituary\" title=\"\">Robert Kee</a> – and others, including Peter Jay as chair and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/15/broadcasting.comment\" title=\"\">Nick Elliott</a>. Deakin, who helped to secure the funding, was earmarked as director of features but became director of programmes when Elliott pulled out.</p> <p>TV-am went on air in 1983, but Jay’s famous “mission to explain” proved a grave miscalculation as it vied with the BBC’s less-serious breakfast show. Jay was forced to resign, Ford and Rippon were sacked, and the Aitken brothers, Jonathan and Timothy, took control, appointing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/greg-dyke\" title=\"\">Greg Dyke</a> editor-in-chief.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When TV-am’s ‘mission to explain’ did not succeed, Deakin wrily conceded that Roland Rat had saved the breakfast service</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/sep/09/guardianobituaries.maggiebrown\" title=\"\">Bruce Gyngell</a> as managing director and Mike Hollingsworth as programme controller, Deakin’s job was gradually eroded, so he resigned in 1984. He had enough of a sense of humour to concede that lighter items such as the puppet rodent Roland Rat had saved the breakfast service, and he continued his career as an independent producer.</p> <p>Michael was born in Oxford, to Margaret (nee Beatson-Bell) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jan/31/guardianobituaries2\" title=\"\">William Deakin</a>, a literary assistant to Winston Churchill, wartime SOE officer parachuted into Yugoslavia to join Josip Tito’s partisans and later first warden of St Antony’s College, Oxford. On leaving Bryanston school in Dorset, Michael studied English at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and, with a fellow student, founded the fine art publisher Editions Alecto in 1960. A Rake’s Progress (1963) featured early etchings by David Hockney.</p> <p>Deakin entered broadcasting in 1964 as a producer on BBC radio current affairs programmes. Four years later, he switched to the newly launched ITV company Yorkshire Television.</p> <p>From storylining Tom Grattan’s War (1968-70), a children’s series about a young evacuee, he produced documentaries such as The Struggle for China (1969), assessing the bloody and turbulent events there during the 20th century. Then, alongside John Fairley, the head of documentaries, he was Yorkshire Television’s editor of documentaries (1976-82).</p> <p>His friendship with Frost extended to co-authoring Frost’s Book of the World’s Worst Decisions (1982) and being best man at his wedding to Carina Fitzalan-Howard the following year.</p> <p>After leaving TV-am, Deakin switched to drama to work as executive producer on the TV miniseries Act of Betrayal (1988), with Elliott Gould as an IRA assassin, and Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less (1990), an adaptation of Jeffrey Archer’s novel.</p> <p>His current affairs background then informed TV movies such as Doomsday Gun (1994), starring Frank Langella as the designer of a “supergun” for Saddam Hussein, and Varian’s War (2001), with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/14/william-hurt-obituary\" title=\"\">William Hurt</a> as the American journalist helping Jewish artists and intellectuals to escape Nazi persecution in France during the second world war.</p> <p>In a different vein, Deakin was amused to find himself associated with a gold disc-winning album, Lost Horizons (2002), recorded by the electronic duo Lemon Jelly, featuring his nephew Fred Deakin, and Nick Franglen.

So there is some precedent in other sports and it’s certainly a conversation worth having.”</p> \n<p>On Sunday, the British cyclist and five-time Olympic champion Laura Kenny urged the sport to do more to prevent such incidents. “I think the crashes are getting worse and it’s because the speeds are getting higher, the positions are getting more extreme,” she said. </p> \n<p>“Maybe there should be screens because [Walls] should not have been able to go over the top and into the crowd – that’s pretty damn dangerous.”</p> \n<p>Track cycling at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics last year was also marred by a number of crashes, including a high-speed incident for the Australian team pursuit squad <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/03/auscycling-launches-investigation-into-broken-handlebar-that-caused-olympic-crash\">after a freak handle-bar snap</a>, and a collision between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/03/gb-dethroned-in-mens-olympic-team-pursuit-amid-danish-crash-controversy\">Danish and British teams</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e44a89f3ea31c2cd2dfe8b31d5d03c26f28f65b8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e44a89f3ea31c2cd2dfe8b31d5d03c26f28f65b8/0_107_3560_2136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Joe Truman (left) and Matthew Glaetzer of Australia (right) are left on the track after a crash in the Keirin on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Joe Truman (left) and Matthew Glaetzer of Australia (right) are left on the track after a crash in the Keirin on Saturday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Korf suggested the sport had to take more steps to protect riders. “Cycling is not too dissimilar to where Formula One was a decade, a decade and a half ago in terms of advancements in equipment, technology, safety, rider welfare,” he said. “There are steps being made, but there is a lot more ground that can get covered and surely will get covered in years to come.”</p> \n<p>Australia have endured a number of mishaps in Birmingham. The bid by Matthew Glaetzer, the two-times sprint world champion, to defend his Commonwealth Games keirin crown came undone on Saturday with a high-speed crash that left England’s Joe Truman in hospital. The Tasmanian Josh Duffy was involved in the incident on Sunday, but escaped with minor scrapes.</p> \n<p>AusCycling said: “Rider safety is at the heart of everything we do to coach and prepare our riders for competition. “While we are making continuous improvements, these are incredibly powerful athletes moving at high speeds and accidents will sometimes occur.”</p> \n<p>Despite these incidents Korf insisted morale in the team was high, helped by the seven gold medals already won by Australia in the velodrome. “The team is doing really well on and off the boards,” he said. “The vibe is generally very good.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/01/like-an-alien-obelisk-space-debris-found-in-snowy-mountains-paddock-believed-to-be-from-spacex-mission","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T14:07:15Z","webTitle":"‘Like an alien obelisk’: space debris found in Snowy Mountains paddock believed to be from SpaceX mission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/01/like-an-alien-obelisk-space-debris-found-in-snowy-mountains-paddock-believed-to-be-from-spacex-mission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/01/like-an-alien-obelisk-space-debris-found-in-snowy-mountains-paddock-believed-to-be-from-spacex-mission","fields":{"headline":"‘Like an alien obelisk’: space debris found in Snowy Mountains paddock believed to be from SpaceX mission","trailText":"Astrophysicist Brad Tucker says he often gets calls from people who think they’ve found space junk but the scorched metal found by two farmers is ‘very real’","byline":"Natasha May","body":"<p>The Australian Space Agency is investigating space debris found in farmland in the Snowy Mountains in southern NSW, after being notified by an astrophysicist who believes it to be from a SpaceX mission.</p> \n<p>Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at the Australian National University, says he often gets calls from people who believe they’ve found space junk – and they are normally easy to rule out.</p> \n<p>“This was different,” he said.</p> \n<p>Tucker received a call last Thursday from Mick Miners and Jock Wallace, two sheep farmers in the small town of Dalgety, who reported having found a scorched object.

In the past week the two candidates have behaved like cliche-spouting populists on the stump, rather than responsible members of a party still in office. The latest excursion of the frontrunner Liz Truss – supposedly the nation’s foreign secretary – into education policy defies belief.</p> <p>She proposes that Oxford and Cambridge be forced to interview for a place any high-flying student in the country with three A* grades at A-level.<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/07/31/liz-trusss-oxbridge-interview-plan-smacks-micromanagement-warns/\"> She says it is wrong</a> that “you should have to put yourself forward” for these places. She might have added, God forbid that you should have to go somewhere like Leeds University – a fate she escaped by shuttling off to Merton College, Oxford. Her proposal would involve some 13,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/aug/10/a-level-entries-across-uk-awarded-top-grades\">Oxbridge interviews</a> from England alone, swamping and distorting the admissions system (assuming candidates can afford to await their exam results, rather than taking up conditional offers elsewhere), and discouraging applicants with less than three A*.</p> <p>The idea puts a further premium on exam performance as an indicator of future success, a facile obsession that has little to do with education: Truss has long <a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2014/03/06/andrew-gimson-profiles-liz-truss-seen-by-some-as-a-future-tory-leader/\">been bowled over</a> by exam-centric Chinese schools. Worse, it cements the elitist assumption that Oxbridge should be further assisted to cream off the top achievers each year to attain ever greater heights of academic quality and status. It is hard to believe Truss would have made this proposal had she been a graduate of Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham or Durham.</p> <p>Universities do have a role in social engineering and should try to widen their social base. But that applies to them all. In some parts of Britain they are the most potent agency of the ailing levelling-up agenda. They bring creativity and talent, public money and graduate employment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/17/northern-powerhouse-northumbria-university-climbs-research-rankings\">to regions</a> from which they have been drained over the past half century. It is these places that need the brightest students if they are to compete nationally and internationally. The government should not seek to suck them dry of a few hundred A* students a year to further boost the egos of Oxford and Cambridge.</p> <p>British university policy is already a victim of chaotic dirigisme. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/29/the-guardian-view-on-arts-and-humanities-under-threat-on-campus\">prejudice against the humanities</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-recommends-cutting-unnecessary-bureaucracy-in-research-sector\">wasteful bureaucracy</a> of science research, the lockdown legacy of virtual versus in-person teaching, all suggest a sector of the economy woefully in need of rethinking.</p> <p>Oxford and Cambridge are focusing ever more of their efforts on <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/YearlySnapshotSu[…]mbed=y&amp;%3Adisplay_count=yes&amp;%3AshowTabs=y&amp;%3AshowVizHome=no\">p</a><a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/YearlySnapshotSummary?%3Aembed=y&amp;%3Adisplay_count=yes&amp;%3AshowTabs=y&amp;%3AshowVizHome=no\">ostgraduates and research</a>. It is possible that eventually they may even discontinue undergraduate teaching altogether. For the time being policy should not discourage bright school-leavers from attending their local university or other centres of excellence, let alone to promote Oxbridge elitism.</p> <p>Such vacuous and ill-thought-out ideas are spouting daily from the Truss camp – forcing the hapless Rishi Sunak into imitation. This is no way to choose a responsible prime minister in a time of economic distress.

Festival co-founder Peter Gabriel is here, of course, introducing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/29/osibisa-british-black-rock-band-fela-kuti-stevie-wonder\">Ghanaian-British rock band Osibisa</a>, praising their role in popularising African music here back in the 70s, and harking back to the first Womad in 1982, when their singer and dancer Angie Anderson was also with the dance company Ekome, who backed Gabriel on his performance of Biko. The Congolese soukous veteran Kanda Bongo Man, still as rousing a performer as ever, said that his UK debut at Womad in 1983 “took me from nowhere to the international market”. And those passionate exponents of Sufi devotional singing, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/omm/10bestcds/story/0,12102,1305211,00.html\">Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali</a>, paid tribute to their uncle Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, whose 1985 Womad debut also received praise from Gabriel in an earlier onstage discussion of the festival’s history.</p> <p>But the festival also continues to look to the future and trails still being blazed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/27/kora-player-sona-jobarteh-i-didnt-want-to-be-told-you-are-good-for-a-woman\">Sona Jobarteh</a>, the continent’s first female kora-playing star, demonstrates her exquisite playing of the West African harp alongside a band that includes her 15-year-old son Sidiki on balafon. From Europe come Taraf de Caliu, four of whom were once international stars with Romanian Gypsy band Taraf de Haïdouks. They returned to Clejani, Romania after the band split and – fronted by new singer Florin Murgoi, who said he was a farmer in the village until they signed him up – they’re clearly delighted to be back with their thrilling, virtuoso blend of rapid-fire duelling violins and cimbalom.

Cuba’s Cimafunk, AKA Erik Rodriguez, switches effortlessly between salsa and African American funk. He praises Prince and echoes James Brown during a high-energy set best suited to a late-night dance club. From the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/02/fantastic-negrito-the-drug-dealing-hustler-who-became-bernie-sanders-favourite-bluesman\">Fantastic Negrito</a> mixes acrobatic soulful vocals with influences ranging from Bill Withers to Lead Belly; gospel, funk, blues and New Orleans jazz, while telling family histories of slavery. South Korea’s ADG7 may be little known here, but they’re an immediate success, drawing a large and quickly charmed crowd thanks to their intriguing clash of styles: they have all the flash of K-pop, with exuberant dance routines from female singers in coloured hats, but their often thunderous songs are based on Korean folk music, including songs from North Korea. They are also great musicians, pairing impressive vocal harmonies with traditional instrumentation like the gayageum zither.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Womad’s past and present comes together during the Sunday night set by Brazilian music legend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/22/gilberto-gil-at-80-bolsonaro-has-a-retrograde-worldview-an-opposition-to-any-advance\">Gilberto Gil</a>, now 80 but still taking chances.

They chose the setlist “democratically”, he says, and it ranges from the opening Barato Total (which he wrote for Gal Costa in the 70s but never recorded), through to a slightly beefed-up Girl From Ipanema, the Beatles’ Get Back and the rousing reggae of Vamos Fugir. His singing is as powerful as ever and – as expected – his family are all impressive musicians. Gil is evidently over the moon to be singing in their company, making for a glorious, emotional set that stretches its arms across Womad’s esteemed four-decade history.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/01/rishi-sunak-tax-cutting-conversion-risks-overpromising","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T13:57:16Z","webTitle":"Shapeshifting Sunak’s tax-cutting conversion risks overpromising | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/rishi-sunak-tax-cutting-conversion-risks-overpromising","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/01/rishi-sunak-tax-cutting-conversion-risks-overpromising","fields":{"headline":"Shapeshifting Sunak’s tax-cutting conversion risks overpromising","trailText":"Former chancellor takes leaf out of rival Liz Truss’s book but his plans may be too good to be true","byline":"Larry Elliott","body":"<p>Harold Wilson’s quip that a week is a long time in politics has rarely been more true than in the case of Rishi Sunak.</p> <p>Seven days ago the former chancellor was marketing himself as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/25/truss-sunak-trade-blows-tv-debate-tory-leadership\">candidate of financial rectitude</a> as he pitched to be Britain’s next prime minister. Tax cuts, Sunak said, would have to wait until they could be afforded and inflation had been tamed.</p> <p>But it appears trying to come across as the modern reincarnation of William Gladstone has not gone down well with the Conservative party members who will choose who succeeds Boris Johnson. The bookies have Liz Truss – who wants <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/25/liz-truss-trussonomics-tax-cuts-interest-rates\">immediate tax cuts</a> – as the odds-on favourite to be the next occupant of 10 Downing Street.</p> <p>In an attempt to win over Tory members, Sunak last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/27/rishi-sunak-vat-energy-bills-screeching-u-turn-kwasi-kwarteng-liz-truss\">ditched his opposition</a> to cutting VAT on energy bills and said he would support a one-year reduction to help consumers cope with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/27/uk-energy-bills-forecast-to-hit-3850-pounds-russia-cuts-gas-supply-further-europe-pipeline\">cost of living crisis</a> that will worsen this winter.

It says something about the former chancellor’s political nous (or lack of it) that last week he was deriding tax cuts as a “sugar rush”, while this week he is pledging the biggest reduction in income tax since the late 1980s.</p> <p>Naturally, Team Sunak say there is a difference between Truss’s tax cuts (irresponsible and inflationary) and their own, which are prudent and affordable because they will be delivered in the fullness of time, when the economy is growing strongly and tax revenues are booming.</p> <p>There are three problems with this. First, there is no guarantee the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/22/uk-interest-rate-rises-weak-economy-output-private-sector-manufacturing-services\">economy will boom</a> during the next parliament. Nothing Sunak has said during his time as chancellor or in the leadership contest has suggested he has found the elixir for strong, sustainable growth. The same applies to Truss, incidentally.</p> <p>Second, even if the economy does perform better than expected, there will be upward pressures on spending that will limit the scope for tax cuts. There will be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/02/nhs-needs-10bn-annual-boost-to-tackle-backlog-and-covid-cost\">cost to tackling</a> the NHS waiting list backlog, meeting the challenge of an ageing population and delivering on the government’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/feb/02/levelling-up-funding-inequality-exposed-by-guardian-research\">commitment to levelling up</a>. Tory members may want tax cuts but the wider electorate may have different priorities.</p> <p>Finally, the former chancellor risks overpromising. Voters liked the sound of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/15/free-broadband-essential-uk-compete-john-mcdonnell-labour-policy-openreach\">free broadband Labour promised</a> at the 2019 general election but thought the pledge was born of desperation and too good to be true. The same could well be said of Sunak’s tax cuts.</p> <h2>Calls to break up HSBC likely to get louder</h2> <p>In one sense, the battle over the <a href=\"https://heguardian.com/business/2022/aug/01/hsbc-vows-to-restore-dividends-to-pre-covid-levels-amid-investor-pressure-banker-bonuses\">future of HSBC</a> is a classic demerger scrap. An investor with a sizeable stake in the business says the bank would be more profitable were it broken up; the management insists the opposite is the case.</p> <p>In HSBC’s case, it is about much more than that. It is about geopolitics and the difficulties that can befall global companies in an era of deglobalisation.</p> <p>HSBC, which is based in the UK but makes two-thirds of its profits in Asia, is getting it from both sides. Investor pressure is coming from the Chinese insurance group Ping An, which owns 9% of the bank’s shares. It says its concerns are purely commercial but there is suspicion that Ping An is acting as a proxy for Beijing in its attempt to exert influence over the bank.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the days when the Conservative party under David Cameron cosied up to China are over. Both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have adopted a hawkish stance to Beijing, not least over the political crackdown in Hong Kong, where HSBC was founded in the 1860s.</p> <p>These geopolitical tensions will persist no matter what happens to the bank’s profits, flat at £4.1bn in the latest quarter. HSBC’s management has sought to placate Ping An by pledging to restore the dividend to pre-pandemic levels as soon as possible, but calls for a breakup will become louder.</p> <h2>Could England win boost the economy?</h2> <p>Will England’s <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report\">victory in the Women’s Euro 2022 </a>final prompt a feelgood factor that will give the economy a much-needed boost?

What’s going on?","byline":"Ian Sample Science editor","body":"<p>If time feels tighter than ever of late, blame it on the revolution. On 29 June this year, Earth racked up an unusual record: its shortest day since the 1960s, when scientists began measuring the planet’s rotation with high-precision atomic clocks.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, Earth completes one full turn on its axis every 24 hours. That single spin marks out a day and drives the cycle of sunrise and sunset that has shaped patterns of life for billions of years. But the curtains fell early on 29 June, with midnight arriving 1.59 milliseconds sooner than expected.</p> <p>The past few years have seen a flurry of records fall, with shorter days being notched up ever more frequently. In 2020, the Earth turned out 28 of the shortest days in the past 50 years, with the shortest of those, on 19 July, shaving 1.47 milliseconds off the 86,400 seconds that make up 24 hours. The 29 June record came close to being broken again last month, when 26 July came in 1.5 milliseconds short.</p> <p>So is the world speeding up? Over the longer term – the geological timescales that compress the rise and fall of the dinosaurs into the blink of an eye – the Earth is actually spinning more slowly than it used to. Wind the clock back 1.4bn years and a day would pass in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/04/the-days-are-getting-longer-but-very-very-slowly\">less than 19 hours</a>. On average, then, Earth days are getting longer rather than shorter, by about one 74,000th of a second each year. The moon is mostly to blame for the effect: the gravitational tug slightly distorts the planet, producing tidal friction that steadily slows the Earth’s rotation.</p> <p>To keep clocks in line with the planet’s spin, the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations body, has taken to adding occasional leap seconds in June or December – most recently in 2016 – effectively stopping the clocks for a second so that the Earth can catch up. The first leap second was added in 1972. The next opportunity is in December 2022, although with Earth spinning so fast of late, it is unlikely to be needed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the Earth is slowing down over the longer term, the situation is messier on shorter timescales. Inside the Earth is a molten core; its surface is a mass of shifting continents, swelling oceans and vanishing glaciers. The entire planet is wrapped in a thick blanket of gases and it wobbles as it spins on its axis. All of these influence the Earth’s rotation, speeding it up or slowing it down, although the changes are essentially imperceptible.</p> <p>According to Nasa, stronger winds <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/oceans/el-nino\">in El Niño years</a> can <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/0210rotation.html#:~:text=During%20El%20Ni%C3%B1o%20years%2C%20for,(thousandth%20of%20a%20second).\">slow down the planet’s spin</a>, extending the day by a fraction of a millisecond. Earthquakes, on the other hand, can have the opposite effect. The 2004 earthquake that unleashed a tsunami in the Indian Ocean shifted enough rock to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/news041229-6\">shorten the length of the day</a> by nearly three microseconds.</p> <p>Anything that moves mass towards the centre of the Earth will speed up the planet’s rotation, much as a spinning ice skater speeds up when they pull in their arms. Geological activity that pushes mass outwards from the centre will have the opposite effect and slow down the spin.</p> <p>How all these different processes come together to affect the length of a day is a question scientists are still wrestling with. But if the trend for shorter days carries on for long, it could lead to calls for the first “negative leap second”. Instead of adding a second to clocks, civil time would skip a second to keep up with the faster-spinning planet. That in turn could have its own consequences, not least reigniting the debate over whether, after more than 5,000 years, defining time by the movement of the planet is an idea that has had its time.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/01/us-prison-officials-alabama-female-journalists-change-clothes-execution","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T13:47:33Z","webTitle":"Female journalist told skirt too short when reporting on Alabama execution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/us-prison-officials-alabama-female-journalists-change-clothes-execution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/us-prison-officials-alabama-female-journalists-change-clothes-execution","fields":{"headline":"Female journalist told skirt too short when reporting on Alabama execution","trailText":"One journalist reporting on the lethal injection was told her skirt was too short and another said she had a full-body inspection","byline":"Ed Pilkington in New York","body":"<p>Last Thursday night, the state of Alabama took three hours to find a vein in Joe Nathan James Jr through which officials could pump lethal injection drugs and execute him, a process that the department of corrections insisted was “nothing out of the ordinary”.</p> <p>Alabama appears to specialize in its extraordinary sense of the ordinary, particularly when it comes to the death penalty. It has now emerged that, during that execution, prison officials subjected female reporters who came as witnesses to the proceeding to a clothing inspection, attempting to bar one woman from the death chamber on grounds that her skirt was too short.</p> <p>Ivana Hrynkiw, a journalist for Alabama’s pre-eminent news outlet AL.com, recounted how she was pulled aside by a prison official and told that her skirt was too diminutive to meet regulations. “I tried to pull my skirt to my hips to make the skirt longer, but was told it was still not appropriate,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvanaSuzette/status/1552867043984265219/photo/1\">she recounted on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>The paradox that the state went to such lengths to uphold what it regards as propriety in clothing even as it prepared to kill a man appears to have been lost on the department of corrections. Officials also subjected an Associated Press reporter, Kim Chandler, to a full-body inspection, making her stand to have the length of her clothing checked. Chandler said that such an indignity had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StatehouseKim\">never happened to her before</a> in the many times she had covered executions since 2002.</p> <p>Hrynkiw was eventually allowed to enter the death chamber after she borrowed a pair of waterproof fisher’s waders from a photographer, attaching their suspenders under her shirt to keep them up. That was deemed appropriate attire when watching a judicial killing.</p> <p>But even then it didn’t stop. The reporter was informed that her open toe heels were a breach of regulation and she was forced to change into tennis shoes retrieved from her car.</p> <p>“I felt embarrassed to have my body and my clothes questioned in front of a room of people I mostly never met,” Hrynkiw said. “I sat down, tried to stop blushing, and did my work.”</p> <p>After all that, the reporter did her job, and so did Alabama. After three hours digging around for a vein, it found one, and went ahead with the execution.</p> <p>James Jr was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in the 1994 killing of 26-year-old Faith Hall. James Jr and Hall had briefly dated before she rejected him, authorities have said.</p> <p>Hall’s daughters wanted James Jr to spend the rest of his life in prison but pleaded for him to not be executed.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/01/england-white-ball-cricket-coach-matthew-mott-asks-patience","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T13:39:07Z","webTitle":"‘A different unit’: England white-ball cricket coach Mott asks for patience","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/england-white-ball-cricket-coach-matthew-mott-asks-patience","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/01/england-white-ball-cricket-coach-matthew-mott-asks-patience","fields":{"headline":"‘A different unit’: England white-ball cricket coach Mott asks for patience","trailText":"The England white-ball coach, Matthew Mott, has told the team’s fans not to live in the past and asked for “a little bit of patience and a bit of perspective”","byline":"Simon Burnton","body":"<p>The England white-ball coach, Matthew Mott, has told the team’s fans not to live in the past and asked for “a little bit of patience and a bit of perspective”.

In this new economy of pop stardom, a few savvy and well-timed videos can be worth far more than a million-dollar marketing campaign.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2ESxHKuSOk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y2ESxHKuSOk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Rosalía: Despechá – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>“If you want to be a star, if you want to go viral, you really rely on your fans’ labour and user-generated content to do that,” says Cat Zhang, an associate editor at Pitchfork. Zhang has written extensively on the <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/tiktok-is-turning-music-marketing-into-a-labyrinthian-game/\">effects of TikTok on the industry</a>, as well as the way that the artist/fan dynamic has become increasingly <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/features/article/discord-music-fandoms/\">reliant on fan labour</a> in recent years. “It’s not really just [about] you tweeting or making a video so much as relying on the reaction to it.”</p> <p>Zhang says she first noticed the “teaser” strategy being used by smaller indie-pop artists such as Ella Jane and Maude Latour, who will often share a snippet of a work in progress to gauge audience reaction. “Among developing singer-songwriters, it was a more common practice because they often didn’t have the budget to necessarily make a whole song first,” she says, “They would tease a snippet as proof of concept, and then if there was enough traction, they would try to build it out.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/06/im-hungry-i-want-to-dominate-jack-harlow-hip-hops-most-fancied-new-megastar\">‘I’m hungry. I want to dominate’: Jack Harlow, hip-hop’s most fancied new megastar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although Despechá may be the latest example of a song becoming a hit before its release, it’s not even the most significant this year. In April, Kentucky rapper Jack Harlow garnered his first ever solo US No 1 (and first UK Top 5 hit) after clips he posted using audio of his single First Class, which samples Fergie’s 2007 song Glamorous, went viral on TikTok. Before the song was released, the sound had been used more than 50,000 times; it has now featured in half a million videos and has remained in the Top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100 for more than three months.</p> <p>Shaylee Curnow – AKA Peach PRC – is an Australian TikTok star and singer signed to Republic Records. Her catchy, high-gloss pop songs (and candid, self-deprecating videos to camera) frequently go viral on the platform, where she has 1.9m followers.</p> <p>In January, she <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@peachprc/video/7051482602322054401?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;lang=en\">posted a clip</a> of her unreleased song God Is a Freak, unsure if its lyrics – “God is a bit of a freak / Why’s he watching me getting railed on the couch / Staying pure for a wedding? / He’s got fucked-up priorities” – would be too risque for her label. To her surprise, the snippet took off, inspiring users to <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/God-Is-A-Freak-7051479060601408257?lang=en\">share their experiences</a> of religious trauma.</p> <p>“I was just like, ‘This is such a silly song – there’s no way [the label are] gonna say: ‘Go for it.’ So I [put it out as] a cheeky little TikTok release,” she says. Naturally, the label loved the song’s popularity: on its official release a month later, the track became a radio and chart success in Australia and New Zealand.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e07I7io1myI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e07I7io1myI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Peach PRC: God Is a Freak – video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Since Curnow leaked God Is a Freak, it has become normal for artists to tease new tracks by sharing TikToks suggesting that someone in their team won’t let them release their new single until it garners a certain level of viral traction, as American star Halsey did in May.</p> <p>The strategy is often dismissed as contrived but Curnow says she understands the appeal regardless. “People love to feel like they’re a part of the process of the song being put out,” she says. “These higher-up big bad guys don’t really exist, but [fans] want to feel like they’re for the people and they’re on the side of the artist. They want to feel like they’re part of their music.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/30/tiktok-female-musicians-self-esteem-rebecca-taylor\">Why do female musicians have to fake it on TikTok? | Rebecca Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After minting a couple of genuine hits, teaser strategies have inevitably become an industry standard: the same day Rosalía properly released Despechá, TikTok announced a new “Pre-Release” feature that will allow artists to officially “leak” their own music. Soon, says Zhang, “it will cease to be novel or [will carry] too much pressure and then people will change tack. I don’t necessarily see it as a huge paradigm shift, but that’s only because I know that there’s going to be another thing added to the equation after this.”</p> <p>In many ways, it feels like the industry’s embrace of TikTok teasers is yet more evidence of how unsustainable its practices are: whenever a song finds a new route to vitality, labels invariably seek to replicate that route and, in the process, render it no longer valuable. The fact that such a high volume of music goes viral today compared to even two years ago means the currency is already being diluted.</p> <p>Despechá’s lightning speed and petrol-head lyrics almost feel emblematic of the era itself: “I’m going 180 because I’m a motorcycle girl,” Rosalía sings. “You get distracted, I overtake you on the right.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/01/david-trimble-funeral-politicians-unite-pay-tribute","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T12:58:13Z","webTitle":"David Trimble funeral unites politicians from across spectrum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/01/david-trimble-funeral-politicians-unite-pay-tribute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/01/david-trimble-funeral-politicians-unite-pay-tribute","fields":{"headline":"David Trimble funeral unites politicians from across spectrum","trailText":"Service for former first minister brings together Northern Irish, British and Irish leaders","byline":"Rory Carroll Ireland correspondent","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/26/lord-trimble-obituary\">David Trimble</a> faced bitter opposition from across the political spectrum during his life but his funeral has united British, Irish and Northern Irish leaders in paying tribute to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/26/legacy-endure-tributes-paid-david-trimble-northern-ireland\">accomplishments and sacrifice</a>.</p> <p>The service in Lisburn on Monday brought together the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and other political representatives from London, Dublin and Belfast to bid farewell to Northern Ireland’s inaugural first minister.</p> <p>It was a rare gathering and show of solidarity – and a truce in current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/13/a-bureaucratic-change-boris-johnson-defends-northern-ireland-protocol-bill\">political tensions</a> – to honour Lord Trimble, an architect of the 1998 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/01/uk-minister-says-northern-ireland-protocol-threatens-good-friday-agreement\">Good Friday agreement</a> and a former Ulster Unionist party (UUP) leader, who died last week at the age of 77.</p> <p>Ireland’s president, Michael D Higgins, and taoiseach, Micheál Martin, joined Northern Ireland’s party leaders at Harmony Hill Presbyterian church, a name both apt and ironic given Trimble’s torrid time as a peacemaker.</p> <p>Trimble shared the 1998 Nobel peace prize with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/03/john-hume-obituary\">John Hume</a>, the then leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP), but he was labelled a traitor by many fellow unionists and faced death threats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2012d1cd7b9e0f39ee6a832f300c345e710d3dab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2012d1cd7b9e0f39ee6a832f300c345e710d3dab/0_183_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Trimble’s funeral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mourners hear tributes to Lord Trimble’s ‘considerable strength of character’ at the service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ireland’s tricolour flew at half-mast over the Irish parliament in Dublin as a mark of respect for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/26/lord-trimble-obituary\">role in ending</a> the Troubles while striving to safeguard Northern Ireland’s place in the UK.</p> <p>The former British prime minister Tony Blair said Trimble had shown immense courage in leading unionists, despite deep misgivings, into a new era. “It is what defines leadership in the end,” he <a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/former-prime-minister-sir-tony-blair-remembers-lord-david-trimbles-tremendous-courage-ahead-of-funeral-41881601.html\">told the BBC</a>.</p> <p>Mourners heard personal stories of Trimble’s boyhood at Bangor grammar school in the 1960s, his career as a law professor at Queen’s University in Belfast and how he overcame shyness to become a transformational leader of the UUP from 1995 to 2005.</p> <p>The Rev Fiona Forbes said people had come to remember an academic, a Nobel laureate, a husband, a father and a grandfather. “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God,” she said.</p> <p>Charles McMullen, a former moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, told mourners: “Provenance shone its light on him.” The reward was a transformed political landscape that had allowed a generation to grow up in relative peace, he said.</p> <p>“History will be exceedingly kind to David, even if life brought many unrelenting pressures and demands.

I DJ’d house on Friday, and he played funk and disco on the Saturday. One night, Jez brought a rough copy of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lfTgmFYFXI\">What Can You Do for Me</a> on cassette. I played it and the place went mad, so we began working together.</p> <p>As with all Utah Saints tracks, the tune for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9Wqs4vjZM\">Something Good</a> was written before we decided on any samples. It’s generally easier to build tracks the other way around, but our back-to-front method meant any borrowings were used in a different context rather than taking someone else’s creativity, and making it the essence of our track.</p> <p>For Something Good we recycled a line from Kate Bush’s 1985 hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pllRW9wETzw\">Cloudbusting</a>. We are super honoured that we’re the only act she has officially cleared a sample for and we hope it’s because we created something new out of her singing. We used it in such a way that Something Good stood up as a song in its own right. We still see tweets now from people who hadn’t realised it was Kate Bush on the track. She is such an enigma, superstar and an all-round great person. We did send her a letter to say thank you, but I’m not sure if she ever saw it.</p> <p>The song was made on limited equipment – old Akai samplers and Atari computers – and saved on to floppy disks. It took more than two weeks of fine tuning to make it all work.</p> <p>We were buzzing when the track was used over the highlights of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/05/linford-christie-barcelona-olympics-1992\">’92 Barcelona Olympics</a> coverage by the BBC: you don’t forget moments like that. When we performed it on Top of the Pops, health and safety powered down my mixer during the recording – they were set up for a lead guitarist, not a lead DJ, and I had to work fast to make our performance look natural. Luckily, I was spending eight hours a day practising. It was one of six times the show had us on.</p> <p>After the first album we spent a lot of time touring, and doing remixes for lots of different acts, from Blondie and the Osmonds to Hawkwind. We were about to start recording another LP, but then got a call to do the <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/u2s-zooropa-10-things-you-didnt-know-666937/\">Zooropa</a> stadium shows with U2, so we went off and did that. And then a load more shows after that.</p> <p>That’s why the gap between our first and second albums was a long one. Not as long as the gap before our next one, though. We’re working on tracks now.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9Wqs4vjZM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xg9Wqs4vjZM?start=111&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=111\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Utah Saints video for Something Good</figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>Jez Willis, producer/DJ</strong></h2> <p>Tim and I had been DJing since school. He was way cooler, becoming a <a href=\"https://dmcdjchamps.com/\">DMC World DJ finalist</a> when he was 17. He’s still that good now. We always wanted to do music full-time, but never expected hits – we just tried to make interesting tunes that we thought were good. </p> <p>As a DJ, you constantly think about which tracks work together, and that helped when choosing samples. The Kate Bush vocal came straight off the CD. Hardware in 1992 was very basic, and getting all the elements to sync was tricky. We had to pitch-bend the first part of Kate’s vocal to keep it in time, which is why it goes “oo-oo-aye”.</p> <p>We threw the kitchen sink at Something Good. There was so much happening, and Guy Hatton, the ace studio engineer mixing it, managed to keep everything together.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/27/pete-tongs-favourite-tracks\">Pete Tong</a> was our A&amp;R man at the time, and we were lucky to have such a legend in our corner. He would always input something really helpful, and was confident in Something Good being a hit – in fact, the whole record company thought it was a No 1, which it would have been if it had come out earlier or later that year, based on how much it was selling [the single got to No 4].</p> <p>When it was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m97WlpsuU74\">rereleased in 2008</a> we had to rebuild everything on the original track from scratch, and then send it to Van She Tech, the remixers in Australia. We then finished it on a laptop in our Leeds studio. It still has the DIY elements, and when it became Radio 1’s most played track of that year, we were really honoured.

HSBC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/hsbc-staff-bonus-pool-profits-covid-bank\">paid 451 of its bankers €1m (£837,000)</a> or more last year, a 40% increase on the number of staff with such payouts in 2020.</p> <p>Meanwhile, shareholders are in line for an interim cash dividend of nine cents a share, although HSBC pledged to boost payouts and start paying dividends on a quarterly basis again from the start of 2023.</p> <p>The move, which pushed its stock up more than 7% on Monday, appears to be an attempt to appease investors after its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/hsbc-faces-pressure-to-split-after-push-from-one-of-its-largest-shareholders\">largest shareholder</a> – the Chinese insurer Ping An – revived calls to separate the bank’s profitable Asian business from the rest of the lender’s operations in April.</p> <p>Ping An is among those who have been disappointed at their returns on their investment, after HSBC cancelled the dividend during the first UK coronavirus lockdown and later reinstated it at only half the level paid out before the pandemic.</p> <p>However, the lender’s chief executive, Noel Quinn, used Monday’s earnings announcement to hit back at demands for a breakup, defending the bank’s strategy and stressing its success was dependent on maintaining its global network.</p> <p>Quinn told reporters that the bank had hired external lawyers and consultants to consider the costs and benefits of a split but ultimately determined: “Alternative structural options will not deliver increased value for shareholders.”</p> <p>He said: “Rather, they would have a material negative impact on value, and our current strategy is the fastest and safest way to get to the higher returns and dividends we all want to see … The primary factor is about disruption to, and potential loss of, the international synergies.” </p> <p>He said HSBC’s analysis showed that carving out a relatively small European bank in a single market could cost more than $2bn, “and even then, has a high risk of failure. So you can understand the risks of standing up separate entities for a franchise of our size … the cost and execution risks over a three-to-five-year period are material.”</p> <p>Quinn also rebuffed <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/hsbc-urged-appoint-shareholder-ping-an-its-board-2022-07-31/\">calls by the Hong Kong politician Christine Fong</a> for Ping An to take a seat on HSBC’s board.

However, some commentators said that while the move would be welcomed by many, there was a risk that some people would take out mortgages they were unable to afford.</p> <p>The Bank has removed a requirement that forced borrowers to be able to afford a three-percentage-point rise in interest rates before they could be approved for a home loan.</p> <p>This “stress test” was introduced in 2014, after the 2007-08 financial crisis, and was part of a package of measures designed to prevent a repeat of the reckless lending that some say was rife in the run-up to the crash.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2022/june/financial-policy-committee-confirms-withdrawal-of-mortgage-market-affordability-test\">The Bank has said</a> another rule that is staying in place – which limits most new mortgage lending to a maximum of 4.5 times a borrower’s income – as well as separate affordability criteria set by the Financial Conduct Authority, “ought to deliver the appropriate level of resilience to the UK financial system, but in a simpler, more predictable and more proportionate way”.</p> <p>The Bank has previously indicated that about 6% of mortgage borrowers – approximately 35,000 people – would have been able to secure a bigger home loan if the interest rate stress test had not been in place.</p> <p>Claire Flynn, a mortgages expert at the comparison website<strong> </strong>Money.co.uk, said given the cost of living crisis, the removal of the affordability test was likely to be viewed by many as good news.</p> <p>She added: “That’s because it could allow more people to get on the ladder as they can take out larger mortgages. However, borrowers will still need to meet the loan-to-income ratio, which could still prevent some from getting the mortgage they require to buy a home.</p> <p>“There is also a risk that with fewer restrictions, some buyers will take out loans that they are unable to afford.”</p> <p>Myron Jobson, a senior personal finance analyst at the website Interactive Investor, said unwinding the measure amid the cost of living crisis “could run the risk of people biting off more than they [can] chew financially to purchase a property”.</p> <p>Banks and building societies look at various aspects of people’s finances when deciding how big a mortgage they think someone can afford to take out, and traditionally the typical maximum for how much an individual can borrow is 4.5 times their annual income.

Kelly, after pausing in near-dread to ensure her goal was allowed, yanked off her top to whiz it around in victory, cheerfully revealing her white sports bra to 87,192 fans in the stadium and millions more watching the match worldwide. “This is a woman’s body – not for sex or show – just for the sheer joy of what she can do and the power and skill she has,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucymirandaward/status/1553816743671463936\">I wrote</a>.</p> <p>I wasn’t alone.

JD Sports has also spent “heavily” on external competition lawyers – likely to have cost millions of pounds – according to its annual report last month. The company had already taken a £55.6m writedown in 2021 after it realised the value of Footasylum was less than it had thought, and £7.4m in costs in 2020 directly related to the transaction.</p> <p>The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/19/jd-sports-buyout-rival-footasylum-bad-deal-shoppers-cma-watchdog\">major concerns from the start</a> that the takeover of Rochdale-headquartered Footasylum, which has 63 UK stores, would lessen competition. However, JD Sports, which runs 3,400 stores across the UK, North America and other markets, made a notable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/jd-sports-attacks-regulator-for-blocking-footasylum-merger-coronavirus\">challenge to the regulator’s authority</a> by successfully arguing in 2020 that the CMA had acted “irrationally” by not considering the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the market.</p> <p>Yet the CMA came back, and in September 2021 it again found that competition on price, quality, range and service levels on footwear and clothing could still be reduced if the takeover went ahead.</p> <p>JD Sports reacted furiously at every stage of the process. Its former chief executive Peter Cowgill argued that the deal would not lessen competition because more and more potential customers were looking online to buy trainers direct from brands such as Nike, Adidas and Puma, who supply to and compete with JD Sports and Footasylum.</p> <p>However, Cowgill resigned in May – 18 years after becoming chief executive of the company – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/jd-sports-boss-peter-cowgill-quits\">after a boardroom bust-up</a> related to the splitting of the roles of chairman and chief executive, both of which he held.</p> <p>His resignation came only months after JD and Footasylum were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/14/jd-sports-and-footasylum-fined-almost-5m-for-breaching-cma-order\">fined almost £5m</a> for sharing commercially sensitive information during the competition investigation. Cowgill and his counterpart at Footasylum, Barry Brown, were filmed secretly meeting in a car park during the CMA’s investigation. The CMA also said phone records were deleted.</p> <p>JD Sports attempted to take a more emollient tone on Monday, saying it had “cooperated with the CMA throughout the divestment process”, including checking that the new buyer was acceptable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kath Smith, the interim chief executive of JD Sports, said: “I would like to sincerely thank the teams at Aurelius and Footasylum who worked collaboratively with the CMA to agree this transaction.

The Hallé should know, having appeared <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/events/performers/e2e9da6e-de76-4a92-a9c7-347158d885df/performances\">at the Proms most years since the 1950s</a>. Under their longstanding music director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/01/mark-elder-conductor-portrait-artist\">Mark Elder</a>, this year’s programme was nonetheless all about orchestral atmospherics.</p> <p>At times, it worked. As Elder launched into the opening oh-so-mysterious pizzicati of Dukas’s The Sorcerer’s Apprentice and the lights went down, there was electric suspense that even the crackle of a steward’s walkie talkie couldn’t shatter. Every ping, shiver, slither and parp of the score’s bag of tricks was present and correct.

Elder played it cool and crystalline: woodwind solos were limpid, the brass sound gloriously copper-bottomed and the strings lush but never luxuriated. Every transition was taut, Elder entirely in control, until he released his grip, hands floating upwards, as the final bell chime dissipated.</p> <p>And then there was Puccini’s brutal one-acter Il Tabarro – a romantic tragedy played out against the industrial backdrop of the Seine – in only its second ever Proms outing. As the troubled couple Michele and Georgetta, Lucio Gallo and Natalya Romaniw were vocally well matched and dramatically compelling, both voices able to hold their own against Puccini’s big, colour-drenched orchestra. Adam Smith’s Luigi (Michele’s romantic rival) was at times underpowered, while Annunziata Vestri’s cartoonish Frugola seemed to have walked out of an entirely different performance.</p> <p>But the orchestra is the crux of this opera’s ambience. The brass provided a foundation full of grit and imaginative use was made of Royal Albert Hall’s huge spaces, with distant voices and solo instruments scattered around. The periodic interventions of two extraordinarily loud offstage boat horns were less successful. Puccini loved sound effects and these appear in his score – but they’re marked “distant”. This was definitely a case where less would have been more.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/01/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-12-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T11:01:21Z","webTitle":"Premier League 2022-23 preview No 12: Liverpool","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-12-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/01/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-12-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Premier League 2022-23 preview No 12: Liverpool","trailText":"Jürgen Klopp hopes his Premier League and Champions League runners-up could prosper without Sadio Mané","byline":"Andy Hunter","body":"<p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted position</strong> 2nd (NB: this is not necessarily Andy Hunter’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)</p> \n<p><strong>Last season’s position </strong>2nd</p> \n<p><strong>Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) </strong>5-2</p> \n<h2>Prospects</h2> \n<p>There is a touch of the unknown about Liverpool this season, unusually, with Jürgen Klopp starting a first full campaign at Anfield <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/22/sadio-mane-completes-bayern-munich-move-liverpool-35m-deal\">without Sadio Mané</a> and looking to a pool of young talent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/13/darwin-nunez-should-be-ideal-fit-for-liverpool-rampaging-bull\">led by Darwin Núñez</a> to compensate for the undeniable loss of the Senegal international.

He had been on Klopp’s radar for a while but it was seeing the Uruguay international up close, when scoring in both legs of Benfica’s Champions League quarter-final defeat to Liverpool last season, that convinced the manager to act fast and act big. “The power and the mix-up with technique, the desire, smart moves, the problems he caused us – we fell all in love in these two games,” said Klopp.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:39:18/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Liverpool\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:39:18/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>Serious disruption awaits with roughly half of Liverpool’s first team squad involved in the tournament.

All of which was forgiven and forgotten when he signed a new three-year deal in July that, at over £350,000-a-week, makes the 30-year-old the highest paid player in the club’s history. It is not simply Salah’s popularity and commercial appeal that justifies the outlay. The Egypt international has scored a phenomenal 156 goals in 254 appearances for Liverpool and keeps himself in condition to maintain that output throughout the course of his long-awaited contract.</p> \n<h2>Social climber</h2> \n<p>#SalahStays unsurprisingly proved one of the most popular hashtags on Liverpool’s social media channels this summer with the striker’s 52 million followers on Instagram embracing news of his contract extension. Two TikTok videos to announce the deal have had over 10m views in total. A more leftfield candidate in every sense is Calvin Harris. The superstar DJ got the party started on the Liverpool team bus during their homecoming parade in the city the day after the Champions League final.

She developed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/postnatal-depression\" title=\"\">postnatal depression</a>, and her GP referred her for counselling.</p> <p>“I suspected it was partly to do with not having dealt with my feelings around being adopted,” says Moruzzi. “Before I had the baby, I’d never really examined how I felt.” The feelings intensified when she had her daughter in 2015. “I became conscious that I was part of a lineage of women,” says Moruzzi, “and I didn’t know anything about them.”</p> <p>Moruzzi looked in vain for resources for adult adoptees, so set up <a href=\"https://howtobeadopted.com/\" title=\"\">How To Be Adopted</a>, a website offering a supportive community for adult adoptees, where posters share advice and experiences.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I became conscious that I was part of a lineage of women, and I didn’t know anything about them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Moruzzi also runs a monthly support group in north London. “It’s a place,” she says, “where you can share things without always having to say: ‘I love my family and I’m happy’, or explain why you might be curious to meet someone who looks like you, or find out more about your grandmothers.”</p> <p>“Claire has worked selflessly to support hundreds of adoptees,” says fellow volunteer Gilli Bruce. “I joined her a couple of years ago, adding some small contributions, but Claire has done all the donkey work and gone unrecognised for too long.”</p> <p>Adult adoptees, says Moruzzi, often “struggle with relationships, friendships and reunions. People reach out to their birth relatives and get cold-shouldered and ghosted.” Adult adoptees may struggle with addiction, people pleasing or identity. When they talk about being adopted to others, the questioning can be insensitive: “People say: ‘Why are you bothering? You’ve got your family. Why do you need to dig up the past?’.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b92c4905e2757f41ed8763464b2f911729d406b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b92c4905e2757f41ed8763464b2f911729d406b/0_1474_3024_2268/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claire Moruzzi with husband Dan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire Moruzzi enjoying her treat with husband Dan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Claire Moruzzi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now that ancestry tests are so popular, Moruzzi finds this bewildering. Adoptees “have to pretend biology doesn’t matter to us. Other people can go on Ancestry.com and do their family tree. Why is it one rule for us and another rule for others?”</p> <p>When she met her biological relatives in her 20s, it was a positive experience, but Moruzzi thinks this may have been in part because “I was in the fog. I was desperate to be accepted and be considerate about existing dynamics.” This, she says, is common. “A lot of us overmanage and overthink this stage. We write letters saying, ‘I don’t want to bother you’, when we haven’t done anything wrong.”</p> <p>Another common issue is medical records. Most adoptees do not know their medical history. “We live in a world that isn’t the most friendly to adopted people,” says Moruzzi. “A GP will ask if you have a family history of a certain disease, and you have to explain that you don’t know. All of that info has been legally severed from you and your children.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We write letters saying, ‘I don’t want to bother you’, when we haven’t done anything wrong</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To make matters worse, all <a href=\"https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/adoption.html\" title=\"\">therapists providing adoption-related counselling to adopted people</a> – even adults – must be Ofsted-registered. This arcane regulation makes it difficult for adult adoptees to find help. “Not everyone can be registered,” Moruzzi says. “Counsellors often have to turn people away.” The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adoption-support-fund-asf\" title=\"\">Adoption Support Fund</a> pays for therapy for adults up to 25, but after that “it drops off a cliff.

There are people out there who may wait decades before they talk.”</p> <p>When it comes to her treat, Moruzzi tells me she has never been for a Michelin-starred meal, so <a href=\"https://galvinrestaurants.com/restaurant/galvin-la-chapelle-the-city-michelin-star/\" title=\"\">Galvin La Chapelle</a> in the City of London invites her and her husband Dan for a seven-course tasting menu. “It’s the service,” Moruzzi enthuses. “You can really tell the difference from a normal restaurant.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Really the night was as much a treat for Dan. “I couldn’t do any of it without him,” she says. “Both emotionally and practically.

A film about a woefully organised festival that spiralled out of control with alarming ferocity, it was the sort of thing you had to watch through the cracks in your fingers. But something tells me that Fyre festival is going to be superseded, because Netflix is about to release a series about Woodstock 99.</p> <p>Trainwreck: Woodstock ’99, as it is aptly titled, is a three-part, chronologically told series about one of the most appallingly assembled music festivals in history. Held to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the original Woodstock, which has come to be seen as a benign force of positivity, Woodstock 99 became renowned for the consequences of its spectacularly bad decision-making. The original Woodstock? Held on a dairy farm. This one? An abandoned military base. The original Woodstock had free food kitchens. This one sold plastic water bottles at $4 a pop. The original Woodstock’s lineup included Ravi Shankar and Joan Baez. This one was a celebration of mindlessly aggressive nu-metal. No wonder it ended in flames.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It was almost like a perfect experiment,” says Tim Wardle, the show’s executive producer, of the conditions that led to all the chaos. “You could almost look at it as an inadvertent psychological experiment.” What’s so incredible is the speed at which all the contributing factors – the heat, the dehydration, the violence, the drugs – went berserk. At the start of day one, we see the crowd catcalling a rattled Sheryl Crow; by the end of day three, everything is on fire and the police are attacking everyone with sticks.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm5uUzbUwR4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Tm5uUzbUwR4?start=1&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I speak to Wardle and the show’s producer Cassie Thornton a day after I have hammered through all three episodes in one sitting, and the mayhem is still ringing in my ears. This isn’t necessarily how the pair would like you to enjoy the show. “We watched all the episodes together when we were cutting it, and it’s almost too intense,” says Wardle. “It builds and builds, and you think: ‘Well, it can’t build any more,’ and then it builds again. And then something <em>else</em> happens and it builds again. On a technical level, it’s really interesting in terms of story construction. Just how long can you take without a release?”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/12/how-fyre-festival-went-up-in-flames-bella-hadid-ja-rule\">‘Closer to The Hunger Games than Coachella’: why Fyre festival went up in flames</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One thing the show does well is put the festival in historical context. Post-Columbine and pre-9/11, Woodstock 99 took place when US culture was riddled with examples that appeared to celebrate explosive male entitlement. Fight Club (about men who bond through violence) came out in 1999. American Beauty (about Kevin Spacey essentially being cucked to death) was released in 1999. The biggest band of the time were Limp Bizkit, a toddler tantrum of a project that took Rage Against the Machine’s political fury and evaporated it down to the pointless slogan “break stuff”.</p> <p>The festival also took place in the infancy of the internet, Wardle points out. “You don’t have people with cameraphones, and there are very few with cellphones. There isn’t the crazy amount of footage you’d have if the festival took place today. But it was also being covered by every rock photographer on the planet. And there were loads of different outlets filming it as well.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5308fad4eb023ed6ba92a413fc963e23e738908\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5308fad4eb023ed6ba92a413fc963e23e738908/0_0_2048_1494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muddy hell … luckily, brown was in fashion that season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muddy hell … luckily, brown was in fashion that season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: New York Daily News/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This means that, when things do start to go south, we get to see it from most angles. We watch MTV hosts grow more and more spooked as angry attendees start pelting them with missiles. We see performers look out at the seething crowd with a mixture of awe and horror. And thanks to the Woodstock 99 pay-per-view channel, which was just as intent on filming frat boys gurning at breasts as it was showing music, we see the speed at which mob mentality envelops the crowd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/12/flashback-woodstock-1999-moby\">Flashback: 23 July 1999</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That really is something to behold. A kind of collective frenzy takes hold from the middle of the second day, and the show demonstrates how dangerous a large group of people can be when they start acting as one. When things get really dark – an attendee steals a van and drives it through the middle of the rave tent during Fatboy Slim’s DJ set, or the crowd start tearing down the sound tower – it is genuinely terrifying. There is blood. There are sexual assaults. It is carnage. Forget Fyre festival; the closest equivalent I can think of is Four Hours at the Capitol, the recent anxiety-inducing documentary about the 6 January insurrection.</p> <p>“You can definitely see, certainly visually, parallels between the two,” says Wardle. “And definitely it’s a predominantly – almost exclusively – white, male crowd that’s reacting in this way. But with the more recent situation, it’s been about the breakdown of the norms of political discourse. Back then, it was more or less a Lord of the Flies thing. There were physical conditions that contributed to this. Being deprived of access to water, shade, food and being ripped off. But, you know, human behaviour goes to dark places.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a910c17b4dd8711d8384e8ce199be5001b014fad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a910c17b4dd8711d8384e8ce199be5001b014fad/0_0_2882_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiddling about while Rome burns … Woodstock 99.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiddling about while Rome burns … Woodstock 99.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There isn’t a single moment in Trainwreck that will transcend everything else, in the way that Fyre festival had that poor organiser who was prepared to perform oral sex on a stranger for bottled water. This is purely because so many bad decisions were made with such frequency that it’s hard for anything to stand out. But the final performance of the festival comes close. On the Sunday night, Red Hot Chili Peppers performed to a crowd at the absolute end of their tether. The audience were exhausted, dehydrated, on drugs and – thanks to the festival’s insufficient sanitation plan – had spent much of the previous 48 hours splashing around in pools of human effluent.</p> <p>Towards the end of the set, the Woodstock organisers – in a truly idiotic attempt to revisit the spirit of 1969 – handed out thousands of lit candles, for a planned vigil against gun violence. Inevitably, the furious crowd decided it would be better to use it for the purposes of arson. This collided with the Chili Peppers’ attempt to revisit the spirit of 69 by performing Jimi Hendrix’s Fire. You couldn’t write a more perfectly sequenced disaster.</p> <p>Incredibly the festival’s two main organisers, John Scher and Michael Lang, both agreed to extensive interviews in the series. They don’t acquit themselves particularly well – Scher is keen to blame anyone but himself for the debacle, while Lang is slippery and evasive – which makes you wonder why they agreed to take part at all. “On one level they know it went awry, but they also don’t think it was a total disaster,” says Wardle. “And they’re keen to have a say in their legacy. They’d rather they said something than just have other people shape the story.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82a6a5715444b72a0ab46826fb1565aa27c15fbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82a6a5715444b72a0ab46826fb1565aa27c15fbd/0_133_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breaking bad … Limp Bizkit fans storm the stage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breaking bad … Limp Bizkit fans storm the stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Micelotta Archive/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“There were some aspects the promoters felt were incredibly positive, and they stand by that,” adds Thornton. “Especially when something is in chaos, if you feel like there are actually positive elements, you want to get out there and share those with the world.” The same can be said for the performers who agreed to take part. Korn’s Jonathan Davis is more than happy to discuss the way he controlled the crowd’s aggression on the first night. Meanwhile, Limp Bizkit’s Fred Durst – who whipped the audience into a state of total uncontrolled violence, crowdsurfed on plywood that rioters had torn off then whined “It wasn’t our fault” as he left the stage – is conspicuous by his absence. “We did have some early conversations with Durst,” says Wardle. “He was very keen. But then … I don’t know if it’s his management team, or whatever. He’s sort of tried to reinvent himself recently. But he decided he didn’t want to take part.”</p> <p>“I think Jonathan Davis is a very intelligent, nuanced person,” says Thornton. “And he really wanted to come from the perspective of: ‘This was amazing in certain ways, and not so great for many attendees in other ways.’ He felt very open speaking about his 360-degree experience.” </p> <p>The catastrophic failure of Woodstock 99, not to mention the recent death of Michael Lang, seems to have killed the spirit of Woodstock for ever. But even though this was an unmitigated disaster, it’s important to remember that the original wasn’t that much better. There was a point in 1969 when, fed up with being overcharged for hotdogs, attendees torched some concession stands. And as Wardle points out, “There were sexual assaults and rapes at the original Woodstock as well. History is creating this mythology around the original Woodstock. The original Woodstock never really existed, you know?”</p> <p><em>Trainwreck: Woodstock ’99 is on Netflix from </em><em> </em><em>3 Augus</em><em>t.</em></p> <p>• This article was amended on 1 August 2022 because after publication, the name of the documentary was changed from Clusterf**k: Woodstock ’99, to Trainwreck: Woodstock ’99.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/01/christian-eriksen-manchester-united-managers-before-joining","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T11:00:21Z","webTitle":"Christian Eriksen spoke to Manchester United managers before joining","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/christian-eriksen-manchester-united-managers-before-joining","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/01/christian-eriksen-manchester-united-managers-before-joining","fields":{"headline":"Christian Eriksen spoke to Manchester United managers before joining","trailText":"Christian Eriksen has said he talked to past Manchester United managers about a possible transfer while at Spurs","byline":"Jamie Jackson","body":"<p>Christian Eriksen has revealed he spoke to every Manchester United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson about joining the club before signing for Erik ten Hag.</p> <p>The Dane, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/15/christian-eriksen-completes-manchester-united-move\">arrived as a free transfer last month</a>, made his full debut on Sunday in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/manchester-united-rayo-vallecano-friendly-match-report\">1-1 draw with Rayo Vallecano</a> in United’s sixth and final pre-season match.

wake of Black Lives Matter protests.</p> <p>From Monday the two-metre-tall portrait of Lt Gen Picton is back on display in the Welsh capital – but in a very different context.</p> <p>After months of

<p>Fadhili Maghiya, the chief executive of the SSAP, said it was important that Picton was not hidden away but present so that the story could be spoken about. “That feels crucial,” he said. “There might be misconceptions that we are seeking to rewrite history with this project. However, that is far from the truth. Reframing Picton aims to rewrite our future by challenging the way we engage with history.”</p> <p>The first room the visitor enters is full of brightness – and horror. It is an immersive work called Spirited, created by <em>Laku Neg</em> (Black Yard in Haitian Kwéyòl), a group of four UK artists, three of whom are of Trinidadian heritage. The visitor winds their way through bamboo frames decorated with twisted paper to learn – and feel – the story of Luisa and two other girls, Thisbe and Present, who were victims of Picton’s brutal regime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It does not shy away from the terrible way Luisa, after being accused of theft, was tortured, hung from a scaffold by her wrist for almost an hour, her entire weight being supported on an upturned wooden peg.</p> <p>Among the many striking elements is a cabinet full of objects from the museum’s collection that tell stories of slavery, repression and colonisation, from sugar cutters to a case of hummingbirds collected from Trinidad.</p> <p>In the second room, The Wound is a Portal is the creation of <a href=\"https://gesiye.com/about\">Gesiye</a>, a multidisciplinary artist of Nigerian heritage from Trinidad and Tobago, whose response to the Picton portrait includes tattoos, performance, drawings, film and documentary work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74b95b399297995473bb66278f6b2e2450a31cc3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74b95b399297995473bb66278f6b2e2450a31cc3/0_123_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of the hedger and ditcher William Lloyd now hangs where Picton’s portrait used to be\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A portrait of the hedger and ditcher William Lloyd now hangs where Picton’s portrait used to be.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as launching the Reframing Picton exhibition, the museum is at the start of a 10-year project “decolonising” its whole collection by re-examining every item, from its stuffed animals to many pictures.</p> <p>When the Picton exhibition ends in a year’s time, the two newly commissioned pieces will form part of Wales’ national collection – but what happens next to the Picton portrait is still up for debate.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the spot where the portrait used to hang is a picture of a more down-to-earth and less controversial Welsh figure, the hedger and ditcher William Lloyd, by Albert Houthuesen.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/01/us-cities-risk-middle-eastern-temperatures-by-2100-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T11:00:21Z","webTitle":"Hotter than Dubai: US cities at risk of Middle Eastern temperatures by 2100","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/01/us-cities-risk-middle-eastern-temperatures-by-2100-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/01/us-cities-risk-middle-eastern-temperatures-by-2100-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Hotter than Dubai: US cities at risk of Middle Eastern temperatures by 2100","trailText":"Unchecked global heating will bring once unthinkable heat extremes, with 16 US cities to rival summer highs seen in Middle East","byline":"Oliver Milmanwith graphics by Andrew Witherspoon","body":"<p>The climate crisis risks pushing many Americans into entirely new climatic realities, with a new analysis finding there are 16 US cities at risk of having summer temperatures on a par with locations in the Middle East by the end of the century.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/climate-crisis-emergency-rebecca-solnit-terry-tempest-williams\">Humanity can’t equivocate any longer.

Back in 2008, when he became Russia’s president, he promised modernisation and liberalisation, and frequently spoke of his love for blogging and gadgets. He even visited Silicon Valley and received a new iPhone 4 from Steve Jobs.</p> <p>Now, he is an enthusiastic participant in the macho posturing and genocidal rhetoric that have become the main currency of political discourse in wartime Moscow.</p> <p>“I’m often asked why my Telegram posts are so harsh,” wrote Medvedev recently. “Well, I’ll answer: I hate them. They are bastards and degenerates. They want us, Russia, to die. And while I’m still alive, I will do everything to make them disappear.” He did not specify whether the “they” in question referred to Ukrainians, western politicians, or both.</p> <p>Medvedev’s physical transformation is as extraordinary as his ideological shift: a decade ago he was boyish, nerdy and seemed almost charmingly awkward wearing a suit and conducting the business of state. Now he looks jaded and puffy-faced, his eyes glazed over as he launches tirades against the west.</p> <p>Medvedev’s rebooted persona is an apparent attempt to retain political relevance in a climate that has darkened significantly in the decade since he left the presidency.</p> <p>“He’s trying to save himself from political oblivion by out-Heroding Herod, and consequently posturing as a candidate in a Kremlin Apprentice show,” said Ekaterina Schulmann, a Russian political scientist at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin.</p> <p>Maria Pevchikh, an associate of the imprisoned Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, interpreted Medvedev’s shift in more personal terms: “When you feel you are a pointless and pathetic person, like Dmitry Medvedev, you try to reinvent yourself from time to time. He could have shaved his head, or gone to the gym … but instead he decided to reinvent himself as a hawk,” she said, in a video discussion devoted to Medvedev’s strange behaviour in May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f79f568a67e53b87d5cc3b62fb663c17d4667c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f79f568a67e53b87d5cc3b62fb663c17d4667c2/0_234_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian matryoshka dolls featuring presidents\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traditional Russian matryoshka dolls on sale near Red Square in Moscow after Medvedev (left) took over from Vladimir Putin as president in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Sinyakov/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Medvedev’s reincarnation has largely been treated as cringeworthy, it is also symbolic of the dashed hopes of a decade ago, when some people believed the system constructed under Vladimir Putin might be capable of carrying out some kind of liberalisation.</p> <p>In 2008 Putin stepped aside, because the constitution at that point only allowed two four-year terms. He moved out of the Kremlin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/08/russia1\">to become prime minister</a>, and personally chose Medvedev, with whom he had worked since 2000, as his successor.</p> <p>“Someone with ideas would probably have got rid of Putin pretty quickly, and Putin didn’t want to risk that. Medvedev fit the bill as a dependent person. He tried to fit in with consensus, just as he is trying to fit in now,” said Gleb Pavlovsky, who spent more than a decade as a Kremlin adviser.</p> <p>But although Medvedev was clearly subordinate to Putin, he cut a very different figure to the former KGB man. He talked of his love for rock music and excitedly spoke about the possibilities of the internet, actively tweeting and blogging. Putin, in contrast, does not know how to use the internet. Medvedev also bemoaned the lack of judicial independence in Russia and made several sweeping statements that suggested he backed real reform.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92b89d51b7a683cb1f4f79b1b682c7da14426b18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92b89d51b7a683cb1f4f79b1b682c7da14426b18/0_164_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Jobs shows Medvedev an iPhone 4\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple’s Steve Jobs shows Medvedev an iPhone 4 during the then Russian president’s visit to Silicon Valley in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RIA Novosti/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It was clear that he really, seriously liked the liberal part of the country, and it wasn’t just a political strategy; he really wanted to be the president of a normal, civilised country,” said Natalia Sindeyeva, the founder of TV Rain, Russia’s main independent television channel, which began broadcasting during Medvedev’s presidency and received his backing when he <a href=\"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/11081\">visited the studio</a> in 2011.</p> <p>Russian liberals were divided on whether Medvedev had a chance of becoming a real politician with his own agenda. “It may turn out that he’s no better than Putin. But if we do nothing, we’ll just end up with Putin anyway,” said the veteran human rights activist Lyudmila Alexeyeva at the time.</p> <p>In time, Medvedev also won a constituency among part of the Kremlin elite, who hoped they could ensure him a second presidential term in which he would slowly reduce the influence of the hardline former KGB agents in government.</p> <p>Medvedev became fixated on the idea of a second term, those who knew him say. On occasion he even clashed with Putin in public, notably when Medvedev authorised a Russian abstention on a UN vote over intervention in Libya.</p> <p>He flirted with the idea of setting up a new political party, and many around Medvedev, including Vladislav Surkov, one of the most important Kremlin advisers, urged him to push for a second term.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33fb93542fbca957f358706c0123f9b4984fd9b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33fb93542fbca957f358706c0123f9b4984fd9b9/113_288_1820_2274/800.jpg\" alt=\"Medvedev and Putin\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medvedev and Putin walk at the official president’s residence in Zavidovo, on 24 September 2011, the day Putin declared he was ready to return to the Russian presidency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Karpukhin/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Of course, there was huge hope and there was a feeling of political thaw, and the thought that if he went for a second term we would become more open to the world,” said Sindeeva.</p> <p>But when Putin summoned Medvedev to a fishing trip in summer 2011 and told his protege he would be returning to the presidency, Medvedev meekly accepted it.</p> <p>“When it came down to it, Medvedev just wasn’t able to take the risk. He wasn’t up to it,” said Pavlovsky. As part of the deal, Medvedev asked that he should remain prime minister, and seems to have genuinely hoped he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/24/purin-proposed-russian-president-medvedev\">become president again</a> after four years.</p> <p>But Putin had other ideas, sidelining many of Medvedev’s associates and giving the new prime minister the poisoned chalice of running the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, essentially acting as a lightning rod for criticism while Putin played the “good tsar”, above the political fray.</p> <p>“The paradox was that exactly after Medvedev did what Putin wanted, Putin stopped trusting him, and that turned Medvedev’s life into misery,” said Pavlovsky.</p> <p>In Medvedev’s subsequent public appearances, he already looked a broken man. He was frequently caught on camera napping at official events, including at the opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_GF9g\">video investigation</a> by Navalny linked a network of palaces and vineyards to Medvedev. He denied the allegations, but there followed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/30/dmitry-medvedev-whipping-boy-russia-discontented-protests\">wave of street protests</a> from those who felt Medvedev had turned out to be just as venal as others in the Russian elite.</p> <p>As time went on, rumours swirled in Moscow political circles about Medvedev’s increasing alcohol consumption. In 2020, Putin told him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/15/putin-calls-for-constitution-changes-that-would-weaken-successor\">resign as prime minister</a> but gave him a token job as deputy chair of the security council.</p> <p>“There’s a lot of things going on inside his head, of course, but I think a big part of his current behaviour is a sense of personal anger and resentment at Russian liberals, who in the end did not accept him,” said one source who knows Medvedev.</p> <p>In the decade after Medvedev left the presidency, hopes for any kind of genuine liberalisation in Russia faded. In 2014, Putin decided on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/putin-confirms-annexation-crimea-ukrainian-soldier-casualty\">annexation of Crimea</a>, and since then the system has only grown more authoritarian.</p> <p>TV Rain, the television station promoted by Medvedev, was taken off air in 2014. In 2021 it was branded a “foreign agent” and its online output was effectively outlawed soon after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It recently started broadcasting again from outside Russia.</p> <p>Twitter, once so beloved by Medvedev, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-completely-blocks-access-to-facebook-and-twitter\">banned in Russia</a> earlier this year. And now, instead of talking about copying innovative economic ideas from the US, Medvedev talks about nuclear war.</p> <p>According to Pavlovsky, the increasing authoritarianism of the Putin regime, and even the invasion of Ukraine, can be traced back to the failed attempts to manage a transition.</p> <p>“Medvedev lost it a bit when he wasn’t able to keep the presidency, and I think Putin lost it a bit too when he realised there was no way to make a transition of power work. The system had no mechanisms to do it … and it’s partly because of that failure of transition that we have ended up where we are today.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/01/six-queensland-police-officers-accused-of-domestic-violence-within-two-weeks-inquiry-told","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T10:44:21Z","webTitle":"Six Queensland police officers accused of domestic violence within two weeks, inquiry told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/01/six-queensland-police-officers-accused-of-domestic-violence-within-two-weeks-inquiry-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/01/six-queensland-police-officers-accused-of-domestic-violence-within-two-weeks-inquiry-told","fields":{"headline":"Six Queensland police officers accused of domestic violence within two weeks, inquiry told","trailText":"Crime and Corruption Commission says one case involved allegations of strangulation and rape","byline":"Eden Gillespie","body":"<p>Queensland’s Crime and Corruption Commission received six domestic violence-related complaints about police officers within two weeks of allowing such matters to be treated as corruption instead of misconduct, an inquiry has been told.</p> <p>One officer had allegations of strangulation and rape made against them, while another allegedly had access to child exploitation material, the commission of inquiry into Queensland police responses to domestic violence heard Monday.</p> <p>Elizabeth Foulger, executive director of Integrity Services at the CCC, told the inquiry that these two matters have been referred back to Queensland police to deal with, subject to a public interest review.</p> <p>The inquiry heard that the CCC received the six complaints in a two-week period in June and two were classified as alleged corrupt conduct and four were classified as alleged misconduct.</p> <p>The CCC reviewed its policies in June to classify domestic violence by police officers involving a serious criminal offence – such as rape, strangulation, assault and stalking – as corruption.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/31/reprehensible-facebook-posts-emerge-as-qld-police-boss-lauds-excellent-domestic-violence-response\">‘Reprehensible’ Facebook posts emerge as Qld police boss lauds ‘excellent’ domestic violence response</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Previously, these offences were only classified as corrupt conduct if an officer committed them while they were on duty, Foulger said.</p> <p>Foulger told the inquiry it had been an “error” not to consider domestic violence perpetrated by police officers as corruption when the body reviewed its policies for police last September.</p> <p>Her submission to the inquiry said such behaviour demonstrates a disregard for public safety and the laws police are obliged to uphold, as well as an inability to impartially investigate domestic violence matters.</p> <p>Commissioner Deborah Richards also asked police about “disturbing” comments about domestic violence that were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/31/reprehensible-facebook-posts-emerge-as-qld-police-boss-lauds-excellent-domestic-violence-response\">revealed by Guardian Australia </a>on Sunday. </p> <p>The Queensland Police Service (QPS) is investigating the social media posts, which were made on a private Facebook group for law enforcement personnel. </p> <p>The posts belittled domestic violence victims and implied officers purposefully avoid responding to such incidents. </p> <p>Sen Sgt David Nixon, from QPS’s ethical standards command, told the inquiry that the force’s north Brisbane district was investigating the posts.</p> <p>A QPS spokesperson said “the identification and location of the member will form part of the investigation”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/29/queensland-health-to-review-medical-costs-for-sexual-assault-victims-by-end-of-year\">Queensland Health to review medical costs for sexual assault victims by end of year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The inquiry also heard that 70% of the domestic and family violence complaints about QPS members since 2017 resulted in no further action by the ethical standards command. </p> <p>Data shown to the inquiry indicated a similar proportion of reports for all alleged offences resulted in no further action.</p> <p>“A number of circumstances can lead to no further action,” Nixon said.</p> <p>“That could be … the officer has been exonerated of any involvement.

Keeping our gut in good health matters more than we may think","byline":"Susie Mesure","body":"<p>The British stiff upper lip has a lot to answer for, not least our reluctance to talk about intimate bodily functions without feeling squeamish. Take gut health, a term that covers how well our stomach and intestines are working. Increasingly, experts believe there are important health benefits to be gained from talking openly about how well our guts are, well, performing. Everyone needs to stop worrying about divulging “too much information”.</p> <p>Gut health matters because research indicates it can affect many of our body’s systems and functions, from our metabolism to our mental health, to our digestive system.</p> <p>The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of trillions of micro-organisms (mainly bacteria) that live in the digestive tract, mainly the large intestine. These bacteria are thought to play a role in regulating the immune system and protecting against disease. The microbiome may influence digestive problems including bloating, constipation and gas, as well as other conditions, from fatigue to anxiety and depression. There is now evidence that chronic conditions such as Parkinson’s and dementia can be related to changes in the nature of gut microbes.</p> <p>The good news is that your gut is great at telling you if it’s not working well; the bad news is that people tend to be less keen on sharing details of their symptoms. “Usually, people find it embarrassing because it involves talking about things like constipation or the need to hurry to the toilet. These aspects are difficult for patients to talk about,” says Dr Fernando Azpiroz, an expert on digestive diseases who was previously chair of the gut microbiota for health section of the European Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.</p> <p>The really good news is that guts are hugely adaptable. What you eat can quickly change your gut microbiota, says Azpiroz. Guts are very clever – some 100m neurons line the gastrointestinal tract, about nine metres end to end from the oesophagus to the rectum.</p> <p>“The gut is the entry door for nutrition,” says Azpiroz. “If your gut is giving you trouble, the first thing to do is to pay attention to your diet. You have to be careful to eat regularly and to eat a balanced diet, avoiding overconsumption of fats and spices. Eating breakfast, lunch, and not too much for dinner are the sort of obvious things that help.”</p> <p>He estimates that as many as one in three people suffer from poor bowel function, such as loose stools. “It’s a very common complaint,” he says.</p> <p>The trouble is that most of us don’t want to talk about it, or about feeling bloated or suffering from flatulence. But we’d benefit if we found the courage to speak up, says Azpiroz, as there may be ways to ease the symptoms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/from-the-inside-out/2022/aug/01/gut-instinct-how-your-diet-shapes-your-mind\">Gut instinct: how your diet shapes your mind</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But if symptoms persist, it’s important to get them checked to rule out conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or something more serious.</p> <p>Many aspects of modern life have been shown to contribute to an unhealthy gut, not least stress, fatigue, poor dietary habits and overuse of antibiotics. If you’re not feeling your best, the idea of making adjustments can seem overwhelming, but even simple changes can help. Eating your food more slowly can help digestion and absorption of nutrients, while staying hydrated helps the mucosal lining of the intestines as well as the balance of good gut bacteria.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, experts agree that eating more dietary fibre and upping our intake of plants is a great way to help keep our guts happy. For example, a review commissioned by the World Health Organization found that people who ate the most fibre were less likely to suffer from colorectal cancer and many other conditions. In a nutshell, a high-fibre diet can have an enormous protective effect.</p> <p>So the message couldn’t be clearer. Eating the right foods doesn’t just keep our gut healthy, it helps ensure that our whole body is on top form. All the more reason to make sure we never again shy away from those important – and gutsy – conversations.</p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"from-the-inside-out/2022/aug/01/gut-instinct-how-your-diet-shapes-your-mind","type":"article","sectionId":"from-the-inside-out","sectionName":"From the inside out","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T10:39:31Z","webTitle":"Gut instinct: how your diet shapes your mind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/from-the-inside-out/2022/aug/01/gut-instinct-how-your-diet-shapes-your-mind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/from-the-inside-out/2022/aug/01/gut-instinct-how-your-diet-shapes-your-mind","fields":{"headline":"Gut instinct: how your diet shapes your mind","trailText":"There’s a reason our gut is known as the ‘second brain’ – what you eat has an effect on your mind","byline":"David Cox","body":"<p>The idea that many of our emotions and feelings are linked to the gut is an ancient one. More than 2,000 years ago, the Romans made reference to what we today describe as a “gut feeling”. Now, modern science indicates that the gut may indeed play a role in mood disorders and our mental health.</p> <p>The gut is covered in nerve cells known as neurons – cells that transmit signals to other neurons, and which are also fundamental to our brains. Research suggests that this network, known as the enteric nervous system, contains more than 100m neurons. This complex network of cells in our gut is able to function independently of the brain and spinal cord, and is often referred to as the body’s “second brain”.</p> <p>And although this “second brain” doesn’t actually do any “thinking”, the gut is far more than just a mechanism for processing and digesting our food. The gut communicates with the brain in a number of ways, and plays a vital role in providing it with neurochemicals, such as serotonin which influences mood, among other functions.</p> <p>In addition to the bloodstream, one of the main pathways between the two is the vagus nerve – a long bundle of nerve fibres that stretch from the brain to the abdomen. “Roughly 80% of the nerve fibres which make up the vagus nerve are signalling in the direction from the gut to the brain, while only 20% are the other way around,” says Dr Katerina Johnson, a psychiatry researcher at the University of Oxford. “It highlights how much the brain is a receiver of information from our gut.”</p> <p>Developing research shows that much of this information comes from gut microbes, which respond to a variety of external influences ranging from diet to stress. It is through the actions and composition of these microbes that the gut is thought to play a role in impacting mental health.</p> <p>Along with various other factors such as our genes, our diets may play a role in determining how we cope with stress and deal with life traumas. Ted Dinan, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University College Cork, in Ireland, points out that both human and animal studies have established links between poor diet and poor mental health.</p> <p>“In a study some years ago, we profiled the gut microbes of patients with depression and of healthy subjects, and we found that there was much less microbial diversity in the intestines of the individuals with depression,” says Dinan.</p> <p>“And when we transplanted the microbiota of a depressed patient into a rat, the rat’s behaviour altered and it developed depressive-like behaviours and a more inflamed immunology. Whereas if you do the same thing from a healthy human to a rat, the animal’s behaviour doesn’t change at all.”</p> <p>One of the reasons that diet is important is because the large intestine – a component of the gut which is relatively heavily populated from a microbial perspective – acts as a giant fermentation organ. The microbes within it break down certain fibres producing various substances – some of which have been linked to positive health outcomes.</p> <p>Johnson explains how scientists have found that patients with depression have less of a particular type of bacteria called <em>bacteroides</em>, which is known to produce an important chemical called GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). This neurochemical helps minimise the impact of stress, and can therefore help us sleep soundly through the night. If the brain does not get enough GABA, this leads to increased anxiety and insomnia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/from-the-inside-out/2022/aug/01/kale-to-kimchi-12-foods-that-are-good-for-gut-health\">Kale to kimchi: 12 foods that are good for gut health</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One particularly important product for the brain is the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan in our diet is broken down – by a group of gut microbes called bifidobacteria – into smaller metabolites that can cross the blood-brain barrier. The brain needs a constant supply of tryptophan metabolites, as they are the building blocks for the mood-regulating hormone serotonin. It appears that if we don’t have a sufficient abundance of bifidobacteria in our gut, due to eating a poor diet, this process will be inhibited, with consequences for our mental health.</p> <p>“Numerous studies over the past decade have illustrated the importance of tryptophan,” says Dinan. “If you take patients who have recovered from depression and you deplete their brains of tryptophan, their depression will reoccur within a really short period of time, within minutes to hours.”</p> <p>Making sure the right types of bacteria are flourishing in your gut appears to be a crucial part of keeping your brain working effectively, yet because people’s guts are so complex – and so different – scientists are still trying to establish the exact definition of a healthy microbiome. What we do know for now is that a good diet plays an important role in keeping your gut – and therefore your brain – healthy.</p> <p>“We know that if somebody starts off on a good diet, and then goes on a diet of fast food, their microbiota changes rapidly in a very short period of time, and good microbes in the gut tend to be lost or decreased very dramatically,” Dinan says. “There’s no doubt that an appropriate diet gives us a good microbiota, which helps us deal more appropriately with stress.”</p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"from-the-inside-out/2022/aug/01/kale-to-kimchi-12-foods-that-are-good-for-gut-health","type":"article","sectionId":"from-the-inside-out","sectionName":"From the inside out","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T10:38:27Z","webTitle":"Kale to kimchi: 12 foods that are good for gut health","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/from-the-inside-out/2022/aug/01/kale-to-kimchi-12-foods-that-are-good-for-gut-health","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/from-the-inside-out/2022/aug/01/kale-to-kimchi-12-foods-that-are-good-for-gut-health","fields":{"headline":"Kale to kimchi: 12 foods that are good for gut health","trailText":"The contents of your shopping basket can have a huge impact on your wellbeing, so stock up on the items which can help to promote digestion and a healthy gut","byline":"Susie Mesure","body":"<p>We’ve probably never been more aware of how the groceries we choose affect our health. Who among us hasn’t tried to resist the lure of the cake aisle? The connection between food and wellbeing seems particularly salient when it comes to gut health. And, it turns out, by making simple changes to our diet, we can start to take care of our tummies. Try popping some of the items listed below into your shopping basket and see if you notice a difference.</p> <p><strong>Potatoes<br></strong>Pile plenty of potatoes into your shopping bag, but resist peeling them because their skins contain fibre. Fibre helps to maintain a healthy digestive system, passing through our small intestine without being broken down. The UK government recommends we aim for 30g of fibre a day, although British adults manage to eat only about 19g on average. Potatoes are also a source of resistant starch, a form of starch that can’t be digested in the small intestine and so is classified as a type of fibre. This, too, may aid gut health.</p> <p><strong>Wholegrains<br></strong>Choosing wholegrain varieties of bread and pasta is an easy way of boosting your fibre intake. Unlike the refined grains used in white bread and pasta, wholegrains include the bran, the fibre-rich outer layer that gets stripped when grain is refined. Remember to check the label on any packets you buy so you can be sure about the ingredients, fibre content and nutritional values. As a guide, a product claiming to be a source of fibre should contain at least 3g of fibre per 100g or at least 1.5g of fibre per 100 kcal, while a product claiming to be high fibre should contain double those figures.</p> <p><strong>Wheat bran<br></strong>A daily intake of 10g of wheat-bran fibre is known to support your gut health by helping to accelerate the transit of food through your intestines. An easy way to boost your intake is by eating breakfast cereals high in wheat-bran fibre, such as the Kellogg’s high-fibre range, which includes Bran Flakes, All-Bran Original and Fruit &amp; Fibre.</p> <p><strong>Oats<br></strong>These are another handy breakfast option. Oats are known to provide a type of fibre often referred to as soluble fibre. This fibre dissolves in water and forms a gel in the gut, which can beneficially impact digestion and metabolism. Remember, oats aren’t just used to make porridge but are the basis of muesli, oatcakes and oat bread.<br><br><strong>Leafy vegetables<br></strong>Parents down the generations have told children to “eat up your greens”, and it turns out they were right. For example, broccoli and kale can provide a source of fibre.</p> <p><strong>Probiotics and fermented foods<br></strong>We can enrich the diversity of our gut microbiome by eating probiotics – technically defined as live bacteria that, when consumed in a viable form and adequate amounts, are beneficial to health. Kefir, a fermented milk drink, is an example of a food providing a probiotic source. Such foods may complement a fibre-rich diet, in the context of gut health. Other fermented foods such as certain yoghurts, sauerkraut, miso and kimchi are examples of probiotic sources.</p> <p><strong>Bulgur wheat<br></strong>If you’re bored of potatoes but need something on the side, this wholewheat grain is your friend. It comes in four sizes, from fine to very coarse, and is great as a basis for salads. Mix it with anything from tomatoes and cucumber to parsley and lettuce, for a tasty side dish.</p> <p><strong>Pulses<br></strong>These come in all sorts of varieties, with some of the most familiar being lentils, chickpeas and kidney beans. All three contain fibre, as well as resistant starch, and can be added to soups, stews, curries or salads.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/from-the-inside-out/2022/aug/01/rise-and-shine-five-recipes-to-supercharge-your-breakfast\">Rise and shine: five recipes to supercharge your breakfast</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Nuts and seeds<br></strong>Pumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds are handy if you’re looking for a fibre snack while on the go. Nuts and seeds can be sprinkled on stir fries, blitzed into curries, stirred into homemade cereal bars, or added to breakfast cereals. And don’t forget nut butters, which come in varieties such as cashew and almond as well as peanut.</p> <p><strong>Assorted fruits<br></strong>If you fancy something sweeter, remember that plenty of fruits contain fibre, such as strawberries, blackberries and pomegranates. Avocados might be savoury but they are a fruit, and another good option.</p> <p><strong>Bananas<br></strong>When green, these are a good source of resistant starch. As a rule of thumb, the greener the banana, the more resistant starch it contains, so try to eat them before they turn completely yellow.</p> <p><strong>Prebiotics<br></strong>Fibre reaches the large intestine undigested. Once there, some types of fibre become “food” for the good bacteria in our gut. These types of fibre are referred to as prebiotics. Small amounts can be found in foods such as chicory root, onions, garlic and artichokes. But you can also opt for foods with added prebiotic fibre.</p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"culture/2022/aug/01/nichelle-nichols-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T10:37:34Z","webTitle":"Nichelle Nichols obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/01/nichelle-nichols-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/aug/01/nichelle-nichols-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Nichelle Nichols obituary","trailText":"Actor who blazed a trail for black women on American TV in the 1960s in the role of Lt Uhura in Star Trek","byline":"Anthony Hayward","body":"<p>The actor and singer Nichelle Nichols, who has died aged 89, was one of the first black women to be featured on American television in a non-subservient role when she played the communications officer Lieutenant Nyota Uhura in the original Star Trek series (1966-69).

She saw Uhura – her name was based on <em>uhuru</em>, the Swahili for “freedom” – not only as a role model for black people, but also for women with ambitions to become astronauts or scientists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f26caacf4c139158019bcdeba784700031b51207\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f26caacf4c139158019bcdeba784700031b51207/0_272_2779_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nichelle Nichols and William Shatner in the episode of Star Trek which featured the US’s first small-screen kiss between a black woman and a white man.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nichelle Nichols and William Shatner in Plato’s Stepchildren, the episode of Star Trek which featured the US’s first small-screen kiss between a black woman and a white man.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paramount Television/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Star Trek’s creator, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1991/oct/28/mainsection.nancybankssmith\" title=\"Gene Roddenberry\">Gene Roddenberry</a>, championed sexual and racial equality, and presented a hopeful vision of the future in the series. “The promise of that imaginary universe was real to me,” wrote Nichols in her 1994 autobiography, Beyond Uhura: Star Trek and Other Memories. “I am still very proud of Uhura: proud of who she was (or will be) and what she represented, not only in her time but in ours.”</p> <p>Nichols was born in Robbins, Illinois, the daughter of Samuel, a chemist who had just served as mayor of that town, and his wife, Lishia (nee Parks). Her paternal grandfather, a white southerner, had alienated his parents by marrying a black woman. After Nichols and her family moved to Chicago, she studied dance at the Chicago Ballet Academy from the age of 12.</p> <p>Two years later her professional career began as a singer and dancer in the revue College Inn at the Sherman House hotel, Chicago. Later she toured the US, Canada and Europe with Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton’s jazz bands (1950-51), appeared in the revue Calypso Carnival at the Blue Angel nightclub, Chicago, and performed as a solo singer and dancer across the US and Canada.</p> <p>Moving to Los Angeles, Nichols was a principal dancer in the film version of Porgy and Bess (1959), which led to her being cast as the campus queen Hazel Sharpe in the original production of Kicks &amp; Co at the Arie Crown theatre in Chicago (1961). Although the musical was a flop, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/28/hugh-hefner-obituary\" title=\"\">Hugh Hefner</a> saw Nichols and booked her to appear at his Chicago Playboy Club.</p> <p>In 1964, she acted in an episode of Roddenberry’s first series, The Lieutenant, a drama about a marine corps. She then auditioned for Star Trek early the following year. With her character still to be developed, she read Spock’s lines and claimed to have impressed the producers so much that they checked whether <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/27/leonard-nimoy\" title=\"Leonard Nimoy\">Leonard Nimoy</a> had yet signed his contract. When it was confirmed that he had, they began discussing Uhura, whose name came from the title of a novel about the fight for freedom in Africa that Nichols had with her at the audition.</p> <p>In her autobiography, Nichols revealed that she had a relationship with Roddenberry – who was married and already dating the woman who became his second wife – before Star Trek began. She later wrote a song for him, Gene, which she sang at his funeral in 1991. She was also a regular at Trekkies’ fan conventions.</p> <p>After Star Trek finished in 1969, she voiced Uhura in Star Trek: The Animated Series (1973-74) and played the part in the first six spin-off films, beginning with Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and ending with Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991). She played Uhura once again in the 2020 fan-produced film Star Trek: First Frontier, as well as appearing as Admiral Grace Jemison in the 2017 fans’ internet series Star Trek: Renegades.</p> <p>Nichols was so associated with Uhura that she was only occasionally offered other screen roles, although she voiced half-a-dozen television cartoons. In the 1974 blaxploitation film Truck Turner, she was Dorinda, a foul-mouthed madam hiring a gangster to carry out revenge on the bounty hunters (played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/12/popandrock.jazz\" title=\"\">Isaac Hayes</a> and Alan Weeks) who killed her pimp boyfriend. She later played Nana Dawson, the matriarch of a New Orleans family devastated by Hurricane Katrina, in the second series (2007) of the TV sci-fi drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/jul/26/heroesworship\" title=\"\">Heroes</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e17d62f2723f9d86b428c8342daeb6979dbe6da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e17d62f2723f9d86b428c8342daeb6979dbe6da/0_171_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nichelle Nichols and William Shatner in Los Angeles in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nichelle Nichols and William Shatner in Los Angeles in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1975, Nichols formed Women in Motion, which produced educational materials based around music. The initiative later expanded, with a Nasa grant, to become an astronaut recruitment project aimed at women and ethnic minorities. Among the thousands who applied were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/24/sally-ride\" title=\"Sally Ride\">Sally Ride</a>, who became the first American woman in space. Nichols won Nasa’s public service award in 1984.</p> <p>As a singer, Nichols released three albums, Down to Earth (1967), Uhura Sings (1986) and Out of this World (1991). In 1990 she also staged a one-woman show, Reflections, a musical tribute to black performers such as Josephine Baker, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/10/lena-horne-obituary\" title=\"Lena Horne\">Lena Horne</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/26/eartha-kitt-obituary\" title=\"Eartha Kitt\">Eartha Kitt</a>, at the Westwood Playhouse in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Nichols’s two marriages, to the dancer Foster Johnson in 1951 and the songwriter Duke Mondy in 1968, both ended in divorce.

reporter","body":"<p>Discussing the weather has long been a harmless British pastime, with forecasters relied on to ruin bank holidays with their predictions of drizzle or give good news of some gentle summer sunshine.</p> <p>But now TV meteorologists have found themselves on the frontline of the climate culture war after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/19/britain-heatwave-1976-crisis-summer-heat\">extreme temperatures</a> hit England last month, with records smashed and highs of 40.3C (104.5F).</p> <p>Laura Tobin is well known as the chirpy weather forecaster for Good Morning Britain. She is popular with viewers and has 200,000 Twitter followers. But she has found herself spending her time battling climate deniers as her job has tipped from giving updates on the mild British weather to charting the terrifying advance of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/this-heatwave-is-a-reminder-that-grass-lawns-are-terrible-for-the-environment\">climate crisis</a>.</p> <p>She said: “When I’d just done my 6.15am weather forecast on the Tuesday morning, I said we are forecasting 41C and I sat and looked at my map after, I was talking to the guy who does my weather graphics for me, I actually teared up. I said, ‘I’ve forecasted it, it’s going to happen, it’s actually reality and it’s going to happen’. We could not believe it in the forecasting community. I was very emotional about it.”</p> <p>But not all of her viewers took the hot temperatures so seriously, accusing her of “scaremongering” and complaining on social media when Tobin linked the heatwave to climate breakdown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/25/uk-drought-extreme-heat-dry\">UK facing drought in August following extreme heat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some tweets accused her of sharing “weather propaganda” and said they switched off when seeing her on television. Some called for her to be jailed over her climate warnings and others called her “Dr Doom”.</p> <p>“People say you should just tell us about the weather, you shouldn’t talk about climate change,” she said, adding: “People think that it’s someone else’s problem and they don’t want to hear it. People don’t like being told what to do.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GMB/status/1548902413758783490\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#39;Exceptional and unprecedented.&#39;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lauratobin1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Lauratobin1</a> explains how extreme the current weather is.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Heatwave2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Heatwave2022</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zWFgi7k7rd\">pic.twitter.com/zWFgi7k7rd</a></p>&mdash; Good Morning Britain (@GMB) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GMB/status/1548902413758783490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 18, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Unlike many who face abuse and complaints on Twitter, Tobin makes a point of replying to climate deniers and even replies to their tweets live on air, answering their questions.</p> <p>“Meteorologists are one of the main ways climate change is communicated to the public,” she said.</p> <p>“We have a duty to tell the science and show why it matters. What we know, what we’ve seen [in such a short timescale], what we are saying isn’t being alarmist – what we are seeing is alarming. It’s not scaremongering – the truth scares people but the reality is scary.”</p> <p>She views it as part of the job to convince people that the climate crisis is real. “I realised a long time ago that even if those people are one in a million or one in a thousand you have to talk to them and convince them they are wrong, showing them the proof. And I have managed to do it before, I have spoken to complete climate deniers and sceptics, shown them the science in a non-condescending way, and convinced them.”</p> <p>And the angry comments do not upset her, as she believes it is her calling to warn people about the climate emergency.</p> <p>“Anything that somebody can say that might be having a go at me or negative, my feelings about climate change blow that out of the water, I don’t get upset, I just want them to care and understand,” Tobin explained.</p> <p>“For me the more emotional thing was that these temperatures were forecast and they became a reality, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/20/heatwave-led-to-london-firefighters-busiest-day-since-second-world-war\">the wildfires started</a>, and that there will be hundreds if not thousands of fatalities. Because we gave massive warnings, places like care homes and schools could prepare and more people were saved.</p> <p>“We had comments saying the Met Office should stick to forecasting not telling people what to do. Actually, I said, hold on a minute, all of these things will have helped save lives so why is it a bad thing? We suggest people bring an umbrella if it is going to rain, no one has a go at us for that, so why can we not suggest that people prepare for extreme weather?”</p> <p>The meteorologist Scott Duncan shows the rapid change in climate by making and sharing stark graphics on social media. Many of these were shared thousands of times during the heatwave but also attracted abuse.</p> <p>“These [extreme weather] events you get, you get the masses coming out with the pitchforks and torches. People think they can forecast the weather themselves, which is fine, but when people come to social media and bash the weather forecaster it’s just not on,” he said.</p> <p>Celebrities and the media have also started unhelpful pile-ons for forecasters trying to warn about extreme heat.</p> <p>“When Jeremy Clarkson was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeremyClarkson/status/1548625115918868481?s=20&amp;t=LV8XMEG5_MojIKg4qSRdvg\">tweeting</a> incorrectly about how France hadn’t declared a heatwave it was sort of stoking a mob, it’s not helpful.

You start to become numb to it, you used to be surprised to see these things and now you don’t.</p> <p>“I’ve been posting less actually, I wanted a step back after the reaction.”</p> <p>But Duncan and Tobin plan to continue telling the world about the climate emergency.</p> <p>“The air we were breathing was hotter than our lungs on Monday and Tuesday [18-19 July] which wasn’t really a thing in the past – seeing 40C in places like Doncaster where had never been above the mid 30s – the scale of these record breaks definitely warranted the highest level of heat warning.

During questioning, he has also reportedly blamed Abe’s grandfather and postwar prime minister, Nobusuke Kishi, for promoting the church in Japan in the 1960s as a countermeasure against communism and trade unions.</p> <p>The church, known for conducting mass weddings in sports stadiums, was founded in South Korea in 1954 by Rev Sun Myung Moon, a self-proclaimed messiah who preached new interpretations of the Bible and conservative values, including a strong anti-communist streak.</p> <p>In a video message last year to the Universal Peace Federation, an affiliated group, Abe praised the group for its focus on family values. “We should be wary of so-called social revolutionary movements with narrow-minded values,” he said.</p> <p>There is no evidence, however, that Abe was a member of the church, which also had relationships with other influential conservatives, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush and Donald Trump.</p> <p>It found an immediate ally in Kishi, an alleged war criminal who was never charged, and whose social conservatism and rightwing politics mirrored those of Sun Myung Moon, whom he met near Mount Fuji in 1967 to discuss their anti-communist mission.</p> <p>Those same shared values sustain the present-day relationship between the church, whose members are often referred to as Moonies, and the LDP, according to Prof Mark Mullins, director of the Japan Studies Centre at the University of Auckland.</p> <p>“Conservative LDP politicians do share some values with the Unification church - their anti-communism and, more recently, family values, including opposition to same-sex marriage,” Mullins said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"517436a67902896a8b1e0bd5526120bc1eb94c7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/517436a67902896a8b1e0bd5526120bc1eb94c7c/0_129_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photograph of Shinzo Abe at the headquarters of the Japanese Liberal Democratic party in Tokyo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photograph of Shinzo Abe at the headquarters of the Japanese Liberal Democratic party in Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While LDP lawmakers have often publicised their ties to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/g7-japan-world-leaders-tour-shrine-cameron-obama-abe\">conservative Shinto</a> and other organisations, “it appears that they were not keen to have their association with the Unification church to be widely known,” Mullins added.</p> <p>“This is probably related to the negative image of the church due to complaints and lawsuits by former members over deceptive and high-pressure fundraising and recruitment activities.”</p> <p>Despite its Korean origins, the church has found fertile ground in Japan, where it is said to have hundreds of thousands of members.</p> <p>The National Network of Lawyers Against Spiritual Sales, a group of 300 lawyers representing people who claim they have suffered financial damage because of the church, accuse it of brainwashing believers into handing over huge quantities of money.</p> <p>The network has received 34,000 complaints relating to “lost” money totalling more than ¥120bn (£742m) since 1987 – a claim the church has strongly denied.</p> <p>The lawyers repeatedly asked Abe and other LDP lawmakers to stop sending congratulatory messages or appearing at events organised by the church, which now calls itself the Federation for World Peace and Unification, and its affiliates.

The supreme court’s next term won’t start until October. Congress will be in recess in August. And the January 6 hearings will be on hiatus until September. Things will calm down for a little while. Or so it will seem on the surface, at least.</p> <p>This supposed respite follows what historians might come to call the Long Summer of 2022. It began in early May, when Justice Samuel Alito’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/03/supreme-court-abortion-leak-politics-law-overturn-roe/?utm_source=pocket_mylist\">draft majority opinion</a> in Dobbs v Women’s Health Organization leaked – the decision that in June overturned Roe v Wade and abolished the right to abortion. This was not the start, but itself a manifestation and apotheosis of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/19/ending-roe-v-wade-beginning-conservatives-civil-rights-democracy\">reactionary assault</a> on the post-1960s civil rights era that originated in Republican-led states and has been consistently enabled and actively advanced by the supreme court. The Dobbs leak, which dominated the political discourse for weeks, clearly indicated an escalation of rightwing attempts to turn the clock back by many decades.</p> <p>In early June, the House select committee on the January 6 attack tried to capture the nation’s attention with the first in a series of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/06/10/1104156949/jan-6-committee-hearing-transcript\">televised hearings</a> that, for better or worse, have formed the center of the institutional defense of democracy. It all came to a head in the final days of June, when the central political conflict crystallized in the span of just a little over a week. On Thursday, 23 June, the January 6 committee’s fifth hearing focused on Donald Trump’s outrageous <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/jan6-hearing-trump-corrupt-DOJ/?id=85556383\">attempts to corrupt the justice department</a>. It is generally not a good sign that such an explosive revelation about how the former president tried to nullify a democratic election was able to dominate the news cycle for only about 12 hours.</p> <p>The very next day, the supreme court published its decision to abolish the right to abortion. It came in the context of a remarkably aggressive assault not just on democracy and civil rights, but also on the state’s ability to handle the challenges of a modern, pluralistic society. Within a week, the court undermined the <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/06/coach-kennedy-gorsuch-prayer-public-schools.html\">separation of church and state</a>, weakened the ability of <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/07/bruen-concealed-carry-gun-violence.html\">liberal states to regulate guns</a>, basically made it clear that it would tolerate even the most <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23187117/supreme-court-louisiana-racial-gerrymander-ardoin-robinson-congressional-maps\">brazen racial gerrymandering</a>, and undercut the <a href=\"https://www.fivefourpod.com/episodes/west-virginia-v-environmental-protection-agency/\">administrative state’s attempts</a> to tackle environmental problems.</p> <p>Amid all these decisions that left no doubt about the court majority’s intention to help conservatives impose their will on the entire country, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/opinion/cassidy-hutchinson-january-6-committee.html\">Cassidy Hutchinson</a>, former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, testified in the committee’s sixth hearing, on 28 June. She painted a clear picture of the former president’s deliberate efforts to summon a violent, armed mob. To care about American democracy, in those last days of June, was to exist in a state of constant emergency, whiplash, and exhaustion.</p> <p>Yet even in those hectic days of late June, and certainly throughout the Long Summer of 2022, the experience of most Americans, even those who followed the proceedings in Washington closely, were shaped not just by the political upheavals, but by the normal challenges of everyday life. Stores remained open, people had to go to work, they suffered or celebrated with their favorite sports teams.</p> <p>It would be unfair to denounce these as just illusions of normalcy. In a lot of ways, things really are “normal”, in the sense that most of us continue the routines that dominate our daily lives, even in the midst of a political crisis around us. We have to function, we compartmentalize, we experience a strange mixture of normalcy and emergency that can sometimes feel almost disorienting. Franz Kafka famously <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/fighting-a-private-war-1.333252\">noted in his diary</a> on Sunday, 2 August 1914: “Germany has declared war on Russia. Swimming lessons in the afternoon.” Kafka had just witnessed the beginning of what quickly escalated into the first world war. His remark captures the tension between the global and the personal, the extraordinary and the routine, history and everyday life, the outrageous and the mundane.</p> <p>There is always a temptation to resolve that tension by ignoring the emergency and focusing on the ordinariness of it all – because how bad could things possibly be, the sky isn’t ever falling. This, however, is a privilege not available to the women who are dealing with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samkarlin/status/1549116888831098881?s=20&amp;t=2G5JnmgWhJlMSDGsK32r8w\">cruel consequences</a> of their bodily autonomy being denied or the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/22/us/politics/after-roe-republicans-sharpen-attacks-on-gay-and-transgender-rights.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur\">traditionally marginalized, vulnerable groups</a> who are the targets of the reactionary offensive. Such a focus on the markers of normalcy is deceptive and politically dangerous. It is difficult for contemporaries to discern the exact nature and extent of the crisis through which they are living. We can’t necessarily see the democratic backsliding by simply looking out the window – certainly not until it may be too late – but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a continuing crisis underneath.</p> <p>“Crisis”, of course, might be the most overused term in the public discourse. And in its colloquial meaning, in which it vaguely refers to any kind of difficult situation, it certainly doesn’t have much analytical or explanatory value. But if taken seriously, the notion of “crisis” delineates a highly unstable situation in which established strategies, tactics and patterns of behavior don’t work any more, a constellation in which accepted modes of making sense of the world around us prove inadequate and unable to generate viable solutions.</p> <p>The summer of 2022 should have hammered home the fact that all of us who prefer democracy are experiencing such a profound crisis. The supreme court, one of the critical institutions of constitutional government, is not only complicit in the full-on assault on democracy, civil rights and the state’s ability to adequately tackle urgent public policy issues, it is its spearhead. In this situation, simply clinging to the established idea that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexThomp/status/1542256921431924738?s=20&amp;t=SEVnjH9vQ08xYLVwuWrlfw\">public trust in institutions</a> must not be undermined will not be good enough.</p> <p>And it’s true that, in a vacuum, it is highly problematic for authorities to prosecute the leading political opponent of a sitting president. But we are not in a vacuum. We are in a situation in which the former president was the central figure in a multi-layered, multi-month scheme that amounted to an actual coup attempt. Not holding him accountable would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-jamelle-bouie.html\">gravely endanger the future</a> of constitutional government.</p> <p>In medical terms, the word “crisis” refers to the turning point of a disease: the patient will either recover – or die. In this sense, a crisis is the opposite of a stable equilibrium. And that’s precisely where we find ourselves.</p> <p>After the overturning of Roe, the overwhelming message from all corners of the right has been: We are not done yet – or, as <a href=\"https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2022/06/the-end-of-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-abortion\">First Things</a>, the pre-eminent intellectual platform of the religious right, put it: Dobbs was just “the end of the beginning” and a “resounding first step”. Nothing more. There’s no appeasing those who are behind the reactionary crusade, no bargain or truce to be had. The refusal to compromise with the vision of multiracial pluralism, with anyone who deviates from their idea of the natural and/or divinely ordained order, is at the heart of their political project. They are not looking for a consolation prize, partial victories, or an exit ramp.

Anything else is a vanity project","byline":"Andrew Gawthorpe","body":"<p>Does the US need a third party, and can one succeed? According to the founders of the new Forward party, the answer to both questions is yes. By targeting disaffected Americans on all parts of the political spectrum, the founders – who include the former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang and the former Republican governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman – <a href=\"https://fwdtogether.org/\">hope</a> to create a new force that will lead Americans into a future in which they can “cut out the extreme partisanship, reintroduce a competition of ideas, and work together in good faith”.</p> <p>Sounds great. But unfortunately, the Forward party is ill conceived, based on a faulty idea of how to fix America’s descent into political madness, and likely to collapse under the weight of its own contradictions.</p> <p>At the core of the party’s justification for its own existence is the suggestion that both of America’s two major parties are to blame for the country’s dysfunction, and that the only way to move forward is to replace them with something new. This is a misleading and self-serving diagnosis. Whatever gripes one might have with its policies, the Democratic party is the only one of the two major parties committed to basic democratic and liberal norms. The problem that ails America is that Republicans are not.</p> <p>The absurdity of this attempt to create a false equivalence becomes even clearer when the new party’s founders <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/07/27/forward-party-new-centrist-third/\">talk details</a>. They argue that “most Americans” agree neither with “the far right’s insistence on eliminating gun laws” nor with “calls from the far left to confiscate all guns and repeal the Second Amendment”. But these two things are not the same: the first is what is actually happening in America right now, whereas the second is a view that was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9224415629\">attributed</a> to Kamala Harris as part of a fabricated smear on Facebook and enjoys approximately zero support in the Democratic party.</p> <p>On abortion, the party’s founders similarly contrast “the far right’s quest to make a woman’s choice a criminal offence” with “the far left’s extreme views on late-term abortions”. Once again, the false equivalence is startling. It’s thanks to the mainstream Republican party, not the “far right”, that abortion is now illegal in eight states, with many more expected to follow. “Late-term abortion”, meanwhile, is a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/02/06/tough-questions-answers-late-term-abortions-law-women-who-get-them/\">medically meaningless</a> term used by conservatives to imply that women who have life-saving surgery late in their pregnancy are in fact having elective abortions, cheered on all the way by baby-killing liberals.</p> <p>When they avoid talking specifics, the founders can sound more convincing. Who could disagree with “welcoming new ideas” and “creating a political home” for people from both parties? But in the America of today such bromides feel – to borrow, in the spirit of bipartisanship, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/06/sarah-palin-her-own-words\">a phrase</a> from Sarah Palin – “hopey-changey”. In reality, there is only one responsible place for anyone to be if they want to protect America’s democratic, liberal norms – and that place is in the Democratic party.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Forward party seems much more likely to siphon votes from the left than from the right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead of strengthening this one last realistic defense that the US has left, the Forward party will weaken it. The party’s founders <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/07/27/forward-party-new-centrist-third/\">draw</a> on old polling data from just after the January 6 insurrection to claim that 50% of Americans now identify as independents. In fact, the figure is <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/Party-Affiliation.aspx\">now</a> nearer 40%, and political scientists <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/few-americans-who-identify-as-independent-are-actually-independent-thats-really-bad-for-politics/\">will tell you</a> that there are very few “true” independents in America’s polarized political landscape. Of that small pool, the Forward party – whose most recognizable face is Andrew Yang, a former Democrat – seems much more likely to siphon votes from the left than from the right. Even if it doesn’t, it will have helped spread propaganda about liberals wanting to end the second amendment and legalize third-trimester abortion, benefiting Republicans. Even a small electoral effect could spell disaster – especially with Republican state governments poised to steal close elections in swing states.</p> <p>The final problem with the Forward party is its internal incoherence. The party promises “common sense” solutions, but common sense means very different things to different people. The fact that the party is trying to stitch together supporters from across the political spectrum is probably one reason it is offering so few details about what its actual policies will be. Political tents can only get so big before they collapse under the weight of their own contradictions, and it is hard to see how the Forward party can avoid a similar fate if it wants to move beyond platitudes.</p> <p>The Democratic party may not be perfect. But the two-party system, and the threat to America’s democracy posed by Republicans, has a stark and brutal logic. Those who care about democracy and liberalism should advance the cause of the Democratic party. Republicans who cannot bring themselves to do that should work to change the Republican party from within. Anything else is a vanity project. Such projects might have value to politicians who had their personal ambitions thwarted in the regular party system. But what do they possibly have to offer the American people?</p> <ul> <li><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University and host of the podcast America Explained</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/01/first-thing-alarm-nominations-election-deniers-kari-lake-mark-finchem","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T10:13:54Z","webTitle":"Nominations for election deniers sparks alarm | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/first-thing-alarm-nominations-election-deniers-kari-lake-mark-finchem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/first-thing-alarm-nominations-election-deniers-kari-lake-mark-finchem","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: alarm at nominations for election deniers","trailText":"Kari Lake and Mark Finchem are in running for crucial state roles.

Predictably, in this Ring with no gold and no ring, the staging, in Andrea Cozzi’s eclectic sets and Andy Besuch’s costumes, dispenses with all other Wagnerian props.</p> <p>All the same, there are pregnant possibilities. The young abductee, brutalised and feral, is Götterdämmerung’s Hagen in the making. The school-uniformed girls he tyrannises may be embryonic Valkyries. And the potential purging of a rotten and heartless world is the enduring Wagnerian theme of themes.</p> <p>Vocally, Bayreuth standards are more often decent than stellar these days.

The problem wasn’t hackers from a foreign power, or infiltration using malware, or even a denial of service attack bombarding the MoD’s servers. It was something a lot simpler: human error.</p> <p>On three occasions, it emerged, the names and email addresses of 268 Afghans had been accidentally exposed in emails that were sent using the “carbon copy” (cc) field instead of the “blind carbon copy” (bcc) field. The consequences, if the names fell into the wrong hands, were potentially life-threatening.</p> <p>Though the stakes of that particular leak were unusually high, outbound email leaks such as this are common and, according to Steven Furnell, professor of cyber security at the University of Nottingham, they tend to happen for two main reasons.</p> <p>“One is carelessness, rushing to do something – attaching the wrong thing, sending to the wrong people,” he says, describing how he is often on the receiving end of emails sent in error because people have typed “Steve” into the address field, and the email software has automatically added his email address instead of the correct one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ebf21afc2c3a3b30b82f0eb474980be09bf321a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ebf21afc2c3a3b30b82f0eb474980be09bf321a/0_25_2020_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: “If the names fell into the wrong hands, it was potentially life-threatening”\" width=\"1000\" height=\"878\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The other problem is that it can be hard to differentiate one computer file from another. A text file might contain top-secret business information or tomorrow’s canteen menu. And a spreadsheet might be your fantasy football scores or the quarterly financial results. So it’s unsurprising how carefree we can be when attaching a file, and hitting “send”. It can be hard for people to “appreciate the value and the significance of the material that they’re attaching, and the potential mismatch between that and who they’re sending it to”, says Furnell.</p> <p>Other recent issues include <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-60831683\" rel=\"nofollow\">a leak earlier this year</a> on the Isle of Wight, when the local council inadvertently emailed out details of families who were home schooling, and the government service provider Serco, when it was recruiting for contact-tracing posts during the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/serco-accidentally-shares-contact-tracers-email-addresses-covid-19\">accidentally revealing</a> to applicants the names and details of other people who had applied.</p> <p>“The lion’s share of data leaks are not caused by sophisticated hackers, but by outbound errors, or certainly errors in communication, by employees within companies,” says Robert Fleming, chief marketing officer at the email security firm Zivver.</p> <p>In fact, according to the <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/data-security-incident-trends/\" rel=\"nofollow\">most recent security trends report</a> from the Information Commissioner’s Office, 75% of reported security incidents were down to what it calls “non-cyber” reasons, such as mistakes when sending email, including sending personal data to the wrong recipients.</p> <p>It’s not surprising then that outbound leaks are something that IT professionals worry about. For its <a href=\"https://www.zivver.com/freedom-to-focus?utm_campaign=GBL-22-Q2-Freedom%20to%20Focus&amp;utm_source=guardianlabs-article1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freedom to Focus report</a>, Zivver surveyed 6,000 IT leaders worldwide, and found that 43% cited data loss through employee email error as a major concern, narrowly behind only malware (48%) and phishing (46%).</p> <p>“Companies are spending millions on secure gateways, malware detection, and even on paying off ransomware threats, so why aren’t enough companies protecting their employees from making mistakes on their outbound communications too?” asks Fleming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec501f660b4220aa069f3e45e7046844592d4bbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec501f660b4220aa069f3e45e7046844592d4bbf/0_0_2020_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: “It’s important for employers to empower staff to work securely”\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Some businesses have already got the message, including the workplace management firm Best Companies, which turned to Zivver for help.</p> <p>“We work with governments, we work with defence contractors, we work with law enforcement agencies and, in some cases, it could be a matter of life or death if the data we hold gets out into the public domain,” says its CEO Jonathan Austin. “We wanted to figure out how to take the pressure off our colleagues and protect ourselves.”</p> <p>So what can businesses and organisations do to protect against data leaks? One obvious mitigation is to offer employees better training, but with Zivver’s survey finding that 64% of employees disregard their security training in its entirety, this isn’t completely foolproof.</p> <p>“Three-quarters of IT leaders said in that survey that they believed data security training alone would reduce email security mistakes,” says Zivver’s Fleming. “But then a third of the employees surveyed said that they hadn’t received any security training. And a further third, who actually had received the training, said they had not actually used anything they had learned.”</p> <p>A more technological solution is required, not least because if a business doesn’t have an approved solution to a file transfer problem, employees may take risks themselves.</p> <p>“You’ve got platforms where people can set up personal accounts and put corporate information into them, not remotely considering the data protection legislation or rules that sit alongside where the service is, based on where the data might end up residing,” says Furnell. “So you’ve potentially got an increasingly leaky sieve, depending on what services the organisation officially uses, and what shadow services employees might have identified to get the job done for themselves.”</p> <p>What’s needed is a platform that will empower employees to work securely.</p> <p>“People make mistakes,” says Fleming, “so it’s important for employers to put in place appropriate measures to empower staff to work securely, so that all the onus isn’t on the employee. Saying ‘attend this extremely dull security awareness training’ is not good enough.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31ed1fe0657640d8e6ae889cc2cf09e21697ca76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31ed1fe0657640d8e6ae889cc2cf09e21697ca76/0_0_2020_1509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: “People love the peace of mind it gives them”\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>And this is where a solution such as Zivver comes in. Its platform interacts with every step of the email and file transfer process to keep data secure.</p> <p>“If I try to send an email to someone I’ve never met before, attaching our company’s profit and loss statement, smart technology will intervene, based on business rules and machine learning, and ask me if I <em>really</em> want to send such confidential information to a new contact,” explains Fleming.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/send-smarter/2022/aug/01/six-reasons-your-business-email-isnt-as-secure-as-you-think-and-one-way-to-fix-it\">Six reasons your business email isn’t as secure as you think – and one way to fix it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once an email has been sent, Zivver’s secure transportation layer securely delivers it to the recipient, using asymmetric encryption and zero access technology, meaning that not even Zivver can read the contents of an email or its attachments. And when it arrives, Zivver confirms that the recipient has received and accessed the email.</p> <p>It is this type of seamless smart technology that Fleming believes can take a bite out of outbound data leaks. “It’s got to be effortless, it’s got to be easy to use,” says Fleming. “Because if it’s super complicated to be secure, you’re asking too much of your employees. Basically, they’re just not going to do it.”</p> <p>And that, ultimately, is why Best Company’s Austin turned to Zivver – to protect outbound security in a way that wouldn’t make life harder for his team. “From a data communication perspective, and when sharing sensitive information, Zivver ticks all the boxes,” he says. “People love the peace of mind it gives them.”</p> <p>Fleming adds: “Your employees are your biggest assets, so you’ve got to empower them to do their day-to-day work as effectively and productively as you can. And to do that, you have to help them be secure in their day-to-day work.”</p> <p><em>Secure your digital communications now.

How can you prevent sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands?","byline":"James O’Malley","body":"<p>As much as big tech might long to replace it, email is still hard to beat. The technology has been around for almost four decades now, and it remains our most critical tool for doing business. But can business leaders really be confident their email system isn’t the weak link in their digital security? Here’s why email might not be as secure as you think – and how a modern secure communications platform such as <a href=\"https://www.zivver.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zivver</a> can help your business stay safe.</p> <p><strong>Badly designed or no authentication<br></strong>Everyone knows not to use the word “password” as their password, but sometimes that’s the least of a company’s worries because IT policies aimed at increasing security might actually be undermining it. Staff using many different systems at work are invariably told to use a different password for each of them, including their email. They are then instructed to change their passwords regularly and to use complicated combinations of numbers and characters (which can be hard to remember). Such precautions might sound like a good idea but in reality they are a recipe for disaster as they make it more likely that someone somewhere will end up with their email password on a Post-it note stuck to their monitor.</p> <p>The good news is there is a much better way to sign in. Today, it is already normal that when we log in to something particularly sensitive, such as our online banking, we’re asked to enter a special code that’s sent to us via text message or even using an “authenticator” app. It’s an effective check, because the system then knows that if you used the code, you really are using the phone or device you say you are. It’s also a system that is increasingly used by email providers. But still there are ways to go further and be even more secure, which some companies need to do under GDPR rules. For example, Zivver will add this extra authentication to individual emails and attachments too. So if you need to send that particularly sensitive file, you can be confident that the person opening it really is the person it was intended for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0853cf8036eefaa682726d94ad9475572307d18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0853cf8036eefaa682726d94ad9475572307d18/338_276_1056_801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mature man working using the laptop on the desk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"759\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">End-to-end encryption ensures maximum email security.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valentina Barreto/Stocksy United</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Missing or weak encryption<br></strong>When you send an email, you want to make sure that it is secure, but even today about 10% of emails sent are completely unencrypted. This means that whatever you’ve written could potentially be read en route to its destination, or even snooped on by service providers, or hackers when it arrives<strong> </strong>at its destination. It also means that your emails could be subject to government data requests – which can be a particularly big problem for European companies working in the US, as data protection laws make sharing that information more complicated. Luckily though, there is a better way. The modern gold-standard is end-to-end encryption, where not even your email provider can see the contents of messages. Instead, the keys are only held by you and the recipient. Therefore, if the message is intercepted or accessed by others, it appears as gobbledygook. So your business secrets remain secret.</p> <p><strong>No ‘message received’ verification<br></strong>It’s always reassuring to know that a parcel has reached its final destination, and that the correct person has received the goods. But with many traditional email services, once you hit “send”, the email is out of sight and out of your control. If you have something time-critical, or particularly sensitive, you can only hope it reached the right person in time. This is why Zivver created a proof-of-delivery system that works a little like sending a parcel by recorded delivery. When an email is sent, it will verify that it has reached its destination, and generates a comprehensive data report<strong> </strong>for each email that even holds up in court if needed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"577fbaf795aaadd64187ed28ae4358cfd6fe3542\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/577fbaf795aaadd64187ed28ae4358cfd6fe3542/0_0_1733_1155/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Over the shoulder view of someone typing on a laptop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even if you quickly recall an email sent in error, it may still be opened.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marko/Stocksy United</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Recalling emails is hit and miss<br></strong>Many of us have experienced it: you receive an email that doesn’t really seem like it’s meant for you, and you ignore it. Then moments later you receive a recall notice from the sender. At that point it’s hard to resist taking a peek at the email before the recall actually happens to discover what you’re not meant to see. So, in many cases, even if the sender quickly recalls an email sent in error, they can’t be certain confidential details haven’t already been seen. However, when you revoke an email with Zivver, it quickly restricts access to the email and, if it hasn’t been opened, you can be confident its contents are secure. And if it, or an attachment, has been opened, you will be able to see that it has, and you can then assess the security implications.</p> <p><strong>It is too hard to remain secure<br></strong>Your business is only as secure as its weakest point, which is why it is important to make sure your whole team is taking digital security seriously. However, this can be tricky. If being secure is too much hassle, or makes it difficult for people to do things such as send large emails securely, then people are less likely to comply. It may even lead to the use of “shadow IT” – business teams using unapproved, outside tools and services that are simpler to use – which risk sending your data into a digital wild west. Zivver has built its platform on the principle that security must be “effortless”. When sending secure emails through the platform, everything is taken care of behind the scenes. To your team it’s a simple, silent, browser plug-in. And recipients outside your organisation don’t need special software to receive a secure email from your team, they can just click a link and enter a code sent via SMS or in a separate email.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/send-smarter/2022/aug/01/free-to-focus-expert-advice-on-employee-distractions-and-how-to-remove-them\">Free to focus: expert advice on employee distractions and how to remove them</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>We all make mistakes<br></strong>The most difficult part of keeping our businesses secure isn’t IT – it’s us humans. Try as we might, no one is perfect. We’ve all sent the wrong attachment or cc’d the wrong person. Mistakes are human nature, and a part of doing business. There’s no way to train your team to do everything right 100% of the time. The trick is to minimise errors by being smart and using a tool such as Zivver, which alerts users to potential issues and supports them through required decisions. Working as a browser plug-in, it will intelligently analyse your team’s outbound communications and apply “business rules” that put a halt to anything that appears disastrous should it fall into the wrong hands. For example, if you were to attach the company balance sheet to an email to a new contact, it would stop the email in its tracks, and alert you – making sure that was what you really<em> </em>wanted to do.

Here’s how to reduce the noise, and help staff regain focus …","byline":"Rosie Mullender","body":"<p>With more of us working from home more often, online security is a bigger concern for businesses than ever. But rather than dramatic attacks from outside sources, <a href=\"https://www.zivver.com/why-zivver\" rel=\"nofollow\">90% of data breaches are actually caused by human error</a>, says security firm <a href=\"http://www.zivver.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zivver</a>. Distractions at work (be it at home or the office) are among the factors that create errors that can lead to these data breaches. We asked three experts about the issues that can dent productivity, disrupt employees’ focus and compromise security – and how to mitigate them.</p> <p><strong>Communications overload<br></strong>Tech companies have come up with multiple tools to help us communicate – but when it comes to focus and productivity, they can hinder as well as help.</p> <p>“Tech makes communication quicker, more efficient and more accessible, allowing people from all over the world to work together – but it’s created a lot of distractions along the way,” says business coach and productivity expert <a href=\"http://moxieclub.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jess Salamanca</a>. “Having multiple tabs open, switching between communication platforms, not knowing how to use these tools correctly … all of these mean people get distracted. It can take up to 23 minutes to refocus on a task after switching from one to another. If you forget your password, or you’re struggling to find the right document, your focus can be disrupted – and when that happens multiple times throughout the day, it’s a lot of time wasted.”</p> <p>In fact, a comprehensive multinational <a href=\"https://www.zivver.com/blog/blog-the-freedom-to-focus-securely-empowered-employees-protected-businesses\" rel=\"nofollow\">survey</a> by Zivver found that an overwhelming 98% of employees want the freedom to focus. To reduce the number of interruptions experienced by employees, cyber-security consultant and chartered security professional <a href=\"http://bores.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">James Bore</a> recommends streamlining your tech.</p> <p>“Think carefully about the tools you use, rather than just piling them on,” says Bore. “Having one email and one instant messaging platform makes perfect sense, whether you’re working from home or in the office – but it makes less sense to have five different communication platforms. Keep what you do use clean, efficient, and narrowed down to what you’re actually using it for, rather than letting it expand and grow.”</p> <p><strong>Pressure to respond<br></strong>In an age of instant gratification, we all expect speedy responses to our messages. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305067456_Evolution_of_Conversations_in_the_Age_of_Email_Overload\" rel=\"nofollow\">Studies have shown</a> that the most likely reply time to an email is just two minutes, while half of responders will reply within an hour – and with instant communication tools, the pressure to respond quickly can be even greater.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57414ca2d3f1d0578d145a0c008e06422121b4ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57414ca2d3f1d0578d145a0c008e06422121b4ab/3_0_2094_2619/800.jpg\" alt=\"Business coach and productivity expert Jess Salamanca\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Business coach and productivity expert Jess Salamanca</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“One of the joys of email is that I can send a message, and you can reply when you feel like it,” says Bore. “But when you’re looking at platforms that are more real-time, there’s an impulse to respond instantly. It’s like someone walking up behind you and tapping your shoulder every five minutes.”</p> <p>Salamanca adds: “We do our best work when there are as few distractions as possible. The quality of the work you’re doing decreases a lot when your focus is interrupted, and in turn you can make more mistakes.”</p> <p>The answer is to either consolidate all your communications into one outlet – preferably an asynchronous one, such as email – or switch off notifications altogether when you need to concentrate.</p> <p>“Allowing yourself to not get distracted and flustered by new work or emails coming in means your brain stays focused on the task at hand, and you’re less likely to make a mistake – such as sending an email to the wrong person because you were thinking about them,” says systems strategist <a href=\"http://ellebaldry.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elle Baldry.</a> “If you give yourself the permission to take your time and do things properly – or ask your employer if it’s OK to switch off notifications for a period of time so you can work on one thing, rather than 30 at once – you’ll be happier and more productive.”</p> <p><strong>Security stress<br></strong>Ironically, worrying about security protocols can be distracting enough in itself to cause mistakes – especially in workplaces where multiple tools mean multiple processes to remember.</p> <p>“It’s one of those annoying balances in security, because we want people to be aware of the consequences of these things – but you can overdo it,” Bore says. “If you tell people that if they make even the smallest mistake there are horrendous consequences, they give up trying to control it and ignore security, because they’ve been taught that no matter what they do, bad things will happen. So there are consequences for pushing too hard on negative messaging.”</p> <p>To combat the fear factor, employers should make sure they’re protecting their systems from human error, with a secure communications platform such as Zivver, and supporting staff in its usage – especially if they make mistakes (and 62% of employees surveyed admit to making recent email errors).</p> <p>“It’s important to give staff the confidence to work the systems they’ve got to hand, and the confidence to say they need help, or have slipped up in some way, without major repercussions,” says Baldry. “You want to make sure they know you’ve got their back by providing a piece of software that’s going to make life easier for them and remove human error wherever possible. You’ll never get rid of it 100% – but there are steps you can take to vastly improve the situation.”</p> <p><strong>Overwork<br></strong>Mistakes due to human error are often due to being overloaded and having tight deadlines, which mean people simply don’t have the time to give their jobs and security protocols the level of focus they deserve.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fe12ceed838fac6493747e7f0fdf49d5c8255e72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe12ceed838fac6493747e7f0fdf49d5c8255e72/56_655_4372_5986/730.jpg\" alt=\"Cyber-security consultant James Bore\" width=\"730\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyber-security consultant James Bore</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The more tasks you’ve got, the faster you want to get through them,” says Bore. “Security goes out the window in favour of knowing once a task is done, you can move on.”</p> <p>Baldry adds: “If I’m rushing and on the go, my autofill takes over and people get gobbledygook from me. It’s also easy to attach the wrong document or copy the wrong person into an email because you’re typing the first three letters of their name, your software is automatically picking a person out of your address book, and you don’t have time to check it.”</p> <p>If employees are complaining that they don’t have time to focus on security, it might be a sign that they’re overworked.</p> <p>“Ask yourself why employees are making these mistakes,” says Baldry. “Is it due to the fear factor of: ‘If I don’t get this out, I’m going to be in trouble,’ and rushing through things? If so, you need a multi-pronged attack, sort out your tech, yes – but start with the users.”</p> <p><strong>Inadequate tools<br></strong>Unintended sharing of sensitive data accounts for <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/data-security-incident-trends/previous-reports/\" rel=\"nofollow\">almost 74% of all data leaks</a> (Excel file) – and if this sounds familiar, using secure outbound communication tools your employees can rely on should be a priority.</p> <p>“If you’re sending out the payroll spreadsheet, and it’s three o’clock on a Thursday afternoon, it’s easy to accidentally type ‘all staff’ rather than ‘all finance’ into the recipient line,” says Bore. “That’s not the fault of the people involved, because their job is to send information – if someone can accidentally send a sensitive document to the wrong person, or to people outside the company, you need to look at your controls around email.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/send-smarter/2022/aug/01/smart-sender-or-mail-fail-how-much-do-you-know-about-secure-communications-take-our-quiz\">Smart sender or mail fail – how much do you know about secure communications?

Thirty or so buyers from restaurants, shops and markets sit on one side of the large, cool room that smells like a rock pool. A conveyor belt divides the buyers from the workings of the room: two auctioneers and four men shifting hundreds of polystyrene boxes containing thousands of creatures. Fish that, minutes earlier, were unloaded from boats we watched return from the sea and dock in the canal that cuts through Fiumicino.</p> <p>If you’ve flown into Fiumicino airport, just outside Rome, there’s a chance you’ve seen the canal as the plane curves to land on a runway near the coast. It was constructed under the emperor Claudius in 46 AD, part of Portus, a large artificial harbour for a growing city sustained by an empire. Built to supplement Ostia, ancient Rome’s original mouth on the sea, Portus would eventually supplant it and for 500 years provided a vital conduit and mighty port. While the new name of Fiumicino is seen on maps dated 1582, the urban and port redevelopment took place in the early 1800s and streets were named with purpose: <em>Via del Tonno</em> (tuna), <em>Via dei Merluzzi (cod), Via dei Salmoni </em>(salmon)<em>, Via delle Ostriche </em>(oysters)<em>. </em>Today, 25 trawlers and crews can fish designated areas, then dock along the ancient waterway to bring 100 different species to the daily <em>asta </em>that takes place in a side street near the canal mouth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s a vivid stall of pink, silver and white, scales and shells that reflect the light </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have been to fish <em>aste</em> before, so I anticipate shouting. Here, though, it is relatively quiet, except for clicks as buyers press a tiny remote device. Boxes of fish are loaded on the conveyor belt, and also filmed so their contents appear on a screen; a fish shopping channel for those sitting near the door. An electronic indicator board details the type of fish, weight, cost, boat and fishing zone. The buyers click and claim anchovies, hake, mullet, red bandfish and even brighter red gurnard, mackerel-like <em>palamita</em>, kingfish, skate, cuttlefish, flying squid called <em>totani</em>, octopus, rose prawns and crabs.</p> <p>My son is with me and chats away to a buyer called Maurizio who, in-between clicks, tells him the names of the fish, and also secures our future custom by giving Luca what looks like a tiny shark. Early the next morning we return to Fiumicino to find Maurizio, who runs one of the last remaining stalls in the covered market. It’s a vivid stall of pink, silver and white, scales and shells that reflect the light. There’s a momentary moral dilemma; a good thing, I think – a reminder to think twice and ask questions. We taste local pink prawns and buy wedge clams called <em>telline</em>, and a crab with amazing legs.</p> <p>As a cook, eater and writer, I find the advice from the RSPCA and helpful, clear and <a href=\"https://www.rspca.org.uk/-/blog-crabs-have-feelings\">sobering</a>. Before cooking, crabs must be chilled or stunned into a sleep state (torpor) so they can be humanely killed by spiking with a pointed knife. The Marine Conservation Society’s <a href=\"https://www.mcsuk.org/goodfishguide/search\">Good Fish Guide</a> recommendations are just as blunt, a good thing in regard to food. At the moment, Shetland brown crabs are a good choice.</p> <h2><strong>Linguine with crab, lemon and herbs</strong></h2> <p>A beautiful dish from a beautiful creature, so serve immediately.</p> <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>10 min</strong><br>Serves<strong> 4</strong></p> <p><strong>300g white and brown crab meat</strong>, at room temperature<br><strong>1 unwaxed lemon<br>2 heaped tbsp finely chopped parsley<br></strong><strong>A pinch of dried oregano<br>120ml extra-virgin olive oil<br></strong><strong>1 small red chilli</strong>, finely chopped<br><strong>450g linguine or spaghetti</strong><br></p> <p>Bring a large pan of water to a boil, add salt, stir, then add the pasta.

At the time, he was working for a magazine, and had a huge passion for comics. “The magazine was half music, half comic,” he says. “I was going to do signings with all the artists and writers.”</p> <p>While having a drink with friends at the hotel bar, he spotted a beautiful girl. “There was another convention going on for orchid growers and I assumed she must be with them. There weren’t many women at comic conventions back then,” he says. About halfway through the evening, Mark’s friend Paul told him he was going to look for his sister, who was in Glasgow studying French and would be joining them for a drink. When he returned, he brought Ingrid. “She was the girl I’d been looking at earlier in the night,” says Mark.</p> <p>They began to chat and hit it off straight away. “I really liked him,” says Ingrid. “He had a very deep voice because he’d been drunkenly singing the night before, I think. He was a friend of my brother’s too, so I thought he must be OK.” They sat in the hotel bar and talked until 3am. “I had come out of a long relationship and had been feeling a bit low,” says Mark. “When I met Ingrid, it was like the clouds parted and the sun came through. She was so bright and funny.”</p> <p>The next day, they met up for another drink. “I was desperate to see Mark again,” says Ingrid. “I’d never really had a proper boyfriend before and it was all exhilarating and exciting.” By the end of the evening, they were holding hands under the table. “It turned into a naughty weekend,” laughs Ingrid. Mark was sharing a room with a friend, who kindly switched rooms to give them privacy. At the end of the convention, they exchanged numbers, but Ingrid admits she wasn’t sure she would see him again. “I lived in Glasgow and he was in London, I just thought it was a bit of fun.”</p> <p>They stayed in touch and Ingrid agreed to visit London in the summer, after her exams were over. “I was a diligent student and I wanted to get my studies over first,” she says.</p> <p>She arrived on a hot day and they spent the weekend exploring London. “I remember when I first saw him in the distance. I forgot to lick my fingers to take my chewing gum out and it stuck to my hands,” she says. “We both had a laugh about it, which was a great icebreaker.”</p> <p>After that, they began a long-distance relationship, before Ingrid moved to London in 1997. “We were living life to the full in the city,” says Mark. “We went to loads of gigs, festivals and drinks events through my work, and all our friends were in creative industries.” Ingrid says they were “always” going out. “Life seemed very free, and it was really easy to find temp jobs.”</p> <p>They married in Glasgow in 2000, and had their son, Felix, the following year. In 2004, they moved to Leeds, then to Glasgow in 2009. “I wanted to be closer to my mum,” says Ingrid. They have worked together to support their son, who was diagnosed with autism. “Felix is absolutely amazing. When you share something like that as a couple it’s quite empowering but it can be scary too.”</p> <p>It has been almost 30 years since they met, but Mark says his wife is exactly the same. “She’s incredibly funny and always surprises me. All the things I found irresistible when I first met her are still there.” Ingrid feels the same way. “He makes me piss myself laughing and we never tire of each other. He’s a really good person and it’s been quite a ride.”</p> <p><em>Want to share your story?

A child of the second world war, Daveau enjoyed her childhood in the French capital but she also longed for the mysteries of nature. It was an intellectual and spiritual passion that brought her as a graduate student in a male-dominated field to Africa, where she researched pastoral terrain in the semi-arid Sahelian Mauritania during the 1950s. Gruelling but rewarding, her academic work also led her to the love of her life, the Portuguese geographer Orlando Ribeiro.

Distracting musical interludes, where a series of location photographs are presented with no accompanying information, are the opposite of what a geographer seeks to accomplish.</p> <p>In the end, this documentary is lifted by Daveau’s personality; the way her voice sparkles with the same enthusiasm when she talks of her husband or her research shows that the pursuit of knowledge is not only cerebral but also emotional.</p> <p>• Suzanne Daveau is released in cinemas on 5 August, with a preview show on 4 August at the ICA, London.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/01/babies-sleep-easy-fixes-parents-children","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T10:00:20Z","webTitle":"Some babies sleep well, some don’t – beware those selling easy fixes | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/babies-sleep-easy-fixes-parents-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/babies-sleep-easy-fixes-parents-children","fields":{"headline":"Some babies sleep well, some don’t – beware those selling easy fixes","trailText":"As parents, we are bombarded with rituals and superstitions to get our children sleeping through the night, says Guardian columnist Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","byline":"Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett","body":"<p>I’m not going to tell you whether or not my baby is sleeping. If I say he is and your baby is not, then you will hate me. And if I say that he isn’t, I will immediately be bombarded with unsolicited advice, usually for a fee. The shysters are already circling.</p> <p>Besides, nothing lasts for ever. When the baby was very small and I wondered if he might become “a good sleeper”, other parents delighted in telling me about the four-month sleep regression. Then I found a scientific article claiming <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220131-the-science-of-safe-and-healthy-baby-sleep\">it was a myth</a> and decided that if I refused to believe in it, then it would not come for me. I’ll let you know how that goes, I could say, but I won’t. I’m very tired, but most of all I’m tired of talking and thinking about baby sleep.</p> <p>I keep reading that in the western world we are obsessed with getting our babies to sleep through the night, when in fact this is neither natural nor, from a safety perspective, desirable (as poet Louise Glück has it: “Human beings must be taught to love/ silence and darkness”). Thankfully for them, no one has attempted to say this to my face, or to the faces of any of the other new mothers I know, several of whom have not had more than two consecutive hours of sleep for months now. For it is not desirable nor safe to have parents losing their minds from sleep deprivation either.</p> <p>The cliche that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/26/parenthood-sleep-deprivation-after-birth-mothers-hit-hardest-research\">lack of sleep</a> is used as a means of torture is regularly trotted out, but the reality of what it can do to your brain is often skirted over, perhaps because it is simply too eerie, too gothic, too downright creepy to fully contemplate. “I became prey to daydreams and hallucinations, remembering conversations that had not occurred, glimpsing strange creatures through windows and in corners, a continual buzz of activity in my head both infernal and remote, as if a television had been left on in a next-door room,” says the writer Rachel Cusk.</p> <p>I think of Sylvia Plath’s words “cow-heavy and floral/ In my Victorian nightgown”, and remember how I prowled the house in the early weeks in my own Victorian nightgown, looking like Bertha Mason from Jane Eyre, and probably as much of a fire hazard. Forget operating heavy machinery, I could barely put one foot in front of the other and wept from exhaustion. The desire for sleep became something visceral and monstrous.</p> <p>Yet, in the small hours I would sit in the glow of the screen, trying to find the answer to “baby won’t sleep”, reading and reading until trying to sleep became pointless, because soon he would be awake again. The insomnia is almost more maddening, the irritating singsong of “sleep when the baby sleeps” echoing in your ears.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/29/my-kids-love-detective-stories-and-as-i-read-with-them-i-can-see-why\">My kids love detective stories – and, as I read with them, I can see why | Sophie Brickman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At some point, you become aware that there are different camps when it comes to sleep: the co-sleepers, the sleep trainers. I judge none of them because I have seen first-hand the effects of long-term sleep deprivation on a person: my autistic brother never slept. How my mother stayed sane, I cannot comprehend. Even now, many years later, she has developed a kind of stamina for baby care and an ability to cat nap that leaves me in awe. Recently I woke after sleeping a sleep of the dead to peer through the living room door at her snoozing on the sofa, my son sleeping peacefully next to her in his bassinet, and felt powerfully and tearfully grateful.</p> <p>And although the thought of a baby being left alone to cry in the dark makes me feel very sad – one baby book suggested keeping a clean set of sheets next to the crib during sleep training, as the baby would in all likelihood cry until he or she vomited – I understand that sometimes you have to try to save yourself in order to continue being able to parent.</p> <p>Factionalism helps no one, nor is it new. Previous generations had books by Richard Ferber, Gina Ford and a whole host of others, all saying they would be able to help their babies sleep. Our generation has Instagram <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/29/losing-my-mind-can-baby-sleep-gurus-really-help-exhausted-parents\">sleep consultants</a> with no qualifications to contend with. Trends wax and wane, from cry it out to the shush-pat method. We are told not to feed babies to sleep, to put them down “drowsy but awake”, to live our lives according to regimented nap times. The infant sleep industry in the US alone is apparently worth more than $325m. A £1,000 crib called the Snoo, which swaddles and rocks your baby to sleep in a way that I can’t help but feel is a little dystopian, is the must-have Instagram item (several mothers, friends or friends of friends have said that it does, however, work). We’ve come a long way from the apocryphal leaving the pram at the bottom of the garden.</p> <p>As parents, we engage in strange rituals and superstitions about baby sleep. At one stage I was convinced the reason my baby slept was because the mattress of his Ark pram bassinet was made from 100% pure wool. He slept so well in his pram that we would place its bassinet inside the Snuzpod – the bedside crib that allows you to “co-sleep” safely. Or maybe it was Ewan the Sheep, a pulsating sleep aid with millions of acolytes, or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/18/childless-childfree-child\">Mahler I played him</a> in the womb. My mother, meanwhile, used to drive me round north London at 2am in her nightgown. And then there’s the rocking and the singing and the white noise, the pink noise, the brown noise (who knew so many types of noise existed?).</p> <p>Ultimately, though, I’m not sure what any of it means. Of course there are things you can do, but much of how a baby sleeps seems to be simply internal, inherent. Some do, some don’t. But that isn’t something you can sell. Or not yet, anyway.</p> <p><strong>What’s working</strong> The boy loves the music of the 1950s, specifically All I Have to do is Dream by the Everly Brothers, so if you’ve seen me pounding the pavements as the dulcet tones pipe from the pram, wherein I have placed my phone, that is why. I fantasise about a pram with inbuilt speakers.</p> <p><strong>What’s not</strong> Speaking of the Victorians, it has occurred to me that a lot of the folk songs I’ve been singing to him are incredibly morbid, from “my grave will warmer, sweeter be” (Danny Boy) to “She died of a fever and no one could save her” (Molly Malone).

He rejects the claims that Greens policies, including dental on Medicare, scrapping student debt, increasing jobseeker, or investing in public housing are too expensive.<br></p> \n  <p>Chandler-Mather says the logic of insider interests is “best exemplified” when it comes to climate change, citing the fact “over 2 degrees of warming is exactly what 89% of this place supports”, because Labor doesn’t agree with the Greens’ push to ban new fossil fuel projects.<br></p> \n  <p>He says:<em>”Spending only a week in this place has been a stark lesson in how so much of the pomp, ceremony and rules of this place work to deepen and reinforce that disconnection. Literally the same week the Business Council was holding a special event in parliament house with the prime minister, children peacefully calling for action on climate change were dragged out by police.”</em><br></p> \n  <p>Chandler-Mather has a policy suggestion: the four-day work week “with no loss of pay”, which he says “would give people that most precious of resources: time”.<br><br>Chandler-Mather speaks about the Greens’ grassroots organising in Brisbane, telling voters in Griffith that political experts who said the minor party had no chance of winning Griffith were wrong, and they were right.<br><br>He clearly doesn’t think the Greens have tapped out at four lower house seats: “<em>Next time an expert or politician tells you it’s unrealistic to expect that in a wealthy country like Australia no one should go hungry or without a home ... know that when they tell you tax cuts for billionaires, more coal and gas, and mandatory detention of refugees is the best you can hope for - know that they’re wrong. Because if the Greens wins in Brisbane, Ryan and Griffith proved one thing it’s that the only barrier to change is our capacity to organise campaigns like this across the country. Our collective power terrifies the major parties and their corporate donors. But it should give you hope.”</em></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T09:25:31.376Z\">at 10.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e798ca8f08af33ff4a4ec3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T09:13:33.071Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Albanese on Coalition’s view on voice: ‘I believe they will support a change’</strong></p> \n  <p>Albanese says he has talked to Dutton about the voice and hopes he will support it: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is very important that this be a unifying moment for the nation.

manner that is fully consistent with our respective obligations under the [treaty], and relevant safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency,” the working paper reads.</p> \n

Official numbers record that <strong>more than 300,000 Australians each and every week of being infected with Covid</strong> and we know from zero sampling and other ways that <strong>the likely number is more than twice that.</strong></p> \n   <p>We think that as many as half of Australia has contracted Covid just over the course of this year so far. </p> \n   <p>Our focus is on getting through this wave.

Support is available through our standard medical system. States are operating long Covid clinics. </p> \n   <p>Their waiting lists are growing. It is increasingly clear to me that we will need to develop a focused response nationally to the phenomenon of long Covid. </p> \n   <p>I have already started work on the next phase of the government’s pandemic response, particularly beyond this winter and this third Omicron wave. I have already spoken to the Chief Medical Officer to introduce proposal around long Covid in particular. </p> \n   <p>I am keen to continue discussions with the member for Kooyong and other members of this place [regarding] this profound long-term health challenge that is proving so debilitating [and] distressing for so many Australian.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>• This post was amended on 1 August 2022 .

As a few people noted at the time, there was no consequence if NSW did nothing.<br></p> \n  <p>Anyway, the seemingly interminable approval for that Narrabri field has trundled along with <strong>Santos </strong>still to make a final financial sign-off of the deal.<br></p> \n  <p>That’s another way of saying: nothing extra can happen in terms of new gas supplies in the near term. It’s all about making sure what “excess” or uncontracted gas there’s floating around (some 167PJ<strong> </strong>of gas) doesn’t all get sucked up and shipped overseas. </p> \n  <p>Not the biggest ask, you’ve have to say, given we’ll be paying over-the-odds for it anyway (and way more than it’s costing to produce).<br></p> \n  <p>But the other point worth noting is what was in the <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Gas%20Inquiry%202017-2025%20Interim%20Report%20-%20January%202022_FA.pdf\"><strong>January ACCC report</strong></a><strong> <br></strong>but isn’t in this one.<br></p> \n  <p>Whereas that previous one highlighted “bans, moratoria and other regulatory restrictions on onshore exploration and development”, you won’t find words like that in this new ACCC report.<br></p> \n  <p>Similarly absent are paragraphs like this:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Government processes may be contributing to the lack of diversity and the slower development of new sources of supply. Governments play an important role in influencing the development of gas in the east coast gas market, with states and territories responsible for releasing acreage, granting permits to explore for, appraise and produce gas in tenements located onshore and within three nautical miles of the coast.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Guess what, that’s gone too.

That is:<em><br></em></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>We are considering privacy concerns raised in the Internet 2.0 report in line with our regulatory action policy.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Platforms and apps must be transparent in how they treat their users’ data and protect their privacy, particularly for vulnerable users such as children, and should only collect information that is reasonably necessary to deliver the service. In regards to consent, individuals need to be provided with genuine choices around how their personal information will be handled, and those choices need to be inherently fair.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Members of the public should also review their privacy settings regularly.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>As my colleague <strong>Alex Hern </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/20/tiktoks-privacy-problem-isnt-what-you-think\">wrote last month</a>, the problem with TikTok isn’t unique to TikTok. The kind of data the company seeks is what is called fingerprinting – which is used to track users across the internet for advertising purposes and what Apple is trying to crack down on – so the issue people have with TikTok is an issue they should also have with a lot of other non-Chinese companies.</p> \n  <p>Hern:<em><br></em></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>The problem with TikTok is no more and no less than the fact that it is a tremendously influential and important app, owned by a Chinese company. There is no technical data that will answer the question of whether that level of social and cultural power ‘should’ be in the hands of a company with roots in a geopolitical opponent.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T00:55:29.161Z\">at 1.55am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62e7202f8f08c00147328474\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-01T00:43:53.874Z\">1.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Karen Andrews moves motion on Department of Home Affairs</strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Karen Andrews</strong> is moving a motion in the house on home affairs – the former minister is upset with the changes Labor has made to the portfolio.

The manufacturers said to the consumers, without reprimand or regulation: “These things are great. Consume them.” Today – after many decades of fashionably lighting up – the evils of cigarettes are finally accepted and frowned upon, with new bans put into place. Love Island is on that very same, long trajectory.</p> <p>The (leftwing) media is peppered with hot takes surrounding the moral disgrace that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\">Love Island</a>. With each new season, the public concern gets slightly louder – but despite hearing the echoes, we can’t quite kick this nightly habit. We have a feeling, deep down, that it’s bad – but we “love to hate it”; we are “just so addicted”.</p> <p>We talk ourselves in circles that lead us nowhere – feeling guilty for consuming it, then watching again and adoring every second, then realising something this hypnotically addictive can’t be good for us – but it’s on every night, and there’s no real reason to stop, is there?</p> <p>How many people, back in the 50s, behaved similarly whenever they craved a cigarette? How many had a sneaky feeling it was wrong, but then looked up and saw a massive cigarette advert – “More Doctors Smoke Camels than any other cigarette!” – plastered to one of those rickety Routemaster buses? Just today, I saw a lit-from-behind ITV advert in the train station, next to the ones for the banks and the phone companies, which said: “WE OWN LOVE.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"297ad9e2e07d8f34fc986fbfb5015feb5de9624a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/297ad9e2e07d8f34fc986fbfb5015feb5de9624a/0_19_1792_1405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christina Hendricks in Mad Men\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smoking gun … Christina Hendricks in Mad Men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there’s the added factor of social media; closing in on the people we think have acted wrongly, like flies swarming around a bin. It makes sense. The ability to call out behaviour we see as unacceptable, even triggering a wider conversation about it in the process, is one of the few plus points of Twitter and Instagram. We are holding one another accountable for our actions, and why not? Why not desperately wrangle this reality TV show into the reluctant position of “exemplary moral compass”? “Be kind,” we say, but also, “Jacques should rot for ever in hell for the way he’s treated Paige”. We send the tweet, ignoring the most sinister fact that some people who have been on the show went on to end their own lives.</p> <p>The obsession lingers all day. We hit the mid-afternoon procrastination slump, open a new tab, and read a piece about how the show’s organised misogyny is increasing at an exponential and societally harmful rate. There are clear signs of group female-targeted bullying in the villa this year, says the internet, and the producers really should rectify it. We lean back in our ergonomic chairs, gaze into the jungle-esque vista of houseplants we have created for ourselves and think, “You know, that’s actually so true.”</p> <p>That night, though, we obviously watch it again. You’re telling me Davide and Ekin-Su are still arguing? This is huge. I must fold myself on to the sofa like a shrimp this instant, and watch the dispute unfold in its entirety. When we’re watching Love Island, its myriad issues fade into the background for the hour. It soothes us; it itches a part of our brain we didn’t know needed scratching.</p> <p>Knowing that it’s bad for humanity isn’t enough to make us stop – because we do know that it’s bad. At best, it is brain-rotting; at a medium, it can negatively affect the societal code of acceptable behaviour; and at worst, it is lethal. We’ve seen this before, though, an infinite number of times – cigarettes, opium, freak shows, whole swathes of human vices we U-turned on – and we know that time is the only solution.</p> <p>Right now, an act of human will, even a collective one, is not enough to compete with the powers making money from reality TV. It’s just too good, and not properly bad enough, for any significant group of people to stop consuming it. We must, it seems, push these things to their most harmful limit, stretching as much profit out of them as we possibly can, before as a society we backtrack on ourselves, stub it out and go, “Wait, actually … no. Enough.”</p> <p>• <em>Iona David’s book,</em><em> Is This Love or Dopamine?</em><em> (</em><em>Harper Collins, £14.99</em><em>) is out now</em>. <em>To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/is-this-love-or-dopamine-9780008513733\">guardianbookshop.com</a>.

That dynamic has now shifted, with Gemili deciding to leave the Tumbleweed Track Club in Florida, where Reider trains many of the world’s top sprinters, including the Olympic 200m champion, Andre De Grasse, and the world 100m silver and bronze medallists Marvin Bracy and Trayvon Bromell.</p> <p>Gemili’s decision comes after Reider has continued to make headlines off the track. In Eugene, he was denied accreditation by World Athletics and was then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/17/under-investigation-sprint-coach-apprehended-and-cautioned-in-eugene\">cautioned by police</a> for gaining unauthorised access to the warm-up area.

The Arwing was added as a programmer’s shortcut to, essentially, teach a dragon how to fly. Once the dragon was airborne, the ship was hidden away in Ocarina of Time’s source code, where hackers unearthed it 22 years later.</p> <p>“It’s amazing to me that it was there all this time – it just took a lot of digging to find it,” says Billy Basso, a game developer from Chicago. “It’s completely inessential, but it helps people bond with how games are made, the creators behind them and the time and place. It connects you to history in a way.” Basso hopes to foster similar connections with Animal Well, an eerie pixel-art cave system which its creator hopes will have plenty of secrets left to uncover a decade from now.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.animalwell.net/\">Animal Well</a> you play a squishy emoji-style critter in a world of “ambiguously hostile” larger organisms that range from giant ghost dogs to extremely creepy flamingos. There are no level-ups or traditional weapons: as in a horror game, “you never feel able to dominate your environment.” Rather, progress is about using deceptively homely cartoon objects such as Frisbees and yo-yos to interact with other animals and avoid becoming their dinner.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4i5CMOliF0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X4i5CMOliF0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While Animal Well’s winding subterranean geography recalls Metroid, interactions with creatures riff on the whimsical item puzzles of point-and-click adventures such as Monkey Island, albeit with several different solutions per puzzle. Some are fairly obvious: dogs go well with Frisbees, for instance. Others, Basso hopes, will take years to unravel. Animal Well is a single-player game, but players may still need to collaborate, even if it’s only by trading theories on forums and social media. Basso also plans to encrypt the source code so that players can’t hack out the secrets, as they did with Ocarina of Time.</p> <p>This obfuscation isn’t just for the sake of challenge. Animal Well is a quiet protest about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/22/pushing-buttons-retro-games-nintendo\">the dismal state of video game preservation</a> in an online age, aimed especially at live service games that are playable only as long as publishers keep the servers running. “Even with the PS3 and Xbox 360 generation, I’m running into issues logging into those accounts, downloading games or patching them,” says Basso. “It’s already an issue, and it’s going to be so much worse for the generation following that.”</p> <p>Animal Well, by contrast, is built to last. “If I’m doing puzzles that maybe take 10 years to solve, I want the game to be playable 10 years from now.” The game doesn’t rely on third-party tools such as Unity that may lose compatibility over time, and Basso may ultimately host it himself rather than leaving it at the mercy of a digital store such as Steam. Animal Well is also designed to run more independently of your PC’s operating system or configuration than other games, to get around compatibility issues.</p> <p>Basso plans to release Animal Well in a finished state, with no updates or downloadable extras to boost sales after launch. Like games from before the broadband revolution, he wants it to feel “like this physical artefact that already has everything hidden in plain sight”.</p> <p>Where Ocarina of Time’s fossilised Arwing was an accident of circumstances, Animal Well is a deliberate time capsule, a refuge for its creator’s daydreams and nightmares that invites further discussion about the video game community’s struggle to safeguard its own history. It’s a fascinating project, and a poignant one. “The world will change around the game, and the way it interacts with the game will change,” Basso comments. “But the game itself won’t.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Animal Well will debut on PlayStation 5 and Steam; release date to be confirmed</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2022/aug/01/gentleman-jack-hat-to-olly-alexander-cape-10-objects-queer-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T09:00:19Z","webTitle":"From Gentleman Jack’s hat to Olly Alexander’s cape: 10 objects that tell Britain’s queer history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/01/gentleman-jack-hat-to-olly-alexander-cape-10-objects-queer-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/aug/01/gentleman-jack-hat-to-olly-alexander-cape-10-objects-queer-britain","fields":{"headline":"From Gentleman Jack’s hat to Olly Alexander’s cape: 10 objects that tell Britain’s queer history","trailText":"With drag queens’ dresses, erotic drawings, even a prison door, Queer Britain’s new exhibition distills centuries of LGBTQ+ life.

Fifty years on, the capital is host to another important milestone: the arrival of <a href=\"https://queerbritain.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Queer Britain</a>, the UK’s first national LGBTQ+ museum.</p> <p>Three months after the museum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/28/inside-queer-britain-first-lgbtq-museum\" title=\"\">opened in Kings Cross</a>, its first exhibition is now open to the public.

Here are 10 pieces from the show that capture the essence of the UK’s modern queer history.</p> <h2><strong>Oscar Wilde’s prison cell door</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88ac212e5b08927d1d8f2558dad6a50e2c51fed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88ac212e5b08927d1d8f2558dad6a50e2c51fed8/0_68_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wilde’s cell door, on show at Queer Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilde’s cell door, on show at Queer Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You are immediately greeted in the exhibition by the door of the prison cell that confined Oscar Wilde in 1895. The celebrated Irish writer was imprisoned on the charge of gross indecency after his relationship with another man was discovered. He died three years after his release, destitute and outcast. He left behind a complicated legacy of flamboyance, fear, inspiration and injustice. Wilde’s experience of being villainised by the media and persecuted by the state has made him an icon for many LGBTQ+ people and, as curator Dawn Hoskin says, the piece is also symbolic of the doors he opened for later generations.</p> <p>At Queer Britain, the cell door is displayed alongside a cover of the Gay Liberation Front magazine Come Together<em>, </em>which ran from 1970 to 1973. It reads “Oscar power to Oscar people”, reflecting Wilde’s enduring significance in queer British history. “In the museum space, the door literally casts a shadow,” Hoskin says. “It’s representative of how Wilde’s legacy and the homophobia of that time created a shadow, too.” Also displayed is a 1909 edition of Wilde’s De Profundis, written during his imprisonment and published after his death. It belongs to Queer Britain co-founder Joseph Galliano-Doig. “I found this copy of De Profundis when I was 14 and anxious about being gay. It saved my life,” he says. “It made me feel seen, comforted and angry.”</p> <h2><strong>Duncan Grant erotic watercolour</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a638526416dd4bc6d4b270f470dcbd1976ce4c47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a638526416dd4bc6d4b270f470dcbd1976ce4c47/825_193_4857_4163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Duncan Grant erotic watercolour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"857\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The visual arts have always been a haven for queer expression, recording lives, loves and emotions long before the LGBTQ+ acronym existed. Duncan Grant, one of Britain’s most famous mid-20th-century painters, navigated a time when gay and bisexual people risked legal persecution in expressing and representing their lives. He was born in 1885, seven months before an act was passed in parliament that criminalised all male homosexual sex in England (the same law under which Wilde was imprisoned).</p> <p>In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/08/lost-erotic-drawings-duncan-grant\" title=\"\">more than 400 erotic drawings by Grant were found under a bed</a>. “Everybody thought they had been destroyed,” said Dr Darren Clarke, head of collections at Charleston, the Sussex farmhouse where Grant lived and worked. The 422 works were created in the 1940s and 50s, a time when male homosexuality was still illegal, and depict “every conceivable act of couples”, as Clarke <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54447684\" title=\"\">put it in 2020.</a> “It’s quite a kama sutra of Duncan Grant’s sexual imagination.” The collection was secretly passed from lover to lover, and from friend to friend. Due to the vulnerability of old watercolours to excessive light, Queer Britain will showcase three of Grant’s drawings on rotation; the choices will become gradually racier over time.</p> <p>“All of the drawings have a tenderness and intimacy to them,” says Hoskin. “The first piece has a gentle hand on the thigh and represents making the ‘first move’, which is connected to what the museum is doing with our first exhibition, too.”</p> <h2><strong>Rotimi Fani-Kayode portrait by Robert Taylor</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75dd0807236550876c7d39f10e49d84eb585b45f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75dd0807236550876c7d39f10e49d84eb585b45f/902_66_4696_4326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Taylor’s portrait of Rotimi Fani-Kayode.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"921\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Rotimi Fani-Kayode was a photographer who moved from his home in Nigeria to England in 1966, at the age of 12, to escape the Nigerian civil war. While working in New York he became friendly with Robert Mapplethorpe, whom he cited as an influence on his work exploring tensions between sexuality, race and culture. Fani-Kayode was living in Brixton when he died at age 36 from an Aids-related illness in 1989.</p> <p>British photographer Robert Taylor met Fani-Kayode in 1987, and the two became fast friends, with Taylor saying: “My passion for photography was sparked by a richly rewarding friendship with Rotimi.” His portrait of Fani-Kayode symbolises the radical love between black queer men, speaking to a wider story of queer loss and survival, with Fani-Kayode’s legacy living on through Taylor’s work.</p> <p>“I was very conscious of getting across the idea of ‘living legacies’ and people inspiring each other by making personal connections,” Hoskin says. “For queer people in particular, inspiration has not always been about seeing someone in a book – it can come from meeting friends and forming close, intimate relationships.”</p> <h2><strong>Hat from Gentleman Jack</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2baca7201ba31580108437f85328ca30fbf1a7e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2baca7201ba31580108437f85328ca30fbf1a7e5/0_0_5029_3499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suranne Jones as Anne Lister in the BBC series Gentleman Jack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suranne Jones as Anne Lister in the BBC series Gentleman Jack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Brooks/BBC/Lookout Point/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anne Lister was a Yorkshire-born industrialist, writer and landowner who is considered to be “the first modern lesbian”. Lister’s diaries recorded her daily life and, in code, her many relationships with women, which started during her school days. Her appearance was considered masculine and she dressed only in black, which is why she came to be known (generally unkindly) as “Gentleman Jack”. Her final relationship was with Ann Walker, to whom she was symbolically married in Holy Trinity church in York, which is now celebrated as the birthplace of lesbian marriage in Britain. Lister’s diaries, a rare first-person account of life as a pre-20th-century lesbian, were recently brought to life in the TV drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/15/gentleman-jack-has-genuinely-saved-lives-readers-respond-to-the-shows-cancellation\" title=\"\">Gentleman Jack</a>. This black hat, which was worn by Suranne Jones in the BBC/HBO series, is based around the signature look Lister wore every day. “I love and only love the fairer sex … my heart revolts from any love but theirs,” she once wrote. </p> <h2><strong>Switchboard </strong><strong>logbook</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"535d162e6a181e9ff22af9b3b9514c339e24d196\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/535d162e6a181e9ff22af9b3b9514c339e24d196/0_104_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Switchboard logbook.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Switchboard, a helpline for anyone who wants to talk about gender identity and sexuality, has been taking calls since 1974. In the days when being in the closet was the norm and any semblance of equality felt like a pipe dream, Switchboard provided a lifeline – and it still does today. Displayed at Queer Britain is the volunteers’ logbook, which offers insight into the range of issues facing LGBTQ+ people in Britain, with stories of curiosity, fear, friendship and loss. This exhibit, from 1987, records a time when Switchboard was the leading source of information on HIV/Aids.</p> <p>Alongside the logbook, visitors to Queer Britain can listen to a selection of actual calls from the archive, featuring Switchboard volunteers such as Lisa Power – a Stonewall co-founder and Queer Britain trustee.</p> <h2><strong>Divine’s octopus dress</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26413eb7bca90a4796334b88f9b897314f0788d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26413eb7bca90a4796334b88f9b897314f0788d6/0_393_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Divine’s octopus dress, a short, orange halter-neck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Divine’s octopus dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Divine (1945-1988) was a titan of drag from the era before RuPaul’s Drag Race catapulted the art form into the mainstream. Known for their work with gay film-maker John Waters, Divine was named the “drag queen of the century” by People magazine upon their death in 1988.</p> <p>Divine’s work was particularly pioneering because, at the time, drag was preoccupied with prettiness and pageantry. Instead, they explored beauty in dark, sexy and confusing forms. Hoskin says this feels closely connected to British drag, despite Divine’s US roots. “Divine was about revelling in the weird and the unusual. There was always a challenging element of: am I going to be made to laugh, or be a bit scared? That is what I really like about British drag, which has a similar basis in humour and observation.”</p> <p>Before their death, Divine toured the UK in the 1980s, performing high-energy disco tracks on Top of the Pops and on a boat on the Thames at Pride. This orange octopus dress became synonymous with Divine’s later years and was the inspiration behind Ursula the Sea Witch, the villain in Disney’s The Little Mermaid, which was released a year after Divine’s death. The dress is displayed alongside a series of portraits of today’s drag performers in Divine-inspired looks, shot by photographer Darren Evans.</p> <h2><strong>Rainbow hijab ensemble</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"023f175f5228ffbd530c62a58336af7bdbda6fd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/023f175f5228ffbd530c62a58336af7bdbda6fd6/0_49_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faiz’s multicoloured hijab, with the mannequin’s hand resting on the shoulder of another female mannequin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 2005, representatives from LGBTQ+ Muslim charity <a href=\"https://imaanlondon.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Imaan</a> marched at London Pride. Faizan Faiz, the organisation’s co-founder, wore a rainbow hijab to make a statement about the erasure and marginalisation queer Muslims have faced, from outside and also from within the LGBTQ+ community. “On the 2005 Pride march, we were jeered by gay Islamophobes and in defiance we gave a speech to 10,000 people at Trafalgar Square,” they say in the notes accompanying the exhibit. Just as the Pride flag symbolises different people coming together, the rainbow hijab represents the union of queer and Muslim identities. “If my mum had known her handiwork would end up in an art gallery, would she have viewed me being LGBTQ+ differently?” Faiz adds.</p> <p>Hoskin says that, while it would have been easy to curate an exhibition that was purely celebratory, she was keen not to erase challenging moments like this. “We shouldn’t just be talking about the idea of an LGBTQ+ community versus wider society, but should also be looking within and questioning how inclusive and open to diversity we actually are,” she says.<strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>Lady Phyll and Christine Burns statues</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21d948bd06721187e726c335af3c01e4182f7622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21d948bd06721187e726c335af3c01e4182f7622/0_321_6574_3944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Figures of Christine Burns (left) and Lady Phyll.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Figures of Christine Burns (left) and Lady Phyll.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the start of 2018, there were 925 public statues in the UK – just 158 of which depicted women, and only 25 of which depicted non-mythical or non-royal women. (By contrast, there were more statues of men named John.) The <a href=\"https://putherforward.com/\" title=\"\">Put Her Forward</a> project set out to change this by making 25 three-dimensional printed statues of inspirational women. Activists Christine Burns and Phyll Opoku-Gyimah (known more widely as Lady Phyll) were among the 25 women selected. Burns, whose statue previously stood in Manchester, was a key negotiator in the creation of the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, while working with trans equality organisation Press for Change.

Performing at Glastonbury festival in 2016, Alexander wore a vibrant rainbow cape and delivered a rousing speech on LGBTQ+ rights, where he called for the elimination of racism, ableism and misogyny. “Sometimes I’m afraid but I’m never ashamed. I am proud of who I am,” he said, wrapped in the colours of the Pride flag. “Say ‘No thank you, fear!’”</p> <p>There is a dialogue between Alexander’s cape and a nearby item in the exhibition: a handwritten letter from Elton John to his teenage self, in which he urges himself to let go of his fears – and change his name. He and Alexander have since performed gay anthem <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk4eMIswunQ\" title=\"\">It’s a Sin</a> together at the 2021 Brit Awards. This cape is a reminder that the visibility of Alexander’s generation follows years of struggle and silence.</p> <p>“Sometimes, for older queer people, seeing younger people discover themselves sooner and have that freedom of expression is wonderful and joyful to see,” Hoskin says. “But also, that might be tinged with a bit of sadness. We wanted to create space for that intergenerational dialogue.”</p> <h2><strong>Trans Pride placards</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10e34744e7158c7589a1e6fbc66aa035c527b8c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10e34744e7158c7589a1e6fbc66aa035c527b8c5/0_643_6395_3837/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Placards reading “Fags fight for our trans youth” and “Trans and proud”\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, many of the larger-scale Pride festivals were cancelled. In their place, Trans Pride emerged as a radical alternative for people who consider Pride to be a political protest. These placards were collected at London Trans Pride 2022, where 20,000+ people marched in defiant joy, but also rage at the hostility and state-sanctioned prejudice being directed towards trans people.<strong> </strong>Reflecting on the past 50 years, these handmade signs are a visual record of how much Pride has evolved, while maintaining its founding principles of queer solidarity and resistance.</p> <p>“These placards capture a colourful combination of joy, fierceness and emotional urgency, as well as the process of advocating for yourself and being an ally to others,” Hoskin says. “We are a museum, but we’re very much a ‘museum of now’. We don’t have to wait for years to respond. We’re able to do that quickly, in the moment.”</p> <p><em>• Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Whelan, who also holds passports from Canada, the UK and Ireland, has repeatedly denied the charges and claims that he was set up.</p> <p>The US government has denounced Whelan’s charges as false and declared both Whelan and Griner were being “wrongfully detained”.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, announced that the US has made a “substantial proposal” to Russia to release Whelan and Griner. Although Blinken refused to say what the US was offering in return, a source familiar with the matter <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/blinken-says-he-will-press-lavrov-us-proposal-bring-home-griner-whelan-2022-07-27/\">confirmed</a> a CNN report that Washington was willing to swap Bout, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence in the US, as part of the exchange.</p> <p>Prisoner swaps have been a long part of the history between the two former cold war adversaries. The first major exchange between the US and the Soviet Union occurred in February 1962 when Americans gave up Rudolf Abel, a convicted KGB spy, in exchange for American pilot Gary Powers, whose U2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union two years earlier. The exchange, which took place on the fog-covered Glienicke Bridge on a cold, cloudy Berlin morning, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/05/bridge-of-spies-film-review-tom-hanks-steven-spielberg-cold-war-gary-powers-u2\">adapted</a> into a Steven Spielberg thriller more than 50 years later.</p> <p>The Powers-Abel exchange paved the way for further prisoner swaps. A little over 20 years later, the US conducted what one American official called the “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/weekinreview/the-world-free-to-spy-another-day.html\">biggest spy swap</a>” in history. The US released four eastern European spies in exchange for 25 people detained in East Germany and Poland. In more recent memory, 10 Russian agents detained by the US were exchanged in 2010 for four Russian officials that the Kremlin had jailed over their illegal contacts with the west.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23c1b9eebc7fffa7963cf2fe7525e69d733decd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23c1b9eebc7fffa7963cf2fe7525e69d733decd5/0_249_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Whelan holds a sign as he stands inside a defendants’ cage during his verdict hearing in Moscow on 15 June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Whelan holds a sign as he stands inside a defendants’ cage during his verdict hearing in Moscow on 15 June 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In April, former US marine Trevor Reed was released back to the US after being detained in Russia since 2019. Russian authorities had accused Reed of attacking a Moscow police officer and sentenced him to nine years in jail. In exchange for Reed, the US released jailed pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was sentenced in 2011 to 20 years in prison for conspiring to import more than $100m worth of cocaine into the US.</p> <p>Despite these exchanges, none have quite involved the notoriety of a figure like Bout. Born in 1967 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, to a bookkeeper and a car mechanic, Bout went on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/viktor-bout-brittney-griner-paul-whelan-prisoner-swap\">train</a> as an interpreter at Moscow’s Soviet Military Institute of Foreign Languages.</p> <p>Rumoured to speak six languages, Bout developed a decades-long career by acquiring Soviet military transport planes and filling them with various weapons that were left behind after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Since then, Bout has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/17/magazine/arms-and-the-man.html\">supplied</a> weapons to conflicts around the world including Afghanistan, Angola, Congo, Lebanon, Somalia and Yemen.</p> <p>For decades, governments and rebels fought each other with weapons that Bout sold to either side.</p> <p>In 2008, Bout was arrested in Bangkok after he was caught on camera trying to sell weapons for use against Americans by undercover US Drug Enforcement Administration agents. He was convicted in a New York court in 2011 and was sentenced to 25 years at a federal prison in Marion, Illinois.</p> <p>Reports of Bout’s potential release have since been met with an array of emotions.</p> <p>Kathi Austin, founder of the Conflict Awareness Project, a non-profit that investigates major arms traffickers, expressed concerns over the possibility of Bout’s release.</p> <p>“I spent nearly 15 years chasing Bout around the globe to stop his trade in death … My life and that of other colleagues and UN peacekeepers were put on the line to bring him to justice,” she told the Guardian.</p> <p>“You cannot imagine how much I have emotionally struggled with the idea of Bout’s release … Putin knew very well what he was doing by making Brittney Griner a bargaining chip … In a post-release situation … Putin is certain to weaponize Bout in areas of the world where the Merchant of Death has a proven track record,” she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e74d95d505d39ca71511bbb049e47c4bc2fa9a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e74d95d505d39ca71511bbb049e47c4bc2fa9a6/0_337_4952_2974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Viktor Bout waits in a holding cell in Bangkok on 9 March 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Viktor Bout waits in a holding cell in Bangkok on 9 March 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sukree Sukplang/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Daryl Kimball, executive director of the nonpartisan membership organization Arms Control Association, echoed Austin’s concerns.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Kimball said: “Releasing Viktor Bout … could certainly lead to adverse consequences … If he is part of a prisoner swap with Russia, it could damage future efforts to hold accountable those who illegally facilitate dangerous weapons transfers to warlords, conflict zones and undemocratic regimes.”</p> <p>Jodi Vittori, a former air force lieutenant colonel who is now a professor at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service, said: “Given that Mr Bout has been incarcerated since then, it is unlikely that his arms trade networks remain significantly intact.”</p> <p>Nevertheless, Vittori expressed concern over the irony of such a proposal, saying: “Trading American hostages for a notorious Russian arms trafficker with the ominous moniker of the Merchant of Death sends the world mixed messages at a time when the United States is striving to arm Ukraine as it fights for its life and democracy against Russia.”</p> <p>Jordan Cohen, a defense policy and arms sale analyst at the Cato Institute, cast doubt on Bout’s ability to cause harm in the short term if he is released. “US and western intelligence will likely track him and his network to make sure no sudden arms trafficking deals are happening. Beyond that, his years in prison and solitary confinement also likely diminished his ability to quickly mobilize his network,” Cohen told the Guardian.</p> <p>Others have praised the Biden administration for its proposal. Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, tweeted: “I applaud @SecBlinken &amp; @StateDept efforts to bring Britney Griner and Paul Whelan home even if it means handing over Viktor Bout.”</p> <p>However, he urged the state department to also include Marc Fogel in the deal. Fogel, a former history teacher at the Anglo-American School in Moscow, was arrested last August after trying to enter Russia with medical marijuana that his doctor prescribed him to treat “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/marc-fogel-russia/index.html\">severe spinal pain</a>”. Russian authorities sentenced him to 14 years of hard labor, accusing him of committing “large-scale drugs smuggling”.</p> <p>“The tragic situations of Brittney Griner and Marc Fogel seem very similar. So I would hope Fogel could be included in a package deal. Getting three innocent Americans back, not just two, for one real criminal, seems like a good trade to me,” McFaul, whose sons Fogel taught at the Anglo-American School, told the Guardian.</p> <p>In an interview with the Washington Post, Jane Fogel said that her hopes of securing her husband’s release have been fading, saying: “There’s a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that Marc will be left behind.”</p> <p>While Griner’s wife received a call from Joe Biden, Fogel’s family has been stalled at the state department’s “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/07/28/marc-fogel-teacher-russia-prison/\">mid-functionary level</a>”. In a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/07/28/marc-fogel-teacher-russia-prison/\">letter</a> Marc Fogel recently addressed to his family regarding the prisoner swap reports that the Washington Post reviewed, he wrote: “That hurt … Teachers are at least as important as bballers.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, others have criticized the irony of the state department’s proposal as hundreds of thousands of Americans remain incarcerated over marijuana charges.</p> <p>The Libertarian party of New Hampshire responded to the news of the prisoner swap by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LPNH/status/1552375673267920902?s=20&amp;t=EwdLFRGqLkt6VeuR95Hw9g\">writing</a> about action on drug offenses in the US, saying: “America is mad at Russia for doing to Brittney Griner what it does to 374,000 people per year.”</p> <p>Another user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jSpechal/status/1541489449225306114?s=20&amp;t=K49_X1y9CpyDlRVOVyJCQA\">tweeted</a>: “I often wonder how Americans who have family members still in American prisons over weed, feels watching this entire #BrittneyGriner thing unfolds?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2022/aug/01/poem-of-the-week-sonnet-lxx-by-charlotte-smith","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T09:00:18Z","webTitle":"Poem of the week: Sonnet LXX by Charlotte Smith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2022/aug/01/poem-of-the-week-sonnet-lxx-by-charlotte-smith","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2022/aug/01/poem-of-the-week-sonnet-lxx-by-charlotte-smith","fields":{"headline":"Poem of the week: Sonnet LXX by Charlotte Smith","trailText":"A lonely poet has been warned against a wandering ‘lunatic’ but feels more envy of his mental state than fear","byline":"Carol Rumens","body":"<h2>Sonnet LXX</h2> <p><strong>On Being Cautioned Against Walking on an Headland Overlooking the Sea, Because it was Frequented by a Lunatic</strong></p> <p>Is there a solitary wretch who hies<br>To the tall cliff, with starting pace or slow,<br>And, measuring, views with wild and hollow eyes<br>Its distance from the waves that chide below;<br>Who, as the sea-born gale with frequent sighs<br>Chills his cold bed upon the mountain turf,<br>With hoarse, half-uttered lamentation, lies<br>Murmuring responses to the dashing surf?<br>In moody sadness, on the giddy brink,<br>I see him more with envy than with fear;<br><em>He</em> has no <em>nice felicities</em> that shrink<br>From giant horrors; wildly wandering here,<br>He seems (uncursed with reason) not to know<br>The depth or the duration of his woe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"slim volume\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style=&quot;padding: 0px; margin: 0px; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;.left-rule:before,.right-rule:before{content:'';float:left;width:43%;height:1px;border-top:1px dotted #bdbdbd;margin-top:12px}.right-rule:before{content:'';float:right}svg{display:block;margin:auto}p{margin:0px}#wrapper{margin:0px}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;left-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;right-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;svg version=&quot;1.1&quot; width=&quot;30px&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot; id=&quot;Layer_1&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot; x=&quot;0px&quot; y=&quot;0px&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 30 24.8&quot; enable-background=&quot;new 0 0 30 24.8&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot; fill=&quot;#fdadba&quot;&gt; &lt;path d=&quot;M29.3,1.4C26.2,0.5,23.4,0,21.2,0c-3.4,0-5.2,1-6.2,1.9C14,1,12.2,0,8.8,0c-2.3,0-5,0.5-8.1,1.4L0,1.6v23l1.3-0.4 C4.2,23.4,6.7,23,8.8,23c4.2,0,5.2,1.8,5.2,1.9l1.9,0c0,0,0.9-1.9,5.2-1.9c2.1,0,4.6,0.4,7.5,1.3l1.3,0.4v-23L29.3,1.4z M8.8,20.9 c-2,0-4.2,0.3-6.8,1V3.1C4.6,2.4,6.9,2,8.8,2c3.7,0,4.9,1.4,5.2,1.8v18.3C12.9,21.5,11.3,20.9,8.8,20.9z M28,21.9 c-2.6-0.7-4.9-1-6.8-1c-2.5,0-4.1,0.5-5.2,1.1V3.8C16.3,3.4,17.5,2,21.2,2c1.9,0,4.2,0.4,6.8,1.1V21.9z&quot;/&gt; &lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Charlotte Smith (1749-1806) was born into a wealthy family. Her father, owned estates in Surrey and Sussex, but financial misadventures forced him to sell off much of his land, and Charlotte, motherless from the age of four, was forced into marriage at 15 to a slave trader, Benjamin Smith. Smith had financial misadventures of his own that resulted in his imprisonment in a debtors’ prison in France: Charlotte, a political radical opposed to slavery, had little choice but to join him. On their return to England, she left Benjamin and set about supporting herself and the children. Although an assiduous novelist, she thought of herself primarily as a poet, and her first collection, Elegiac Sonnets and Other Essays was published to some acclaim. Walter Scott, Wordsworth and Coleridge were <a href=\"https://wordsworth.org.uk/blog/2020/11/06/charlotte-smith-pioneer-of-romanticism/\">among its admirers</a>.</p> <p>Smith wrote about the Sussex landscape from first-hand observation, her sense of the dramatic challenging any idea that this part of England was merely a tame, fashionable resort. Unsurprisingly, given her formative experiences, her emotional orientation was towards the shadowy, nocturnal and mournful. This week’s poem, which didn’t appear until the second edition of the Elegiac Sonnets, broadens the focus on the natural world to include the human and social, although the figure of the lunatic is absorbed into the imaginative darkness the poet characteristically inhabited.</p> <p>Cleverly, she devotes the first eight lines of the sonnet to an extended question. Its elements fused by the tight rhyme scheme (ababacac), it seems to ask if such a person as the “lunatic” exists, and, in so doing, allows the poet to build up a possible picture of him and his actions.</p> <p>Despite the conventional “wild and hollow eyes”, she treats the figure with objectivity and a certain realism. He may move “with starting pace or slow” – suggesting, perhaps, an erratic mixture of the two. She imagines his sleeping rough on a “bed” of cold, windswept turf. He’s seen to note the distance of the clifftop from the surf beneath, perhaps conjuring a possibility of suicide. That object is abandoned. Smith ends her portrayal by asking if the lunatic “with hoarse, half-uttered lamentation, lies / Murmuring responses to the dashing surf?” He behaves almost as a romantically conceived poet might. <a href=\"https://thebillshakespeareproject.com/2010/04/the-lunatic-the-lover-and-the-poet/\">As Shakespeare put it</a>: “The lunatic, the lover and the poet / Are of imagination all compact.” The scene is now set for a reversal of a kind, in that the poet introduces herself in her “moody sadness” and perhaps hints at her own temptation towards “the giddy brink”.</p> <p>The admission, “I see him more with envy than with fear” is carefully planned and expressed: it avoids the charge of sentimentality. In Smith’s view, the lunatic has been forced into an honest confrontation with nature and, whatever those “giant horrors” may be, his ability to encounter them seems an assurance of his authenticity. Behind the concluding sestet lies the heavy weight of the requirements of being – a woman struggling to make a living, a poet who must write prose, a radical cramped by polite society. The comment that the lunatic is “uncursed with reason” is placed in parenthesis, as if to lightly veil its shockingness.</p> <p>Wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Being_Cautioned_Against_Walking_on_an_Headland\">identifies the quotation</a> in the italicised phrase in line 11 as “an allusion to Horace Walpole’s controversial gothic play The Mysterious Mother (1768). The Countess of Narbonne is warned to stay indoors due to a violent storm, and replies, “Wretches like me, good Peter, dread no storms. / ’Tis delicate felicity that shrinks, / When rocking winds are loud.” The same entry includes an image of the engraving that accompanied the poem’s inclusion in the second edition of the Elegiac Sonnets.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/01/rishi-sunak-rejects-claim-doomster-attitude-economy-income-tax-cut","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T08:59:45Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak rejects claim he has ‘doomster’ attitude to economy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/rishi-sunak-rejects-claim-doomster-attitude-economy-income-tax-cut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/01/rishi-sunak-rejects-claim-doomster-attitude-economy-income-tax-cut","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak rejects claim he has ‘doomster’ attitude to economy","trailText":"Former chancellor says he finds his successor’s accusation ‘amusing’ as he vows to cut income tax by 20%","byline":"Geneva Abdul","body":"<p>The Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak has rejected accusations from his successor as chancellor of being a “doomster” on the economy, as he pushed his plan to cut income tax by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/31/rishi-sunak-pledges-20-tax-cut-by-end-of-decade-in-last-gasp-pitch-to-members\">20% by the end of the decade</a>.</p> <p>“As chancellor I was very keen to make sure that I started cutting taxes,” Sunak told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “What I’ve announced today builds on that, and that’s because I believe in rewarding work and the best way for the government to signal that is to cut people’s income tax.”</p> <p>The current chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, announcing his support for Sunak’s rival, Liz Truss, in the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/07/31/nadhim-zahawi-vote-booster-liz-truss-doomster-rishi/\">Daily Telegraph</a> on Monday, said: “Liz understands that the status quo isn’t an option in times of crisis.</p> <p>“To quote the excellent economist Sam Bowman, we need a ‘booster’ attitude to the economy, not a ‘doomster’ one, in order to address cost of living woes and the challenges on the world stage. Liz will overturn the stale economic orthodoxy and run our economy in a Conservative way.”</p> <p>When asked to respond to Zahawi’s remarks, Sunak laughed and said: “As you can tell, I find it rather amusing.” He pointed to his pro-Brexit credentials and economic assistance package during the Covid pandemic, adding: “It’s my opponent in this contest who wants to stick with the failed orthodoxy of having these ultra-low corporation tax rates and, you know what, they don’t work in increasing business investment in this country – we’ve tried it for a decade.</p> <p>“It’s entirely different to doing things right now that would make the situation far worse and endanger people’s mortgages,” Sunak said, in an attack on Truss’s ambitions to cut taxes immediately.</p> <p>Sunak is under pressure to make inroads into the lead opinion polls suggest Truss enjoys among the Tory members who will decide the next prime minister, as postal ballots begin dropping on Conservative doormats. In the latest YouGov poll, Truss holds the lead among Tory members, while the <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/07/27/where-do-britons-stand-liz-truss-and-rishi-sunak\">broader public favour</a> Sunak at 28% to Truss’s 25%, with 47% undecided.</p> <p>Sunak’s proposed plan to cut income tax to 16p by the end of the next parliament would cost about £6bn a year. As prime minister he said he wanted to cut income tax in a way that was “responsible” by making sure it could be paid for, and is done so alongside economic growth.</p> <p>“I don’t think embarking on a spree of excessive borrowing at a time when inflation and interest rates are already on a rise would be wise,” he added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is the latest policy pledge called “another U-turn” by a Truss campaign source, after Sunak recently promised to cut VAT on energy bills, a policy he rejected in office. And the UK is projected to experience the lowest growth in the G20 – apart from Russia – and have the worst growth in the G7 at about 0.5%.</p> <p>“The public and Conservative party members can see through these flip-flops and U-turns,” said the source.</p> <p>When asked to name another country that had raised taxes amid a cost of living squeeze, Sunak said “every country is going to be slightly different in how they deal with it”, while emphasising the UK’s publicly funded healthcare system through tax, and its growing backlogs.</p> <p>“What she’s suggesting is entirely sticking with the failed orthodoxy of the last 10 years,” Sunak said of Truss’s policy, adding that people were looking at the last months of Boris Johnson’s leadership through rose-tinted spectacles.</p> <p>Addressing Johnson’s behaviour and citing his resignation along with 60 MPs, Sunak said the government found itself on the “wrong side of an ethical issue”.</p> <p>In an attempt to regain public momentum, Sunak

meeting. He insisted he “did not express a view” about her to the chief executive of Investment NSW, Amy Brown.</p> <p>“We didn’t discuss anything through the lens of performance; it was merely an exchange of pleasantries to say, you know, thank you for organising it, and then allowing the CEO of Investment NSW to go away and [make a decision],” he said.</p> <p>Brown wrote to the head of the recruitment firm on 26 March to thank her for “preparing a draft selection report” that placed Cole above Barilaro.</p> <p>But, she said, she had “sourced a couple of informal referees for the candidates, which I’ll share with the group as they’re likely to change things”.</p> <p>By 15 June, Barilaro had replaced Cole as the top-ranked candidate.

The nature by which these winds cause monsoon rains is not well understood. One popular theory suggests that during the searing summer heat, the land warms far quicker than the surrounding ocean, with this temperature gradient driving in an air flow from the south-west. This converges with south-easterly winds from the South China Sea, as well as with mountains on the Indian subcontinent, to enable these heavy rains to develop. The development or failure of monsoon rains is critical to the Indian economy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Europe, a further burst of heat is expected across parts of France, Germany and the Benelux region this week.

Thanks to digitised and searchable records, all the frustrating blanks in your family tree can now be enticingly fleshed out. Sometimes those blanks will reveal something remarkable and dramatic, but as any fan of BBC One’s <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007t575\">Who Do You Think You Are?</a></em> will attest, even the mundane tales can be strangely touching.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/01/simon-mawer-tightrope-trapeze-marian-sutro\">Simon Mawer</a>, Booker-shortlisted for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/25/the-glass-room-simon-mawer\">The Glass Room</a></em> in 2009, now enters this arena with his new novel (his word). Composed largely of fictionally presented chapters from the lives of his own 19th-century forebears, its narrative progress is peppered with authorial interruption as Mawer seeks to remind us of its underpinning reality. These interruptions come in many forms: photographed register entries in copperplate; his own musings on the nature of his project (“It could be the start of a Dickensian novel, couldn’t it?”); and somewhat pedantic footnotes making sure we know that those are the “very words, taken from his letter home” or that he isn’t misspelling “Babarbadoes”.</p> <p>From that “Dickensian” opening on a beach in Suffolk, where young Abraham Block strips a drowned corpse of its two gold sovereigns, we move into his adult life at sea. But with procreation as the inevitable driver of the story, we soon swipe across to a train carriage with an ingenue seamstress coming up to London for the first time. And there’s a bounder in the seat next to her, exploiting their forced proximity to initiate his seduction. Still, she lands on her feet when, now with child, she rents a room with Abraham’s uncle near the docks. And thus Mawer ancestry, on the maternal side, is under way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The fictionalised elements are never less than credible, if sometimes overdetailed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Part two, of course, requires a complete restart, with a shift over to the paternal side of things. Thus we dive into the life of George Mawer, private soldier in the 50th Regiment of Foot. Beginning with his marriage to one Ann Scanlon, we move with him from barracks to garrison and back again. She, like all army wives, will share his curtained-off dormitory bed, and offspring soon follow. But family life is curtailed by the British government’s decision (maybe not for the last time) to do something about Russians in the Crimea. George’s regiment is soon sailing off to strange lands.</p> <p>Armies are awash with paperwork, nearly always meticulously preserved, and this is when – to its detriment – the novel starts to be governed by the disproportionate availability of these archives. The result is a near-exhaustive fictionalisation of the 50th’s marches, skirmishes and encampments; with a pedantry reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/28/100-best-novels-tristram-shandy-sterne\">Tristram</a>’s Uncle Toby, we are given the precise dimensions of trench and parapet.</p> <p>But the siege of Sevastopol, however evocatively fictionalised, can’t help but feel like a history lesson when the story we really want to follow is Ann’s. She is now back in Lincoln and thrown on to parish charity along with those little Mawer ancestors. Thanks to a once-mentioned name in family lore, Mawer is able to posit a link to an unmarried member of that parish committee. He then offers us a choice of scenarios to bring these two together: ranging from the tender to the functional to the purely monetised. But again, Mawer butts in to tell us these are only guesses, somehow undercutting the entire premise of his own project.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/28/simon-mawer-once-upon-a-life-climbing\">Once upon a life: Simon Mawer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These fictionalised elements are never less than credible, if sometimes overdetailed. So it’s a shame that, rather than allowing his characters to grow and interact, as any novel demands, Mawer instead regularly elbows his way on to the page to remind us that, for instance, “this particular rumour happened to be true”. These reminders of his research only serve to disempower the characters and defuse any jeopardy in the storytelling. Things aren’t helped by prose that is a touch too workaday: tones are “dulcet” and hair, more than once, comes in a “shock”.</p> <p>Mawer himself concedes that the problem with any account of the past is “how to put yourself into the mind of someone <em>who has no idea what is about to happen</em>”. But that is exactly what novelists do – and it can only be done when liberated from the fell hand of history and the hard graft you’ve put in to unearth it.</p> <p>• <em>Ancestry: A Novel</em> by Simon Mawer is published by Little, Brown (£18.99).

In the winter, there will be a £400 discount on electricity bills for all households. A £150 rebate on council tax for bands A-D has been paid to many households, but it is understood some families are still waiting to receive it.</p> <p>There have been other schemes, too, such as the government-backed “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/23/uk-train-tickets-the-great-rail-sale-is-on-but-is-there-a-catch\" title=\"\">Great British Rail Sale</a>” announced in April, which saw a million off-peak, mostly advance, train tickets discounted by up to 50%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/21/government-cost-of-living-package-abandons-struggling-families-say-charities\" title=\"\">A cost of living package</a> unveiled a few days ago, initially includes a mix of new and pre-existing discounts on meals, mobile tariffs and theatre tickets from businesses including Asda, Morrisons, Amazon and Vodafone.</p> <p>But how does the UK compare with other European countries?</p> <h2>Ireland</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\" title=\"\">Ireland </a>has given out energy credits, reduced tax on gas, electricity, petrol and diesel, and cut bus and train fares in one of the EU’s most expensive countries. Measures introduced since the start of 2022 have put an extra €480 (£403) in the average person’s pocket.</p> <p>Households were given a €200 energy credit in April, followed by 9% to 13.5% cuts in VAT that will save households approximately €50 on gas and €70 on electricity. Fares on public transport were cut by 20% in April, and halved for those aged 19 to 23. Fuel duty cuts amount to 20 cents per litre of petrol, and 15 cents per litre of diesel.</p> <p>The government says measures in last October’s budget, such as increasing the weekly pension by €5 and a modest de facto income tax cut, anticipated the cost of living crisis.</p> <p>Leo Varadkar, the tanaiste, or deputy prime minister, claimed Ireland was doing “a lot more” than the UK, although fact-checkers have struggled <a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/factcheck-ireland-uk-cost-of-living-measures-5778914-Jun2022/\" title=\"\">to verify, or debunk, the assertion</a>.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>Germany passed various measures to alleviate the cost of living crisis in July. A <a href=\"https://www.bahn.com/en/offers/regional/9-euro-ticket-en\" title=\"\">€9 a month ticket scheme</a>, covering travel on all modes of urban and regional transport, was designed to nudge commuters and holidaymakers into leaving the car at home, and aid those who are reliant on public transport. High-speed ICE trains are exempt from the offer, which runs until 31 August.</p> <p>From June through to August, the government is also cutting taxation on fuel, which makes up about 50% of the total fuel price. While studies suggest that fuel companies have largely passed these cuts on to consumers, rather than pocketing them as initially feared, prices remain considerably higher than this time last year, especially for diesel.</p> <p>There are also a series of one-off payments: people in gainful employment are to be paid an energy price lump sum of €300 through their employer’s payroll, which companies can reclaim from the government. For freelancers, it will show up as a €300 reduction in their advance income tax payment.</p> <p>People on social welfare will receive €200. One-person households on housing benefits will be subsidised with €270 a month, rising to €350 for two-person households and at €70 per extra person thereafter.</p> <p>To further assist larger households with spiralling gas and electricity bills, families are being paid a one-off €100 per child in July.</p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p>Spain arguably went one step further than Germany earlier this month when its socialist-led coalition government declared that travel across certain parts of the state-owned rail network, Renfe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jul/15/spain-announces-free-rail-journeys-from-september-until-the-end-of-the-year\" title=\"\">would be free from 1 September to the end of the year</a>.

But for me, the bravest thing was to walk away from being a doctor 10 years later.</p> <p>I’d always wanted to study medicine but, believing I wasn’t bright enough, I left school at 15 and didn’t return to education until my 30s. Despite discovering the self-belief I’d lacked as a teenager, the going was still tough. Personal commitments meant a hefty commute and money was always tight. The end goal kept us all going, though, fantasising about the kind of medics we wanted to be. We didn’t dream about prizes or having rare diseases named after us; each one of us dreamed about being a doctor who made a difference. A doctor who fixed things.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don’t miss reading ECGs and writing prescriptions, I miss the patients</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You spend five years at medical school learning how to fix things, but after graduation, when you’re spat out on to a hospital ward, you soon discover there are many things in life you’re unable to fix. It’s a tough lesson. Especially in a landscape so underfunded and understaffed; if everyone in the NHS did only the job they were supposed to do, the entire system would collapse within 24 hours.</p> <p>It wasn’t the workload I struggled with, though. The long hours and the lack of resources, I could deal with, because everyone had to. What I found really impossible was the emotional load. As a doctor, you know you’ll witness upsetting things. You know you will hear people given devastating news. You will watch people die and you will see the most awful distress. To be present at these vulnerable moments in a stranger’s life is a privilege, but it also becomes a burden if, like me, you’re unable to let those moments go. You never know how you’ll react to something until it’s in front of you. I believed I was strong enough to cope. I thought life experience would help me. I was wrong. I collected those distressing moments and I carried them around until I became mentally and physically unwell myself. Until their weight began to break me.</p> <p>Medicine, ironically, is not the place to break, and I knew I needed to find a coping mechanism very quickly, so I began to write. Writing allowed me an escape, a door into another world, but it also helped to iron out my thoughts. In my lunchbreak (if I had one) I’d sit in the hospital car park and empty my head on to a page. I wrote a story I didn’t think anyone would read (I thought my mum might read it), but that story became <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-trouble-with-goats-and-sheep-9780008132170?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;\">The Trouble with Goats and Sheep</a>, and it would be a Sunday Times bestseller. But with that unexpected success, I had to make a decision. Was I a doctor, or a writer?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/hope-cure-chronic-condition-identity-disability\">I gave up hope of a cure for my chronic condition. And it’s made me happier than ever before | Keith Kahn-Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whenever I tell people I no longer practise medicine, there’s always a beat of silence. A quiet judgment. Because medicine isn’t just a job, it’s a <em>vocation</em>. Vocation, however, is a dangerous word, because we use it to excuse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/26/stressed-nhs-staff-quit-at-record-rate-of-400-a-week-fuelling-fears-over-care-quality\">poor working conditions</a> and the absence of a quality of life, and anyone in a caring profession is expected to tolerate things no one else would withstand purely because they have some kind of divine calling. After the beat of silence, people usually pull themselves together and smile, and say “good for you”. And it really was, mentally and physically.</p> <p>At the point my car-park book was sold to HarperCollins, work pressure and the emotional strain of medicine had made me so unwell that my GP sent me for an urgent cancer referral. I didn’t, thankfully, have cancer. I had burnout (a dangerous term because it implies something clear and obvious, but it often goes unnoticed, even by the person who is burning). Writing, something I had started as a form of therapy now gave me an exit card, a chance of self-preservation, and I took it. It wasn’t a decision I made lightly. I’d worked hard to get to this point, but I knew if I didn’t put myself first, I would eventually disappear.</p> <p>I still work on the wards now, but as a volunteer. Because I don’t miss reading ECGs and writing prescriptions, I miss the patients. It was only ever about the patients. Since quitting medicine, I’ve been called many things. A snowflake. A wimp. I’ve been told I have no backbone. All of this may be true, but there are times when you need to focus on yourself. If you have walked so far down a road, it feels counterintuitive to turn around. Dangerous, almost. But I don’t regret my decision for one second, because heading back, and walking away, is often the safest route of all.</p> <ul> <li><p>Joanna Cannon is a psychiatrist and author.

Located in Sichuan province, the valley is a place where bees are on the verge of extinction, the consequences of which we see in the opening sequence of fruit farmer Cao and his wife hand-pollinating flowers on their trees.</p> <p>They are one of three families in this agricultural triptych: there is also maize-cropper Ye, who is thinking of branching out into fruit in order to pay for a new house, and beekeeper Zhang, who leaves her grandparents to look after her young daughter so she and her husband can take refuge in the far-flung part of the valley where insects still thrive. As Cao testifies, the problem is modern pesticides, which caused fruit harvests to fail shortly after they started being used in the mid-1960s.</p> <p>Is there a growing awareness of the problem? Do bee friendly chemicals exist? Is the frankly frightening amount of cigarette smoking in the fields here what is actually driving away the insects? The incurious Earth: Muted doesn’t seem interested in prising open the wider context; it rests wholly on extended sequences of the farmers at work unsheathing corn cobs or collecting pollen, with halting commentary superimposed. The film touches on the issues: Cao alludes to informing the Chinese authorities about pesticides’ harmful effects, while Ye’s father is adamant they can be safely used without harming the bees. But there is no real inquiry.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNOEbdbLkG4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fNOEbdbLkG4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>What is apparent are the economic pressures that are driving the farmers en masse into the arms of the agro-industrial complex. Everyone here, team pesticide or not, is looking to improve their prospects to ensure a better life for the next generation. But instead of pushing the film into defining what the ecological cost of this may be, the film-makers – torn between a proper investigative exposé and a less judgmental bucolic portrait – placidly position this as just part of the timeless cycle of rural struggle.

If we are to produce the best possible England teams of the future – not to mention have a healthier and happier female population – that needs to change.</p> \n<p>Right now, far too much potential female talent is being left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/10/kelly-smith-delights-at-number-of-girls-taking-part-in-in-schools-football-session\">overlooked and untapped</a>.

That<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/27/englands-euro-2022-win-over-sweden-drew-peak-tv-audience-of-93-million\"> 9.3 million viewers</a> watched the England v Sweden semi-final is just ridiculous. But, crucially, it is now about maintaining that coverage because, as we have seen in the past, there is a drop-off in terms of attendance and coverage after major tournaments. We have a responsibility as the media to make sure the game is at the forefront of people’s minds for the next year.</p> \n<p>The way we have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/29/readers-on-euro-2022-and-womens-football\">marketed women’s football</a> in the past has not always been right. For a long time, we have targeted young children, specifically girls. We mixed up the participation element with the attendance element. We have to realise that there are so many different demographics to talk to and we should just market the hell out of it over the next year, because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/09/fa-aims-to-almost-triple-womens-super-league-attendances-in-three-years\">demand is clearly there</a>.</p> \n<p><em>Sophie Downey is a freelance football writer and regular contributor to the Guardian’s women’s football newsletter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/moving-the-goalposts\">Moving the Goalposts</a></em></p> \n<h2>Jen Offord: Don’t lose what makes the women’s game so special</h2> \n<p>In theory, it would be possible for women’s football to be its own game completely, with its own clubs and its own structure not linked to the men’s game. In practice, I do not think that is going to happen: it is going to be the “one club” approach that continues, with women’s teams as part of the same organisations. That will mean more money going into the women’s game – and women should have equal access to those resources. However, the “one club” idea is disingenuous. The teams are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/apr/28/womens-football-aligned-mens-game-comes-at-a-price\">not valued equally</a> – there is a clear hierarchy.</p> \n<p>Money is part of what can be so toxic in the men’s game – it breeds resentment among fans, players become so wealthy that they are almost seen as not a real person and cannot be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/10/racial-abusers-to-be-banned-from-all-premier-league-grounds\">touched by abuse</a>. Whereas the women’s game has a much nicer vibe: more celebratory, less bitterness. None of this business of middle-aged men shouting abuse at boys young enough to be their sons. I would have no problem taking my daughter to a match when she is old enough, whereas I might with the men’s game.</p> \n<p>I have this sense that the women’s game has a freedom and a passion that we do not always see in the men – like they really want to be there. And that is joyful to watch. As the game grows, I really hope we never lose that.</p> \n<p><em>Jen Offord hosts the Standard Issue podcast</em><em> and wrote </em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-year-of-the-robin-9781785787577\">The Year of the Robin</a></em><em>, an account of Charlton Athletic’s struggles during a pandemic season.

The place she was brought up alongside her seven siblings, crashing into each other in west London’s concrete cages, is only five miles from here but it would not have mattered if it was 500 the way she felt; the way all of them did. God, the noise. The explosion, the release, the everything. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/31/england-germany-womens-euro-2022-final-match-report\" title=\"\">had only gone and bloody done it</a>. England had.

How do you even begin to articulate this? A moment of this magnitude. The way she did, maybe. And so there she was sprinting across the turf at Wembley, teammates in pursuit, the white shirt that will forever be historic in her hand, waved wildly above her head.

They never will now; it will always be there. A first ever trophy for England’s women was within touching distance, 56 years and one day after the only trophy any England team had ever won.</p> \n<p>There were 10 minutes to go in extra time when she scored, but that number had started to feel largely irrelevant, like penalties were inevitable now, everyone just waiting for it: the drama, the tension. And, yes, quite probably the cruelty, too. A year ago, in this same arena, England’s men had led a European Championship final and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jul/11/italy-crush-england-dreams-after-winning-euro-2020-on-penalties\" title=\"\">lost it on penalties</a>. And, that was Italy: this was Germany, for goodness sake. Which served to make this feel like even more of a liberation.</p> \n<p>England had taken the lead with a gloriously taken goal from Ella Toone an hour into an exhausting, sometimes confrontational match that had always been on a knife edge. The beauty was in the simplicity, a lovely first time ball from Keira Walsh sending her through, time seeming to slow. Time to think, to wonder, perhaps at some subconscious level to be aware of all this signified. Time for that to weigh, too.</p> \n<p>Not for Toone. Her shot, impeccably executed, rose into the air, the ball dropping slowly almost serenely into the net, watched all the way – in Beth Mead’s case from the corner flag, as she made her way to the bench having been forced off injured. Which was just one of the reasons why this was not done yet. Germany had got the better of the second half and deservedly got a superbly worked equaliser from Lina Magull that took this to extra time.</p> \n<p>Tension clung to this place, a shootout looming. Some stories seem to be writing themselves.</p> \n<p>There is always an alternative ending, though, and with 110 minutes on the clock, an ugly goal and the most beautiful moment. A corner from the right was headed back by Lucy Bronze, immense all night, and dropped by the German goalline.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2fb06f9d0155c3340307aba18c815c13aa591124\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fb06f9d0155c3340307aba18c815c13aa591124/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chloe Kelly celebrates her winner for England in the final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kelly celebrates her winner for England in the final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The way Kelly describes it, she played “street football without rules”, her brothers smashing into her in the cage, playing until the darkness fell. If it had been easy, she “wouldn’t be here”, she had said. It hadn’t been easy: a year ago she had suffered a cruciate knee ligament tear and missed the Olympic Games, her inclusion here in doubt. Now, when it mattered most, there she was.</p> \n<p>Fighting for the ball, the bodies before her no obstacle, Kelly scrambled it over the line and then set off, millions going mad.</p> \n<p>She jumped and ran and screamed and headed to the touchline. Six hours earlier her friends and family had stood on Wembley way with an England flag, QPR embossed on it – the club where she started – now she stood before them and crossed her arms. When at last she slowed to a halt and they were ready to start again, the referee, Kateryna Monzul, pulled out a yellow card. She should ask to keep it. This was her first competitive international goal and it was <em>the</em> goal.</p> \n<p>It seemed to settle everything, England managing those final minutes masterfully now, the ball kept largely in the corner, as if Kelly had delivered clarity. Still, it’s never over until, well, it’s over, England’s subs and staff streaming on to the pitch at the final whistle. Jill Scott bounded across, the one player left from England’s last final in 2009.</p> \n<p>There were tears everywhere. This meant the world to them; something deeper than a trophy that will be dissected in coming days but for now was there to be enjoyed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"028b60ae-f054-44ba-b1c7-2ab5ddd6efaa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NbbDN31jmZw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And Wembley burst into Sweet Caroline, the players lined up at the side of the pitch, running to join in. “It’s Coming Home” boomed round as well, maybe for the last time? Once more, with feeling. Everywhere, people sang: in this stadium and way, way beyond.</p> \n<p>In Durham, Sheffield, Whitby, Sunderland, Manchester, Hanwell too. Or, just stood there looking at it, still trying to take it all in: it had actually happened. So, this is how it feels. England had done it.</p> \n<p>“Oh my God,” Kelly said, staring up at it, this stadium, that sound. “Look at them. It’s amazing. This is unreal! This is what dreams are made of. I want to thank everyone who took part in my rehab. I always believed I would be here.”</p> \n<p>And so she was, for a moment no one had experienced in 56 years. Or, in many cases, ever. She had not come far but she had come a very long way.

And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/23/buyers-of-brand-new-homes-face-20000-bill-to-make-them-greener\">retrofitting comes at a much higher cost</a> than building in energy efficiency from the start. <br></p> \n<p>This constant change has damaged the insulation industry. “There has been this boom-bust policy making which has really decimated the industry,” says Phillips. </p> \n<p>The government has ambitious climate plans – for example, phasing out all<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/heat-and-buildings-strategy\"> gas boilers in homes with electricity-powered heat pumps</a> by the late 2030s. If the electricity generation is green, then the technology is there for British homes could be net zero by 2035. But heat pumps won’t work well unless the houses are properly insulated. <br></p> \n<p>And with no replacement policies or cash, that leaves many of Britain’s homes without simple insulation – unnecessarily cold, expensive to heat and pumping out carbon emissions. <br></p> \n<p>Here’s the scale of the challenge ahead:<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/home-insulation/all-houses\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>How could it work? </h2> \n<p>“There’s no silver bullet,” says Phillips. “There is such a diverse range of houses and households – from families living on the breadline in fuel poverty, through to people who are well-off.”<br></p> \n<p>Her thinktank, E3G, suggests <a href=\"https://9tj4025ol53byww26jdkao0x-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/The-home-energy-security-strategy-a-permanent-solution-for-lower-bills_E3G-report-1.pdf\">a range of measures</a>, from refitting all social housing and poorer owner-occupied houses through to green mortgages and stamp duty holidays for those at the wealthier end of the spectrum. <br></p> \n<p>Other ideas include devolving the power and funding to local councils, an approach recommended by the Climate Change Committee. with clear goals to insulate a certain number of homes by a certain date.

But it is the group of young girls in Girlfriends Times Two, smiling from ear to ear with their hands gripped tight to the gold edges – confidently showing that they belong in these frames – that I find the most joyous.</p> <p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve watched Sarina Wiegman’s unstoppable England team thrill the nation in the Women’s Euros. There was the 95th-minute long-range goal by Georgia Stanway, which clinched their spot in the semi-final, Alessia Russo’s backheel to secure the Lionesses’s place in the final, and last night Ella Toone’s epic lob giving them the initial lead in the final, and then Chloe Kelly’s goal securing England as the triumphant and deserved win. It’s all been documented by the team’s official photographer, Lynne Cameron, who has captured the euphoria of their success, from the aftermath of Fran Kirby’s momentous goal to Rachel Daly storming the pitch in celebration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e0401039a6fc9da3783583b9948bbc1232740b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e0401039a6fc9da3783583b9948bbc1232740b9/0_0_4003_3203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lorraine O’Grady’s Troupe With Mile Bourgeoise Noire), taken at the African American Day Parade in Harlem in 1983.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lorraine O’Grady’s Troupe With Mile Bourgeoise Noire), taken at the African American Day Parade in Harlem in 1983.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Alexander Gray Associates, New York/2022 Lorraine O’Grady / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as the Lionesses have shattered any preconceptions that football belongs in a man’s world – as shockingly revealed in an anonymous note <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Emmabarnett/status/601669806702596096\">tweeted</a> by Woman’s Hour presenter, Emma Barnett – O’Grady too broke free from traditional ideas about what art is and where it should be situated. Rightly ignoring society’s rigid viewpoints on a gender-imbalanced art world, and bringing art back to its simplest and most effective terms, Art Is … showed that anyone could be worthy of belonging “inside the frame” – of being a subject of “art”. It’s up to us, the viewers, participants – or in the case of the England team, the fans – to rewrite the rules and be inclusive of everyone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Art can be a performance, a question, a call to action, in a museum or out in the streets</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This month, the Lionesses achieved that, not only through their incredible success on the pitch but in the impact on those watching them play. An amazing 9.3 million people watched England thrash Sweden; records were broken as Sunday’s’s game became the most attended for a Uefa tournament<br>in men’s or women’s football; TV viewing figures are up 58% from previous Women’s Euros. The former England men’s star Ian Wright proclaimed after the team soared into the final: “If after this, girls aren’t allowed to play football like the boys in school, then what are we doing?”</p> <p>Art Is … brought art out of the museum and into the public realm. It expanded the fabric of photography and performance, and showed the “non-artist acquaintance” – and perhaps the establishment they came from – the relevance of art and its power to drive inclusivity. It showed that art can be a performance, a question, a call to action, in a museum or out in the streets. For O’Grady, art is “a joyful performance in Harlem’s African American Day Parade”.</p> <p>Just like O’Grady telling the beaming young girls that they too should be included on museum walls, the Lionesses are encouraging the next generation of footballers. This is powerfully outlined by the striker Nikita Parris, who has written: “So I know how young women, young black women feel growing up in today’s world because there’s not much representation at the highest level, where they see a pathway or they feel a sense of, ‘I can attain that dream.’”</p> <p>In the way that Art Is … was groundbreaking in the realm of art, the Lionesses, not only in making history by lifting their trophy last night, have changed minds and hearts. Now everyone can feel that they are worthy of being part of the game.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/01/arizona-republicans-kari-lake-mark-finchem","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T07:00:16Z","webTitle":"Alarm as Arizona Republicans set to nominate election deniers for top posts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/arizona-republicans-kari-lake-mark-finchem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/01/arizona-republicans-kari-lake-mark-finchem","fields":{"headline":"Alarm as Arizona Republicans set to nominate election deniers for top posts","trailText":"Kari Lake and Mark Finchem running for governor and secretary of state in primary contests that could have serious consequences","byline":"Sam Levine in New York, Nina Lakhani in Phoenix, and Lauren Gambino in Washington","body":"<p>Arizona Republicans are on the verge of nominating two of America’s most prominent election deniers for governor and secretary of state, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/29/1113707783/election-deniers-secretary-of-state-arizona-finchem\">the latest</a> in a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/trump-loyalists-secretary-of-state-candidates\">primary contests</a> with serious consequences for America’s democracy.</p> <p>Kari Lake, a former news anchor, and Mark Finchem, a state lawmaker, are running for governor and secretary of state, respectively.

It’s a trend that is deeply alarming, experts say, and could pave the way for Republicans to reject the result of a future election.</p> <p>“It’s a dangerous time for elections because you have a couple of people who are relying on people to vote for them but then will turn around and say the election system is rigged despite the lack of any evidence as such. There’s no talk of policy or anything. It’s all looking backward to 2020,” said Barrett Marson, a Republican consultant in the state. “This issue has staying power, much to my chagrin and a lot of other people.”</p> <p>Even in an era when denying election results has become Republican orthodoxy, Lake and Finchem stand out.</p> <p>Lake has said she would not have certified the 2020 presidential race in Arizona, falsely claimed Joe Biden lost the state (he carried it by more than 10,000 votes), and called the election <a href=\"https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/gov_deniers.html#45_Arizona_-_Kari_Lake\">“corrupt” and “rotten”</a>. During a rally earlier this year, she claimed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/arizona-midterms-swing.html\">nearly a dozen times</a> in the span of an hour that the election was stolen. She has called for the imprisonment of Arizona’s top election official for her handling of the 2020 race and jailing journalists. Lake wants to end mail-in voting, widely used in Arizona, and she and Finchem have both joined a lawsuit, supported by MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell to end the use of electronic voting equipment in Arizona.</p> <p>Both Mike Pence and Arizona governor Doug Ducey have endorsed Karrin Taylor Robson, a wealthy real-estate developer, who is <a href=\"https://www.abc15.com/news/political/elections/kari-lake-out-in-front-of-governors-race-by-large-margin-new-poll-shows\">Lake’s most significant challenger</a> in the polls for the nomination. In recent days, Lake has begun suggesting there is fraud underfoot to steal the election from her, but has offered no evidence to support her claim.</p> <p>“We’re already detecting some fraud. I know none of you are shocked,” she said, according to the Washington Post. “We’re already detecting fraud, and believe me, we’ve got cyber folks working with us, we’ve got lots of attorneys. And I’m hoping that we have the sheriffs that will do something about it. We’ll keep you posted.” She has, however, recently encouraged her supporters to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-backed-kari-lake-wants-mail-in-ballots-2022-7\">cast their votes</a> by mail.</p> <p>Taylor Robson has said the 2020 election wasn’t fair, but has stopped short of saying it was stolen. Lorna Romero, a Republican operative in the state who has worked for former governor Jan Brewer and for John McCain, predicted that the winning candidate in the primary would be whoever could broaden their message the most. <a href=\"https://azsos.gov/elections/voter-registration-historical-election-data\">About a third</a> of voters in Arizona are not affiliated with a party and can choose to vote in either the Democratic or Republican nominating contests.</p> <p>“This is populism. This is just pure populism for populism’s sake, and her desire to be popular,” said Chuck Coughlin, a Republican consultant in the state. “You have a referendum, if you will, in the governor’s race, on which part of the party are you supporting. The pragmatic, want-to-govern conservative – or Trump. You have a significant war going on there.”</p> <p>Finchem is the frontrunner for the secretary of state nomination, a position from which he would oversee elections in Arizona.</p> <p>Finchem was a <a href=\"https://www.americanoversight.org/in-the-documents-new-details-about-the-origins-of-the-arizona-senates-discredited-election-audit\">close ally</a> of Trump in the former president’s bid to overturn the 2020 race. Ali Alexander, a leader of the Stop the Steal movement, has credited Finchem with bringing the push to Arizona. “Arizona started with one man: State Representative Mark Finchem,” Alexander <a href=\"https://www.azmirror.com/2021/02/10/there-wouldnt-have-been-a-stopthesteal-campaign-in-arizona-without-mark-finchem/\">said last year</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee26e19afc527d793733da7db27b234153d23da7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee26e19afc527d793733da7db27b234153d23da7/0_32_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Finchem in October last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Finchem in October last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Mummey/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.azleg.gov/press/house/55LEG/2R/220207FINCHEMHCR2033.pdf\">Finchem introduced</a> a resolution to decertify the election, which is not legally possible. He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21174160-arizona-joint-resolution-regarding-electors\">signed a joint resolution</a> of the Arizona legislature asking Congress to accept a fake slate of electors from Arizona (a plan currently under investigation by the Justice Department). He hosted Rudy Giuliani at a Phoenix hotel after the election for an event at which the president’s lawyer lied and said Biden won the election because he received votes from undocumented people.</p> <p>Finchem is also a member of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia group, and was at the capitol on January 6. He has been subpoenaed by the committee investigating the capitol attack. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/trump-loyalists-secretary-of-state-candidates\">is a member</a> of a network of candidates who don’t believe the results of the 2020 election seeking to be the chief election official in their state.</p> <p>“Am I’m surprised that somebody who questions the 2020 election would want to run for secretary of state? No, not really,” Romero said. “His whole standpoint is he wants to eliminate the fraud from the system, and it’s a good talking point for him for those who believe the 2020 election was stolen.”</p> <p>Secretary of state primaries are usually “sleeper” contests that few people pay attention to, Romero said. That means Trump’s endorsement is likely to be a major boost for Finchem in the race. Still, Romero said she was “disappointed” by the emphasis on a stolen election, because Republicans have a significant opportunity to appeal to voters on issues like the economy this year.</p> <p>The secretary of state in Arizona is responsible for canvassing official statewide election results. Coughlin said he had little doubt Finchem would hold up certification of a race.</p> <p>“He would not fall in line. He would follow the Donald Trump script of doing everything possible to be a disrupter if the election outcome is anything but what he wanted. I don’t see any go-along-to-get-along in Mark Finchem,” he said.</p> <p>Until 2020, Finchem did not have much of an interest in Arizona’s election laws, and was known mostly for representing the issues of his rural district in southern Arizona. “His reputation wasn’t great. People didn’t much like working with him,” Marson said. “He was a back-bencher is probably the best way to describe it.”</p> <p>The political potency of election denialism was on display earlier this month at a rally in Arizona’s rural Prescott Valley, where Donald Trump came to stump for Lake.</p> <p>Shawn Callaway, 34, a Republican party committee worker in Surprise, a small city near Phoenix, is supporting both Lake and Finchem. He supports Lake, he said, because of her efforts to halt the use of electronic voting equipment.</p> <p>“It means a lot to me that she’s willing to fight against election fraud, because if our elections aren’t safe we don’t have anything,” said Callaway, who bagged front row seats with his wife and parents to see Trump.</p> <p>Callaway, who plans to cast his vote in person, also said he was unfazed by Finchem’s connection to the extremist Oath Keepers. “The Founding Fathers wanted us to have militia groups – it’s what keeps us free. As long as they are law-abiding, I’m fine with that,” he said.</p> <p>Kelly Ciccone, 58, who moved to Maricopa county from Florida a decade ago, also said she plans to support Finchem and Lake. “It’s a plus that he’s an Oath Keeper – self-defence is everything. Guns aren’t bad: crazy people with guns are the problem,” said Ciccone, who also attended the Trump rally. “Kari Lake is pure fire. She’s a dragon, just like Trump.”</p> <p>The race underscores how Arizona continues to be a hotbed of conspiracy theories about the 2020 race.</p> <p>Last year, the state legislature authorized an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/14/arizona-election-audit-recount-ballots-maricopa-county\">unprecedented partisan review</a> of the 2020 race, championed by Finchem, of the 2020 race in Maricopa county, the largest county in the state. Even though the audit affirmed Biden’s win, Lake, Finchem, and other conspiracy theorists continue to insist that something was amiss. The state Republican party recently censured Rusty Bowers, the Republican House speaker Rusty Bowers after he testified to the January 6 committee about Trump’s efforts to pressure him to overturn the election.</p> <p>The Guardian also observed a focus group with five Arizona Republicans who voted for Trump in 2020, conducted as part of a series by the prominent anti-Trump Republican strategist, Sarah Longwell. The hour-long session offered a glimpse into how views of the candidates varied widely.</p> <p>One woman who considers herself a moderate said she was inclined to support Lake because she grew up watching her deliver the news on TV. But for the other self-identified moderate in the group, Lake’s public persona gave her pause. Noting that Trump was also a media figure before turning to politics, she said: “I’m not certain I want to see Arizona go down that road.”</p> <p>All were aware that Trump had endorsed Lake, but that wasn’t enough for some.</p> <p>“I love Trump’s policies but not his rhetoric, and think Kari Lake would also be divisive when we need to come together,” said 81-year-old Arlene Bright, who attended the Trump rally in the Prescott Valley.</p> <p>“We need to move on from the last election.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/01/how-unilever-plastic-sachets-became-a-toxic-scourge-oceans","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T06:30:15Z","webTitle":"Single servings at low prices: how Unilever’s sachets became an environmental scourge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/01/how-unilever-plastic-sachets-became-a-toxic-scourge-oceans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/01/how-unilever-plastic-sachets-became-a-toxic-scourge-oceans","fields":{"headline":"Single servings at low prices: how Unilever’s sachets became an environmental scourge","trailText":"<strong>Plastic in the Depths</strong>: Multinational denies dropping plan to recycle plastic sachets – and leaving developing countries with a toxic headache as they end up in landfill or the ocean","byline":"Karen McVeigh and Gemma Holliani Cahya in Jakarta","body":"<p>Five years ago, Unilever announced a “radical recycling” process aimed at tackling a huge waste scourge it helped to create: billions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/26/uk-must-act-stamp-out-curse-plastic-sachets-say-campaigners\">single-use sachets</a> that litter south-east Asia’s landfills, pollute its waterways and wash up on its beaches.</p> \n<p>The “sachet economy” of single servings at low prices, targeting poorer consumers, began across much of the developing world in the 1990s.

Meanwhile, waste pickers who work on landfill sites<strong> </strong> said they were no better off, as sachet waste is too low in value to collect.</p> \n<p>The scheme was an “expensive failure”, said Yobel Novian Putra, the clean-energy officer at the non-profit organisation Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (Gaia) Indonesia. </p> \n<p>Putra’s organisation published a <a href=\"https://www.no-burn.org/unilever-creasolv/\">report</a> in January concluding that the Unilever scheme had failed owing to low recyclability and the low value of the waste. “It is a lot of effort to collect sachet waste and the price is very low,” said Putra, who added: “Unilever has not empowered waste-pickers and provided them with an income.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"f4a2e42158a28456b475a2cee233ac4e2077c3dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4a2e42158a28456b475a2cee233ac4e2077c3dd/0_0_4000_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy is barely seen amid an expanse of plastic and other waste between shacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boy fetches his ball from a rubbish-filled creek in Manila.

Over four seasons, Nathan For You, in which Fielder coached real small business owners into audaciously inane plans (<a href=\"https://www.avclub.com/nathan-for-you-relies-yet-again-on-the-power-of-celeb-1819207647\">staging a massive celebrity tip</a> at a diner for free press, rebranding a realtor as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7BlydBMAVU\">“100% ghost-free”</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/dumb-starbucks-nathan-fielder-los-feliz-comedy-central/1991301/\">“Dumb Starbucks”</a>) offered a decent litmus test for one’s tolerance for cringe. The typical Nathan For You viewing experience was some mix of awe at the grandiose stupidity of the scheme, amusement at the lengths to which Fielder would go, and genuine concern for the businesses.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fjPFt8cpic\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2fjPFt8cpic?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Rehearsal takes Fielder’s commitment and viewer trepidation to new heights. It takes a knowingly false notion – that one can control emotions, or life – and doubles down again and again until that notion looks like unhinged genius. There are the building blocks of reality-ish TV – participants both exposed and kept at a remove, the assumption that everything is quasi-real and quasi-scripted, crisp editing. (Fielder is an executive producer of the superlatively edited <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/magazine/how-to-john-wilson.html\">HBO’s How To With John Wilson</a>, which transforms mundane city life into glorious fantasia.) Watching The Rehearsal feels like reaching the outer fringes of reality television – you’re not quite sure what to make of it, skeptical of going further, and can’t stop looking.</p> <p>In the first episode, Fielder helps a trivia enthusiast practice revealing a low-grade, years-long fib to a friend with photorealistic accuracy, including a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/nathan-fielder-the-rehearsal-alligator-lounge-visit.html\">full-scale working replica</a> of Brooklyn’s Alligator Lounge. As all Fielder plots do, the second episode, which aired last Friday, escalates the stakes: Fielder unveils a two-month long simulation for Angela, a 40-something born-again Christian who put off having children, to test-run motherhood. We see the Truman Show-esque intricacy of Fielder’s set design – per Angela’s wishes, she lives at a farmhouse in Oregon with a garden, and rehearses the adoption of her son “Adam” from a real agency, handed over by his real mother. (Fielder also has the replica Alligator Lounge transported to a warehouse in Oregon – a good portion of the show’s entertainment is simply marveling at the amount of money he got out of HBO.)</p> <p>We also see, sometimes simultaneously, the arcane scaffolding required to sustain this disbelief. Fielder, blurring the line between the TV producer persona and Nathan For You’s socially awkward, stone-faced disposition, edits the adoption scene in real time, asking the real mother to elaborate on why she’d be “unfit” to be a parent. Big Brother-style cameras film Angela and a cast of child actors – all playing the role of Adam – in the house, beamed to a control board in the production’s nearby headquarters. A giant timer on the living room wall counts down the four-hour shifts for the underage actors, as required by law. Staff members stealthily switch out carseats when Angela’s not looking, or crawl through a window to slip a motorized crying doll into the crib for the night shift. (It is uncomfortable, borderline disturbing, to see toddlers participate in a production they cannot understand, pretending Angela is their mother; it’s also indistinguishable from the work of a child actor on any other show, nor arguably as fraught as, say, an child’s Instagram account created by adults.)</p> <p>For viewers, there is little distinction between on- and offstage, yet it’s disconcerting, and never less than fascinating, how quickly you take The Rehearsal’s bizarre terms as a given. That’s true even as the terms shift before us according to Fielder’s exacting vision and spiraling ego, itself extracted and fitted for TV. If, as Megan Garber argued in the Atlantic, the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/05/survivor-20-years-later-keeps-teaching-us-trust-no-one/610981/\">paranoid style of American reality television</a> post-Survivor taught us to assume the awesome, all-knowing power of off-screen producers, The Rehearsal just levels up the visibility of the machinations. The producer’s contortions are plot. When Fielder, who joins Angela’s simulation as platonic co-parent, feels trapped by the rules he has set for his own project, he changes them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa63098e78f4ef22a64cc1906411a68dede605c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa63098e78f4ef22a64cc1906411a68dede605c4/0_70_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Fielder in The Rehearsal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Rehearsal’s second episode, in which Fielder outlines his plan for Angela, has renewed a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/nathan-fielder-rehearsal-profile.html#_ga=2.141821810.1585931847.1658952069-402675310.1654531715\">critique of Fielder’s work</a> as manipulative or mean. It is fair to say that Angela’s devout faith comes off as kooky, her participation in this project delusional; a potential simulation partner for her has since said he <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkgpng/the-most-fascinating-guest-on-the-rehearsal-who-crashed-a-scion-tc-at-100-mph-did-not-enjoy-his-time-on-the-show\">takes issue with his portrayal</a> on the show, in which he smokes weed, drives, and fixates on spiritual numbers. But to dismiss the episode as manipulation feels like a misread of The Rehearsal, which consistently pokes at its own pretensions and sets up Fielder’s unfettered social anxiety as the butt of the joke. Of course it’s manipulation – the discomfort with a person’s portrayal, its perceived fairness or unfairness, is a core tenet and landmine of making television about real people appearing more or less as themselves.</p> <p>All reality shows contain some dance between choreography and watchable chaos, between controlled variables and the power of editing, for a product that assumes the position of accurate summary, or at least best curation. No one, not even the camp creations of Selling Sunset, or the contestants on Survivor, or the staff on Below Deck, or the castaways on Love Island, has control over their edit. We are all performing all the time, with no final say on one’s perception; reality participants do so at a heightened degree, with a semi-public record.</p> <p>The ultimate TV victim, to the extent that there is one, of this concept is Fielder himself. Over the course of the season, he grows trapped by the confines and gaps of his own experiment, which keeps dodging his grasp, especially as he becomes faux co-parent juggling work and life – in other words, childcare in the show and making the show. Angela understandably has her own visions for the project and acts accordingly. A separate participant ghosts the production without explanation, though you can infer it’s related to emotions over a deception that does, in my opinion, bump up against an ethical line. (The Rehearsal includes his prior footage.) In the later episodes, Fielder’s attempts to control variables of perception spiral into an addictively meta, solipsistic Russian doll of impersonations.</p> <p>The heart of another is a dark forest, but Fielder seems determined to try to map it anyway. At its core, The Rehearsal is deeply curious about why that is – why we act the ways we do, how we behave irrationally, the lengths we’ll go to avoid vulnerability, the amount we’ll watch other people try. To truly see people, their neuroses and inconsistencies and vanities, is messy. To know it’s being filmed for public consumption is discomfiting. To have that meticulously edited, and shot through with an HBO budget carte blanche? That’s good television, a reality show in which extreme contrivances get to something real.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Rehearsal airs on HBO in the US and is streaming on Binge in Australia, with a UK date

mortgages","byline":"Sarah Butler","body":"<p>About one in seven people could be paying a “loyalty penalty” for products such as mortgages and mobile and broadband packages, according to Citizens Advice.</p> <p>The charity said some UK households could save as much as £400 by switching, or seeking discounts, from their current suppliers.</p> <p>Citizens Advice also said analysis of the budgets of 165,000 people who came to it for help with debts suggested people on lower incomes can end up spending nearly double the proportion of their income on telecoms that those earning more do.</p> <p>Citizens Advice said it heard from a woman called Tracy who signed up to a £30-a-month package which included TV, landline, broadband and international calls in 2006. She relies on disability benefits.</p> <p>In January this year, she started working through her bills to look for potential savings and was shocked to see her bill had increased to £80 a month over the years, the charity said. She has now switched providers.</p> <p>She told the charity: “Everything is going up: gas, electric, food, and I have a mortgage to pay. I shop late in the evenings to get yellow-sticker discounted food, I turned off my gas as I can’t afford to repair the boiler or use the heating and I don’t go anywhere other than my hospital appointments.</p> <p>“When I asked my broadband provider why I wasn’t told about the increases, they said I should have checked my payments and contacted them to see if there was a cheaper deal.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/18/uk-overcharging-loyal-customers-fines-mobile-phone-broadband-insurance\">The charity submitted a “super-complaint”</a> about loyalty penalties in the mobile, broadband, home insurance, mortgages and savings markets in 2018.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Measures to protect home and car insurance customers from loyalty penalties were introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/30/landmark-uk-insurance-shakeup-poised-to-benefit-loyal-customers\">in January this year</a>. The changes mean insurers are required to offer renewing customers a price that is no higher than they would pay as a new customer.</p> <p>Mike Emmett, who runs training for advisers at Citizens Advice Cardiff and Vale, said: “Many people see their mobile and broadband as a lifeline. They need them to speak to people and do things like manage their universal credit account, and help their kids with their homework.</p> <p>“But they’re usually reluctant to switch for fear of rocking the boat, particularly because of the prospect of credit checks. We also find people who are digitally excluded or who have mental health problems often prefer to speak to someone about switching, but they can wait for hours on the phone and end up giving up.</p> <p>“It’s so frustrating when we see people who are on the lowest incomes paying the loyalty penalty, as they’re forced to jump through so many hoops to try to sort it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/01/climate-crisis-burning-death-meat-recycle-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"The climate crisis is so boring – but I also hate the idea of burning to death | Sofie Hagen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/climate-crisis-burning-death-meat-recycle-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/01/climate-crisis-burning-death-meat-recycle-environment","fields":{"headline":"The climate crisis is so boring – but I also hate the idea of burning to death","trailText":"I recycle, have cut my meat intake and don’t have kids.

We have a 25% share of the property which is valued at £82,000. The full value of the property when we bought it in March 2021 was approximately £328,000. We bought this with a five-year mortgage with a fixed rate of 2.2% and we’ve been overpaying the maximum 10% of the overall mortgage without incurring an overpayment penalty.</p> <p>Would it be possible for me to remortgage for 100% ownership as a buy-to-let? If so, what would the procedure be? We can pay off the mortgage for the share of the property we own (there is about £50,000 remaining of the mortgage), as I’ve come into a bit of money through inheritance. Is it a case of staircasing to 100% while applying to a bank for a buy-to-let mortgage?<br><strong>UM</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Unless there are exceptional circumstances, under the terms of your shared ownership lease you are not allowed to let your home if you only own a part of it (although you are usually allowed to have a lodger who lives with you). However, once you have staircased to 100%, you will own the property outright and so can let your home to whomever you like.</p> <p>To be able to staircase to 100%, you’ll need to pay to get a valuation done by an independent Rics-qualified valuer. Then you need to calculate whether the money you inherited will be enough to cover 75% of the valuation or whether you’ll need to increase your current mortgage to be able to buy your home outright. If the figures add up and – if applicable – your mortgage lender agrees to increase your mortgage, you can go ahead with buying the final share of your home. Once that’s done, you can go ahead with getting a buy-to-let mortgage or your current lender’s permission to let the property. But bear in mind that if you switch to a buy-to-let mortgage you’ll have to pay an early repayment charge because you’d be paying off your current residential mortgage before the five-year fixed-rate term is up.</p> <p>But what I don’t understand is why you want to switch to a buy-to-let mortgage even if you can. Where are you going to live if you let your home to tenants? It seems to me that a simpler and more sensible course of action would be for you and your wife to use the money you have inherited to buy a further share in your home and to carry on living there.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/01/a-new-start-after-60-at-70-i-went-camping-for-the-first-time-and-stopped-cocooning-myself-from-life","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"A new start after 60: At 70 I went camping for the first time – and stopped cocooning myself from life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/01/a-new-start-after-60-at-70-i-went-camping-for-the-first-time-and-stopped-cocooning-myself-from-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/01/a-new-start-after-60-at-70-i-went-camping-for-the-first-time-and-stopped-cocooning-myself-from-life","fields":{"headline":"A new start after 60: At 70 I went camping for the first time – and stopped cocooning myself from life","trailText":"His tent has blown down, midges have forced him to sleep in a van, but after decades of planning and preparation, Erik Wilkinson is embracing the unexpected","byline":"Paula Cocozza","body":"<p>Erik Wilkinson’s 70th birthday hit him with great force. He celebrated, but cannot remember the occasion. However, a phrase entered his head. “Pregnancy of death,” he says. “The words sprang into me. I thought: ‘I don’t know how long I’ve got.’ And this phrase kept coming to mind.”</p> <p>It began to dominate his thoughts. “Like any pregnancy, you need certain inputs. Because you are going through a transition,” he says.</p> <p>This is how, at 70, Wilkinson decided it was time for his first experience of camping. A thinker and a planner – he says he is often described as a thoughtful tactician – he took preparation seriously. He and his wife, Norah, put up a tent in the garden. During lockdown, they slept out for the first time.</p> <p>“Our tent opened Norah and me to strange rustles of animals, the flutter of moths and the gentle hues of the sky ... and the tent stayed up!”</p> <p>Did Wilkinson want to camp as a child? “Not at all!” he says. “The thought was awful. It was too challenging.” In cubs and scouts, he declined all invitations. “I wonder why,” he muses.</p> <p>Maybe he liked to know how things would pan out in advance? “Probably. Yes.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I’m trying to make the journey from ‘This is awful’ to ‘This is an adventure’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wilkinson spent most of his working life, from his late 20s to 55, in the National Careers Service, which is ironic, given that he didn’t really know what to do. He was looking for security after two years travelling – itself an attempt “to break the whole thing about lower-middle-class kid goes to university, comes out and goes into a bank”. He set up a self-funding assessment centre in Wiltshire, which used psychometric testing to provide careers advice. In a sense, at 72, he is now advising himself on his own best way forward.</p> <p>After the night in the garden, Wilkinson continued his camping apprenticeship with Norah in Stroud, then in Carmarthenshire. He saw other campers’ fires, and bought a fold-up brazier. He adapted his Citroën Berlingo to take a camp bed.</p> <p>Then, in June, after they had visited family in Scotland, Norah caught the train home to Gloucestershire and Wilkinson set off on his first big solo adventure – “10 days on my own around the north of Scotland”.</p> <p>He slept out in the van by the sea on his first night, after midges drove him from the campsite. But that was great, he says. “It’s the things that go wrong, the problem-solving, the people you meet, that take you out of your comfort zone. It’s not cocooning you from life.”</p> <p>Another night, a gale blew down his tent in Durness – and that was fine, too. “That’s there as a memory. It’s shifting it from ‘This is awful’ to ‘This is an adventure’. That’s the journey I’m trying to do.” Maybe he is trying to effect the same shift on hitting his 70s.</p> <p>Camping, or adventure, is only one aspect of Wilkinson’s “pregnancy” preparations. The phrase being so suggestive, I wonder if he and Norah have children, but Wilkinson says they chose not to and “it’s not been a big deal”. He lists other “pillars” of this gestation as practical (getting a will in order, accepting death, developing intergenerational relationships), but say there is a spiritual element, too.</p> <p>Wilkinson says that all his life he has worked too hard. Even volunteering for local climate groups in retirement came to feel like a job. As he talks about his “pillars”, this “pregnancy” that may extend to decades sounds as if it has activated his work ethic, albeit in a liberating way. “I’m very in my head,” he says. “That’s why the camping is so good.”</p> <p>It chimes with his experience after university. “What I wanted to do was to travel,” he says. He went to India and Israel. “And that was the best thing I ever did.” Not least because he met Norah on a kibbutz.</p> <p>There are times, especially while having breakfast at his campfire, or sitting there in the evening, between eight and 10 as the light fades, enjoying “that meditative aspect” of the flames, that he really appreciates camping – “for giving me a way to be as healthy and positive as I possibly can be for the people I love”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/04/tell-us-has-your-life-taken-a-new-direction-after-the-age-of-65\" title=\"\"><em>Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?</em></a><em> </em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/01/robert-lowell-memoirs-edited-by-steven-gould-axelrod-and-grzegorz-kosc-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Robert Lowell: Memoirs, edited by Steven Gould Axelrod and Grzegorz Kosc – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/01/robert-lowell-memoirs-edited-by-steven-gould-axelrod-and-grzegorz-kosc-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/01/robert-lowell-memoirs-edited-by-steven-gould-axelrod-and-grzegorz-kosc-review","fields":{"headline":"Robert Lowell: Memoirs, edited by Steven Gould Axelrod and Grzegorz Kosc – review","trailText":"A collection of the poet’s stately prose from the 1950s reveals his shift into confessional writing and the bipolar disorder that led to hospitalisation and regrets","byline":"Declan Ryan","body":"<p>In an exceptionally gifted generation of American poets, Robert Lowell was, in his lifetime, number one. That was the critical consensus at least after Robert Frost’s death in 1963 left space at the head of the table. Since Lowell’s own death in 1977, however, his reputation has waned, while others in his circle – especially his friend <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/elizabeth-bishop\">Elizabeth Bishop</a> – have outstripped him.</p> <p>Born to one of the grandest families in the US, Lowell was a difficult figure. His early work was all hellfire and bombast, leaning on Milton and his zealous Catholicism. It won him acclaim, but the brimstone fervour was accompanied by what we would now call bipolar disorder, resulting in bouts of “enthusiasm”; short-lived love affairs, hospitalisation and stultifying regret.</p> <p>In 1954, shortly after his mother’s death, Lowell underwent psychotherapy at the Payne Whitney clinic in New York and began writing an “autobiographical monster”, reflecting on his childhood, spurred by the therapy that saw him revisit his formative years. He hoped this might be his way out of writer’s block – as a lapsed Catholic, he didn’t want to continue with the “old rhetoric” – and would lead to a less enervated existence. In one poignant extract here he sets out what he hoped to gain: “What I ask is… that these extremes be cured, or at least moderated… I want to live the life I have – married, teaching, writing”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The family portraits, rich in stabbing detail, deepen our understanding of Lowell’s childhood</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The project led to a great artistic leap, but not in the way he’d anticipated – the “monster” became material for poetry, and in 1957 he completed drafts of 11 poems that formed the basis of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/mar/01/robert-lowell-at-100-poetry-centenary\">Life Studies</a> </em>(1959), his influential shift into “confessional” writing. <em>Memoirs</em> publishes, mostly for the first time, the prose Lowell composed – chiefly in two spells between 1954 and 1957 – and allows the reader to see it not only as origin story for the poems, but as a graceful, stately work in its own right. Lowell was influenced by Flaubert, his “images and ironic or amusing particulars”, and was in possession of invaluable source material.</p> <p>Elizabeth Bishop, writing to Lowell after reading the <em>Life Studies</em> poems, noted wryly: “I am green with envy... I feel I could write in as much detail about my uncle Artie, say, but what would be the significance?” Unlike Bishop’s uncle, Lowell’s family were historic public figures. In one of a number of “undertaker’s pieces” on writers, Lowell writes: “Wasn’t I… a young man doomed to trifle with poetry and end up as president of Harvard or ambassador to England? I have stepped over these pitfalls. I have conquered my hereditary disadvantages.”</p> <p>The family portraits, rich in stabbing detail, deepen our understanding of Lowell’s childhood and his attempts at recovery in the “balanced aquarium” of the hospital. His reminiscences fill out figures known to readers of his work, which, from <em>Life Studies</em> onwards, became a “small scale <em>Prelude</em>”; like Wordsworth’s epic, Lowell made his life his grand subject. As in the poems, he can be dismissive of his father, the permanently smiling Robbie, a former naval man who “treated even himself with the caution and uncertainty of one who has forgotten a name”. By contrast, Lowell’s mother, Charlotte, is imposing, dominant, almost mythic: “Mother, her strong chin unprotected… seemed to me the young Alexander”. Lowell’s grandfather, Arthur Winslow, the clan’s true patriarch, is also seen in colour, in a deepening of <em>Memoirs’</em> oedipal overtones. He “presided like Lear at the head of the table”, we learn, his presence haunting and unbalancing the family.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/mar/01/robert-lowell-at-100-poetry-centenary\">Robert Lowell at 100: why his poetry has never been more relevant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There’s something oedipal in Lowell’s tributes to other writers too, among them mentors such as Robert Penn Warren and John Crowe Ransom (“the intellectual father I would have chosen”). Then there are his thoughts on former students Anne Sexton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/08/sylvia-plath-reflections-on-her-legacy\">Sylvia Plath</a>. Plath’s last poems, Lowell writes, have “the wild energy of a horse throwing off its trappings”, but the cost of their terrible courage was too great, “the finality of playing Russian roulette with a full cylinder”.</p> <p>He is quick to downplay the morbid glamour that clung to his generation: “the life of the ant is more to the ant than the health of his anthill”. Lowell wrote this prose, as he wrote more broadly, to supply himself with “a sort of immense bandage of gauze… for my hurt nerves”. Giving a reading in 1976, he remarked, as an aside, “memory is genius” and as he puts it here: “From year to year, things remembered from the past change almost more than the present.”</p> <p>Writing was a life raft. Through it he found a way to lower his poems’ temperature and fix, in lasting images, what his biographer Ian Hamilton called “the moderate emotions”, fashioning memory into art.</p> <p>• <em>Declan Ryan’s first collection of poetry, Crisis Actor, will be published by Faber next year</em></p> <p>• <em>Robert Lowell: Memoirs</em>, edited by Steven Gould Axelrod and Grzegorz Kosc,<strong> </strong>is published by Faber (£40).

Chances are that relaxed traveller was born with access to a passport that has a high “power ranking”.</p> <p>If you don’t know what that is, lucky you, for you are probably a holder of a passport that is high on the Henley passport index – a global ranking of countries in terms of the travel freedom their passports enjoy. The higher your passport ranks, the more “border privilege” you have – that is, the ability to cross national boundaries with, at best, a sense of excitement and, at worst, mild annoyance at the inconveniences of travel.</p> <p>As the reality of Brexit bites and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/24/wing-and-a-prayer-48-hours-at-luton-airport-interviews-by-michael-segalov\">international travel increases</a> post-lockdown, Britons are about to find out a few things about border privilege – namely, what happens when you lose it. Only a nation that viewed freedom of travel as an entitlement could have thrown it away so breezily. Those who did not grow up with border privilege can tell you that without it travel is an obstacle course; something you gird your loins for, prepare dossiers of documents for, say several hail Marys and inshallahs for.</p> <p>The passports at the top of the Henley index allow the holder to visit almost 200 countries without securing a visa in advance. Those lower down, like the Sudanese one I was born with, must pass through the eye of a needle before being permitted to enter the majority of countries. Applicants face almost unscalable walls of bureaucracy and suspicion, comical demands for paperwork and, often, humiliation and refusal.</p> <p>For a long time I was so terrified of travel falling through at the 11th hour that I would not make any plans until I was firmly on the other side of the border. I only booked tickets at the very last minute, at exorbitant cost, when I was certain that it was too late for anything to go wrong. I have had visa applications languish for weeks and months beyond the date I had intended to travel, missed the bedsides of ill relatives, the celebrations of friends and family, and too many work and training opportunities than I can bear to estimate.</p> <p>Having a low-ranking passport means its holder is under constant threat of plummeting down trapdoors in the middle of a journey. A visa detail overlooked by a border official meant I was summoned, having just landed in Riyadh, into a room of angry Saudi border officials who scolded me for this oversight, and sent me back on the next flight. I wasn’t allowed to leave the airport until I had paid the price of the return flight, which took all the cash I had. Another time I was yanked into secondary processing in the US with no explanation and no recourse, where I was left for so long without information or update it probably amounted to some sort of illegal detention.</p> <p>Since 2016, the British passport has fallen from joint first place on the index <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jan/14/uk-passport-drops-to-sixth-in-global-power-index\">to sixth</a>. With that comes a new reality, which is already being ominously described as the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/23/travel-chaos-is-the-new-normal-after-brexit-british-tourists-are-warned\">new normal</a>”. Travel to and within Europe is becoming unpredictable, costly and generally with more of the series of hurdles that others are used to. The introduction of a single stamp to enter the EU sounds like a small enough thing, but it triggers hours of queues, and then the domino effect starts – missed connections, missing baggage, refund mazes.</p> <p>In this new reality, consistency is gone. What you will need to enter France is different from what you will need to enter Spain, the latter recently confirming that British visitors may need <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/1643741/Spain-tourism-money-Brits-Foreign-Office-travel-hacks\">proof of sufficient funds</a> to cover your stay, a return ticket and evidence of accommodation. Whatever the requirements, the adequacy of your evidence is to be assessed by a single guard within whose person lies the entire border. You will come to understand that all travel permits, both those that require only a stamp and those that require an involved visa process, are subject to different versions of the same brief sentence, usually appended to entry permits and disclaimers on travel information packs: “This is not a final entry visa, a border official can still refuse entry.”</p> <p>Someone with a low-ranking passport will tell you that in all interactions with this border official you absolutely must keep your counsel, in the knowledge that this guard who has your passport in their hands is, for the next few minutes, the most powerful person in your life. They are a sovereign, they can make or unmake laws there on the spot, and possibly plunge you into financial ruin. Even if things are bad, you must always remember that they can get much worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/31/now-voters-know-we-cant-make-brexit-work-labour-must-call-for-closer-bond-with-europe\">Brexit is a flop, and the voters know it. So why can’t Labour call for a closer bond with Europe? | Roy Hattersley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In all situations you must soothe yourself by repeating an incantation that reminds you that you are lucky: lucky to have got this far; lucky to have the paperwork and means to travel at all; lucky that you have the skill and physical ability to negotiate an unexpected obstacle; and lucky that the worst you are likely to face is a smarting ego and wallet, rather than detention or deportation.</p> <p>I recount these experiences with no rancour. I once sat, flinching, next to a trembling elderly south Asian woman in a wheelchair while she was being yelled at in secondary processing at a US airport for not being able to speak sufficient English to answer questions about who she was visiting. Whatever work her family had put into securing her entry to the country had been wiped out by a single new arbitrary requirement.</p> <p>The most important lesson you will learn is that border officials may not know the law and yet are infinitely empowered. They can be poorly informed, under-resourced, or unable to keep up with border policy changes; and yet they are part of such a large and messy border policing machine that your poor treatment and their mistakes will be swallowed up in its churn.</p> <p>For British travellers, however, there will be an extra kick. Your grievances will then be trivialised by Brexit evangelists. You will be told that these are small sacrifices to make, the gripes of a privileged few in the middle of a cost of living crisis in a country trying to take back control of its own borders and economic fate, that being unable to afford or navigate holidays to our nearest most cheaply accessible neighbours is a “first world” problem.</p> <p>But eventually, what will become clear, as with all Brexit fallout, is that the benefits we have lost can be clawed back by those who have the most – the fast tracks, the travel insurance, the funds and the time. For the rest of us, I recommend compiling a paper dossier of supporting documents, a very early arrival at the airport and, if you are overcome by frustration or panic, remembering it could always be worse.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/01/monkeypox-us-virus-vaccine-health-response","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Slow response to monkeypox exposes ‘tired, overworked’ US health agencies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/monkeypox-us-virus-vaccine-health-response","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/01/monkeypox-us-virus-vaccine-health-response","fields":{"headline":"Slow response to monkeypox exposes ‘tired, overworked’ US health agencies","trailText":"Virus has taken hold amid ragged system ravaged by years of underfunding, messy bureaucracy and Covid","byline":"Jessica Glenza","body":"<p>A “slow and bureaucratic” response that has seen monkeypox spread rapidly across the US – with more than a thousand cases in New York City alone – reveals just how badly battered local health agencies have been since the Covid pandemic, advocates have said.</p> <p>Once a rare African virus, monkeypox has taken hold amid the ragged patchwork of city, county, state and federal agencies that make up the US public health infrastructure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/san-francisco-monkeypox-state-of-emergency\">San Francisco and New York state on emergency footing over monkeypox</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Unfortunately, delayed actions mean monkeypox has spread within the gay community and among other men who have sex with men,” said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors.</p> <p>“This outbreak has grown to be a public health crisis in America.

The situation was not helped as resources that had once been devoted to things like tracking communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, or running routine vaccination clinics, were suddenly diverted to Covid-19.</p> <p>Sexual health clinics have struggled, too, as testing and staff resources were devoted to Covid-19, hurting organizations that had already suffered years of underfunding.</p> <p>The result has been worse health outcomes for many basic public health services: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/29/childhood-immunisation-plummeted-pandemic\">routine vaccinations for children</a> have fallen; <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p1218-overdose-deaths-covid-19.html\">overdose deaths have exploded</a>; and the US has posted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/12/us-sexually-transmitted-infections-record-2020\">record-high rate of sexually transmitted infections</a> for the sixth year running.</p> <p>As monkeypox has spread, the Biden administration has attempted to respond by releasing about 1.1m vaccines and ramping up testing capacity, which has grown from about 6,000 to 80,000 per week. The World Health Organization declared monkeypox a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/jul/23/who-declares-monkeypox-a-global-health-emergency-video\">global health emergency</a> this week, and the US could follow suit by declaring monkeypox a national public health emergency, which would release more resources to local agencies.</p> <p>“The system is tired, it’s overworked, it’s underpaid, it’s understaffed,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “All the same issues that plagued us during the pandemic are still with us and haven’t gone away.</p> <p>“What’s added to it, with monkeypox and beyond, is that we also have a workforce that has documented mental health trauma after the pandemic.”</p> <p>Public health advocates want the president and Congress to allocate more funds to respond to the outbreak, and for sexual health clinics in general. Public facilities have proven to be the first line of defense with monkeypox, even as federal prevention funding for such work has <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/article/babies-die-as-congenital-syphilis-continues-a-decade-long-surge-across-the-us/\">fallen 41% since 2003</a>.</p> <p>“Local sexual health providers are being asked to respond to monkeypox on top of an already out-of-control STI epidemic in America,” said Harvey. “We are at the breaking point: we need the Biden administration and Congress to immediately fund STI public health programs and clinical services.”</p> <p>Although anyone can catch monkeypox, the virus has primarily affected men who have sex with men. Sexual health clinics have often been frontline responders to the outbreak because of how monkeypox can present its symptoms, with lesions around the genitals and the anus – though sex is just one way monkeypox can spread. Any close contact with an infected person can spread the disease, including touching, kissing and cuddling, as well as sharing glasses, utensils, bedding and towels.</p> <p>Although the virus, which belongs to the same family as smallpox, is rarely fatal, symptoms can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/23/i-literally-screamed-out-loud-in-pain-my-two-weeks-of-monkeypox-hell\">excruciating</a>, with painful lesions and flu-like symptoms, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/faq.html#Basics\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Up to <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/article/monkeypox-sexual-health-clinics-underfunded-ill-equipped/\">10% of people</a> are reportedly requiring hospitalization, , and many are showing up in emergency departments because of severe pain, said Freeman.</p> <p>The situation is exacerbated because testing for monkeypox is limited. There is no home test and results can take days. There is, however, a vaccine, for which people at heightened risk may be eligible; they may also qualify for treatment with the drug tecovirimat, sold as TPOXX. But the barriers are significant, obtaining it can be tricky, and tecovirimat – usually reserved for people with severe symptoms – must be requested by doctors from the government’s national strategic national stockpile, which involves significant paperwork.</p> <p>Moreover, people without insurance probably lack access to both vaccine and drug, said Freeman; about 12.7% of the LGBTQ+ community lacks health insurance compared with 11.4% of the general population, according to <a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/lgbt-health-ib.pdf\">an analysis</a> by federal officials. Even if you do have insurance, there are hurdles baked into the US healthcare system, such as trying to navigate between urgent care clinics, primary care providers and state health departments.</p> <p>Freeman recounted a story she about a local health department that asked its state for information about a monkeypox outbreak. The state replied to check with the CDC; the CDC then redirected local officials back to the state.</p> <p>“There’s a lot of finger-pointing going on here,” she said. “We should have learned. We should know more now than we knew three years ago from our Covid response [about] what we need to do here.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2022/aug/01/martha-karua-wave-mother-of-nation-kenyan-presidential-elections","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T06:00:15Z","webTitle":" ‘Karua wave’ in Kenya’s elections may bring first female deputy president ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/01/martha-karua-wave-mother-of-nation-kenyan-presidential-elections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/aug/01/martha-karua-wave-mother-of-nation-kenyan-presidential-elections","fields":{"headline":" ‘Karua wave’ in Kenya’s elections may bring first female deputy president ","trailText":"Martha Karua may become Kenya’s most senior woman ever but feminists fear the compromises that will be forced on her","byline":"Caroline Kimeu in Nairobi","body":"<p>The Kenyan media are calling it the “Karua wave”, as the woman hoping to be the country’s first female deputy president energises a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jul/04/pressure-points-threat-of-violence-builds-as-kenyas-elections-approach\">jaded political race</a>.

She was a key figure in the push for multiparty democracy through the 1980s and 1990s, and defended human rights activists during the dictatorial regime of the former president Daniel Arap Moi, known for its brutal crackdowns on dissent.</p> <p>The 64-year-old resigned from her role as justice minister in 2009, citing frustrations in her efforts to bring about judicial reform after the <a href=\"https://www.jurist.org/news/2009/04/kenya-justice-minister-resigns-citing/\">government appointed judges without her knowledge</a>.</p> <p>Analysts say her nomination breathed new life into the campaign of Odinga’s Azimio la Umoja political alliance, sparking new enthusiasm among Kenyans looking for change. “There was a very ambivalent middle class looking at all the candidates, feeling like there was no one they could identify with. That base was definitely stirred up when Martha joined the race,” says Joy Masinde, a political analyst. “It energised a group of urban women that were not very invested in the political process.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"042ed6aa7f7f117e5dbfda05f20b03b5496fa8fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/042ed6aa7f7f117e5dbfda05f20b03b5496fa8fa/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kenyans hold painted portraits of three politicians at an election rally\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters hold portraits of Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta, left; presidential candidate Raila Odinga, centre, and his running mate Martha Karua at a rally in Murang’a last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Masinde says Karua’s candidacy has pulled in some votes for Odinga, who is ahead of his main rival, William Ruto, in the polls, and believes the nomination heralds a trend.</p> <p>“People are now seeing the benefit of bringing a different gender on to a ticket,” says Masinde. “You can hear the nostalgia when people say <em>Mama na Baba</em> [mother and father] – it’s like a nuclear family, it feels safe.</p> <p>“Even in the campaign rhetoric, now you hear the references that ‘when a woman is there, the youth issues are taken care of, the gender issues are taken care of’,” she adds.</p> <p>But such narratives do not always work when female politicians go it alone. Karua <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/26/kenya-election-debate-failed\">ran for the presidency</a> nine years ago but won less than 1% of the vote. She took a break from politics shortly after.</p> <p>Her new allies are unexpected: Odinga, whom she accused of ethnic cleansing after Kenya’s 2007 post-election violence, and the outgoing president Uhuru Kenyatta, whom she accused of failing to tackle corruption.</p> <p>Some consider such partnerships to be a necessary evil. “When she tried to stand on her values and track record in 2013, she didn’t gain much traction,” says Catherine Amayi, a Kenyan feminist. “With the state backing and visibility she has now, she’s gained a lot more ground with voters.”</p> <p>While Karua has strong support from urban and educated Kenyans, analysts say that her opponent, Rigathi Gachagua, may have more support in the Mount Kenya region, a highly influential voter base where they both come from.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5749519e22cd0cf288dc66d8eef9f57bdede028\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5749519e22cd0cf288dc66d8eef9f57bdede028/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two people stand up through car sun roofs as they wave to crowds \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raila Odinga, in the foreground, and Martha Karua, behind, greet supporters in Nairobi’s Kibera slum after being nominated as presidential candidates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“In the urban setting, there’s definitely a Martha wave but when you go back to the countryside, you find that is not so much so,” says Masinde, who adds that sexist attitudes towards leadership still hold sway, making Gachagua a preferred candidate.</p> <p>Kenyatta, who supports the Odinga-Karua bid, also holds significant influence in the region.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It gives me hope that when she’s in government, I wouldn’t have to live in exile or be afraid of getting shot</p> <footer> <cite>Boniface Mwangi, campaigner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Karua, who was elected in 1992, was one of the first women to become an MP in Kenya, and has held the position for two decades in a country where only 23% of parliamentarians are women. While the constitution requires that no more than two-thirds of MPs should be men, the supreme court ruled that this did not require immediate implementation.</p> <p>The courts took a stronger stand in 2020, when the chief justice advised Kenyatta to dissolve parliament for failing to implement gender equality.</p> <p>“Karua’s appointment is coming on the backdrop of the clamour of inclusion. The two-thirds gender rule has never been actualised, so women have really been agitating for their space in politics,” says Masinde.</p> <p>Women’s groups say a Karua win could resonate beyond Kenya’s borders. “The rates of women in leadership across Africa are still dismal,” says Eunice Musiime, of the feminist organisation <a href=\"https://www.akinamamawaafrika.org/\">Akina Mama wa Afrika</a>. Only 10% or so of vice-presidential positions in Africa are held by women, with only two female presidents and five as prime ministers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2dc3de77593db3bd196fc8941ac38e1533457c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2dc3de77593db3bd196fc8941ac38e1533457c7/0_0_2048_1464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young woman in a pink jacket stands at a lectern\" width=\"1000\" height=\"715\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martha Karua in 2003, being sworn in as Kenya’s minister for water resources.

It rose to prominence on the back of several high-profile campaigns.</p> <p>But earlier this year, NWS publicly imploded amid accusations of the very thing it was designed to tackle – white saviourism and privilege. Nielsen was accused of using her white privilege to control the organisation and of abusing black Ugandan staff. Allegations surfaced of bar brawls.</p> <p>Now Nielsen, who has since resigned from the organisation she helped to start, has told the Guardian that she acknowledges she behaved in a hypocritical way.</p> <p>In Uganda, mainstream public conversations about white saviourism began 10 years ago after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/09/kony2012-video-70m-hits\">Kony2012</a>, a student-made film, was launched by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/08/kony-2012-what-s-the-story\">US non-profit group Invisible Children</a> to back a campaign to bring warlord Joseph Kony to justice.

The organisation also called out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/29/i-am-not-my-trauma-survivors-of-sexual-abuse-at-a-ugandan-girls-shelter-photo-essay\">Bernhard ‘Bery’ Glaser</a>, a German accused of sexually abusing underage Ugandan girls, who died before the end of his trial.</p> <p>Nielsen – a self-styled “white saviour in recovery” – supported the organisation by infiltrating white spaces and gaining better reception for its work among white audiences.</p> <p>“I think that they wouldn’t have done some of the things they did if they did not have Kelsey on board, or go up against some of the people they targeted in their campaigns” says Bwesigye bwa Mwesigire, a Ugandan activist and African studies researcher at Cornell University. “White faces are protected better than black faces when calling whiteness to account.”</p> <p>The cracks in NWS had begun to show in 2020 when a global racial reckoning after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">murder of George Floyd</a> in the US prompted difficult conversations on race and the role of allies. Some of the campaign’s followers began to question Nielsen’s front-seat role in the organisation.</p> <p>Mwesigire says Nielsen co-opted important campaigns. “At some point, the story of Renée Bach harming Ugandan children became a personal conflict between Renée and Kelsey – an intra-white affair where we [Ugandans] were just props,” he says. “In some way, the NWS approach was to separate the good whites from the bad whites, so it still centred on whiteness.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03eed87c05cd437baf1383a5bb8936886259d989\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03eed87c05cd437baf1383a5bb8936886259d989/0_0_960_720/500.jpg\" alt=\"Renee Bach, far right, was accused of practising medicine on children without medical training.\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Renee Bach, far right, was accused of practising medicine on children without medical training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alaso told the Guardian that black team leaders were often sidelined by third parties in favour of an outspoken Nielsen, which she believes was partly because of her white privilege. Alaso says that Nielsen’s central role in the organisation became more problematic as the organisation broadened its focus into black liberation and pan-Africanism. According to some employees, Nielsen began to distance herself from her background and would compare herself to black revolutionaries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/13/assata-shakur-civil-rights-activist-fbi-most-wanted\">Assata Shakur</a>. “Kelsey considered herself as the most radical person in the organisation for black liberation,” says Rwothomio Kabandole, an employee at NWS. “She behaved as though she knew more than African people, and appointed herself judge, juror and executioner of what it meant to be black in Africa.”</p> <p>As NWS evolved from being a social media-led campaign into an organisation, many of its blindspots surfaced. Alaso says because Nielsen was American, the organisation opted to open its US-based financial accounts under her name. Nielsen also facilitated its registration as a non-profit in the US, where the organisation received most of its funding, which made it eligible for tax exemptions. As a result, Kabandole claims that Nielsen exercised exclusive control over NWS’s accounts, and effectively “held them hostage”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/10/msf-ran-white-saviour-tv-ad-despite-staff-warnings-over-racism\">MSF ran 'white saviour' TV ad despite staff warnings over racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Initially, Kelsey’s presence on the team appeared to be helping us overcome legal challenges, but she abused that status and used it to her advantage,” says Alaso. She claims that late last year, she found out that Nielsen was misusing the organisation’s funds and says that when she challenged her on it, Nielsen tried to have her dismissed.</p> <p>In correspondence with the Guardian, Nielsen denied all allegations of misappropriation.</p> <p>As the financial scandal rocked the organisation, other allegations against Nielsen began to surface. Some employees claim that she subjected them to verbal abuse and threatened them with the sack when they refused to back her move to fire Alaso. They also claim they received periodic reminders of how fortunate they were to have a job at NWS when Uganda had high unemployment levels. They also say that she was violent towards an employee at a Kampala bar.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Nielsen expressed regret over the bar assault and, without addressing specific claims, said she had acted out of white privilege during her time at the organisation. “It’s easy to talk about the harm whiteness causes when it’s naming it in others,” she says. “We become a lot more resistant and unwilling when it is recognising it in ourselves. I have been resistant to see this and that’s extremely hypocritical of me, especially considering the work I committed myself to.”</p> <p>Having faced a severe backlash on social media, matters have come full circle for Nielsen. “For me, this experience has humanised individuals we’ve ‘held accountable’ on the platform,” she says, adding that the experience has made her reconsider whether public callouts were the best way to instigate change.</p> <p>Alaso did not escape criticism when NWS’s problems began to surface on Twitter last month. Many of the organisation’s supporters believed she was at the helm, with Nielsen playing a supportive role.</p> <p>“The NWS team and I are accountable to our community and will stay transparent and open to questions and ongoing concerns,” <a href=\"https://nowhitesaviors.substack.com/p/2nd-official-statement-from-olivia\">she said on 3 June</a>.</p> <p>After a tumultuous year, the organisation is now restructuring into a fully black, African-led NGO that Alaso says will continue to call out white saviourism.</p> <p>Even with the changes, Mwesigire is sceptical of the organisation and its work, saying that a better way to fight the white saviour complex is to support informal “non-structured” community efforts.</p> <p>“On a day-to-day basis, ordinary [Ugandans] are saving themselves. The reason they are not supported is because they are not seen as stakeholders,” says Mwesigire. “The only way to end white saviourism is to stop centring whiteness.”</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/jun/08/global-dispatch-sign-up-for-a-different-world-view\">Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter</a> – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Global Dispatch\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4146\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Global Dispatch\" data-form-description=\"Get our fortnightly email of editors' picks and the biggest headlines\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email</figcaption> </figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/01/uk-businesses-slash-investments-due-to-soaring-prices-and-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T05:30:14Z","webTitle":"UK businesses slash investments due to soaring prices and Brexit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/01/uk-businesses-slash-investments-due-to-soaring-prices-and-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/01/uk-businesses-slash-investments-due-to-soaring-prices-and-brexit","fields":{"headline":"UK businesses slash investments due to soaring prices and Brexit","trailText":"As many firms are now planning to cut investment as to increase it, latest polls find","byline":"Graeme Wearden","body":"<p>UK business leaders are slashing investment plans as soaring prices, Brexit trading difficulties and political uncertainty all leave bosses pessimistic about the economic outlook.</p> <p>As many firms are now planning to cut investment as to increase it, according to the Institute of Directors’ latest poll of business chiefs.

A local woman (Diana Quick) intermittently pops up to protest about the planned memorial, insisting that she is “not bigoted” but questioning why a memorial for Jewish victims should sit in her local park.

Dan reveals himself to be a thoroughly objectionable character whose “owning up” to his white, male privilege is glib, expedient, perhaps even cynical. Leah seems to see through it so it is unconvincing when the pair begin a romance – and one which has little bearing on the drama or its outcome.</p> <p>The performances are robust, even with some slightly halting moments, and Leah makes a powerful speech at the end which pulls the rug from under the feet of the characters and leaves us weighing up her words too.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://originaltheatreonline.com/productions/42/on-demand-originals-at-riverside-studios\">Available online until 21 July 2023</a></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/01/first-edition-england-women-euro-2022","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T05:27:29Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Five big ideas to grow women’s football after England’s heroics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/first-edition-england-women-euro-2022","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/01/first-edition-england-women-euro-2022","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Five big ideas to grow women’s football after England’s heroics","trailText":"In today’s newsletter: After the Lionesses’s tournament for the ages, five experts explain how to carry the momentum into the women’s game at all levels","byline":"Archie Bland","body":"<p><em><strong>Good morning!!!!!!! </strong></em>I don’t want to alarm you, but something… <em>good </em>has happened.

If you look at Chelsea, Arsenal, and Manchester City, they’re so far ahead – whereas you might have a top player like Chelsea striker Sam Kerr on upward of £300,000 a year, the average WSL salary is <a href=\"https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/how-much-are-womens-footballers-paid\">reportedly around a tenth of that</a>.</p> <p>You also then have a real gulf between the WSL and the rest. Look at a club like Leicester: they have the backing of a big Premier League side, and when they got promoted into the WSL they invested heavily, have a really good young coach, new training facilities and they’re playing in the main stadium. Everything was set up for them to succeed. But they got hammered quite a few times. That is a reflection of the gap.</p> <p>To make the league more competitive, there’s a case to be made that the clubs should be committing money into a central pot that gets distributed, rather than just investing in their own sides. That could make a difference quickly. At the moment, it feels like we’re on a journey towards Premier League Mark II. That’s because they want to get the big clubs on board to accelerate growth – but this tide isn’t going to raise all boats, which is what you need. There’s a danger that they build the castle without the foundations.</p> <p><em>Suzanne Wrack is women’s football correspondent for the Guardian and the Observer and author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-womans-game-9781783352159\">A Woman’s Game: The Rise, Fall, and Rise Again of Women’s Football</a></em></p> <p>***</p> <p>Faye Carruthers: England should bid to host the next World Cup</p> <p>There is already a joint bid between Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands for 2027. But because of the success of the Euros so far, it’s going to be a hotly contested bidding process. And England should be part of it.</p> <p>It’s important for people to see that the country is keen to host the World Cup, to maintain momentum. With the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next year, the time difference means that for fans over here, it’s not going to get the same amount of traction as this home tournament has done.</p> <p>The Lionesses have secured a whole swathe of new fans because of what they have achieved this summer. Success breeds support, and that then transfers onto the domestic game, and then further down the pyramid to participation.</p> <p><em>Faye Carruthers is host of The Guardian’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theguardianswomensfootballweekly\">Women’s Football Weekly</a> podcast.

Just 40 per cent of all schools offer identical footballing opportunities to girls during evenings, weekends and holidays. If we are to produce the best possible England teams of the future - not to mention have a healthier, happier, female population - that needs to change.</p> <p>Right now, far too much potential female talent is being left overlooked and untapped. Let’s hope head teachers all over the country are energised by the Euros and cease to pay mere lip service to sporting equality for girls.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/louisetaylor\">Louise Taylor</a> is north-east football correspondent for the Guardian</em></p> <p>***</p> <p>Sophie Downey: We should just market the hell out of it</p> <p>I’ve followed the women’s game for 10 years now and it’s massively different from where it was – that 9.1 million viewers watched the England v Sweden semi-final is just ridiculous. But, crucially, it’s now about maintaining that coverage, because, as we’ve seen in the past, things do drop off both in terms of attendance and coverage of the sport after big tournaments. We have a responsibility as the media to make sure that the game’s at the forefront of people’s minds for the next year.</p> <p>The way we’ve marketed women’s football in the past hasn’t always been correct. For a long time we’ve targeted young children, girls specifically. We mixed up the participation element with the attendance element. We just have to realise that there are so many different demographics to talk to and we should just market the hell out of it over the next year because the demand is there. That’s clear.</p> <p><em>Sophie Downey is a freelance football writer and regular contributor to the Guardian’s women’s football newsletter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/moving-the-goalposts\">Moving the Goalposts</a></em></p> <p>***</p> <p>Jen Offord: Don’t lose what makes the women’s game so special</p> <p>In theory, it would be possible for women’s football to be its own game completely, with its own clubs and its own structure not linked to the men’s game. In practice, I don’t think that’s going to happen: it’s going to be the “one club” approach that continues, with women’s teams as part of the same organisations. That will mean more money going into the women’s game, and women should have equal access to those resources. But the “one club” idea is disingenuous. The teams aren’t valued equally – there’s a clear hierarchy.</p> <p>Money is part of what can be so toxic in the men’s game – it breeds resentment among fans, players become so wealthy that they are almost seen as not a real person, that they can’t be touched by abuse. Whereas the women’s game is a much nicer vibe, more celebratory, less bitterness – none of this business of middle-aged men shouting abuse at boys young enough to be their sons. I would have no problem taking my daughter to a match when she’s old enough, whereas I might with the men’s game.</p> <p>I have this sense that the women’s game has a freedom and a passion that we don’t always see in the men – like they really want to be there. And that is joyful to watch. As the game grows, I really hope we never lose that.</p> <p><em>Jen Offord hosts the Standard Issue podcast and wrote <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-year-of-the-robin-9781785787577\">The Year Of The Robin</a>, an account of Charlton Athletic’s struggles during a pandemic season.

Here’s a selection of your responses:</em></p> <ul> <li><p>England v Spain in February in Norwich changed my view of football supporters. My opinion of ‘big football’ was formed in the 80s, when there was open gang warfare between fans, and violent players were lauded by journalists. But I will happily again take my seven-year-old daughter to a women’s professional match for a memorable, positive experience of a fun family atmosphere of women role model players and female supporters. <em><strong>Asher</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>I hope that this is a turning point … but I absolutely hope that it isn’t a point where the female grassroots ‘ownership’ of the game is taken away from us. That the women can continue to play, manage, referee and support the teams on their own terms – we don’t need men to suddenly get interested in the game now it’s successful after years of put downs and insults. It’s the women’s game and I sincerely hope that it doesn’t lose that. It is more than women playing football: it is women’s football. Please don’t take it away from us – and our daughters. <em><strong>Zoe</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>I had already become rather bored with the men’s game and after seeing the women play I’ll not be watching the men any more until they play with the same skill, enthusiasm, determination, flair, commitment and variety of style that the women have demonstrated. Their games have been a joy to watch for all the reasons that the men’s games usually aren’t. <em><strong>Chris</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Yes, it’s a turning point! Not only in the UK, but also abroad. I live in Switzerland, where professional women’s football is still in its infancy. For a long time already, England and the WSL have been admired as the place to be for female footballers (think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/21/arsenals-lia-walti-never-underestimate-german-team-womens-champions-league\">Lia Wälti at Arsenal</a>). With England’s powerful demonstration of skill, I think more and more countries will recognise that investing in and supporting women’s football lead to great success. <em><strong>Julia</strong></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p>After thousands of users — including the Kardashians — complained about <strong>Instagram’s new updates</strong>, the social media titan was forced to retreat.

Now The Sandman could bring international stardom. He talks about the bullies who tried to keep him down – and life as reluctant role model","byline":"Ammar Kalia","body":"<p>In 1995, 31-year-old Sanjeev Bhaskar was performing a two-week run of The Secret Asians, his comedy double act with the musician Nitin Sawhney, at Ovalhouse theatre in south London. After a surprise rave review from Bonnie Greer in Time Out magazine, a group of BBC executives, including the future producer of The Office, Anil Gupta, flipped a coin to see whether they should go to the show after work or head to the pub. Luckily for Bhaskar, the toss went in his favour. The show was such a hit that they offered him the chance to put those sketches on Radio 4 as part of a new comedy show exploring British Asian culture. It was called Goodness Gracious Me – and it would make Bhaskar a household name.</p> <p>By 1998, the show had transferred to primetime on BBC Two and was a firm part of the British Asian cultural zeitgeist. In music, the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/11/asian-underground-music-eastern-electro-drumnbass\" title=\"\">Asian underground movement</a> was giving voice to second-generation migrants through its mix of club culture and north Indian bhangra. In film, writers and directors such as Gurinder Chadha and Ayub Khan Din explored intergenerational differences in Bhaji on the Beach and East Is East. On TV, Bhaskar’s sketch series – created by an ensemble of British Asian actors including Bhaskar’s future wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/10/meera-syal-interview-roar-devils-hour-kumars\" title=\"\">Meera Syal</a> – lampooned British Asian stereotypes through a mixture of farce and knowing irony.</p> <p>With its skits on curry house culture, fake eastern mysticism and competitive mothers, it reached cult-classic status in British Asian households. Watching it at home as a child, I saw the constituent elements of my community reflected for the first time, with punchlines, played for laughs, that would be fully felt only by those who had lived those experiences. It was television that was for us, by us.</p> <p>“It was the right group of people at the right time,” Bhaskar says. “It feels like a landmark today, but five years earlier it wouldn’t have happened and five years later someone else might have done it. I’m thankful that we were there.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83ClbRPRDXU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/83ClbRPRDXU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>International breakthrough … watch the trailer for The Sandman.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When Goodness Gracious Me’s TV run ended after three seasons, in 2001, Bhaskar co-created the spoof chatshow The Kumars at No 42. He has since explored dramatic work, with starring roles in the gentle period series The Indian Doctor and, since 2015, the acclaimed cold-case drama Unforgotten. “It was partly a conscious decision to move into drama. I wanted to explore the drama side of acting, partly because you just want to see if you can do it,” he says. This week, he will feature in what could be his international breakthrough: the much-anticipated Netflix adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s graphic novel series The Sandman, alongside Tom Sturridge, Gwendoline Christie and Stephen Fry.</p> <p>Meeting Bhaskar, who has spent 25 years on British screens, often playing British Asian caricatures, feels akin to meeting a close relative. In fact, he might be one: his parents are from Punjab, India, like my relatives; we grew up in the same area of London, Hounslow; and his father, Inderjit, worked in the same Nestlé factory in Hayes as my grandmother. It was only when Bhaskar’s career was taking off that he discovered his father had other ambitions. “I only found out in my 40s that he had always wanted to be a director,” he says.</p> <p>We are sitting in the airy front room of the north London home he shares with Syal and their 16-year-old son, Shaan. It is the hottest day of the year. While going outside feels like stepping in front of a hairdryer, Bhaskar is relaxed and sweat-free, dressed in a black “Choose Love” T-shirt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"88f114b3c86a3835d6b9e29925e1aba1d249d43a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88f114b3c86a3835d6b9e29925e1aba1d249d43a/0_0_2394_1587/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kulvinder Ghir, Nina Wadia, Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar in Goodness Gracious Me\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The establishment clearly didn’t know what to do with us’ … Kulvinder Ghir, Nina Wadia, Meera Syal and Bhaskar in Goodness Gracious Me.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“My parents grew up in pre-partition India and when my dad was 14 he ran away to join a theatre company,” he says. “He rode the trains and slept on the streets for two months before he was turned away from the company for being too young. He only made it back home because one day he came across an anti-colonial march that Gandhi was leading and was teargassed with the crowd. He ended up in hospital and they managed to inform his parents.”</p> <p>The year after, in 1947, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/14/everything-changed-readers-stories-of-india-partition\" title=\"\">partition took place</a>. Inderjit found himself in what is now Pakistan. With religious tensions growing, he was forced to move south, to Delhi, where he had no family. “He had to stay in a refugee camp,” Bhaskar says. “He later moved to England, in 1956, but I always think that coming here was not as much of a wrench as that migration. These were ancestral lands that were changed. No one travelled much in those days, so to suddenly go hundreds of miles to Delhi, where he had no connection, must have been brutal.”</p> <p>Bhaskar’s mother, Janak, joined her husband in the UK in 1960. By the time Bhaskar was born, in 1963, they had settled above a launderette in Hounslow. In his spare time, Inderjit would take two buses to a film school in Brixton to take a course on directing. But when his sister’s husband died suddenly, Inderjit decided to quit his studies to support her four young children financially. “He knew what it was like to crush your own dreams, so that explained why he wasn’t more supportive of me when I started out,” Bhaskar says. “He didn’t want his son to go through that as well.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My dad said recently that he’s living out his dreams through me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bhaskar’s start in performance was slow. “I knew from the age of four that I wanted to act and write – I would point at the TV and say to my mum: ‘I can do better than that!’” he says, laughing. “But it took me 30 years to get going. When I did, my parents were shocked, since I was usually so quiet at home.”</p> <p>He describes a childhood of “isolation and bullying at school”, which ultimately led him to cultivate a sense of humour as a coping mechanism. “It was embedded in my ability to survive,” he says. “Humour and irony gives you instant perspective. It can make a terrifying, all-encompassing situation seem ridiculous and manageable. In those years, I would turn to my bedroom wall as an escape. Up there were posters of Elvis, Roger Moore as Bond, Monty Python’s Life of Brian – that was my fantasy land. That, coupled with this sense of irony, saved me in all the challenging times I had to go through, since there was always a bit of me that could see it as absurd.”</p> <p>Having written off school, Bhaskar reinvented himself in college, away from his bullies. There he met a kindred spirit in Sawhney, who would later be in the vanguard of the Asian underground scene; his fourth album, Beyond Skin, was nominated for the Mercury prize in 2000. “We started messing around making little musical comedy skits,” Bhaskar says. “They were things that would pass the time and provide an escape from everything we were going through – from racism to teenage growing pains.”</p> <p>Still, the sketches were only a private experiment for Bhaskar and Sawhney – until Bhaskar left his marketing job in his late 20s over a breach-of-contract dispute. “I had all this time on my hands, so I rang Nitin and said: ‘Let’s hang out and make some stuff together again,’” he says. “We agreed to be unpredictable – people had put us in pigeonholes since we were born, because we were Asian, so we wanted to go against their preconceptions by doing something totally different onstage.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da0d6dfb0d65324783f92ee970f1c980bca7a64d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da0d6dfb0d65324783f92ee970f1c980bca7a64d/0_0_3744_5616/667.jpg\" alt=\"Sanjeev Bhaskar with Nicola Walker in Unforgotten\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dramatic leap … with Nicola Walker in Unforgotten.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They began performing skits under the name The Secret Asians in London arts centres and were soon booked to perform their fateful run at Ovalhouse in 1995. The show was a collage of chaos. It included characters who would later feature in Goodness Gracious Me, such as the Bhangra Muffins and Guru Maharishi Yogi, as well as standup and a flamenco performance from Sawhney and Bhaskar singing a song in Italian. “It was so freeing – like a deep exhalation,” Bhaskar says.</p> <p>In 1998, Bhaskar, Syal and their co-stars, including Nina Wadia and Kulvinder Ghir, found themselves on television, airing to millions every week. (Sawhney had contributed to the radio series, but left to focus on music after the success of Beyond Skin.) “It was hugely cathartic for us, because we had been carrying these experiences around for years and now were in control of that narrative,” Bhaskar says. “We could make jokes about our community that weren’t sectarian and that were written with affection. That’s why we had a broad audience and why people still have a great fondness for the show.” Bhaskar says his Sandman co-star, the British Asian actor and comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/17/people-just-do-nothing-stars-hit-out-at-lack-of-diversity-in-media\" title=\"\">Asim Chaudhry</a>, told him that Goodness Gracious Me was a touchstone for his own work.</p> <p>On The Kumars at No 42, which was hosted by a fictional British Asian family, Bhaskar interviewed stars including Minnie Driver, Daniel Radcliffe and Tom Jones over the course of seven seasons. Apparently, it is one of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61067187\" title=\"\">the Queen’s favourite shows</a>. “Any conversations you have with the monarch are supposed to remain private,” Bhaskar says, with a smile. “But what I can tell you is I know that she has watched it and I’ve spoken to her about it. My parents are thrilled!”</p> <p>While The Kumars was in production, Bhaskar took a press trip to Australia with the cast of Goodness Gracious Me. It was during the 23-hour flight that he realised there was a romantic spark between him and Syal. “We were on such a high – we were being flown first class to promote the show, which had been a hit over there; Meera was releasing her film Anita &amp; Me; and we had just found out that we’d gotten to No 1 on the UK chart with our Comic Relief single with Gareth Gates,” Bhaskar says. “The thing with 23 hours in someone’s company is that you get the raw version of each other – especially me, since I can’t sleep on a plane. I had no filter and Meera was very nice about it. It was an intense period, but that intensity made us both realise that we wanted to hang out with each other more.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s slightly depressing that Goodness Gracious Me still feels like a landmark show</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pair are one of the best-known British Asian couples, but how do they manage as two writers and performers under one roof? “It helps that I openly accept she’s just much better than I am at everything,” Bhaskar says. “But it’s key to value the team and to always do what’s best for our partnership, rather than just our individual careers. We’ve tried to tag team when it comes to work, so there was always a parent at home, and I don’t regret turning things down for that.”</p> <p>With their visibility, does Bhaskar feel they are representative of British Asians in the public eye? “I’m aware there’s a responsibility. It’s not what I asked for, but it’s one that I have been given,” he says. “I don’t think I’m a particularly good role model, but I try to live a compassionate life.” He points to the “Choose Love” slogan on his T-shirt. “I’ve met awful people from all races, religions and genders and I’ve met wonderful people with all those identities, too. People are individuals and we have to treat each other with kindness first. Belonging to a particular club isn’t a shorthand for having the moral high ground.”</p> <p>Bhaskar has most readily used his public status to promote onscreen diversity. “We didn’t win many awards with Goodness Gracious Me, because the establishment clearly didn’t know what to do with us,” he says. “It’s slightly depressing that it still feels like a landmark show, since that means things still haven’t come on enough.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3c5130d078caedfd6ac0a82883134f732035533\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3c5130d078caedfd6ac0a82883134f732035533/0_0_2449_2447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanjeev Bhaskar collecting an MBE with Meera Syal, his wife, in 2006\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reluctant role model … collecting an MBE with Meera Syal in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He mentions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/may/20/we-are-lady-parts-review-give-it-up-for-tvs-fearless-muslim-riot-grrrls\" title=\"\">We Are Lady Parts</a>, Nida Manzoor’s 2021 comedy series about an all-female Muslim punk band, as an example of storytelling moving in the right direction. “I felt a kindred spirit with that show, as it was similar to what we were trying to do, but updating it for the new generation,” Bhaskar says. “Having art from a unique cultural perspective is really important. Equally, any programme set in modern Britain that isn’t diverse is making a conscious decision to be that way, as it doesn’t reflect the makeup of our nation and especially our cities. A story in London that has five white guys in it who are 30 or 35, for instance, is set in a weird fantasy world of the writer’s head.”</p> <p>If diversity is lacking on screen, what does he think of the possibility of a first British Asian prime minister in Rishi Sunak? “Growing up, the Conservatives were the natural political home for a lot of Asians who had their own businesses, but these Johnsonian years have been full of misinformation, buffoonery, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/14/tories-breaking-law\" title=\"\">the breaking of laws</a> and just an utter lack of compassion,” Bhaskar says. “If I look at it just in terms of visibility, the idea that there may be an Asian prime minister is an extraordinary thing. But, in context, it feels like they’re all just playing a game. We need someone who can actually fix this country’s problems, no matter what they look like, rather than bluster on a wave of jingoism and emotion. Where’s the humanity?”</p> <p>Ultimately, it is in his son and the next generation that Bhaskar finds hope. “Every generation basically screws it up for the next one, but out of adversity in history come people who change the world,” he says. “If we’re a shit generation, I hope our children rebel against our lack of thought and narrow-mindedness.”</p> <p>With his parents now 91 and still living in Hounslow, Bhaskar has increasingly been looking back to his childhood. “My parents didn’t understand my career at first – you had to see other people who looked like me to believe success was possible and there was no one else there,” he says. “But my dad said recently that he’s living out his dreams through me and that makes all our old arguments mean nothing. I feel so lucky that our paths have coalesced.” He pauses. “If 14-year-old me could see where I am now, he’d tell me to piss off. But I want to tell him that we will make it out of that launderette and even become friends with some of those people on our bedroom wall. For all the shit we went through, with luck and without, it leads us here.”</p> <p><em>The Sandman is on Netflix from </em><em>5 August</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/01/ivo-van-hove-ita-internationaal-theater-amsterdam-shocking-theatre","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T05:00:15Z","webTitle":"‘How many litres of blood do we need?’: Ivo van Hove’s ITA on 20 years of shocking theatregoers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/01/ivo-van-hove-ita-internationaal-theater-amsterdam-shocking-theatre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/01/ivo-van-hove-ita-internationaal-theater-amsterdam-shocking-theatre","fields":{"headline":"‘How many litres of blood do we need?’: Ivo van Hove’s ITA on 20 years of shocking theatregoers","trailText":"They’ve supercharged Shakespeare, staged impossible novels and stunned with scandalous cinema adaptations. Internationaal Theater Amsterdam reveal their radical secrets","byline":"Interviews by Chris Wiegand","body":"<p><strong>Ivo van Hove</strong><strong>, director:</strong> I’m from a small village in Belgium. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer and thought I’d never make a cent as a director. The arts in Belgium were totally old-fashioned: there was no room for new talents, only the old crocodiles. Elsewhere, performance art and punk were happening. The actor Dora van der Groen said go to the Netherlands because I would lose years not having a job in Belgium. I ran a theatre in the south of the Netherlands then took over Toneelgroep Amsterdam [which became <a href=\"https://ita.nl/en/\">Internationaal Theater Amsterdam</a> (ITA)] in 2001. When I come to a big institution, I like to honour the tradition but also innovate. I’d worked a lot with my own generation but decided this should be a coming together of all ages so we’d have actors in their 20s and 70s. That’s a real ensemble – different opinions and experiences.</p> <p><strong>Marieke Heebink</strong><strong>, actor:</strong> Amsterdam people are known for speaking up; Belgians are very polite. So there was a kind of culture clash. We had to get to know each other. An ensemble is like a working family – you see each other’s flaws.</p> <p><strong>An D’Huys</strong><strong>, costume designer: </strong>It’s been 20 years that I’ve worked with Ivo. He often has the same people around him – it reminds me of Fassbinder or Fellini. You know each other so well and there is a sensibility that goes very deep. It’s not just about taste but about his characters. I know very quickly what he thinks about them.</p> <p><strong>Robert Icke</strong><strong>, writer-director:</strong> There’s something beautiful about how the ensemble has grown together. They’re so diligent about not getting comfortable. You get depth, richness, bravery, confidence – and you don’t get staleness. That’s a dream orchestra to conduct.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbee434b5e0b7727061d7c2d7609c23683c9ff3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbee434b5e0b7727061d7c2d7609c23683c9ff3f/548_129_3991_2395/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fantasy … Halina Reijn in The Fountainhead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The productions are like rituals’ … Halina Reijn in The Fountainhead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Halina Reijn</strong><strong>, actor:</strong> When I was 13 I saw one of Ivo’s productions, Lulu, starring Chris Nietvelt. I wrote him a letter asking to join the company. He never wrote back! It was my dream to join them but I was scared, too, when I finally did. They were the biggest company in Amsterdam with the biggest theatre stars. The hierarchy changed when Ivo came – he was a young director and installed a different dynamic and gave young actors a lot of space. Before that it was super-intimidating.</p> <p><strong>Ivo van Hove:</strong> An ensemble is a lot of work. It’s not easy and it costs money. We pay the actors every month and are very loyal to them.</p> <p><strong>Hans Kesting</strong><strong>, actor: </strong>If you work with the same group of people there’s no distrust, no fear of making mistakes. We work much faster. Ivo made the ensemble a much more professional organisation and elevated it to an international travelling theatre company.</p> <p><strong>Marieke Heebink: </strong>The touring is very demanding.

Our goal is making the best theatre in the world – that’s why the bookkeeper is there, the marketing people, the actors.</p> <p><strong>Jan Versweyveld</strong><strong>, stage designer: </strong>I love that we have two beautiful homes where we work. One of our Amsterdam theatres, the Stadsschouwburg, was built at the end of the 19th century. Then we had the possibility to develop a second theatre which took 10 years. It’s not an easy space – it’s quite big, quite open. It takes some experience to really have the benefit of it.</p> <p><strong>An D’Huys: </strong>With an ensemble, you know the bodies of the actors. I watch how they move. The actor has to live in the costume which should be like a second skin. We use video projections on stage so you are aware of accessories and details. I’m responsible for the makeup but we like to see small wrinkles and sweat instead. With Ivo it’s about murder, blood, aggression … I ask: how many litres of blood do we need? We have three spare costumes for each actor but sometimes that’s not enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62cd0ae4a4b28773b71aa2a35000be9e3adbe911\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62cd0ae4a4b28773b71aa2a35000be9e3adbe911/0_180_3848_2308/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An event … Marieke Heebink and Chris Nietvelt in the Roman Tragedies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An event … Marieke Heebink and Chris Nietvelt in the Roman Tragedies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Halina Reijn:</strong> When you do one of the plays that lasts several hours you really go through it! But there’s nothing that compares – I miss it so much now that I’ve left the ensemble. The shows are about the essence of life – so if you’re dealing with death or love privately then you go on stage and give your own feelings. It’s way deeper than delivering a line. The productions are like rituals or exorcisms.</p> <p><strong>Ivo van Hove: </strong>Every director is different and works in a different way. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/13/simon-mcburney-interview-theatre-culture-crisis-complicite-germany\">Simon McBurney</a>, for example, uses improvisations.

At the start of a production we take the ensemble and lead them into the new project. The first time we speak about it, everybody’s invited and we give a visual presentation.</p> <p><strong>Marieke Heebink:</strong> When we start rehearsing, Jan shows us the set and says have a sniff around. The first really big production I was in was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/19/the-roman-tragedies-review-barbican-ivo-van-hove-barbican\">Roman Tragedies</a>. It wasn’t just a huge stage but an event – the audience sat next to us eating.</p> <p><strong>Halina Reijn:</strong> Ivo has done stage versions of so many films: Antonioni, Visconti, Cassavetes. He always said you don’t have to watch the movies. But it’s too tempting! And so intriguing to see what he does with them. Ivo was one of the first to use video in such a profound way on stage. The video designer Tal Yarden is an absolute genius. It’s a way to break through traditional theatre expectations. I used a camera on stage for <a href=\"https://tga.nl/en/productions/rouw-siert-electra\">Mourning Becomes Electra</a> – Ivo based his concept on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1188372,00.html\">Capturing the Friedmans</a>, the horrifying documentary about a family who took home videos of each other.</p> <p><strong>Jan Versweyveld:</strong> In the first conceptual phase of a production we decide whether to use video and the design starts from that. I use model boxes: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/11/the-fountainhead-review-ivo-van-hove-internationaal-theater-amsterdam-ayn-rand\">The Fountainhead</a> was practically developed in the model box by putting in one piece of paper after another. Ivo is not interested in models – he thinks they restrict his fantasy.</p> <p><strong>Ivo van Hove:</strong> I never think about the audience until the last days before we perform. Then I sit back and try to behave like them. If you do that from the beginning you cannot be creative because you censor yourself – this is too loud, too big. I never would have made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/06/age-of-rage-review-barbican-london\">Age of Rage</a> if I’d thought of the audience. It’s four hours of war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"39fc99e4492e136d4ef90b7a40d3af4960763e97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39fc99e4492e136d4ef90b7a40d3af4960763e97/0_0_4743_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gaite Jansen and Gijs Scholten Van Aschat in After the Rehearsal at the Barbican, London, in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"488\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Profound use of video … Gaite Jansen and Gijs Scholten Van Aschat in After the Rehearsal at the Barbican, London, in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Hans Kesting:</strong> These are draining productions that ask a lot of you. I played Mark Antony in Roman Tragedies and Richard III in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/21/kings-of-war-review-shakespeare-with-shock-and-awe\">Kings of War</a>. Huge roles. You are almost in awe of them when you go on stage. We trust in Ivo and where we will go with him. He still has lots of fire and fury but has grown calmer in his presentation. Good actors work well with him, lesser actors get better with him.</p> <p><strong>Robert Icke:</strong> The actors fight with each other like family. They’re not frightened of each other. You give them the scent and they go off like a pack of wolves into the scene. They’re always searching for ways to make it more visceral.</p> <p><strong>Halina Reijn:</strong> I find acting and everything that comes with it to be super-scary and embarrassing and annoying. But Ivo creates a very clear context within which you can be free. He doesn’t judge any character. He just holds up a mirror and makes the audience a witness of their own behaviour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de591cc82e773766366fffb0b274d87fa2fbd1f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de591cc82e773766366fffb0b274d87fa2fbd1f6/0_0_5203_3654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Draining … Kings of War at the Barbican in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draining … Kings of War at the Barbican in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Robert Icke:</strong> I did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/24/oedipus-robert-icke-sophocles-edinburgh-festival-theatre-as-church\">Oedipus</a> in 2018 with Hans and Marieke. I’d written an English script that was translated – they acted and talked to each other in Dutch and to me in English. It had the potential to be profoundly alienating but I loved it.</p> <p><strong>An D’Huys:</strong> Before my very first meeting with Ivo, for Othello, I prepared lots of drawings but it took no longer than five minutes. Ivo knows what he wants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/02/all-about-theatre-about-film-ivo-van-hove-jan-versweyveld-eye-filmmuseum\">All About Theatre About Film: Ivo van Hove’s big-screen obsessions in focus</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Hans Kesting: </strong>There is a long monologue, “Friends, Romans, countrymen”, in Julius Caesar.

I thought: how could you turn that book, with those graphic scenes, into a stage production? Ivo’s idea was to let me play all the bad guys in the story – I incorporate the evil. As I get older, when I play a dark character in his plays – and there are many of them – I have darker dreams. It does something to you.</p> <p><strong>Robert Icke:</strong> One day on Oedipus, Hans said to me in front of everyone: “This is an OK speech but I think probably it would be better if it was a great speech!” I was like: You’re quite right, I’ll give it another go.

At the <a href=\"https://ratskeller-leipzig.de/\" title=\"\">Ratskeller</a>, near the new town hall, you can get almost anything from traditional spiced meat to Saxon roulade (usually beef filled with bacon, onions, pickles and mustard), and it’s really good quality and reasonably priced. There is also a pleasant terrace. <a href=\"https://max-enk.de/\" title=\"\">Max Enk</a> is more high-end, and serves pretty much everything the region has to offer, including its version of <em>Leipziger Allerlei</em>, which is made with crayfish and morels (rather than the traditional mixture of vegetables served as a main or side dish). Food doesn’t get more typically Saxon than this.</p> <h2><strong>Inspiration</strong></h2> <p>I really like the <a href=\"https://www.spinnerei.de/\" title=\"\">Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei</a>, a former 19th-century cotton mill (once one of the largest cotton mills in continental Europe) that now has restaurants, shops, a cinema, several galleries, plus more than 100 studios for architects, jewellers, ceramicists and artists. It revitalised the city’s artistic scene when it opened in the early 1990s. German artist <a href=\"https://www.grafikstiftungneorauch.de/\" title=\"\">Neo Rauch</a> has a studio here, which is open for occasional exhibitions as well as guided tours. There’s a full programme of exhibitions, concerts, films and other events all year round, but it’s particularly worth a visit when all the galleries are open to visitors, which happens three times a year. Another must-see is Leipzig’s main landmark – the City-Hochhaus, which locals call <em>der steile Zahn (</em>“craggy tooth”) with 36 storeys and a tower designed by Hermann Henselmann in the shape of an open book. The 120-metre-high <a href=\"https://panorama-leipzig.de/en/panorama-tower\" title=\"\">viewing platform</a> puts the whole of Leipzig at your feet.</p> <h2><strong>Neighbourhood</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jul/02/hidden-germany-where-to-stay-and-what-to-do-off-the-beaten-track\">Hidden Germany: where to stay and what to do off the beaten track</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eisenbahnstraße, in the eastern district of Volkmarsdorf, has a particular vibe and is really culturally diverse. From being the “most dangerous street in Germany”, it has become a popular place for young people and is very lively to wander around.

There are even small underground parties on the street.</p> <h2><strong>Green space</strong></h2> <p>My absolute favourite place is the <a href=\"https://www.leipzig.de/freizeit-kultur-und-tourismus/parks-waelder-und-friedhoefe/parks-und-gruenanlagen/clara-zetkin-park/palmengarten\" title=\"\">Palmengarten</a>, a beautiful botanical garden with plenty of water where you’ll want to linger. It dates back to the 19th century, and although the original greenhouse with palm trees and other tropical flora is gone, there are pretty bridges, ponds and a cast-iron pavilion to admire, plus a theatre constructed from an old petrol station. For a long time I also underestimated how beautiful Leipzig is from the water. A boat trip along the canals reveals that Leipzig is not only “Little Paris” but also “Little Venice”.</p> <h2><strong>Nightlife</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"47f6afc842bf38e3ecb6b1e41ed2b0eebd477adc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47f6afc842bf38e3ecb6b1e41ed2b0eebd477adc/0_12_661_661/500.jpg\" alt=\"Leipzig Flower Power bar\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I like to go to the <a href=\"https://kakadu-leipzig.de/\" title=\"\">Kakadu</a>, a fun karaoke bar that somehow always ends up being the last stop – or the beginning – of a long night.

Instead, gardeners should improve their approach to their use of water and paving, and start to experiment with drought-loving species. After all, RHS’s dry garden is not a desert – it has 200-300 plants.</p> <p>“Plants are great at adapting to weather, but we have to adapt with that. So our approach to gardening has to perhaps change,” says Brett.</p> <p>The dry garden, which was planted 22 years ago, is a just a patch of the 1,000 acre site, but has proved an important test bed for gardening in a warmer and windier climate.</p> <p>Plants are watered in initially and then left to their own devices, so only the drought tolerant survive. Some, such as <em>achilleas</em> (yarrow), <em>Eryngium</em> (sea holly) and <em>Agapanthus,</em> are already familiar sights in British gardens, as are perennials such as lavender and rosemary, which thrive on neglect.</p> <p>“It is a learning process for us all,” he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e73a70193ab07262181a0a7e0195fb55c5a87058\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e73a70193ab07262181a0a7e0195fb55c5a87058/0_273_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A more traditional herbaceous border but still stocked with some climate change resilient Echinicea and Achillea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A more traditional herbaceous border but still stocked with some climate change resilient Echinicea and Achillea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition to reviewing our choice of plants, the biggest change we need to make is our attitude to water.</p> <p>Brett has been in the business for 35 years and says the biggest and most concerning changes are the wind and sudden deluges of rain, storms and flash flooding.</p> <p>The RHS has teamed up with Cranfield University to help the nation switch from mains water to rain water. Its <a href=\"https://mains2rains.uk/\">Mains2rains</a> campaign has 10 top tips for changing our behaviour.</p> <p>The greatest change we can make is not watering lawns during dry spells.</p> <p>“We have this image of the classic English garden with lush herbaceous borders, nice green lawns. Our expectation has to change,” says Brett.</p> <p>RHS research in its <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/science/gardening-in-a-changing-world/climate-change#:~:text=Fifteen%20years%20after%20Gardening%20in,Sheffield%20and%20University%20of%20Reading.\">Gardening in a Changing Climate report</a>, has shown that people are already changing their attitude to straw lawns, with a survey showing the majority of the public would rather have parched grass than a plastic alternative.</p> <p>Do not use a hose. “Use a watering can instead, that way you can target your watering and you can keep those herbaceous plants you want,” says Brett.</p> <p>Other recommendations include installing water butts and using drip trays beneath pots to stop loss of excess water.</p> <p>Brett points to new designs of self-watering pots or baskets, which have built in reservoir spaces with wicks allowing the water to be drawn into the roots through capillary action, says Brett.</p> <p>“Right plant, right place,” is a cornerstone of RHS horticulture teaching and is just as important to achieve sustainability.</p> <p>Sarah Wilson-Frost, who looks after some of the dry garden at Hyde Hall, warns against placing water-loving plants alongside your dry-garden ones. She has found that <em>Eupatorium maculatum</em>, or Joe Pye weed, a regular of prairie gardens, actually needs quite a lot of water and meant some of the dry garden ended up needing hydration in the extreme recent heat. So it will probably be moved.</p> <p>Water your plants at dusk or close to it, when temperatures are low. Watering during heat is counter-productive as the moisture goes straight up the plant and exits the leaves through the transpiration process. “It means water won’t penetrate deep into the soil, roots might start adapting and then start to become shallow”, making them less resilient in storms, says Brett.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6e164667e2b01d81b59edb6450d4ad0ab6ca18c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6e164667e2b01d81b59edb6450d4ad0ab6ca18c/0_273_8192_4918/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RHS’s Robert Brett surrounded by the sculptural tufts of grasses and shrubs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brett surrounded by the sculptural tufts of grasses and shrubs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mulch or a cover of loose stones, bark or other material on top of bare soil helps retain moisture and will be essential in the future.</p> <p>Run-off from paving, whether a domestic driveway or large expanses of land in housing and industrial developments, has long been identified as a contributor to floods.</p> <p>This too is something we can change.

Anything less would demonstrate once and for all that this government is truly soft on dirty money.”</p> <p>John Cullinane, the director of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the leading body representing tax accountants, said oligarchs and other members of the corrupt elite would be easily able to exploit “gaping holes” in the new rules.</p> <p>He said individuals could legally sidestep the rules by holding property or land in the name of a nominee company, or by simply sharing the ownership with more than four relatives or friends.</p> <p>“We highlighted a particular loophole in the new law, namely that the legislation requires the identification only of the beneficial owners of the company in question, and not those of the land or property itself. This matters because the company could be holding that land as a nominee for an individual who does not own the company,” Cullinane said.</p> <p>“The company might be owned by a Cayman or Panamanian law firm, for example, which holds legal ownership of many properties on behalf of wealthy clients. In this scenario the names on the register would likely be the partners in the law firm, or perhaps no one at all. The name of the oligarch would be nowhere to be found.”</p> <p>Cullinane said that even if an oligarch did own shares in an offshore company that owns a UK property, “if they hold 25% or less of that company’s shares, nothing needs to be disclosed.” He said: “A family of six could each own a 16.67% share of the company, thus bringing them outside the registration requirements.”</p> <p>He pointed out that Alisher Usmanov, who has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/uk-imposes-sanctions-on-russian-billionaire-and-former-deputy-pm\">subjected to UK sanctions</a> and described by the government as “one of Vladmir Putin’s favourite oligarchs”, has said he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/alisher-usmanov-ex-arsenal-shareholder-russian-bilionaire-assets-sanctions\">transferred properties into irrevocable trusts in the names of members of his family</a>, potentially putting them beyond sanctions.</p> <p>Cullinane also said a fine of up to £2,500 a day for failing to comply with the rules was unlikely to pose much of a deterrent to the super-rich targets of the legislation.</p> <p>The Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell, who has long called on the government to do more to tackle international corruption, said: “It is probably true that bad people will find loopholes to prevent total transparency. If so, it will be up to the government to plug those loopholes with speed and effectiveness.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steve Goodrich, the head of research and investigations at Transparency International UK, said the law “isn’t perfect” but “it’s a good start”.</p> <p>He said: “If enforced properly, this register will reveal who controls offshore companies holding property in the UK. For decades, criminals and kleptocrats have used opaque corporate structures to launder dirty cash into high-end real estate. Now they’ll have to do so without as much cover.</p> <p>“Criminals are always trying to stay one step ahead of the law, and we’ve highlighted to government potential loopholes they might want to exploit.

It offers a stricter segregation than the Taliban has required of government universities, Amir points out, yet it is now at risk of being unable to enrol new students.</p> <p>“Even now we have time, if they restart classes, in the remaining months of the year we can graduate students, with more effort and support including intensive classes,” he said. “But if it continues, then next year you won’t have students in the university, apart from those who graduated in previous years, which will be small numbers.”</p> <p>Online classes and illegal underground schools have allowed some girls to keep studying, including in parts of the Taliban’s deeply conservative southern heartland, but these efforts only reach a tiny minority.</p> <p>Because secret schools are private initiatives, most have to charge fees to at least cover their costs, and the economic catastrophe that engulfed Afghanistan means few families can afford them.</p> <p>Streaming or downloading classes requires at least a smartphone and a generous data package, again out of reach for many of the girls who were the first in their family to reach high school.</p> <p>Afghanistan’s new leaders have repeatedly claimed that they support women’s education, as long as it complies with their definition of Islamic regulations.</p> <p>This includes near total separation of the sexes, although male professors still teach some women’s classes due to a shortage of specialists.</p> <p>Taqi pointed to the ministry’s efforts to shift schedules and reallocate buildings, so that women can attend single-sex classes, as a concrete demonstration of that support.</p> <p>Some universities, including the leading Kabul University, now teach men and women on alternate days. Others have morning and afternoon shifts.</p> <p>“Our ministry is committed, we have plans, policies, procedures and as you see education in university is going on for both girls and boys,” he said.</p> <p>But without a pathway to enrol new students, or should the Taliban bring in plans to limit what women can study, those changes will be little more than a temporary accommodation for the last classes of female students in many subjects.</p> <p>“They want to restructure the universities, to streamline girls’ education to specific faculties,” said the source with Taliban links. “They [ask]: ‘Why should girls study engineering?’</p> <p>“They will be restricted to specific faculties, medicine, education, sharia. I don’t even believe they are going to be that progressive to allow them to be doctors.”</p> <p><em>Lutfullah Qasimyar</em><em> contributed reporting</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/01/muse-release-nft-edition-album-will-of-the-people-charts","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"Sales from the crypto: Muse NFT album to become first new chart-eligible format in seven years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/01/muse-release-nft-edition-album-will-of-the-people-charts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/01/muse-release-nft-edition-album-will-of-the-people-charts","fields":{"headline":"Sales from the crypto: Muse NFT album to become first new chart-eligible format in seven years","trailText":"Industry figures hail ‘the future of music’ as rock band announce first album of its kind to qualify for official UK charts","byline":"Eamonn Forde","body":"<p>When British rock band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/muse\">Muse</a> release their ninth studio album, Will of the People, on 26 August, the NFT (non-fungible token) edition will become the first release of its kind to qualify for the charts in the UK and Australia. It is the first new format to be added to the charts since album streams in 2015.</p> <p>It will be sold via the “eco-friendly” NFT platform Serenade, which sold official Brit awards NFTs for £10 each in February.</p> <p>Serenade’s founder, Max Shand, describes the Muse release as “the black T-shirt of NFTs”, a utilitarian digital format that is straightforward to buy. “What a fan wants is something simple and understandable but that gives them a sense of proximity to an artist and a sense of recognition from other fans,” he says.</p> <p>Unlike with many NFTs, buyers will not require a crypto wallet. After the purchase is made on Serenade’s website, a digital wallet is created and the NFT transferred to that wallet. If users have an existing crypto wallet, such as for BitCoin or Ethereum, they can use that.</p> <p>The UK’s Official Charts Company (OCC) made NFT albums eligible for the charts several months ago but this is the first release where the vendor, in this case Serenade, is approved as a chart-return digital retailer.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgyQufB1Yic\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GgyQufB1Yic?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>“There has been loads of noise about NFTs being the future of music, the future of entertainment, the future of ownership,” says Martin Talbot, chief executive of the OCC. “It’s great this is becoming a reality.”</p> <p>He says the Muse release did not force an update of the OCC’s chart-eligibility rules, it will be the first that meets the entry criteria.</p> <p>In April, UK indie rock band the Amazons released a digital box set NFT, limited to 100 copies, that came with pre-orders of their How Will I Know if Heaven Will Find Me? album, due in September. That was sold as part of a bundle rather than as a standalone release.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/07/cash-gifts-and-strong-arm-tactics-musics-problem-with-nfts\">Cash ‘gifts’ and strong-arm tactics: music’s problem with NFTs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Serenade had been in discussions with Warner Records, home to Muse, about releasing an NFT album for several months. Muse, who had worked with the blockchain platform CryptoKitties in 2020 to create digital collectables, were deemed the obvious first choice.</p> <p>“The band have always been at the forefront of technological innovation in their creativity and artistry,” says Sebastian Simone, vice president of audience and strategy at Warner Records in the UK.</p> <p>The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.</p> <p>“We wanted to keep it more about the product than about the ancillary experience,” says Simone.</p> <p>With the number of copies limited – and not all of them to be purchased in the UK – the release will not significantly skew the anticipated chart performance of Will of the People.</p> <p>“If you want to make an impact on the chart, there are definitely ways to do that,” states Simone about the potential for NFTs to dramatically inflate first-week sales. “With Muse it’s actually not essential as they are [already] on tens of thousands of pre-orders. We anticipate the No 1 spot to be very clear that week.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As with other NFTs, the original buyer can resell it, and 15% of the resale price will revert back to the band and the rights owners – Warner Music for the sound recording rights and Universal Music Publishing for the composition rights.</p> <p>The OCC confirmed that resales of the album will not count as a “new” sale.</p> <p>“There are absolutely no plans to change the fundamental principles [of the charts] where we count the sale of something when it is brand new and you first buy it,” says Talbot. “We don’t count the sales to the second buyer.”</p> <p>Future releases could include extras and fan rewards that are added to the album as the campaign around it evolves. The OCC will ensure the extras on release are not so bloated as to fall foul of the chart rules. “What you’re always looking for is something of such high value or such desirability that it overshadows the music itself and people aren’t buying it for the music, they’re buying it for the [added extras],” says Talbot.</p> <p>On the matter of whether this could all collapse into gimmickry, Simone says Warner is already planning similar releases for other acts. “It will become more widely adopted,” he says. “This is going to be the beginning of the door opening.”<br><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/01/country-diary-dragonflies-and-trout-thrive-in-the-quiet-of-the-river","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T04:30:13Z","webTitle":"Country diary: Dragonflies and trout thrive in the quiet of the river","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/01/country-diary-dragonflies-and-trout-thrive-in-the-quiet-of-the-river","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/01/country-diary-dragonflies-and-trout-thrive-in-the-quiet-of-the-river","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: Dragonflies and trout thrive in the quiet of the river","trailText":"<strong>Aberaeron, Ceredigion:</strong> I come to an old stone wall over the Afon Aeron; there’s enough life here to make me pause for too long","byline":"John Gilbey","body":"<p>The worst of the heat has slipped away into the east, and a wind from the sea is starting to cool the stone of the harbour walls.

New, bright thistle flowers erupt from the old stone wall that guards the stream, the stems describing narrow arcs in the breeze.

Further on, grey wagtails make short, erratic flights over the water, taking flies on the wing before landing on water-rounded stones to rest and demonstrate robustly how they got their name. My walk has a welcome interruption when I meet an old friend on the path and get introduced to their young – and very enthusiastic – spaniel, which looks down at the cool water with obvious longing.</p> <p>Above a quiet bridge the river pools idly between overgrown margins. Inconspicuous over the pebbled bed, small brown trout – hardly more than fingerlings – ease their way against the gentle current. On the smooth surface of the water, growing rings appear like the marks of raindrops, but these plot the floundering impact of newly hatched flies. The trout approach and strike, taking the insects with a barely audible plop, while large dragonflies halt and dash in an ancient pattern above the water.</p> <p>I have paused too long, and dark heavy clouds are starting to build in the humid late afternoon.

On Monday, Taiwan’s premier Su Tseng-chang did not directly respond when asked, but told reporters in Taipei: “We always warmly welcome visits to our country by distinguished foreign guests.”</p> <p>Pelosi was supposed to visit Taiwan in April but the trip was postponed after she contracted Covid-19. Recent reports suggesting Pelosi intended to visit in August have angered Beijing and prompted threats of military countermeasures. Some analysts have said it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/27/a-dangerous-moment-china-warns-of-consequences-if-nancy-pelosi-visits-taiwan\">one of the most dangerous moments</a> in cross-strait relations in decades.</p> <p>China considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province destined for reunification, and strongly objects to all acts that appear to support Taiwan as an independent sovereign state. In a phone call lasting more than two hours, China’s president, Xi Jinping, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/xi-jinping-tells-joe-biden-not-to-play-with-fire-over-taiwan-in-two-hour-call\">warned Joe Biden</a> over what he considers China’s “territorial integrity”. “Those who play with fire will perish by it,” Xi said.</p> <p>On Sunday, Chinese air force spokesman Shen Jinke was quoted by state media as saying that Beijing would “resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity”.</p> <p>Shen said at a military airshow that the air force has many types of fighter jets capable of circling “the precious island of our motherland”, referring to Taiwan.</p> <p>The US does not have official ties with Taiwan but maintains friendly relations and is legally obliged to provide weapons for self-defence.</p> <p>Taiwan’s government will not comment on a Pelosi visit as it balances its wish to maintain the safety of the status quo while also growing its relations with the US.</p> <p>Taiwan’s population has lived under the threat of China for decades, and while recent events such as the Ukraine war have heightened concerns and prompted increased military and civilian preparations, there has been little sign of major worries specifically surrounding Pelosi’s visit.</p> <p>Among Taiwanese analysts and officials there is some belief that Pelosi must visit now to avoid appearing cowed by Beijing’s strong language.</p> <p>Amanda Hsiao, a senior China analyst with the Crisis Group, a thinktank, said on Friday that China was unlikely to directly target US military assets or risk a military confrontation. However, she noted that China had greatly increased military activity in recent years, including frequently sending squadrons of warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ).</p> <p>“Beijing will have to select a response that visibly rises above the already high baseline of activity,” Hsiao said.</p> <p>On Saturday China conducted previously unannounced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/china-taiwan-military-exercises-nancy-pelosi-visit\">live-fire exercises</a> in the Taiwan Strait, at the narrowest point between China and Taiwan’s main island.</p> <p>Numerous US political delegations have made unofficial visits to Taiwan in recent years, showing support for the democratic island amid increasing pressure from China. Pelosi would be the highest-ranked US official to go there since 1997 when the then speaker, Newt Gingrich, visited.</p> <p>Biden, who does not control the actions of the speaker as Congress is a co-equal branch of government, told media that the military did not think it was a good idea.</p> <p>Drew Thompson, a former US defence department official, said the lack of a Taiwan mention in the press release did not necessarily mean the delegation would not stop by in an unofficial capacity. On Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanganzhu/status/1553623251661688832?s=21&amp;t=hcEZjH4FTLuCXGdAZK3XEQ\">Thompson said</a> he believed China would be satisfied with the exclusion of Taiwan on the formal itinerary, even if the delegation visited.</p> <p>“This is an accommodation to Beijing’s concern but far from a capitulation. China’s interest in keeping Taiwan off the formal agenda and listed with sovereign states is respected,” he said.</p> <p>Thompson speculated that the most likely outcome would be increased sorties into the ADIZ or reconnaissance flights around the island, but the firing of missiles or crossings of the median line between China and Taiwan were now unlikely.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Reuters</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2022/aug/01/covid-deaths-in-australia-data-reveals-demographics-hit-hardest-since-pandemic-began-interactive","type":"interactive","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T02:05:25Z","webTitle":"Covid deaths in Australia: data reveals demographics hit hardest since pandemic began – interactive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2022/aug/01/covid-deaths-in-australia-data-reveals-demographics-hit-hardest-since-pandemic-began-interactive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2022/aug/01/covid-deaths-in-australia-data-reveals-demographics-hit-hardest-since-pandemic-began-interactive","fields":{"headline":"Covid deaths in Australia: data reveals demographics hit hardest since pandemic began – interactive","trailText":"Breaking down the data: which demographic groups have suffered the most and the least","byline":"Josh Nicholas and Andy Ball","body":"<figure class=\"element element-atom element--immersive\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/07/australian-covid-deaths/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/01/new-zealand-borders-fully-reopened-as-last-covid-restrictions-lifted","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T01:53:22Z","webTitle":"New Zealand borders fully reopened as last Covid restrictions lifted","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/new-zealand-borders-fully-reopened-as-last-covid-restrictions-lifted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/01/new-zealand-borders-fully-reopened-as-last-covid-restrictions-lifted","fields":{"headline":"New Zealand borders fully reopened as last Covid restrictions lifted","trailText":"Cruise ships, international students and visitors from China and India among those who will be able to once again travel to New Zealand","byline":"Eva Corlett in Wellington","body":"<p>New Zealand’s borders are fully open for the first time since they abruptly snapped shut to keep Covid-19 out in March 2020.</p> <p>The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the nation was “open for business” after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/new-zealand-to-fully-reopen-borders-for-first-time-since-covid-pandemic-started\">final stage of the phased reopening</a>, which began in April, was completed on Sunday night.</p> <p>Visitors from all over the world will once again be allowed into New Zealand, including maritime arrivals, those on student visas and those from non-visa waiver countries, such as China and India.</p> <p> Ardern said the reopening was “an enormous moment” in a <a href=\"https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2022/08/livestream-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-speaks-at-china-business-summit.html\">speech to the China Business Summit</a> on Monday morning.<br><br>“It’s been a staged and cautious process on our part since February, as we, alongside the rest of the world, continue to manage a very live global pandemic, while keeping our people safe,” she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/lots-of-happy-tears-joy-as-new-zealand-opens-border-after-two-years-of-isolation\">‘Lots of happy tears’: joy as New Zealand opens border after two years of isolation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“New Zealanders are hosts.

Yong and MacIntyre will explain why there’s never been a better time to be a virus, connecting the threat of climate change, our duty as citizens and – perhaps most surprisingly – hope.</p> <p>“We’re going to keep having floods, we’re going to keep having bushfires, we’ve got these pandemics coming, and new threats all the time,” Rolley says. “What I wanted the biggest message of the festival to be is that politics isn’t going to fix everything. Everything might be political or have a political idea attached to it, but a lot of this is going to have to be about how we treat each other and how we care for each other.”</p> <p>Care is a big theme of this year’s Antidote. Astrid Edwards and Danielle Celermajer, along with host Bri Lee, will come together for <a href=\"https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/events/whats-on/Antidote/2022/fatal-adaptation.html?utm_source=the-guardian&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=antidote_editorial_sp&amp;utm_content=in-article_fatal-adaptation_book-now_221245\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fatal Adaptation</a>, a conversation that asks us not to get so accustomed to disaster and devastation that we stop taking care of each other. This event, along with others in the lineup, will shine a light on the importance of hope and community in times of tragedy, whether they be caused by bushfire, floods or war.</p> <p>Of course, there will always be space for politics at Antidote, and former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and Greens leader Adam Bandt are both due to appear in festival events.

One example is Succession’s Brian Cox, who will appear in person at the Opera House for <a href=\"https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/events/whats-on/Antidote/2022/successions-brian-cox.html?utm_source=the-guardian&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=antidote_editorial_sp&amp;utm_content=in-article_antidote-brian-cox_book-now_221379\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Evil in Us All</a>. “The arts can give us unique insight into the way power and politics work,” Rolley says. “And nowhere do we see this more than in Brian Cox’s portrayal of the malign cruelty of power as exercised by Logan Roy. His work as an actor is a big part of why Succession is an obsession for so many of us.”</p> <p>Comedian <a href=\"https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/events/whats-on/Antidote/2022/jenny-slate.html?utm_source=the-guardian&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=antidote_editorial_sp&amp;utm_content=in-article_antidote-use-it-all_book-now_221238\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jenny Slate</a> (writer and voice in Marcel the Shell with Shoes On<em>, </em>actor in Everything Everywhere All at Once, and the author of Little Weirds),<em> </em>is another artist to add to the must-see list, Rolley says. “With Jenny Slate, the ‘antidote’ we are offering is sweet comic relief,” he says. “Her off-centre take on life gives us a chance to look at the awkwardness and weirdness all around us and find the hilarity and charm in it.”</p> <p>Author Mohsin Hamid will also appear at Antidote, in conversation with journalist Osman Faruqi, discussing privilege, prejudice and white anxiety in <a href=\"https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/events/whats-on/Antidote/2022/the-last-white-man.html?utm_source=the-guardian&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=antidote_editorial_sp&amp;utm_content=in-article_antidote-use-it-all_book-now_221244\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Last White Man</a>. Sharing a title with Hamid’s latest novel, the event will be a critical and important discussion on race.</p> <p>“The book is speculative fiction, a genre ideally suited to amplify contemporary concerns,” Rolley says. “In it, a white man wakes up one morning with darkened skin. The storyline immediately raises questions about white supremacist anxiety and replacement and the end of privilege. I am really looking forward to Osman Faruqi unpicking this parable with Mohsin Hamid and confronting some of the challenges we face here in Australia.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8b5e6bb78ca7e857d40d019a563c14316818b171\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b5e6bb78ca7e857d40d019a563c14316818b171/0_0_1920_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"people milling in foyer of sydney opera house, underneath the soaring concrete arches of the sails \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Festivalgoers can also learn some new skills: interactive workshops at Antidote will explore the likes of <a href=\"https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/events/whats-on/Antidote/2022/use-it-all.html?utm_source=the-guardian&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=antidote_editorial_sp&amp;utm_content=in-article_antidote-use-it-all_book-now_221257\" rel=\"nofollow\">kitchen waste</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/events/whats-on/Antidote/2022/soap-making-workshop.html?utm_source=the-guardian&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=antidote_editorial_sp&amp;utm_content=in-article_antidote-soap-making_book-now_221260\" rel=\"nofollow\">soap making</a>, and, Rolley’s personal favourite, the traditional Japanese art of <a href=\"https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/events/whats-on/Antidote/2022/kintsugi-workshop.html?utm_source=the-guardian&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=antidote_editorial_sp&amp;utm_content=in-article_antidote-kintsugi_book-now_221259\" rel=\"nofollow\">kintsugi</a>. “The whole idea of taking something that’s broken and repairing it – and having that be a legitimate and different work of art – is such a great metaphor for what we want to do with the world,” Rolley says. “We’re trying to repair the world, but we’re also trying to come up with ways to make our lives better and to make our society better.”</p> <p><em><strong>The 2022 Antidote Festival takes place at the Sydney Opera House on Sunday September 11, <a href=\"https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/antidote?utm_source=the-guardian&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=antidote_content_sp&amp;utm_content=in-article_antidote-explore-line-up_book-now_1381\" rel=\"nofollow\">view the full program and ticket options</a>.</strong></em></p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/01/fricking-amazing-rugby-sevens-gold-caps-australias-commonwealth-games-redemption","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T01:35:48Z","webTitle":"‘Freaking amazing’: Rugby sevens gold caps Australia’s Commonwealth Games redemption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/fricking-amazing-rugby-sevens-gold-caps-australias-commonwealth-games-redemption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/01/fricking-amazing-rugby-sevens-gold-caps-australias-commonwealth-games-redemption","fields":{"headline":"‘Freaking amazing’: Rugby sevens gold caps Australia’s Commonwealth Games redemption","trailText":"Four years ago the women’s team suffered Commonwealth Games heartbreak on the Gold Coast; in Birmingham they atoned spectacularly","byline":"Australian Associated Press","body":"<p>Bottles were popped on the Gold Coast as Australia’s newest rugby sevens stars tended to unfinished business in the Commonwealth Games on the other side of the world.</p> <p>A 22-12 defeat of Fiji in the gold medal game in Coventry, just outside of host city Birmingham, on Sunday night erased the pain of an extra-time loss to New Zealand four years earlier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/south-africa-stun-fiji-to-win-mens-rugby-sevens-commonwealth-gold\">South Africa stun Fiji to win men’s rugby sevens Commonwealth gold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It came after their rousing defeat of the Kiwis in the semi-final the night before and a pool game loss to Fiji that could have upended their campaign altogether.</p> <p>Mainstays Sharni Williams, Demi Hayes and Charlotte Caslick were again among the best of a side that burst onto the scene with gold at the sport’s Olympic debut in 2016.</p> <p>But in Levi sisters Maddison and Teagan, as well as grand final try-scorers Faith Nathan and Madison Ashby, a new wave showed this year’s world champions were surging towards Paris 2024.</p> <p>The men’s team settled for fourth place, losing 26-12 to New Zealand in the bronze-medal game.

Ardern called for Beijing to respect and support the institutions that she said undergirded regional and international peace and stability.</p> <p>Both New Zealand and China had been “major beneficiaries of relative peace, stability and prosperity … The rules, norms and institutions, such as the United Nations, that underlie that stability and prosperity remain indispensable,” Ardern said, but are also “under threat”.</p> <p>“We see how much we have to lose should the international rules-based system falter,” she said.</p> <p>The speech was closely wedded to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/04/we-dont-need-to-be-reactive-new-zealand-keeps-faith-in-its-foreign-policy-amid-china-pacific-push\">party line of Ardern’s second-term government’s foreign policy</a>. The policy has emphasised “respect, consistency, and predictability” in dealings with China: essentially, that the government will continue to cooperate and work closely with China on mutually beneficial matters, particularly trade, while calling out differences – typically on foreign policy and human rights.</p> <p>That balancing act has, at times, been a difficult one to manage. New Zealand remains highly dependent on China for trade – the country is its largest trading partner, accounting for 23% of total trade and 32% of goods exports.</p> <p>But as China’s economic importance to New Zealand has grown, ideological differences with Beijing have become increasingly stark, with reports of severe human rights abuses in Xinjiang, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/japan-china-logic-of-brute-force-indo-pacific\">Beijing’s push into the Pacific</a> and South China Sea, and erosion of democracy in Hong Kong.</p> <p>“In response to increasing tensions or risks in the region – be they in the Pacific, the South China Sea, or the Taiwan Strait – New Zealand’s position remains consistent – we call for adherence to international rules and norms; for diplomacy, de-escalation and dialogue rather than threats, force and coercion,” Ardern said.</p> <p>“Our differences need not define us. But we cannot ignore them. This will mean continuing to speak out on some issues – sometimes with others and sometimes alone,” she said.</p> <p>“We have done this recently on issues in the Pacific. We also have consistently expressed our concerns about economic coercion, human rights, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong.”</p> <p>One of the prime minister’s primary examples of faltering institutions and norms was Putin’s war on Ukraine, and she called on China to “to be clear that it does not support the Russian invasion” and “to use its access and influence to help bring an end to the conflict”.</p> <p>Over the past year, the Pacific has become an arena for broader geopolitical competition: with increasing interest from China, the US has also been looking to beef up its connections and alliances in the region.</p> <p>Following Ardern’s speech on Monday, the commander of the US military in the Pacific said he wanted to expand and strengthen its ties with New Zealand.</p> <p>Adm John Aquilino, head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, was in Wellington to meet top New Zealand defence force and government officials.</p> <p>“Our partnership runs very deep,” Aquilino said. “We are doing many things together to continue to ensure peace and prosperity for both of our nations and for all the nations in the region.”</p> <p>He said the leadership of Australia and New Zealand in the Pacific was “critically important”.</p> <p>In June, the US signed Partners in the Blue Pacific, a cooperation agreement between Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the UK, and US.</p> <p>“The United States has been a Pacific nation our entire life.

December.</p> <p>Despite Ayres’ insistence that the decision to appoint Barilaro was done at arm’s length from ministers, the Guardian has revealed Ayres asked Brown to <a

had only had “discussion and engagement” with her.</p> <p>“Throughout the course of this exercise and standard activities that happen in the interactions between, particularly, secretaries or heads of agencies and ministers, we’re always going to get discussion and engagement,” he said.</p> <p>“The key point here is there’s been no direction by me to Amy Brown about who should be employed.</p>

northern California’s Klamath national forest, near the Oregon border, with expected thunderstorms a big concern, said US Forest Service spokesperson Adrienne Freeman.</p> <p>“The fuel beds are so dry and they can just erupt from that lightning,” Freeman said. “These thunder cells come with gusty erratic winds that can blow fire in every direction.”</p> <p>The blaze exploded in size to reach more than 80 sq miles (207 sq km) by Sunday evening, just two days after erupting in a largely unpopulated area of Siskiyou county. At least 2,000 people were ordered to evacuate. The cause of the fire was under investigation.</p> <p>The blaze torched trees along California Highway 96, and the scorched remains of a pickup truck sat in a lane of the highway.

Crews were working along edges of the fire Sunday, and aircraft were expected to continue to make water and retardant drops to help slow the fire’s advance, said Sara Rouse, a spokesperson with the interagency team assigned to the fire. High temperatures and erratic winds were expected, she said.</p> <p>Roughly 200 miles to the south, Idaho residents remained under evacuation orders as the Moose fire in the Salmon-Challis national forest charred more than 75 sq miles in timbered land near the town of Salmon. It was 21% contained by Sunday morning. Officials said they expected fire growth in steep, rugged country on the fire’s south side.</p> <p>In Hawaii, fire crews and helicopters have been fighting flames Saturday evening on Maui near Paia Bay. The Maui county emergency management agency said a brush fire was 90% contained but a red flag warning was in effect for much of Sunday. </p> <p>In north Texas, firefighters continued efforts to contain the two-week-old, 10.5 sq mile Chalk Mountain fire. The crews report 83% containment of the fire that has destroyed 16 houses and damaged five others about 50 miles south-west of Fort Worth.</p> <p>Back in California, a significant buildup of vegetation was fueling the McKinney fire, said Tom Stokesberry, a spokesperson with the US Forest Service for the region.</p> <p>“It’s a very dangerous fire, the geography there is steep and rugged, and this particular area hasn’t burned in a while,” he said.</p> <p>“It’s continuing to grow with erratic winds and thunderstorms in the area and we’re in triple digit temperatures,“ said Caroline Quintanilla, a spokesperson at Klamath national forest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66fb2d383debb31d70360a3c6741692d3d87154e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66fb2d383debb31d70360a3c6741692d3d87154e/0_378_5795_3477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A horse in a pasture as the McKinney Fire burns in the background.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A horse in a pasture as the McKinney Fire burns in the background.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The California governor, Gavin Newsom, declared a state of emergency Saturday as the fire intensified. The proclamation allows him more flexibility to make emergency response and recovery effort decisions and access federal aid. It also allows “firefighting resources from other states to assist California crews in battling the fires”, according to a statement from the governor’s office.</p> <p>Resources from all over California were being brought in to help fight the region’s fires, said Stokesberry, the US Forest Service spokesperson.</p> <p>McKinney’s explosive growth forced crews to shift from trying to control the perimeter of the blaze to trying to protect houses and critical infrastructure like water tanks and power lines, and assist in evacuations in California’s northernmost county of Siskiyou.</p> <p>Deputies and law enforcement were knocking on doors in the county seat of Yreka and the town of Fort Jones to urge residents to get out and safely evacuate their livestock on to trailers. Automated calls were being sent to land phone lines as well because there were areas without cell phone service.</p> <p>The Pacific Crest Trail Association urged hikers to get to the nearest town, while the US Forest Service closed a 110-mile section of the trail from the Etna Summit to the Mt Ashland campground in southern Oregon.</p> <p>Oregon state representative Dacia Grayber, who is a firefighter, was camping with her husband, who is also in the fire service, near the California state line when gale-force winds awoke them just after midnight.</p> <p>The sky was glowing with strikes of lightening in the clouds, while ash was blowing at them, though they were in Oregon, about 10 miles (about 16 km) away. Intense heat from the fire had sent up a massive pyrocumulonimbus cloud, which can produce its own weather system including winds and thunderstorms, Grayber said.</p> <p>“These were some of the worst winds I’ve ever been in and we’re used to big fires,” she said. “I thought it was going to rip the roof top tent off of our truck. We got the heck out of there.”</p> <p>On their way out, they came across hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail fleeing to safety.</p> <p>“The terrifying part for us was the wind velocity,” she said. “It went from a fairly cool breezy night to hot, dry hurricane-force winds.”</p> <p>The fires come as scorching temperatures bake the Pacific north-west, the west remains parched in record drought, and severe storms sent flash floods surging across several states. In Kentucky, flash floods have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/31/kentucky-flash-floods-climate-crisis\">claimed the lives</a> of at least 25 people in what experts have called a 1-in-1,000 year rain event.</p> <p><em>• </em>This article was amended on 1 August 2022.

Definitely a comedy. Academics have long agonised about how to categorise The Tempest but director Sean Holmes’s gleefully eccentric production is unequivocally comic. The great magician Prospero wears exceedingly tight bright yellow swimming trucks – and nothing else – for much of the show. Blow-up lilos feature heavily. Cheeky ad-libs and contemporary song choices, including a particularly raucous rendition of Three Lions, tear strips through Shakespeare’s text. It’s a rag-tag concoction but, in its best moments, it’s a riot.</p> <p>With palm trees wrapped around the pillars, a shiny barbecue and hotel-lobby orchestra perched on the balcony, Paul Wills’s design looks like Love Island crossed with a B&amp;Q summer sale. There are nods to the dark TV satire White Lotus, both in Cassie Kinoshi’s spikily playful score, as well as the decision to dress island “monster” Caliban (often portrayed as a grunting savage) as a brutally overworked local staff member. It’s an interesting read, which lends Ciarán O’Brien’s Caliban surprising dignity and depth, but it’s only the beginnings of an idea that rarely works its way into the rest of the show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80ad4c4ca914f5b6b28b6e4527a3744eab91c58a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80ad4c4ca914f5b6b28b6e4527a3744eab91c58a/0_134_4040_2425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Davis as Trinculo, George Fouracres as Stefano and Ciaran O’Brien as Caliban in The Tempest at Shakespeare’s Globe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lads, lads, lads … Ralph Davis as Trinculo, George Fouracres as Stefano and Ciaran O’Brien as Caliban in The Tempest at Shakespeare’s Globe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>George Fouracres and Ralph Davis have a ball as the drunken Stefano and Trinculo – comedy bit-roles that here feel like star turns.

So too do a slew of yellow rubber ducks, a litany of lilos, and an endless catwalk of novelty costumes (hello Harry Potter!). The energy stays consistently high but what’s missing is the magic – and the power and grace that the suggestion of sorcery lends to Shakespeare’s language. Prospero’s book of spells is bound together with a Tesco bag and Prospero himself only feels commanding in the play’s dying moments. It’s a shame because there’s a rough-hewn playfulness about Ferdy Roberts that might have made for an unsettling Prospero, with a frightening kind of magic at his fingertips.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/whats-on/the-tempest-2022/\">Shakespeare’s Globe</a>, until 22 October.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/ng-interactive/2022/aug/01/whats-on-netflix-and-amazon-this-month-august","type":"interactive","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T00:00:08Z","webTitle":"What’s on Netflix and Amazon this month – August","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ng-interactive/2022/aug/01/whats-on-netflix-and-amazon-this-month-august","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/ng-interactive/2022/aug/01/whats-on-netflix-and-amazon-this-month-august","fields":{"headline":"What’s on Netflix and Amazon this month – August","trailText":"Our monthly rundown of the best new releases on Netflix, Amazon, iPlayer, All4, Sky/Now and more in the UK","byline":"","body":"<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/08/tv-reviews-monthly-august/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2022/aug/01/starkly-different-but-edwards-and-selwood-both-worthy-milestone-men","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-31T23:55:37Z","webTitle":"Starkly different but Edwards and Selwood both worthy milestone men | Jonathan Horn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/01/starkly-different-but-edwards-and-selwood-both-worthy-milestone-men","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/01/starkly-different-but-edwards-and-selwood-both-worthy-milestone-men","fields":{"headline":"Starkly different but Edwards and Selwood both worthy milestone men","trailText":"It was a big weekend for two players who marked their 300th and 350th AFL games respectively","byline":"Jonathan Horn","body":"<p>Two champions of the sport, two men taken in the same draft but with completely different career trajectories, celebrated major milestones over the weekend.</p> <p>Shane Edwards was hoisted up and carried off following an astonishing comeback win over Brisbane. Edwards was nearly a Brisbane player himself. The Lions’ chief recruiter was desperate to get him, but was outvoted by senior figures at the club. They settled on Albert Proud, who ended up in jail.</p> <p>Few footballers have been so assured and so damaging in heavy traffic. He would swerve, shimmy and circumvent the normal chain of possession with his long, weighted handballs. Richmond was never a pretty team. They had blue-collar players who could thump and soccer it forward. It was swarming, brutally efficient football. But Edwards was the purest of footballers. In a team that always played in a hurry, he was the one who was always unrushed – their Pendlebury, their Mitchell. For any of us who have scrubbed around at the lower levels, if we could wave a magic wand and be blessed with one talent, it would invariably be that – the ability for the game to slow down around us.</p> <p>But you had to strain to see him sometimes. He was easy to miss. He was labelled ‘underrated’ so often it got to the point that he was verging on being overrated. At Richmond games, your eye was immediately drawn to the superstars. Edwards was best watched with a rewind button. You’d re-watch a passage of play that had broken a big game open and the crowd and commentators would be gurgling over Martin. But Edwards was always in there somewhere. It was invariably his touch – the cleanest touch, the decisive touch – that set the football free and propelled Richmond forward. Even on Sunday, amid all the last-quarter mayhem, he was a cool head and a clever distributor.</p> <p>Unlike Edwards, Joel Selwood was an instant star. In his first practice match, as he was being stapled up on the boundary line, the coaching staff had to caution him against cannoning into packs head first. He nodded, wiped the blood, re-entered the fray and almost had his head removed. It was constitutional.</p> <p>Selwood’s played like a rutting bull for 15 years now. We should be cautious about lauding this aspect of his game. There’s so many footballers whose lives are in disarray as a result of head knocks. Just this week, Jay Schulz detailed the toll of more than 40 concussions – the depression, insomnia and memory loss.</p> <p>But Selwood is somehow still standing. He’s missed just 30 games since 2007. He’s never missed more than four in a row. There have been other footballers who have played with the same ferocity, and with the same recklessness. But they typically haven’t lasted very long. The body, the head and the brain simply can’t take it.</p> <p>An argument can be mounted that he’s the most significant Geelong footballer in the history of the club. Polly Farmer went back to Perth. Gary Ablett Snr went missing. His son went to the Gold Coast. When Selwood arrived, it was a club on its final warning. It was “provincial, parochial, happy with mediocrity, but poisoned by it too,” James Button wrote in his official history. The 2007 loss to North Melbourne was a watershed moment. In just his fifth game, Selwood was easily Geelong’s best player that day. He brought a steel and a hunger that at times bordered on disturbing. He changed the club, led it, dragged it kicking and screaming into contention year after year. Many of the sides that finished top four under his captaincy were pretty limited. He’d will them over the line in games they had no right to win. He took them to preliminary finals they had no business being in. Every year, the pundits would say that Geelong’s cupboard was bare, and that Selwood’s body was shot. Every year, he would go again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/31/no-room-for-racism-in-afl-but-it-runs-deeper-than-just-verbal-and-online-abuse\">‘No room for racism’ in AFL but it runs deeper than just verbal and online abuse | Ben Abbatangelo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Few footballers have squeezed more out of themselves. Few footballers have enjoyed so much success, so early in their careers. But strangely, my enduring memories of him won’t be from the wins. I’ll remember him collapsing like he’d just been kneecapped on the night the Kennett curse was broken. I’ll remember when he went on Footy Classified with steam coming out of his ears, while all his teammates were on the turps and dressed up as Ewoks, after the Cats had been bundled out in 2014. I’ll remember the blood, the bandages, the trainers being shooed away, the constant booing and carping over his ducking.</p> <p>And I’ll remember those eyes. Tim Boyle once said the only person in football with eyes like that was former captain, Luke Hodge. There was distance in those eyes, he wrote, a “wilderness” that was almost unnerving. You don’t see eyes like that on people gathering around water coolers, or handing out canapes. They’re the eyes of those born to compete, to fight and to lead.</p> <p>They’re irreconcilable with the amiable, respectful interviewee we saw on Saturday, the man who trotted to all four quarters of the centre square and thanked his fans. For a brief moment, however, that thin veneer of politeness cracked, the jaw jutted and the eyes blazed. “Righto boys, enough of all this”, he seemed to be saying. With Edwards, there was a sense of finality, of satisfaction of a job well done.

Her big screen debut arrived in 1947, in the film Hometown Girl, but it was her presence on variety shows that made her name over the next three decades. She won an Emmy for her work on Caesar’s Hour in 1957 and performed comedy roles alongside the likes of Jimmy Durante, Mickey Rooney, Steve Allen and Charley Weaver on their variety shows.</p> <p>She got her first voiceover work in 1966, for the animated television series The Super 6. By the 1980s she was ever-present in cartoons, voicing roles in shows including Yogi’s Treasure Hunt, Scooby-Doo, Garfield and Superman, as well as the English dub of 1988 film My Neighbor Totoro. But it was her lifelong dream to work in a Disney film, and the opportunity came in 1989 with The Little Mermaid.</p> <p>“It was a lifelong ambition of mine to do a Disney film,” she told author Allan Neuwirth in Makin’ Toons: Inside the Most Popular Animated TV Shows and Movies. “So, I was theirs hook, line and sinker.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e283fd3d086fa1d0d4f629933deeb07fa885c200\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e283fd3d086fa1d0d4f629933deeb07fa885c200/0_9_2388_2983/801.jpg\" alt=\"Carl Reiner, winner of best supporting actor for Caesar’s Hour, with Carroll, winner of best supporting actress for Caesar’s Hour, at the Emmy awards in 1957.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carl Reiner, winner of best supporting actor for Caesar’s Hour, with Carroll, winner of best supporting actress for Caesar’s Hour, at the Emmy awards in 1957.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBCUniversal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Critics singled out Carroll’s performance as particularly strong in the box office hit.

Directed by Ben Williams, it unfolds in the eerie, otherwise empty corridors, classrooms and playground of a disused school. Thanks to some startling close-ups and lyrical narration it packs a punch even before Seutin’s crew make the first moves of their glitching uprising. Stand by for a sinister rendition of Simon Says.</p> <h2>Hedda (After Ibsen)</h2> <p>Writer-director Jen Heyes and composer Tom Parkinson’s sideways look at Hedda Gabler finds Ibsen’s 19th-century heroine squaring off against the great Norwegian playwright, dissatisfied with the limited life she’s been written. David Hoyle gives us a beguiling, deadpan Hedda, sometimes through song, in a pungent and stylishly captured performance that’s available on <a href=\"https://stream.sohotheatre.com/show/hedda\">Soho Theatre on Demand</a> until 30 September.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52fHu07wdok\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/52fHu07wdok?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>The System</h2> <p>The Inbetweeners’ Emily Head performs all the roles in her own play, a whodunnit in the aftermath of a birthday party where the host has been murdered. Original Theatre Company’s ambitious production, directed by Guy Unsworth, was recorded live in one take on stage at the New Wolsey in Ipswich and is followed by a Q&amp;A with the writer-performer. <a href=\"https://originaltheatreonline.com/productions/31/the-system-on-demand\">Available until 31 August</a>.</p> <h2>Summer Shorts</h2> <p>Subscription service Marquee TV unveils its third <a href=\"https://www.marquee.tv/summer-shorts\">annual festival</a> of free short dance, theatre and music films, one for each day of the month. Drew Jacoby choreographs Evidence of It All, written by librettist Royce Vavrek and narrated by Rosamund Pike; Drift finds choreographer Cathy Marston performing her own improvisation on the banks of the River Aare in Berne, Switzerland; and there’s a handful of films from Gauthier dance company’s The Dying Swans Project, each responding to Mikhail Fokine’s 1907 solo piece for Anna Pavlova.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab81eabc8bad6e158274a788d4bf92c1096716b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab81eabc8bad6e158274a788d4bf92c1096716b9/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben and Max Ringham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Expert ears … Ben and Max Ringham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gordon/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Exemplar</h2> <p>The prolific <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jun/28/why-cant-we-do-it-the-ringham-brothers-daring-sound-designs\">Ringham brothers</a> have brought their expert ears to stage productions around the UK, creating sound designs whose moods linger long after the curtain comes down. Now they collaborate with playwright Dan Rebellato on their first audio drama for the BBC. It’s a thriller starring Gina McKee as a forensic analyst who uses sound to solve mysteries. Shvorne Marks plays her trainee and there’s also a role for Fenella Woolgar. The series is broadcast weekly on BBC Radio 4 from Friday 19 August and also on BBC Sounds.</p> <h2>Neighbors</h2> <p>When Cicely Tyson died last year, she was rightly lauded as a consummate actor and mentor to many stars including Vanessa Williams who called her “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jan/29/cicely-tyson-remembered-by-vanessa-williams\">incredible and inspirational</a>”. In 1971, Tyson starred in a TV adaptation of Arkady Leokum’s play <a href=\"https://www.marquee.tv/videos/broadway-neighbors\">Neighbors</a>, which explores similar themes to Bruce Norris’s later Clybourne Park, as it follows a black couple planning to move into a predominantly white suburban neighbourhood.

A captivating performer, Coe celebrates the thrill of losing yourself in a library – at a time when they are being lost themselves amid huge cuts. Jackson’s tale of growing up as a bookworm in a clifftop home with his dad, words “fluttering like birds in my brain”, is told with lovely rhyming couplets and a super-sized pop-up book set design. For audiences aged four to 10, this is one of several on-demand shows from <a href=\"https://www.halfmoon.org.uk/on-demand/\">Half Moon theatre</a> to entertain and inspire in the summer holidays.</p> <h2>What the Constitution Means to Me</h2> <p>For more than a dozen years, Heidi Schreck’s evergreen show about the US constitution has taken on new shades in each political climate. Every time she does it anew “the world has changed”, she says in the show. “Next week, next month, its meanings may shift again,” observed Alexis Soloski in our own Broadway review <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/31/what-the-constitution-means-to-me-review-broadway-triumph\">back in 2019</a>.

Cuts on central government investment since 2012 have resulted in the pace of insulating homes slumping in the past decade, making the energy crisis more acute.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UK’s petrol prices are the second highest in Europe, according to new data from the RAC breakdown recovery service. UK drivers pay an average pump price of 186p, as much as 20p more per litre of petrol than drivers in Spain and France, according to the research. The UK is, meanwhile, ranked 12th in terms of temporary tax cuts on petrol, well behind Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.</p> <p>Simon Williams at the RAC said: “This analysis lays bare an uncomfortable truth for the UK government – that compared with other European countries, it’s pretty much done the least to support drivers through the current period of record high fuel prices.

Remember, it was only just over a year ago that – with largely the same squad and manager – they blew the chance to qualify for the Champions League on the last day in 2020-21.</p> \n<p>Injuries hurt them last year – key players such as Jamie Vardy, Wesley Fofana, James Justin, Jonny Evans and Ricardo Pereira were all among those who missed large chunks of the season – and while there have not yet been any summer additions, a fully-fit Foxes can hurt any team, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/leicester-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">as Liverpool found out</a> after Christmas.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6143b9ea-101f-4e5f-b0e9-0abb9dc6f519\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jBTrXrSWKek?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, frustration lurks. Leicester were eliminated from the Europa League in the group stage, and despite being the FA Cup holders, were completely outclassed by east Midlands neighbours Nottingham Forest in the fourth round, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/nottingham-forest-leicester-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report\">losing 4-1</a>. The Europa Conference League run to the semi-finals, where they were defeated by eventual winners Roma, provided some solace for Brendan Rodgers, who found himself under pressure as Leicester’s season petered out.</p> \n<p>The reliance on James Maddison is considerable. Nobody in the squad comes close to the 30 direct goal contributions (18 goals, 12 assists) the No 10 made for City in all competitions, while it will be interesting to see if Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall continues to progress after his fine breakthrough season.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/epl-preview/leicester-city/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The manager</h2> \n<p>The debate over whether Brendan Rodgers is elite has raged ever since his Anfield days. He has certainly improved his man-management skills since Envelope-gate at Liverpool, where he sealed away three names that he thought would let him down. In contrast, this Leicester team seems relatively tight-knit but the squad certainly grew unsettled over speculation linking Rodgers to Manchester United late in 2021 – a distraction that continued even after Ralf Rangnick was appointed on an interim basis at Old Trafford.</p> \n<p>Reaching the top six feels unlikely but if another underwhelming season unfolds it would not be a surprise to see Rodgers leave after three and a half years at the helm. He has spoken of the frustration of not having transfer funds – “my honest opinion is that [the squad] is not going to be the level I would have wanted” – but says he “really respects the club, so I don’t go to war with them”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00e4cef623178e6707000aadcd825d4e57f45294\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00e4cef623178e6707000aadcd825d4e57f45294/0_206_5083_3051/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wesley Fofana missed most of last season with a broken leg and having the defender available will be a big boost to Brendan Rodgers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wesley Fofana missed most of last season with a broken leg and having the defender available will be a big boost to Brendan Rodgers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>Leicester City are the only club in Europe’s top five major leagues yet to make a summer signing. They have a first XI capable of challenging for Europe but lack the squad depth of their rivals. “We have to do some business out before we can get players in,” Rodgers has conceded, “but hopefully we can improve the squad.” A lot depends on the future of Youri Tielemans and Maddison (who was subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/transfer-news-leicester-city-reject-newcastle-40m-bid-james-maddison\">a £40m bid from Newcastle last week</a>), while Luke Thomas, Wesley Fofana and even Kasper Schmeichel have all been linked with moves away. After missing out on Charles De Ketelaere (destined for Milan) and Kim Min-jae (signed for Napoli), City could yet move for Monaco’s Sofiane Diop.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>The fact Nigeria failed to qualify for the World Cup is a big plus for Rodgers, with both Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho set to stay in Leicester for the tournament. The England contingent is an interesting one: as many as four players – James Justin, Thomas, Harvey Barnes and Maddison – could be called up but a more likely scenario is that none of them are, with Jamie Vardy having retired from international football.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:37:03/embed.html\" data-alt=\"l\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-03:37:03/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during World Cup</h2> \n<p>The National Space Centre is an absolute doozy of a day out, complete with rockets and a planetarium.

Despite his injury troubles last season, Mr Leicester City has an enduring appeal among young and old supporters. This is Vardy’s 10th year with City, and the striker has no plans to let up with 12 months remaining on his contract. “If I can carry on getting the goals, still playing well and keeping fit, that can be extended to later down the line,” said Vardy, who has held legendary status since firing the Foxes to the Premier League title in 2016.</p> \n<h2>Social climber</h2> \n<p>At 35 years old, you might think Vardy is a bit too old to be on TikTok. But there he is, kicking balls as hard as he can towards the camera and reacting to fans submitting their best Sunday league goals. However, James Maddison pips Vardy as the most popular player on the platform with 1.6 million followers, who are treated/subjected to a lot of baby content as well as tricks and flicks from the midfielder’s back garden – Maddison has built a proper 4G pitch, complete with two full-size goals. No wonder he’s so good at those free-kicks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed–overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed–the-fiver\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>If Leicester were a Netflix doc …</h2> \n<p>We’ve already watched a summer drama unfold in the Wagatha Christie case, in which Rebekah Vardy has been pitched against Coleen Rooney, with husbands Jamie and Wayne exchanging nervous glances across the courtroom.
