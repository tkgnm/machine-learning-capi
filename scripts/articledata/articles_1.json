Yesterday Nato secretary general, <strong>Jens Stoltenberg</strong>, said that China has no reason to overreact, as “the US and other Nato allies have paid visits with high-ranking officials to Taiwan regularly over the years.”</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62ecdf048f08cf8820edc941\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-05T09:19:36.085Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are some of the latest images we have received from China and Taiwan over the newswires.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a06b75d3eca6af5adbf98a383bd2eedc95a825fe\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a06b75d3eca6af5adbf98a383bd2eedc95a825fe/0_0_2627_1752/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taiwan Navy’s battle ships anchored at a harbour in Keelung city, Taiwan today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taiwan Navy’s battle ships anchored at a harbour in Keelung city, Taiwan today.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ritchie B Tongo/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57fce72403725007ffc1283ca6d47982ab7587a5\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57fce72403725007ffc1283ca6d47982ab7587a5/0_0_1000_563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Air Force aircraft under the Eastern Theatre Command of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) gets refuelled mid-air during military exercises in the waters around Taiwan, in this screengrab from a 4 August, 2022 video that was released on 5 August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Air Force aircraft under the Eastern Theatre Command of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) gets refuelled mid-air during military exercises in the waters around Taiwan, in this screengrab from a 4 August, 2022 video that was released on 5 August.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eastern Theatre Command/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a06f73dbe5012106d49b4666f97a48b8fb5860c4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a06f73dbe5012106d49b4666f97a48b8fb5860c4/0_215_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists stand facing container ships in the waters off the 68-nautical-mile scenic spot in Pingtan island, one of mainland China’s closest points to the island of Taiwan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists stand facing container ships in the waters off the 68-nautical-mile scenic spot in Pingtan island, one of mainland China’s closest points to the island of Taiwan.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb1e93fe30a6cf15b1f5bed6e8b20b0b6f42491a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb1e93fe30a6cf15b1f5bed6e8b20b0b6f42491a/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Taiwan Air Force aircraft arrives next to a Mirage 2000-5 fighter jet upon landing at Hsinchu Air Base in Taiwan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Taiwan Air Force aircraft arrives next to a Mirage 2000-5 fighter jet upon landing at Hsinchu Air Base in Taiwan.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annabelle Chih/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82b1d8ec7bd86b1b1598a1f1b3ee40f151e296f4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82b1d8ec7bd86b1b1598a1f1b3ee40f151e296f4/0_0_3500_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Men read a Global Times report about military exercises near Taiwan at a newspaper stand in Beijing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Men read a Global Times report about military exercises near Taiwan at a newspaper stand in Beijing.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tingshu Wang/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62ecd9098f087e2e93c71abd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-05T08:47:53.971Z\">9.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the video clip where Taiwan’s president says her country will not provoke conflicts but will firmly defend its sovereignty and national security. </p> \n  <p><strong>Tsai Ing-wen</strong> delivered the video message in response to China’s exercises.

Unearthed in 1954, the Temple of Mithras quickly captured the city’s imagination. This underground building dedicated to Mithras the Bull Slayer, deity of a mysterious soldiers’ cult, was central to the original Londinium settlement along the Thames. Yet in spite of heated press coverage, and Winston Churchill’s endorsement, its treasures were then dispersed – or even thrown away – while the building was haphazardly reconstructed in 1962 on the top of a car park roof. Today it’s been carefully recreated at the bottom of the Bloomberg skyscraper, at the original site where archaeologists have since found many other ancient artefacts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The show asks us to think about the present and future relationship we have with objects</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because of the pandemic, Berlin-based artist Castillo Deball’s creation was shaped by what she’d gleaned from archaeologists’ databases, rather than her hands-on exploration of the collection. “It became more speculative and metaphorical,” she says. The items she looked to are not those associated with the temple and supercharged by its mystery. Rather, they are the more ordinary finds from later digs. “They’re utilitarian objects from daily life that were under the earth, not because of a holy situation, but because somebody had already thrown them away,” she explains. “Things like cooking pottery, clothing and writing tablets, which were used almost in the way we use text messages now. Once the message was delivered, the tablet was discarded.” The wooden tablets, which were covered in wax and inscribed, are the first example of written language in Britain and considered one of the collection’s greatest prizes.</p> <p>In her installation, Roman Rubbish, three towers of stacked ceramics suggest ways that our understanding of the worth and meaning of objects can change. In one, amorphous ceramics have been occasionally burnished with metallic glaze and are stuck through with a hotchpotch of things that can easily fall to the floor, including coins, pins and dice. Another column puts the business of preservation at the centre, carefully recreating pots with breakages and all. The final ceramic work enlarges tiny amulets – “a phallus on one side, a vagina on the other” – as well as toothless combs, suggesting how their significance has grown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine's biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A gauzy curtain connects the works, painted with scripts from the tablets and with further interpretations of artefacts concealed in pockets to make teasing silhouettes: uncertain shadows cast by the elusive past.

It is now time “to do something qualitatively different”, Williams <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-the-elgin-marbles-may-finally-return-to-greece-09kfzwhgd\">told the Sunday Times</a>.</p> <p>But what? Given the recent comments by the chair of trustees, George Osborne, that there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/16/parthenon-marbles-george-osborne-british-museum-greece\">“a deal to be done”</a> with Greece, the museum appeared to be hinting at a change of its stance on the marbles. So are we likely to see the marbles on display in Athens soon, or perhaps even given back permanently to Greece?</p> <p>Not quite. Pressed on the detail of the proposed partnership, the British Museum is unequivocal. It said: “We will loan the sculptures, as we do many other objects, to those who wish to display them … provided they will look after them and return them.”</p> <p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/nov/16/return-of-parthenon-marbles-is-up-to-british-museum-says-no-10\">comments by Boris Johnson</a> that returning the marbles was a matter for the British Museum were widely interpreted as the UK softening on repatriation. The government now insists he meant only loans – and that the museum is still legally barred from giving anything back.</p> <p>The museum may be right when it pleads that the question of legal ownership is not everything – “the public is failed when conversations are limited to a legalistic and adversarial context” – but on that strict point, it seems, nothing has changed.</p> <p>There are some, however, who question how long the museum’s line will be able to hold. “These are all indications that they know the game’s up,” says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-hicks\">Dan Hicks</a>, professor of contemporary archaeology at the University of Oxford, citing also comments by the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/museums-should-be-free-to-return-looted-colonial-artefacts-says-v-amp-a-chief-tristram-hunt-bvb5lztdc\">V&amp;A director, Tristram Hunt</a>, that the laws barring museums from returning artefacts should be reconsidered.</p> <p>“What’s happening, I think, is a fundamental shift in the position of audiences, stakeholders, and communities that we say we serve as museums. That idea of a benevolent cultural institution that shares is completely out of step now if it isn’t backed up with handing back stolen goods. There is a sea change in public opinion internationally.”</p> <p>Hicks has been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/07/europe-museums-decolonisation-africa-empire\">prominent critic</a> of the British Museum and other institutions over the Benin bronzes, the legal status of which, unlike the marbles, is largely undisputed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jul/30/oxford-university-may-return-items-looted-from-nigeria-by-britain-in-1897\">Oxford University</a> last week became the latest in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/oct/15/cambridge-college-to-be-first-uk-return-looted-benin-bronze\">wave</a> of <a href=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/15479/\">institutions</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/01/germany-hands-over-two-benin-bronzes-to-nigeria\">governments</a> to agree to return bronzes, acknowledging the treasures were <a href=\"https://africa.si.edu/exhibitions/current-exhibitions/visionary-viewpoints-on-africas-arts/the-raid-on-benin-1897/\">looted from Benin</a> city by British forces in 1897. So far, the British Museum continues to resist calls to return the 900 Benin items it holds, speaking only about “research and cultural exchange initiatives” with “stakeholders and partners” in Nigeria.</p> <p>Museums large and small have been grappling with these issues for decades, says <a href=\"https://curatorialresearch.com/people/\">Tehmina Goskar</a>, a curator and fellow of the Museums Association, who until recently sat on its ethics and decolonisation committee. “Because of social media, more people are talking about it, but as far as the sector is concerned, it’s been a thing for an awfully long time. [It’s just that] it hasn’t moved very quickly to do anything about it.”</p> <p>However, social media, increased engagement with diaspora communities and the Black Lives Matter anti-racist campaign have made issues of repatriation and decolonisation harder to ignore, she notes. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/travel/survey-results/daily/2021/11/23/9b053/2\">Almost 60% of Britons</a> now think the Parthenon marbles belong in Greece, with only 18% believing they should stay in London.</p> <p>Plenty in the heritage sector are sympathetic to the British Museum’s ambition to be “a museum of the world, for the world”, among them the archaeologist <a href=\"https://mikepitts.wordpress.com/\">Mike Pitts</a>, who says that debate about the marbles has “become more about politics and mudslinging than anything else … It’s much more helpful to think about the present and the future, rather than what happened in the past.</p> <p>“That’s not to say that nothing should ever be returned.

Some people simply found it hard to spend time with their own thoughts, especially if they tended towards negative thinking, they said.</p> <p>The study’s leader, Kou Murayama, the professor of pedagogical psychology at the University of Tübingen, said people generally found it hard to estimate the extent to which contemplation was something to be valued; rather, they considered other activities as more attractive – until they were encouraged to let their minds wander.</p> <p>“This could explain why people prefer to keep busy rather than to enjoy a moment of reflection or letting their imagination run away with itself in their everyday lives,” Murayama said.</p> <p>The study, in which 259 people took part, has been published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology.</p> <p>The experiments included asking participants to estimate the extent to which they would appreciate sitting on their own and thinking to themselves for 20 minutes. They were forbidden to use a smartphone, to read, or to walk around.</p> <p>According to the results, every one of them found their enjoyment at letting their minds wander was far greater than they had expected. This remained the case even when the experiment conditions were altered, including putting participants alone in a sparse conference room, placing them in a dark tent or cupboard, or letting them sit alone for just three minutes or for 20.</p> <p>Sometimes they were asked to comment on how they were feeling while in the middle of the sessions, sometimes after they were completed. But in every case the participants said their enjoyment was greater than they had anticipated</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A test group of other participants were given access to digital devices, and allowed to read the news online.

That, too, was achieved with the Cubs 92 years ago. August 1930 was a monstrous month for Hack: 113 at-bats, 45 hits, 13 home runs, 53 RBI.</p> <p>Wilson ended the year with 146 runs scored and a .356 batting average to accompany those eye-popping 191 RBI. The 56 homers were a National League record that stood for 68 years until surpassed by Mark McGwire in 1998.</p> <p>Lou Gehrig batted in 185 runs for the Yankees in 1931, which remains the second-highest single-season RBI total. Wilson was originally credited with 190 but a rather tardy review determined that an RBI that should have gone to Hack was wrongly given at the time to a teammate, and his tally was <a href=\"https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19990623&amp;slug=2968014\">boosted</a> to 191 in 1999.</p> <p>Driving in hordes of teammates is an old-fashioned habit now that on-base percentages and the average runs per game tend to be lower than in the pre-war period. Among the 30 <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/RBI_season.shtml\">highest</a> single-year RBI totals, only five occurred after 1949, and all in the “steroid era”. No one has driven in more than 150 runs since Alex Rodriguez (156) with the Yankees in 2007.</p> <p>Wilson was certainly taking a drug, though not the performance-enhancing kind. Born in Pennsylvania steel country, his parents were alcoholics and Hack followed suit. He always insisted he never took to the field while drunk. While hung over? That was a different matter.</p> <p>“I never took a drink in my life on the day of a game after 11 o’clock in the morning,” he once said. For Clifton Blue Parker, author of a fine biography of Wilson, Fouled Away, he “was the Roaring ‘20s epitome of a baseball player, primed for an age of American excess.”</p> <p>Hack’s mother died from a burst appendix when he was seven. He left school at 16 and worked 12-hour days at a print works, then signed for the minor-league Martinsburg Blue Sox in West Virginia. He suffered a broken leg on the opening day of his first professional season, which prompted a move from catcher to the outfield after his recovery. Wilson worked as a label stitcher in a <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Qu1TJLiZjbEC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=hack+wilson+sock+mill&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1uHOvOhyhE&amp;sig=ACfU3U0MbjHab92rJ5DC26anN35dft-2Tw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRiNzzy6j5AhU8lmoFHYA8ALYQ6AF6BAgpEAM#v=snippet&amp;q=interwoven&amp;f=false\">sock factory</a> in the off-season and married at 23, to Virginia Riddleberger, a divorcee 12 years his senior.</p> <p>Wilson made his major league debut with the New York Giants in 1923, acquired his moniker (his real name was Lewis) and drew comparisons with a slugger from across town named Babe Ruth – in appearance, batting prowess and relish for extracurricular activities.</p> <p>His unusual physique fascinated contemporary sportswriters, while more recent analysts have <a href=\"https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/gene-collier/2010/05/23/No-one-can-stack-up-to-Hack/stories/201005230191\">speculated</a> that it was caused by fetal alcohol syndrome. Hack was only 5ft 6in tall, but heavy, with a large head, tiny feet and small arms and legs. The baseball writer Lee Allen wrote in 1961 that Wilson was a comic figure, a “pudgy Goliath, a gorilla of a man with a red face” who “looked like a sawed-off Babe Ruth”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6e939175d9c6c0e6089596305ad44458c6e29f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6e939175d9c6c0e6089596305ad44458c6e29f2/146_280_3532_2738/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hack Wilson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"775\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hack Wilson poses at Chicago Cubs spring training at Catalina Island, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Acquired by the Cubs in late 1925, he flourished in the bedlam of Prohibition-era Chicago, where, Parker wrote, he “was on friendly terms with Al Capone”. He was once arrested when police raided a speakeasy. The story goes that he tried to escape via a window but got stuck halfway through. “Standing in a line a few days later,” Parker recounted, “he got into a shoving match with two policemen. Charged with disorderly conduct, he was taken to the police station where the captain, a baseball fan, dropped the charges and actually ordered the officers to apologize.”</p> <p>An early <a href=\"http://according%20to%20the%20baltimore%20sun/\">scouting report</a> is said to have described Hack as possessing “homicidal tendencies”. Parker wrote that Wilson once drunkenly trashed a hotel room in Boston and shoved an umpire. He punched one Cincinnati Reds pitcher during a game and knocked out another at a train station later that night. The Chicago Tribune reported that during a game at Wrigley Field in 1928, Wilson lunged into the stands and “choked the hell” out of a heckler. Wilson was fined $100 by the National League and the fan, a <a href=\"http://wrigleyville.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017/09/07/hack-wilson-vs-edward-young-how-to-milk-a-fight/\">milkman</a>, sued Hack and the Cubs for $50,000.</p> <p>Though he belted 39 home runs and batted .345 with 159 RBIs in 1929, Wilson’s season was defined by fielding blunders in Game 4 of the World Series that helped the Philadelphia Athletics overcome an eight-run deficit and go on to win the title.</p> <p>Traumatised by the mistakes, Wilson rebounded with his record-setting 1930 campaign and became the highest-paid player in the National League, with an annual salary of $33,000 (the equivalent of about $650,000 today). He seemed entrenched as the National League’s riposte to the American League’s Ruth, albeit with only a fraction of the media attention lavished on The Babe, but his fall was swift.</p> <p>His <a href=\"https://wrigleyivy.com/the-cubs-tragic-hero/\">drinking</a> worsened and he fell out with the rigid and teetotal new player-manager, Rogers Hornsby, and was suspended after being accused of egging on a teammate who beat up a pair of reporters at a train station. He mustered a paltry 13 home runs and 61 RBI in 1931 and was traded to the St Louis Cardinals, who promptly dispatched him to the Brooklyn Dodgers. A strong season proved only a temporary return to form and Wilson played his last major league game for the Philadelphia Phillies aged 34.</p> <p>He returned to Martinsburg and opened a pool hall but his life spiralled down. His wife filed for divorce, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Qu1TJLiZjbEC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=hack+wilson+%22loathsome+venereal+disease%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1uHOvOaBcy&amp;sig=ACfU3U11JVv41cR41rsR9zOeQnY23AlrXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikpJ_esqj5AhWJkmoFHY1QCO4Q6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=loathsome%20venereal%20disease%22&amp;f=false\">accusing</a> him of contracting a “loathsome venereal disease”. He fell out with their son. And the money was gone.</p> <p>“Hack was a warm and cheerful and full-bloodied human being, well flavored by the malt and seasoned by life,” recalled Bill Veeck Jr, the son of the Cubs’ president and a team owner, quoted in Wrigleyville by Peter Golenbock.</p> <p>“Hack’s only trouble was that he was overgenerous. He gave everything away he had. Always. His money, the shirt off his back - little things like that. Chicago was a toddling town in those days. Hack’s drinking buddies, a rollicking crew of about two dozen Chicagoans, would wait for him after the game and they’d toddle over to the joints on the North Side and the West Side. Hack picked up every check.”</p> <p>Broke and broken, he tried bartending but was taunted by customers. He found work in an aircraft factory in Baltimore, then as a park laborer and a swimming pool locker-room attendant.</p> <p>Penniless, Wilson died of an apparent alcohol-related illness in Baltimore aged 48 in 1948, three months after Ruth succumbed to cancer. Though he was <a href=\"https://www.si.com/mlb/2015/06/15/si-vault-hack-wilson-mark-kram\">inducted</a> into the Hall of Fame in 1979, he is remembered as much for his faults as for his triumphs.</p> <p>He gave a regretful interview to a radio station a week before his death. Parts were transcribed, framed and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/05/sports/on-baseball-hack-wilson-s-lesson-still-valid.html\">posted</a> on a wall in the Cubs’ clubhouse as a cautionary tale. “There are many kids in and out of baseball who think that just because they have some natural talent, they have the world by the tail,” Wilson said. “It isn’t so. In life you need many more things besides talent. Things like good advice and common sense.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2022/aug/05/you-cant-escape-from-your-own-mind-as-you-can-from-a-monster-scorns-original-unsettling-body-horror","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T09:00:41Z","webTitle":"‘You can’t escape from your own mind as you can from a monster’: Scorn’s original, unsettling body-horror","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/05/you-cant-escape-from-your-own-mind-as-you-can-from-a-monster-scorns-original-unsettling-body-horror","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/aug/05/you-cant-escape-from-your-own-mind-as-you-can-from-a-monster-scorns-original-unsettling-body-horror","fields":{"headline":"‘You can’t escape from your own mind as you can from a monster’: Scorn’s original, unsettling body-horror","trailText":"Serbian studio Ebb Software is creating one of the most interesting – and disturbing – horror games out there","byline":"Nic Reuben","body":"<p><br>It’s a genre famous for its tropes, horror can also be deeply personal. For Ebb Software, the Serbian nightmare-smiths behind the forthcoming Scorn, effective horror is all about giving the player time for reflection. “While you’re in the middle of a horrific event your fears are purely instinctual,” says studio manager Miloš Hetlerović. “Reflecting on them later or experiencing them secondhand is where the psychological side of horror comes in. You can’t escape from your own mind as you can from a monster.”</p> <p>Set in a lysergic, unsettling world of “odd forms and sombre tapestry,” Scorn’s striking visual direction takes cues from both Alien progenitor HR Giger and Polish surrealist painter Zdzisław Beksiński, Hetlerović tells me – as well as the films of Cronenberg, Argento, Lynch, Carpenter and Jodorowsky, and the fiction of Lovecraft, Barker, Ligotti, JG Ballard, and Stanislaw Lem. Like all good biomechanical art, gazing into Scorn’s world imparts the sense of a place composed of familiar motifs – our own bodies, and the synthetic extensions we willingly construct – but fused and skewed to impart dissociative dread. “Fans of classic survival horror should feel right at home with Scorn,” says Hetlerović, although homeliness itself shouldn’t be expected. The reassuring oasis of a Resident Evil safe room seems unlikely here; Scorn aims to isolate, confuse and trap the player in a world that actively spurns their attempts to understand it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e00b00a3ebbc59543d5cbd25daa95affcdb6855f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e00b00a3ebbc59543d5cbd25daa95affcdb6855f/169_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scorn screenshot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Horrific ecosystem … Scorn screenshot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kepler Interactive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, while you’ll still find your share of weapons, puzzles and encounters that require careful consideration, the game’s horror stems not from jump scares or similar tricks, but the atmosphere and the world itself. “We want players to feel dread and unease during the entire course of the game, and to be left thinking about it long after they have stepped away from the controller,” Hetlerović explains. And, as the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qVrfvIbJkqg\">recent trailer </a>(narrated by Hellraiser actor Doug Bradley) makes clear, you won’t be striking up any conversations with the locals. This is a realm well past its expiration date, inhabited only by an unknowable, slumbering intelligence that doesn’t seem likely to take your intrusion kindly. There’s an underlying rationale, exemplified by its horrific ecosystem, but it’s one whose uncanny nightmare logic you’ll have to parse alone.</p> <p>All of this has taken almost a decade to get right: the game was first teased in 2014, and the team has grown from 4 to 60 members since. Such lengthy development periods often spell disaster, and it’s true that Ebb Software confronted a host of financial and business challenges, but this timespan represents a vision refined and fought for. “The project was an exploration for each member of the team, since all of us had little game development experience to start with,” says Hetlerović. “Much of it was a learning process. However, we are satisfied with the fact that the core concepts and values of Scorn have actually changed very little since the beginning.”</p> <p>In an industry that’s no stranger to cynical trend-chasing and cancellations at the first whiff of risk, having such a stark and original vision survive long enough to arrive writhing and squirming on to our screens this coming October feels like no mean feat.</p> <p>• Scorn is out in October for Xbox and PC</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/05/new-referees-pioneering-kits-and-robin-hood-premier-league-is-back","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T09:00:41Z","webTitle":"New referees, ‘pioneering’ kits and Robin Hood: Premier League is back | David Hills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/05/new-referees-pioneering-kits-and-robin-hood-premier-league-is-back","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/05/new-referees-pioneering-kits-and-robin-hood-premier-league-is-back","fields":{"headline":"New referees, ‘pioneering’ kits and Robin Hood: Premier League is back","trailText":"The 2022-23 season promises migraine-inducing kits, a host of inspirational quotes and the return of a breakdancing badger","byline":"David Hills","body":"<h2>1) The five subs rule</h2> <p>Sold at the time as a short-term Covid welfare measure, it was never going to be permanent – because a permanent change would favour the rich clubs, and that’s not what the Premier League is about. So here we are then, two years later, with a new permanent five subs rule – up to five changes made at three points in the game, plus half-time, from nine options on the bench. Backers say it brings England into line with other top leagues and is a neater answer to player fatigue than cutting the (lucrative) fixture list; critics say it means more talent hoarding and fewer shocks – with big clubs having an in-play safety net if they go behind to a minnow. One obvious upside, though: fewer antsy press conferences devoted to the subject.</p> <h2>2) New match officials</h2> <p>Mike Dean, Kevin Friend, Jon Moss and Martin Atkinson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/the-highs-the-lows-the-reds-and-yellows-farewell-mike-martin-and-mossy\">are gone</a>, giving more game-time to last year’s intake, Jarred Gillett, John Brooks, Michael Salisbury and Tony Harrington.

Most energy, though, went into answering something that’s been niggling the panel since Eric Cantona flew over the McDonalds board in 1995: how would that game have restarted had the ball been in play? 27 years on, an answer: a player leaving the field to welly “an outside agent” is penalised by an indirect free-kick to the opposition “for leaving the field of play without the referee’s permission”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"481d3c74b3ec159153b4378e3149a78d09c27cee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/481d3c74b3ec159153b4378e3149a78d09c27cee/697_59_1114_1392/800.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Mark Long for online version of piece entitled \"Out with the old … Some of the changes to prepare for this season\" that appeared in the Guardian Sport 2022/23 Premier League Supplement\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Mark Long</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) Some choice new kits</h2> <p>Among this season’s sharpest: Liverpool’s iridescent migraine aura <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LFCRetail/status/1546773900943581184\">away kit</a> inspired by the “city’s pioneering role in the ’90s dance scene”; Southampton’s teal, aqua and gold <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SouthamptonFC/status/1543867341381029889\">docks-themed outfit</a> which, say the club, “pushes boundaries of creativity and bravery”; Tottenham’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial/status/1548335906506936320\">kids’ wetsuit design</a>, “offering pro-level inspiration on the field or in the stands”; and Newcastle’s two new looks: a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nufc/status/1534445363620347904?lang=en-GB\">home kit</a>, “iconic black and white inspired by the past, built for the future, honouring the club’s 130-year history”; and an away kit, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nufc/status/1541677886758961153\">white and green</a>, honouring the Saudi regime.</p> <h2>7) A debut mascot</h2> <p>There’s a top-flight bow for <a href=\"https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/2018/august/robin-hood-returns-home/\">Robin Hood</a>, Forest’s mascot since 2018 – successor to Sherwood Bear, who oversaw their 1999 relegation.

I only knew the hard “c” and couldn’t figure out what a kitten had to do with the story.</p> <p><strong>My favourite book growing up</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/03/100-best-novels-little-women-louisa-may-alcott\" title=\"\">Little Women by Louisa May Alcott</a>. I first read it when I was seven or eight. I was the only girl in a family of boys, and I loved immersing myself in the family of sisters. My family also had a lot of anger and volatility, and the thoughtful, attentive parenting Marmee gave her daughters offered a window into an idealised family story. The book appealed to me, too, for the same reason it appealed to girls 150 years ago: the four sisters quarrel, they have flaws, they love and support each other, they figure out ways to solve their problems. And the story itself is told against the backdrop of the American civil war, a history which continues to obsess me both as a citizen and as a writer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The book that changed me as a teenager</strong><br>My parents (and really, everyone who’s ever known me) have always thought my personality was too intense. When I was a child, they gave me Mark Twain’s<em> </em>Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc<em>.</em> They wanted me to see the fate that awaited girls who engaged too intensely with life. Instead, the story of Joan made me long for a vision and the commitment to follow it, even to death.</p> <p><strong>The writer who changed my mind</strong><br>In the Last Analysis<em>,</em> by Carolyn Heilbrun writing as Amanda Cross. I found it in a secondhand bookshop when I was 19, and it showed me a different concept of the female hero than the marriage story I’d grown up thinking was our most probable destiny.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/07/sara-paretsky-interview-i-start-each-vi-warshawski-book-convinced-i-cant-do-it\">Sara Paretsky interview: ‘I start each VI Warshawski book convinced I can’t do it’ </a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The book that made me want to be a writer</strong><br>By six or so I was already writing little stories, but I never imagined myself as a published writer. It wasn’t until I was in my 20s, reading Raymond Chandler at the same time that my life was being turned around by second wave feminism, that I started trying to write for publication. I was tired of reading books in which women used their bodies to try to get good boys to do bad things. I wanted to create a female detective who was a person, someone who could solve problems without using her body, and someone who could have a sex life that didn’t define her moral character. My series of novels featuring detective VI Warshawski came out of that wish.</p> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>author I came back to</strong><br>When I was 18 or so, I read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist. James Joyce’s writing blew me away, and so I thought I’d read Ulysses<em>.</em> I never got past “Stately, plump Buck Mulligan … ” Finally, this past winter, I read it with a group of friends who’d also never made it past the first paragraph. I wish I was erudite enough to join the throngs who list it as their favourite book of all time, but, sadly, it isn’t mine. However, I reread Dubliners and I still am in awe of the craft and insights in those stories. Joyce was only 26, but they still read like mature work.</p> <p><strong>The book I reread</strong><br>Jane Eyre. I read it when I was about 10 but was only interested in the first section, at boarding school. I’ve reread it several times as an adult, and am fascinated by how Charlotte Brontë handles agency in her characters. As a companion, I reread Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys. I don’t usually like what I call vampire books, where a writer reimagines the characters another writer thought up and breathed life into. The Wide Sargasso Sea is a huge exception. Her apologia for the sexuality of women in the West Indies is a tour de force.</p> <p><strong>The book I could never read again</strong><br>The Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness Orczy. I love the storyline, but the depictions of race and class are hard to take.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/18/tess-gerritsen-theres-always-comfort-in-sherlock-holmes\">Tess Gerritsen: ‘There’s always comfort in Sherlock Holmes’</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The books I am currently reading</strong><br>The Dictionary of Lost Words by Pip Williams, and The Cat Who Saved Books by Sosuke Natsukawa, and The Mind Readers by Margery Allingham.</p> <p><strong>My comfort read</strong><br>Barbara Pym, although she’s not as cosy a writer as people who don’t know her work imagine.

PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 12,000 chemicals used across dozens of industries to make products resist water, stains and heat. The highly toxic compounds don’t naturally break down, and are linked to cancer, thyroid disease, kidney problems, decreased immunity, birth defects and other serious health problems. They have been called “forever chemicals” due to their longevity in the environment.</p> <p>Saint Gobain Performance Plastics’ Merrimack, New Hampshire, plant had for decades treated its products with PFOA, one type of PFAS, to make them stronger. The company released PFOA from its smokestacks and the chemicals, once on the ground, moved through the soil and into aquifers. Hundreds of residential and municipal wells pull from the groundwater.</p> <p>As the company and New Hampshire department of environmental services (DES) negotiated the 2018 consent agreement, company officials repeatedly said they didn’t use pure PFOA, or didn’t have a record of using it, but instead used a diluted PFOA mixture of which the toxic chemical only comprised about 2%.</p> <p>In a 2016 <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22088594-may-6-2016-archer-letter-to-nhdes-denies-sgppl-ever-used-raw-apfo-cant-find-purchase-records-2000-to-2003\">letter</a> to state regulators, Saint Gobain wrote that it “never used [pure PFOA] as a raw material at any point in time” in Merrimack, and in 2014 told the EPA it “is not and never has been a … user of PFOA per se anywhere in the United States.”</p> <p>The diluted PFOA wouldn’t spread as widely as pure PFOA, and the modeling that determined the boundaries within which Saint Gobain would be responsible for providing clean drinking water supplies and remediating contamination was developed with the diluted solution as an input.</p> <p>But the documents released as part of the lawsuit show Saint Gobain knew it used pure PFOA years before the consent decree.</p> <p>Among the evidence are 2003 <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22088585-internal-stg-email-re-added-apfo-in-dispersions?responsive=1&amp;title=1\">emails</a> between company employees explicitly stating the Merrimack facility treated its fabric with pure PFOA. Meanwhile, a former Saint Gobain attorney who is now whistleblowing testified that sales records from 3M, which sold PFOA to Saint Gobain, show the company bought “hundreds if not thousands” of pounds of pure PFOA. The 3M sales records are under seal in the class-action suit.</p> <p>And a salesman for DuPont, which also sold PFAS products to Saint Gobain, last year testified that he had “learned that they were using [pure PFOA] … and adding it to our products”.</p> <p>The modeling used to develop the original contamination zone’s boundaries is “fundamentally flawed” because it did not account for the pure PFOA, an engineer hired by Saint Gobain testified in February.</p> <p>Saint Gobain no longer denies that it used pure PFOA; however, in a statement to the Guardian, the company wrote it “vehemently denies any allegation it withheld data, or misled, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services”. The information was “not new” because it was in 90,000 documents it gave the DES since 2016, the company wrote.</p> <p>Messmer said she’s skeptical of that explanation: “If you throw 90,000 papers at someone, is that really notifying them?”</p> <p>In response to a follow-up question about why it developed the consent decree modeling assuming diluted PFOA instead of pure PFOA, the company said the type of PFOA was only “one factor considered in setting the boundaries”.</p> <p>In their July letter to the attorney general’s office and DES, Messmer and other lawmakers asked for an investigation and to expand the boundaries of the contamination zone. The state has “sound legal basis to hold Saint Gobain fully accountable for their pollution, including beyond the current [boundary]”, the letter reads. The attorney general’s office told the Guardian it is reviewing the documents while the DES did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Some are also frustrated with the DES. Documents show it knew it didn’t have Saint Gobain’s complete PFAS purchase records from before 2004, but still entered into the consent agreement.</p> <p>“The regulatory agency is broken, and I’m really angry with the state departments that are supposed to be there to protect the environment and residents,” said Laurene Allen, a Merrimack resident and clean water activist. “Think of the harm that could have been prevented.”</p> <p>The documents reveal a company executive <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22112061-full-7-14-2022-letter-to-ag?responsive=1&amp;title=1\">stating</a> in 2006 that Saint Gobain “ought to downplay the potential health risks” of PFOA relative to other PFAS, and argue there are “no proven” health risks. But a 1995 company <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22112061-full-7-14-2022-letter-to-ag?responsive=1&amp;title=1\">memo</a> shows management had issued a decree to stop using PFOA “because of its toxicity and long half-life”.</p> <p>The company had also in 2006 conducted blood tests for PFOA on its employees but the results remain under seal, and the plant’s previous owner in 1980 investigated why its male employees were experiencing impotence and “polymer fever”.</p> <p>“They all knew,” Messmer said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/05/monkeypox-outbreak-us-gay-community","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T09:00:41Z","webTitle":"Gay community braces for monkeypox as outbreak spreads in US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/monkeypox-outbreak-us-gay-community","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/05/monkeypox-outbreak-us-gay-community","fields":{"headline":"Gay community braces for monkeypox as outbreak spreads in US","trailText":"Viral disease has primarily affected men who have sex with men – but can infect anyone – as cities and states prepare for impact","byline":"Eric Berger","body":"<p>Earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, members of the gay and bisexual men’s social group <a href=\"https://primetimersstl.org/\">Prime Timers St Louis</a>, were “very, very worried” about Covid-19 because of underlying health conditions, said Bob Brinkman, 69, president of the group.

On Thursday the White House declared monkeypox a national public health emergency, triggering more resources especially around vaccines.</p> <p>“It will have a continual impact on my intimate side of life,” said Brinkman, who lives in a St Louis suburb and is retired after working in information technology. “I don’t have anybody in my life right now, and to try to meet somebody on that level, it raises a big concern, and I think a lot of people are thinking about that too.”</p> <p>But while infectious disease experts urge men who have sex with men in cities, like St Louis, not yet hit hard by monkeypox to educate themselves on the disease, they also warn against panic, an understandable reaction for a demographic that was torn apart by the Aids epidemic.</p> <p>“I think it would be safe to say that this could be stressful for individuals, on top of two and a half years of incredible stress,” said Dr Preeti Malani, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Michigan. “People should be worried but not to the point where they are not able to move forward with their lives.”</p> <p>The virus can cause fever, headaches and a painful rash, among other symptoms, but is rarely fatal. It’s primarily spread through prolonged skin-to-skin contact, such as during sex, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/transmission.html\">according to the Centers</a> for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p>The United States had recorded more than 6,300 cases of monkeypox by Wednesday, almost half of which have occurred in New York, California and Illinois, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html\">according to</a> the CDC.</p> <p>But most states have reported fewer than 100 cases. Missouri has reported 10.</p> <p>Cities such as St Louis “should be prepared to see infections transmitted among men who have sex with men and then eventually spilling over into other social networks as well”, Jay Varma, the director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response, said. “It’s very hard to say whether or not this will be large outbreaks or whether it might be just a few cases.”</p> <p>That will depend on the availability of vaccines and the effectiveness of testing and contact tracing efforts, Varma said. There is only enough vaccine supply in the United States to cover about a third of the estimated 1.6 million gay and bisexual men whom officials consider at highest risk, and the shortage could last for months, the Washington Post<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/07/30/monkeypox-jynneos-vaccine-supply-united-states/\">reported</a>.</p> <p>To promote vaccination and information on the virus, Malani said, public health agencies should collaborate with trusted community organizations such as the University of Michigan’s Spectrum Center, which in 1971 became the first office for queer students at a US university. The group now works with the school’s public health department and the county health agency and is preparing messaging for when students return later this month, Malani said.</p> <p>“That’s an example of going to the organizations, the grassroots, the community centers, the individuals who have clout and are visible and are good partners,” said Malani. Public health officials should also use “non-traditional locations” such as bars, restaurants and bathhouses to provide information about the virus.</p> <p>On Monday afternoon, a steady stream of customers entered Club St Louis, which is part of a chain of private men’s saunas. On its website <a href=\"http://www.clubsaunas.com/club_st_louis/\">homepage</a>, the company offers advisories regarding Covid and monkeypox.</p> <p>“The first step in controlling MONKEYPOX is to seek out as many cases as possible, learn how the disease is transmitted, and what the symptoms are,” the alert states. “It’s important to get treatment for those infected and to vaccinate those who are potentially exposed, and to ensure that our at-risk community knows what is happening.”</p> <p>David Williams, a 49-year-old hairdresser, and a friend visiting from out of town came to the pool.</p> <p>“Apparently gay men are the only ones having sex any more in America,” Williams joked of the virus’s primary spread.</p> <p>Williams, who is HIV positive but protected from transmitting the virus because of medication, had already received a monkeypox vaccine from a county health department in Illinois.</p> <p>Still, when asked whether the threat of monkeypox had caused him to change his lifestyle, Williams, who is divorced and single, said, “absolutely”.</p> <p>“No sex,” he said. “Until more people get vaccinated.”</p> <p>But the message from public health officials to gay men should not be, “Just don’t have sex,” Varma said.</p> <p>“Whenever we talk about sex, we as healthcare providers always need to recognize that sex has health benefits, and it brings joy to people’s lives,” said Varma. “That said, you also need to be realistic and honest about where risk is right now. And at the moment … the highest risk is from either anonymous sex partners and/or sex-related events where people are having sex with multiple partners, so it is wise for men who have sex with men to be thinking about what their risk tolerance is.”</p> <p>AJ Pupillo, a 45-year-old St Louis county resident who acts as a caretaker for his parents, had not yet given much thought to monkeypox. Pupillo, who is HIV positive but also cannot transmit the virus, said he trusted Vivent Health, an HIV treatment organization with an office in St Louis, to provide <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Viventhealth/posts/10160278707674238\">information</a> and care he could need regarding monkeypox.</p> <p>“I know I’m in good hands,” said Pupillo.</p> <p>Brinkman, the president of Prime Timers, said the organization would probably continue gathering because monkeypox is much less contagious and is spread differently than Covid.</p> <p>“It might have some affect,” he said. “But I don’t think it’s going to force us back to Zoom.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/05/pep-guardiola-bernardo-silva-could-leave-manchester-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T08:55:57Z","webTitle":"Pep Guardiola admits Bernardo Silva could leave Manchester City","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/05/pep-guardiola-bernardo-silva-could-leave-manchester-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/05/pep-guardiola-bernardo-silva-could-leave-manchester-city","fields":{"headline":"Pep Guardiola admits Bernardo Silva could leave Manchester City","trailText":"Pep Guardiola has admitted Bernardo Silva could leave Manchester City, in what would be a blow to the champions","byline":"Jamie Jackson","body":"<p>Pep Guardiola has admitted Bernardo Silva could leave Manchester City, in what would be a blow to the champions.</p> <p>Guardiola does not like to retain any player who wishes to depart but given how pivotal Silva has been to City’s recent success the manager admitted his preference was to retain the Portuguese, who favours a move to Barcelona.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/05/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-on-the-opening-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for on the opening weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guardiola said: “What happens will happen, and if he stays it is perfect and in the end if he has to leave it is because football is like this; the player has a desire.

Deforestation and historic mining activity in the region have also been mentioned as potential contributors. Both flooding events have been classified as one in 1,000-year events by the NWS.</p> <p>Farther north, in Canada, a hailstone thought to be the largest ever measured in the country was found on Monday. In a severe storm near Innisfail, between Calgary and Edmonton in Alberta, the hailstone had a diameter of more than 12cm and a weight of just over 300g.</p> <p>Following a July marked by extreme heat, exceptional lack of rain and several wildfires, the drought situation in France is becoming increasingly grave.

In the early hours of 22 July, he authorised the military to clear part of a protest camp and take back the presidential secretariat building which had been occupied; more than 50 people, including lawyers and journalists, were injured.</p> <p>Since then, activists and human rights organisations described a systematic targeting of figures who are prominent in the protest movement. More than 100 people, including a Buddhist monk, have been arrested, the courts have issued travel bans, police have raided protesters’ family homes and security agencies have taken activists off the streets and questioned them for hours.</p> <p>“The government’s strategy seem to be to instil fear to make the protesters withdraw,” said Ruki Fernando, a prominent rights activist.</p> <p>Among those targeted has been Jeewantha Peiris, a Catholic priest who is a well-known figure in the protest movement and has been outspoken against the government. Police were given orders to arrest him on site and two churches, one in his home town and one in Colombo, were raided by officers looking for him.</p> <p>Peiris has filed a petition in the courts seeking protection from arrest, but he told the Guardian he had gone underground in the meantime, as police continued to visit his parents’ house asking for his whereabouts.</p> <p>“I have personally felt the intimidation and repression of protesters,” said Peiris. “We always remained peaceful and non-violent. They are now targeting all the protest coordinators and accusing us of committing terrorist acts which is false. This president is undemocratic.”</p> <p>Protests erupted in Colombo this week following the arrest of Joseph Stalin, leader of Ceylon Teachers Service Union and Sri Lanka’s most well known trade unionist, who was detained on Wednesday for taking part in a march in May.</p> <p>“The right to protest is a democratic right. What crime have I committed? Have I stolen public money or murdered people? What crime did I commit?” asked Stalin as he was taken from his offices and forced into a police vehicle.</p> <p>Among those who condemned his arrest was Mary Lawlor, UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders, who called his arrest “disturbing” and said his work “must be supported, not punished”.</p> <p>Sri Lanka’s opposition leader, Sajith Premadasa, questioned why members of the Rajapaksa family still in the country, who are accused of corruption and economic mismanagement and had “launched this cycle of violence”, remained free while figures such as Stalin were now behind bars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f34569d8b5c906a4735d6e66db9c74c8d501aca2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f34569d8b5c906a4735d6e66db9c74c8d501aca2/0_186_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters shout slogans.

But a case was filed in the courts opposing the action and hours before the clearance was due to happen the Attorney General declared that the camp would not be removed until 10 August.</p> <p>Angelo Kulasuriya, 38, who has been living at GotaGoGama, was among the protesters who said they would stay put. “We are not here to protest according to what the police say,” he said. “We have been here fighting for our rights, talking about the issues of the country, because that is the right that was given to us by the constitution of Sri Lanka.” </p> <p>Wickremesinghe has denied any crackdown on the protesters. He said he was taking action only against those who engaged in “violent or terrorist acts” and claimed that protests had delayed essential international financial assistance, including a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p> <p>“Some groups are trying to spread a huge propaganda through social media that I am hunting down the protesters. But it is not true,” Wickremesinghe told parliament on Wednesday. “I will not allow any kind of prejudice to the peaceful activists. I will establish an office to protect the peaceful protesters and support them.” </p> <p>But many groups, including the Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF), who have been very active throughout the protests, say they are being harassed and arbitrarily detained. In the past two weeks, IUSF leaders have received travel bans, been pulled off planes and buses by plainclothes officers and arrested. One was forcibly picked from the streets in an alleged “white van abduction”, questioned for several hours by officers about the location of the IUSF convener Wasantha Mudalige, and then let go three hours later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"First edition signup\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Other less prominent figures have also been arrested, including a protester who took a beer mug from the president’s house and another who sat in his chair when thousands of protesters had taken over the property.

They’ve got a 2% inflation target, that’s actually their mandate. And now inflation is getting double digits. So clearly, something’s gone wrong.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I think there is an issue about how the Bank is operating because clearly if I say to you 2% is your target, and you say to me, ‘Well, actually it’s going to hit 13%,’ I would quite rightly say something’s gone wrong. We’ve got to look at how you’re performing.”</p> \n<p>Kwarteng also said the Bank should have acted quicker to increase interest rates in an effort to control inflation. He said: “I think there is an argument to suggest the rate should have probably gone up slightly sooner.”</p> \n<p>When asked if the Bank would keep its independence, he said “absolutely” but also described potential interventions.</p> \n<p>“We need to look again at what the mandate is and how best they can actually fulfil that mandate,” he said, adding: “You’ve got to look at how the Bank is organised and what the targets are.”</p> \n<p>However, the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, defended its performance, insisting it had not acted too slowly to raise interest rates because it was important to defend the economy in the wake of Covid.</p> \n<p>He told Radio 4’s Today programme: “If you go back two years … given the situation we were facing at that point in the context of Covid, in the context of the labour market, the idea that at that point we would have tightened monetary policy, you know I don’t remember there were many people saying that.”</p> \n<p>Kwarteng was speaking in the wake of Truss’s appearance on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/04/sunak-and-truss-clash-over-cost-of-living-crisis-and-boe-recession-forecast\">Conservative leadership debate</a> against Rishi Sunak on Sky News on Wednesday. Sunak was the clear winner among the audience of Conservative members when they were asked for a show of hands.</p> \n<p>Kwarteng conceded: “He was very fluent, he was very slick. He performed at the end. And I think he did make an impact.”</p> \n<p>But he said that Sunak’s was “the wrong approach”, saying that Truss’s £30bn plan for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/23/thatcher-ministers-liz-truss-tax-cut-plans-patten-lamont-rifkind\">tax cuts</a> was the answer.</p> \n<p>“Interest rates went up yesterday by the largest amount since 1995. That’s 27 years ago. So on top of that, to put up taxes on people, I think is perverse. It’s not a way to deal with a recession,” Kwarteng said.</p> \n<p>Robert Hayward, a Conservative peer and elections analyst, said Sunak’s debate performance caused “a stop in terms of the momentum in one direction” of the campaign that had been going in Truss’s favour.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“There’s no question in my mind and the vote of the audience, it was the first time that he had clearly led in a debate,” he told Sky News.</p> \n<p>He added: “Liz has had the best of the last few days, no question about it, with the series of endorsements from different major personalities.

We might assume the disabled woman is the patient but in the first of many reversals of expectation, it’s not so. Jess (Martinez) is the compassionate therapist … yet she can’t follow her own advice and expose her fury, need and vulnerability.<br><br>Personal, political, even polemical, All of Us was programmed before lockdown, but the pandemic has only sharpened the cruelties of austerity. Care provision shrinks, support is abandoned. There’s much to be angry about, but Jess keeps a lid on emotion. Both the physical and emotional labour of Martinez’s performance are striking. “Let out the wobbly rage!” her neighbour urges, but it doesn’t readily emerge. She maintains that everything is fine, even when left half-dressed while the lights go out.<br><br>Georgia Lowe’s raspberry-carpeted stage includes a central revolve and this play makes us consider people from every angle. Under Ian Rickson’s precise yet delicate direction, they reveal their dimensions: particularly Bryan Dick’s recalcitrant, lacerating patient, and an incandescent Francesca Mills, whose character may use a wheelchair but gleefully refuses pieties, preferring a spliff and a Tinder hookup (“I am a woozy floozy”).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/28/francesca-martinez-all-of-us-standup-comedy\">Francesca Martinez: ‘It’s hard living in a world that can’t handle difference’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the play is built on uncomfortable, extended conversations, its characters hate having to discuss disability or need. That’s not who they are. But whether in formal or everyday talk, they’re dragged back to whatever stands in their way or are required to explain themselves. Martinez captures each evasion, frustration or humorous deflection, but as the cuts bite yet harder and the action broadens to include public meetings with a sharkish local MP, evasion isn’t an option.<br><br>With much of her life wobbling, Jess admits she is drawn to excessive control. Some of the play’s jokes and arguments land too squarely on the nose, but it demands we build a society where we can truly see and value one another. Its insistence on radical empathy shines bright. “I’m not broken,” Jess claims. “I’m a unique spark of life.

The Lonely One’s doleful tenor theme opens in purring dark tones, turning eventually to whooping free-jazz flurries while Clayton and Wilson encircle Lloyd with quiet Spanish-tinged countermelodies. Hagar and the Inuits is a skippily freeboppish Coleman homage, while Jaramillo Blues and Kuan Yin are both languidly rocking groovers, the first a vehicle for Lloyd’s vaporously swooping flute and his partners’ blues variations, the second a Latin-tinged showcase for his stealthy-to-gambolling tenor phrasing and improv fluency.

At a time when the identity of the Catalan club was in question, the young midfielder was the embodiment of what Barca aspired to be again. He ticked all the boxes: diminutive, homegrown and extremely talented. Puig was the next La Masia graduate primed to make it big at Camp Nou, so it’s somewhat surprising to now see the 22-year-old in Major League Soccer.</p> <p>The LA Galaxy announced the signing of Puig on a three-year deal on Thursday with Barcelona so keen to cut their bloated wage bill that they allowed the midfielder to leave for free. “Riqui is a very technical and well-educated player with incredible experiences for his age,” said Galaxy head coach Greg Vanney. “He will fit seamlessly into our group and style of play.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/13/toronto-fc-italy-signings-insigne-criscito-bernardeschi\">Can Toronto FC’s new Italian influx mark a return to MLS glory?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In any other summer, this would be the standout, headline-grabbing transfer involving an MLS club, and it might still be the most noteworthy of this summer’s activity due to Puig’s age and reputation. This, however, hasn’t been an ordinary summer in MLS. There have been numerous landmark deals struck across the league. In fact, this has been the biggest summer in MLS history.</p> <p>Puig’s move to the LA Galaxy comes just one month after Los Angeles FC completed the signing of Gareth Bale and just three weeks since Toronto FC landed Federico Bernardeschi. None of these players are typical MLS ‘retirement league’ signings. They are far from washed up. They are not in MLS for one final pay check. They had other options closer to home in traditionally stronger leagues, but chose to sign for an MLS club instead. That says something.</p> <p>Of course, bigger names have made the move to MLS in the past. David Beckham, Thierry Henry, Didier Drogba, Steven Gerrard, Kaka, Frank Lampard and David Villa all played in MLS, but they all did so in the latter stages of their careers. These signings made MLS a destination in the transfer market, but only for those looking for a final destination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fe10c1dbbd978d57a8da77dc7d8501906030397\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fe10c1dbbd978d57a8da77dc7d8501906030397/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federico Bernardeschi and Lorenzo Insigne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federico Bernardeschi and Lorenzo Insigne made their MLS debuts last month in Toronto FC’s 4-0 win over Charlotte FC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Young/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is where a dramatic shift has occurred this summer. It’s not just the ageing superstars considering MLS as an option, it’s elite performers in their peak too. Puig had offers from Lyon, Monaco and Wolves, according to reports. He also rejected loan offers to leave Barcelona in the January transfer window, but it was the LA Galaxy that turned his head. If the Galaxy can get one or two productive signings of Puig before sending him back to Europe at a profit, that will be considered a great success. This might be the plan for all parties and could form the core of a transfer policy that attracts more peak-age players from Europe in the years to come.</p> <p>Bale was linked with clubs in the Premier League and had the option to play for his hometown team Cardiff City, but he decided MLS would be the best place for him to prepare for the 2022 World Cup. Bernardeschi is similarly preparing for the World Cup alongside Italy teammate Lorenzo Insigne, who also joined Toronto FC from Serie A this summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/12/wayne-rooney-dc-united-manager-derby-county\">More with less: why Wayne Rooney may just be the ideal fit for DC United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cucho Hernandez doesn’t have the name-recognition of the aforementioned players, but at 23 years old he is still at an early stage of his career. Fresh from a season that saw him score five times in 25 Premier League appearances for Watford, it’s notable that he too has ended up in MLS this summer, signing for the Columbus Crew in a club-record deal.</p> <p>It’s not just in the transfers MLS clubs have done that a shift has been witnessed this summer, but in some of the transfers that weren’t done. Jesse Lingard, for example, was reportedly on DC United’s radar not long after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/12/wayne-rooney-dc-united-head-coach-mls\">Wayne Rooney’s appointment</a> as head coach. Ultimately, Lingard stayed in the Premier League and signed for Nottingham Forest on a contract believed to be worth £180,000-a-week, but the links to DC United carried credibility. It was a possibility.</p> <p>MLS finds itself at a critical juncture in its development. The league openly aspires to be one of the best in the world and with every signing like that of Puig, Bale and Bernardeschi the needle moves that bit closer to this becoming a reality. The record $2.5bn broadcast deal recently struck with Apple TV was another sign of progress while the 2026 World Cup will be an opportunity to reach more fans.</p> <p>But MLS might have to liberate its 28 (soon-to-be 29) member clubs in order to accelerate its growth. Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner publicly questioned how LAFC managed to squeeze Bale and Giorgio Chiellini under the salary cap with the pair signed on TAM (Targeted Allocation Money) deals. While Tanner was fined by MLS for his remarks, and there is no suggestion of any rule-breaking by LAFC, there is a sense that front office figures across the league are having to think creatively to sign the players they want. MLS could make their life easier by raising the salary cap and authorising clubs to spend more. One could argue MLS is now holding itself back.</p> <p>It can be tedious viewing everything that happens in MLS through the prism of the league’s continued growth and its place in the global soccer landscape, but this summer has made such discourse unavoidable. Would Puig have signed for the LA Galaxy even 12 months ago? Would Bale and Bernardeschi have used MLS to prepare for the last World Cup in 2018? Possibly not, but more and more players aren’t looking at what the league was in the past, or even what it could be in the future, but what it is right now.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/05/biloelas-nadesalingam-family-feel-peace-after-being-granted-permanent-residency-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T07:21:39Z","webTitle":"Nadesalingam family feel ‘peace’ after being granted permanent residency in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/05/biloelas-nadesalingam-family-feel-peace-after-being-granted-permanent-residency-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/05/biloelas-nadesalingam-family-feel-peace-after-being-granted-permanent-residency-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"Nadesalingam family feel ‘peace’ after being granted permanent residency in Australia","trailText":"In Biloela, Priya Nadesalingam says ‘I know my daughters will get to grow up safely in Australia.

His next move in politics may be even more alarming","trailText":"Once out of office, the former PM could emulate US media shock-makers, wielding influence without accountability, says Guardian associate editor Martin Kettle","byline":"Martin Kettle","body":"<p>As this summer has shown, no prime minister gives up power enthusiastically. Almost without exception, Britain’s leaders leave office in a foul mood somewhere between fury and fatalism. Herbert Asquith and Edward Heath stand out among former inhabitants of 10 Downing Street as two who could never come to terms with their falls. Both went to the same Oxford college as Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Most prime ministers at least try to go with a show of acceptance, albeit through gritted teeth. A few – Arthur Balfour, Neville Chamberlain and Alec Douglas-Home among them – even served later in other prime ministers’ cabinets. The palm for good grace, though, goes to Stanley Baldwin, who reportedly told the police on the Downing Street door on his last exit in 1937 that he was departing with a spring in his step.</p> <p>This will emphatically not happen when Johnson finally leaves in a month’s time. Some of the reasons for that are peculiar to Johnson, a reminder that he is a different kind of person and politician, and we shall return to them in a moment. Other reasons, however, are not.</p> <p>Power is a drug. Politicians take it liberally. Having to give up power is painful and humiliating. In an extreme case, such as Donald Trump, the pain can cause delusions, although the US system has devised useful rituals of transition to soften the blow, which Britain lacks. But the pain of lost power is something that all leaders feel, even the wisest. Fighting against the removal of power is a natural reflex.</p> <p>We know this from political history. But we also know it from mythology. At this moment I know it with particular vividness because Richard Wagner says it is so. I am writing this from Bavaria, while attending Wagner’s four-part Ring cycle of operas at Bayreuth this week. Yet even while Wagner’s music is unfolding, the echoes for Tory party politics are hard to escape.</p> <p>That’s because the central theme of Wagner’s epic is the attempt by Wotan, lord of the gods, to hold on to world power by whatever means he can. Eventually, and crucially, Wotan accepts that his battle is lost and – this is Wagner’s lasting message – that something entirely new must replace the old order. Yet even Wotan remains believably petulant at the moment of actual loss, and thereafter he is a broken force.</p> <p>Johnson is not the lord of the gods, although he once famously said he aspires to be world king. But, like Wotan and all people of power, he struggles to accept that he can no longer command the stage. In Johnson’s case, the struggle with this reality is an unequal one since it must contend with his narcissistic personality, his need for risk and the spotlight, and with the successes he has achieved by ignoring rules and conventions.</p> <p>All of which provides the context for the bubbling belief among Johnson’s supporters and opponents that he is likely to attempt a comeback. It is a campaign for which he himself sowed the seeds with the narrative of “herd” betrayal in his Downing Street speech, his “hasta la vista” Commons signoff, and his recent remark that his ousting was the biggest stitch-up since the Bayeux tapestry.</p> <p>It is also a belief that he does nothing to restrain, not merely among useful idiots who tell the Daily Express that a return is likely next year. Nadine Dorries and Michael Fabricant may seem D-list cheerleaders for a serious campaign. But this week’s <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/truss-extends-lead-over-sunak-in-tory-leadership-race-3pksqstpp\">YouGov poll</a>, showing 53% of Tory members think Johnson’s ousting was wrong and putting him well ahead of Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak as their preferred leader, will do nothing to dampen the talk about Johnson’s second coming.</p> <p>If this is to happen, however, it is important to apply some of the realism which Johnson’s cheerleaders mostly avoid. Under current rules, Johnson must remain an MP in order to be a candidate in any Tory leadership return. This raises three issues.</p> <p>First, Johnson must avoid being suspended after the Commons privileges committee reports on whether he misled parliament over Partygate, because this could trigger a byelection he mightlose. Second, he must hold his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency in the general election, which may not be easy, and has provoked malicious speculation that he may take over Dorries’s much safer Mid-Bedfordshire seat. Finally, he must decide what role he will play in the Commons from September.</p> <p>This is the crux. It is as much a question of temperament as strategy. Temperamentally, Johnson seeks not only the spotlight but also revenge. He is naturally vindictive and disloyal, as his axing of a whole generation of one nation Tory talent before the 2019 election showed. Unlike, say, Margaret Thatcher, who talked the talk about getting her own back for her 1990 ousting but then failed to walk the walk, the incontinent part of Johnson that wants revenge will not be easily quieted.</p> <p>Johnson’s real problem, though, is strategy. The avenging Johnson who is being built up by the Daily Express is a Johnson who would lead the Tory right from the backbenches and then challenge for the leadership. That may be plausible if Sunak wins in a month’s time, but not if Truss does. Truss is the right’s new leader now, and she is on course to lead the party. If Johnson wants a comeback, he can only wait for Truss to fail or try to engineer her failure. Neither is guaranteed. Both are messy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/rishi-sunak-lis-truss-bank-of-england-lying-uk-economy-weak-rigged\">Sunak, Truss and the Bank of England are lying to you – the UK economy is weak and rigged | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is possible that Johnson is about to launch a leadership revenge saga on the Tory party that would end by putting Hamlet to shame. On balance, it is unlikely. Johnson’s ego, though, will need an outlet. That is more likely to be through the media than parliament. He is a born performer. The broadcasters and press barons, including in the US, are likely to offer him the serious cash that he craves along with the chance to make waves.</p> <p>Maybe we should think less about Johnson as the looming Trump of British rightwing politics, and think more about him as something almost as alarming. He could become a new kind of disrupter on the British scene, a rightwing media shock-maker, a role that Nigel Farage has dallied with but does not take seriously. Johnson would do so. He could become the British version of American populist broadcasters such as Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson, setting the agenda from outside the political system. He could make himself the man without whom nothing in politics can happen but who does not have to deal with the consequences. That kind of power and money without accountability would surely suit Johnson just fine.</p> <ul> <li><p>Martin Kettle is a Guardian associate editor and columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/05/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-on-the-opening-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for on the opening weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/05/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-on-the-opening-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/05/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-on-the-opening-weekend","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 things to look out for on the opening weekend","trailText":"Arsenal look to avoid another opening-day stinker, Everton look toothless and will Jürgen Klopp start Darwin Núñez?","byline":"Guardian sport","body":"<h2>1) Arsenal to avoid opening night encore</h2> \n<p>It has become traditional that Arsenal look somewhat undercooked going into a season, but this time their hosts harbour more question marks. While Crystal Palace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/04/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">battered them at Selhurst Park</a> in April, a rematch so soon appears to suit the visitors more and Patrick Vieira’s prediction of “a completely different game” seems hard to fault. Palace are yet to find a replacement for Conor Gallagher, whose energy was so fundamental to their better performances last season, while Cheikhou Kouyaté has left and the current injury list includes James McArthur and Michael Olise. Reinforcements have taken longer to arrive than Vieira might like, while Mikel Arteta has been able to strengthen in key areas and field something close to his favoured starting XI in recent friendlies. A year ago Arsenal’s Covid-weakened side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/13/canos-and-nrgaard-sink-arsenal-to-give-brentford-dream-start\">began disastrously at Brentford</a>, but a Friday night fright does not appear as likely this time around. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Crystal Palace v Arsenal, Friday 8pm</em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/04/is-the-premier-league-and-its-fans-ready-for-a-season-like-no-other\">Premier League’s power risks being dimmed by a further season of flux | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>2) Núñez ready to go for Liverpool</h2> \n<p>Darwin Núñez does not look as if he needs to be eased in. The Uruguay forward started on the bench when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/30/liverpool-manchester-city-community-shield-match-report\">Liverpool beat City in the Community Shield</a> last weekend, but he appeared to be on the same wavelength as his new teammates after coming on in the second half. The runs were intelligent and effective, the link play was smart and there were signs of an understanding with Mohamed Salah, who was involved when Núñez scored his first Liverpool goal with a brave header. The question is whether Klopp decides to play the former Benfica striker when Liverpool visit Fulham on Saturday. Is there anything to gain from holding the 23-year-old back and playing Roberto Firmino through the middle instead? Firmino is an excellent, subtle player, but Fulham’s defenders must be dreading the thought of trying to keep Núñez quiet. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Fulham v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>3) Everton look short of firepower</h2> \n<p>It was against Frank Lampard’s old club last season that Everton found the spirit, style and backing that ultimately kept them in the Premier League, but that was courtesy of a winner from Richarlison – with both Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Salomón Rondón on the bench as back-up. The goalscorer is gone, the England international is out injured for the next six weeks and Rondón is suspended. Another attritional approach is likely, with no recognised forward available for the first game of a new campaign. And to think it is Thomas Tuchel who has bemoaned his club’s summer transfer business so far. Chelsea at least have some new faces to reflect an ambitious new era under Todd Boehly in Raheem Sterling, Kalidou Koulibaly and Carney Chukwuemeka, along with the promise of more to come. They have lost on their last four league visits to Goodison Park, however, and Tuchel’s appeals for reinforcement will only intensify with a fifth. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Everton v Chelsea, Saturday 5.30pm</em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9acf4516-0fee-49db-820d-4a9408054c96\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y-TNSr0TeSU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Will Pope force Dubravka out?</h2> \n<p>Nick Pope or Martin Dubravka? That is the dilemma facing Eddie Howe as his Newcastle team prepares to face Nottingham Forest at St James’ Park on Saturday. Pope did not join from Burnley for £10m earlier this summer to merely sit on the bench. Instead the 30-year-old has made it crystal clear he intends to be playing the first-team football that will all but guarantee him a place on England’s World Cup bound flight to Doha in November. Accordingly the consensus is that Howe will start Pope ahead of Dubravka on Saturday. That, in turn, is set to upset the Slovakia goalkeeper and his agent, who has reiterated that his client is too good to be anyone’s understudy. Something has to give; might a Newcastle-Leicester part exchange deal involving Dubravka and James Maddison be the answer? <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Newcastle v Nottingham Forest, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/04/newcastle-saudi-owners-surprise-with-sensible-st-james-park-revolution\">Newcastle’s Saudi owners surprise with sensible St James’ Park revolution</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>5) Kane can hit the ground running</h2> \n<p>If pre-season is a time for optimism, it has been particularly pronounced at Tottenham. First Antonio Conte committed to the project, then the club made quick and targeted signings. Yet there is one player who holds the key to glory and, happily for all concerned, Harry Kane looks relaxed and ready. This time last year, the striker wanted out. When he was denied his wish, he laboured, scoring only one league goal before the middle of December. He rediscovered his groove under Conte, who joined at the start of November, to finish with 17 in the competition and he carries momentum into the opening game against Southampton, having had a proper pre-season this time. Conte’s system is based on getting the best out of his front men, and Kane intends to embrace the expectations. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Tottenham v Southampton, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>6) Hammers pose City tough opening test</h2> \n<p>The champions do not have an easy start to their title defence. West Ham are unbeaten in their past three home games against Manchester City and play in a way that unsettles Pep Guardiola’s side. A lot of it is centred around the incisiveness of Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio on the counter, and while West Ham looked short of creativity during pre-season that is likely to be less of a problem against City. After all, David Moyes will not be making plans for his team to dominate possession. It will be all about West Ham maintaining a low block, keeping a close watch on Erling Haaland and looking for ways to release Bowen, whose diagonal runs from right to left saw him score twice when Moyes’s side held City to a pulsating 2-2 draw in this fixture last season. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>West Ham v Manchester City, Sunday 4.30pm</em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01abfeddf6f4a402a6698127cb67fe948830681e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01abfeddf6f4a402a6698127cb67fe948830681e/0_141_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jarrod Bowen gives West Ham a 2-0 lead against Manchester City in May, before the champions came back to draw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jarrod Bowen gave West Ham a 2-0 lead against Manchester City in May, before the champions came back to draw. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>7) Parker seeks early points on board</h2> \n<p>Great expectations. This phrase probably doesn’t embody the outlook of Bournemouth fans before their Premier League return. With Scott Parker’s men making hard work of automatic promotion last season, and a concerning lack of summer spending so far, the club look set for a trying campaign. After hosting Aston Villa, Bournemouth next travel to Manchester City before facing Arsenal at home and Liverpool at Anfield. A point at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday may be necessary to avoid the ominous prospect of losing their first four league games and seeing their survival hopes potentially begin to wash away along the south coast by the end of August. Villa fans will be expecting greater things than last season’s 14th place, and if Steven Gerrard’s players are intent on making large strides up the table, picking up three points in games like this should be a must in their hunt for a first top-half finish since promotion in 2019. <strong>Joel Mians</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Bournemouth v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>8) Will Ronaldo make an appearance?</h2> \n<p>Erik ten Hag’s first Manchester United XI for a Premier League game is not expected to include Cristiano Ronaldo due to the wantaway striker’s lack of match-fitness. The manager branded the 37-year-old’s early departure from Sunday’s friendly with Rayo Vallecano as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/03/cristiano-ronaldo-behaviour-unacceptable-leaving-game-early-erik-ten-hag-manchester-united\">“unacceptable”</a> and anyone watching Brighton’s visit will turn into body-language experts, parsing any interaction for a hint of discord. The Portuguese’s decision to go awol was surely premeditated as a latest ploy in the push to leave a club there is supposedly adoration for. As the new manager tries to somehow rebuild a shattered side, how Ten Hag deals with Ronaldo and an unwanted sideshow may define his tenure. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Manchester United v Brighton, Sunday 2pm</em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6a9178a3-09da-4eb7-b01a-ce6c411dc3dd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hh_CtvYZUug?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>9) Bamford return a big boost for Marsch</h2> \n<p>The injuries which restricted Patrick Bamford to a mere nine appearance for Leeds last season played a big part in not only the team’s dalliance with relegation but Marcelo Bielsa’s replacement by Jesse Marsch. The good news for the latter is that Leeds key striker, and 2020-21 leading scorer, is nearing 100% fitness and looks set to start against Wolves at Elland Road on Saturday. If Marsch can keep Bamford fit he has a good chance of buying the time needed to bed his exciting new signings, perhaps most notably the attacking midfielder Brenden Aaronson and the winger Luis Sinisterra, into the first XI and help Leeds fans forget about the summer departures of Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha. The American’s chances of making this season a success will be enhanced appreciably if he can keep Bamford fit. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Leeds v Wolves, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>10) Foxes face uncertainty at kick-off</h2> \n<p>This has been a difficult summer for Leicester. Kasper Schmeichel has left, the futures of Wesley Fofana and James Maddison are up in the air, and the Foxes are the only Premier League club yet to sign a player. A club close to qualifying for the Champions League in 2020 and 2021 found last season did not go entirely to plan, with Brendan Rodgers’ side finishing eighth, six points off a Europa League place. There is a different mood among the Leicester fanbase compared with the start of other recent seasons. They welcome a Brentford team they beat twice lastlast season, albeit fortuitously. The visitors have had a busy transfer window marked by the departure of their midfield maverick, Christian Eriksen. Given the uncertainty in LE2, Thomas Frank’s side may not get a better chance to sting their hosts. <strong>Uzzi Majid</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Leicester v Brentford, Sunday 2pm</em></p></li> \n</ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/05/chess-indias-teen-talent-shines-as-chennai-olympiad-breaks-records","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T07:00:39Z","webTitle":"Chess: India’s teen talent shines as Chennai Olympiad breaks records","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/05/chess-indias-teen-talent-shines-as-chennai-olympiad-breaks-records","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/05/chess-indias-teen-talent-shines-as-chennai-olympiad-breaks-records","fields":{"headline":"Chess: India’s teen talent shines as Chennai Olympiad breaks records","trailText":"Armenia are just ahead of the US, with two Indian teams close behind and England within range.

His rating has shot past the elite 2700 mark, a feat achieved younger only by Wei Yi, Magnus Carlsen and Alireza Firouzja. He has won all his six games so far in Chennai, including his <a href=\"https://chess24.com/en/watch/live-tournaments/olympiad-chennai-2022-open/5/2/1\" title=\"\">impressive win</a> over Alexey Shirov where he encouraged the former world title challenger to launch one of his Fire on Board attacks so as to refute it by superior strategic and endgame play.</p> <p>Gukesh is making a vast impression in Chennai, one that can be compared with five of the great Olympiad debuts by future world class players: Paul Keres at Warsaw 1935, Bent Larsen at Moscow 1956, Mikhail Tal at Munich 1958, Judit Polgar at Thessaloniki 1988, and Vlad Kramnik at Manila 1992.</p> <p>Firouzja, aged 19 and already having been 2800+, is widely regarded as Carlsen’s heir apparent as world No 1, whether or not that also involves the world championship title.

Place your bets.</p> <p>Carlsen’s Norway are seeded No 3 in Chennai, but are currently placed a disastrous 56th with North Macedonia coming up in round seven. As the Oslo journalist Tarjei Svensen has pointed out, prior to Chennai Carlsen had dropped a total of nearly 50 rating points in his last five team events for Norway, and had not made a plus score since 2007.</p> <p>The No 1 began his campaign with two long grinds where part of his strategy seemed to be to keep the endgame going until they were playing with just the 30-second increment, effectively making it rapid instead of classical. This brought a win, a draw, and a fractional rating loss. Meanwhile, Norway’s lower boards dropped whole points. Some said they should have fielded Simen Agdestein. The 55-year-old, who last month won the Norwegian championship for the eighth time, was also a striker for the national football team in his youth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ca2365d7b26b8e2ac0071f660665843720f80a76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca2365d7b26b8e2ac0071f660665843720f80a76/0_0_2058_2060/999.jpg\" alt=\"Ivan Ivanisevic v David Howell.\" width=\"999\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ivan Ivanisevic v David Howell.

You decide whose method leaves a bad taste","byline":"Interviews by Georgina Lawton","body":"<h2>The prosecution: Alex</h2> <p><em>Brushing after breakfast makes sense – why </em><em>start your day with crumbs stuck in your teeth?</em></p> <p>My wife, Wanda, believes you should brush your teeth before breakfast. But I think you should eat first, then brush it all away after breakfast. After you wake up, there’s a lot of bacteria between your teeth. I have told Wanda this over the years (diplomatically of course) that she’s in the wrong, but she won’t change. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You are leaving food particles between your teeth for hours. I don’t think her method makes a whole lot of sense</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Usually the question about who’s right doesn’t come up. But recently I read an article saying that her method of brushing before breakfast is better for good dental hygiene. The article said brushing before breakfast coats your teeth in toothpaste and offers protection against food and sugar for the rest of the day.</p> <p>But I feel that this benefit is far outweighed by the fact that food would be sitting in your mouth all day. You are leaving food particles between your teeth for hours, after all. I don’t think her method makes sense. </p> <p>I have said to her: “I don’t know how you cope with the food between your teeth all day. Aren’t you worried?” And she will say no – it’s just how she was raised.</p> <p>For Wanda it’s a cultural thing. If you’re brought up to do a certain thing, whatever culture you’re in, you’re immune to reason. It’s now part of her morning ritual. I don’t think culture is necessarily open to scientific fact or better ideas. It creates habits that are hard to break.</p> <p>When I’ve had that experience of not brushing my teeth after breakfast, it’s a physically uncomfortable feeling. A few times I’ve woken up late, eaten something quickly and then forgotten to brush my teeth because I’m doing something else, and I hate the way my mouth feels. My teeth seem to have a film on them. And there’s always this chunk of food stuck in my molar and my tongue is vigorously trying to get that thing out for hours and hours. I’m not sure how Wanda copes.</p> <p>Fortunately, Wanda and I live in a house with two bathrooms, so I don’t have to put up with the sight of her brushing her teeth before breakfast. When you live with someone, you make certain compromises. </p> <h2>The defence: Wanda</h2> <p><em>I was taught that you wake up, have a wash and clean your teeth – the issue is a cultural one</em></p> <p>When I was young, my parents always said that when you wake up, you should brush your teeth, wash your face and freshen up. It gives you that instant energy after being asleep. So that’s why I always brush my teeth before breakfast.</p> <p>It’s a habit I’ve had for many years. I was taught that when you wake up and wash immediately, you become a different person – you get rid of the night. It’s what I’m used to. I’m of a Chinese background and my husband’s American. We’ve just been taught by our parents to do different things.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If I brush my teeth after breakfast I’ll taste toothpaste on the way to work. That leaves a horrible flavour for hours</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brushing my teeth before breakfast also saves time. I tried Alex’s method before, but because I have to leave for work straight after I finish my breakfast, I don’t want to go back upstairs to brush. It takes up too much time. So I quit that habit very quickly. Now after breakfast I’m quickly out of the door to start the commute.</p> <p>If I brush my teeth after breakfast I also find it annoying because I’ll taste toothpaste on the way to work and that leaves a horrible flavour in my mouth for hours. I really don’t like it.</p> <p>Alex and I both have very good teeth – people tell us this regularly. We should both carry on doing what we are doing.</p> <p>It’s interesting because in China some things are typically taken very seriously, such as your skin, but there is not so much emphasis on your teeth. Compared with the US, it’s a lot less common to see a dentist regularly and spend money on braces.</p> <p>A lot of my friends say, “Wow your teeth are so good.” But I had braces and I take very good care of my teeth. I brush them twice a day like most people, and I also floss.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/22/you-be-the-judge-should-fellow-bridesmaid-dial-down-the-hen-do-plans\">You be the judge: should my fellow bridesmaid dial down the hen-do plans? </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obviously my methods are working and I’m happy about that. I haven’t read the article Alex was talking about, but I don’t need to. Everyone has their own choice and I like mine. If he thinks that it’s healthy to brush his teeth after eating, he can do it. I will continue to brush my teeth in this way, and that’s fine.</p> <h2><strong>The jury of Guardian readers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Should Wanda brush her teeth after breakfast rather than before?</strong></p> <p>Wanda is not guilty. Alex may not know how she copes, but she clearly does! There are absolutely things you compromise on in a relationship – if she weren’t brushing her teeth at all I could understand. But she does – just not the exact way Alex wants her to.<br><strong>Alphonse, 29</strong></p> <p>Alex’s argument isn’t rational. He says there is research that endorses Wanda’s method, but still insists she’s “wrong”. It’s down to what the individual prefers, particularly as neither has bad dental hygiene. He isn’t required to wonder how Wanda “manages”; he should stop trying to be right and accept that they are different.<br><strong>Angela, 64</strong></p> <p>It feels like Alex is quite controlling – surely his wife’s dental routine is none of his business, and given that they both have good teeth why does it matter? To hear language like, “I don’t have to put up with the sight …” makes me question whether this is just about teeth. <br><strong>Simon, 46</strong></p> <p>I’m with Wanda. As Alex says, any food from her breakfast is in her teeth, not his. The way Wanda brushes has no impact on him. Surely he has more important things to worry about – like why he’s so consumed by his wife’s habits.<br><strong>Lesley, 57</strong></p> <p>Wanda and Alex both have great teeth and are happy with their own morning routines. What’s the problem? Nothing needs to change. As for getting the taste of food out of your mouth - that’s what mints are for. <br><strong>Rebecca, 28</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>You be the judge</strong></h2> <p>So now you can be the judge.

Gabrielle Zevin’s exhilarating, timely and emotive book is perhaps the first novel to truly get to grips with what this means.</p> <p>Sadie and Sam meet as precocious, somewhat awkward children in a hospital where Sadie’s sister is being treated for leukaemia and Sam is recovering from injuries sustained in a car crash. Sam hasn’t spoken since the collision, but Sadie gradually drags him from his self-imposed exile, via long sessions of Super Mario Bros in the hospital games room. Their video game-enabled friendship sets in place a major theme of the novel. “To allow yourself to play with another person is no small risk,” writes Zevin. “It means allowing yourself to be open, to be exposed, to be hurt.”</p> <p>Eventually, the two fall out, only to meet again by chance eight years later in a crowded Boston subway. Sam is at Harvard, Sadie at MIT and they both still love video games enough to start developing one together, aided by Sam’s charismatic roommate Marx. Their game, an artsy adventure inspired by Hokusai’s woodblock print The Great Wave Off Kanagawa, is a smash hit and the trio set up a development studio in Los Angeles. But as their success grows, so does the complexity of their intricately entwined lives. Marx starts a love affair with the game’s hippyish composer. Sadie falls back into a troubling sub-dom relationship with Dov, an abusive male coder who could be modelled on any of the dozens of rich, 40-something predators patrolling the games industry. Meanwhile, Sam stays quiet, still being slowly eaten away by the physical and mental toll of that childhood car smash.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Sam is part Korean, part Jewish, and the success of his games allows him to transcend his awkward sense of unbelonging</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For those who don’t play or understand games, the lengthy descriptions of the development process may at first be trying. The novel explores, with considerable accuracy, the complex technological challenges, the inherent sexism of the games business (Sadie’s contribution is constantly underplayed by fans and journalists), and the compromises involved in meeting the demands of publishers. But throughout it all, Zevin’s avoidance of jargon and her descriptive skill ensure accessibility – and the narrative is grounded by the fragility and humanity of the characters. Video games, for them, are a therapeutic source of escapism. Sam is part Korean, part Jewish, and the success of his games allows him to transcend his awkward sense of unbelonging. Sadie has been overlooked in a family where a sick sibling took all the attention, but her protagonists are free to become heroes. Marx is a handsome, charming playboy who’s never been taken seriously until he becomes CEO of their studio. The worlds they create are progressive and uncompromising, even as a destructive love triangle develops among them and tragedy looms.</p> <p>Comparisons will almost certainly be made between this book and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/28/ready-player-one-ernest-cline-on-how-his-gamer-fantasy-became-a-spielberg-film\" title=\"\">Ernest Cline</a>’s blockbuster Ready Player One, if only because there are still so few novels that seek to investigate the appeal of video games and our relationships with them. But while Cline’s book is an uncritical celebration of hyper-consumerist geek culture, a trivia-obsessed male fantasy of power and entitlement, Zevin’s is a much more complex and interesting novel about how our lives and experiences are now mediated through technology. There’s a moment early on where Sam wants to help Sadie through a bout of depression and Marx is attempting to coach him. “Let her know you’re there,” he says. “And if you can manage it, bring her a cookie, a book, a movie to watch. Friendship is kind of like having a Tamagotchi.” It’s a lighthearted reference to the virtual pet phenomena of the 1990s, but it also shows how, in the modern era, digital culture reflects and replaces real-life intimacy.</p> <p>Zevin has written young adult fiction and Tomorrow … leans towards the accessibility of that genre; the subject matter, too, will no doubt attract a younger audience. But this is not a YA novel about video games. Instead, it’s a novel where video games are a conduit for self-expression and emotional connection, and where play is the most intimate and important human activity there is. Game development becomes a compelling metaphor for the way in which we build our friendships and love affairs – a process of imagination, effort and shared myth-making. On two occasions Sam and Sadie say to each other: “There’s no point in making something if you don’t think it’ll be great.” They’re talking about games, but they mean relationships too.</p> <p>Love, says this engrossing novel, is a creative project, and like any work of collaborative art, it is demanding and thoughtful work; there will always be risks and heartbreak involved. But the rewards are riches we could never have imagined or experienced alone.</p> <p><em> </em>• Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (£16.99).

Uhuru Kenyatta went on to win the re-run, which Odinga declined to participate in and called on his followers to boycott.</p> <p>Ruzuna Akoth, 33, who studies social justice and governance, points to this boycott to explain the youth opt-out. “When Raila did it, it was understood that staying away from the polls was a tactic towards getting issues addressed,” she said.</p> <p>But those who have spoken publicly about their decision to pass on the polls have faced public backlash. “The response has been a bit vitriolic,” said Mumbi Kanyogo, 26, a communications consultant. “There’s a refusal to contend with why people are not voting, and a condescending idea that if you’re not voting, it’s because you’re uninformed, don’t care about politics or are removed from the situation.” </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c5ec43e470f6d9e6eac3a49100fd319c427b6ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c5ec43e470f6d9e6eac3a49100fd319c427b6ac/0_289_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacked boxes of ballot papers in a Nairobi warehouse ready to be transported to polling stations nationwide, 1 August 2022.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacked boxes of ballot papers in a Nairobi warehouse ready to be transported to polling stations nationwide, 1 August 2022. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She said the goal was not to sideline or substitute the government role in public services, but to build stronger and more politically aware communities that can push for change. “The solution lies in mass political power.” </p> <p>Commentators note the entrenched beliefs around voting. “We live in a country where civic participation is reduced to voting. The exercise of voting is currently very extractive, where politicians only engage the population when they want [them] to vote,” said Caroline Mose, a cultural theorist. “One of the statements those who are not voting are trying to make is that civic participation needs to go beyond that.”</p> <p>Irene Asuwa, 26, a social scientist, agrees. Voter engagement this campaign season had been low and passive, she said. “The messaging around the elections is like, ‘go and vote and go home – and vote peacefully!’” She does not intend to vote.</p> <p>“People are saying that the youth are apathetic and disengaged – but many of the young people I know are really into politics and have just chosen to reimagine how politics can work in this country,” said Maureen Kasuku, 30, a community organiser.</p> <p>Kasuku and others opting out are exploring other ways to stay politically involved, such as building labour movements for better working conditions. She believes that Kenya’s notoriously expensive election campaigns keep many good candidates from running for office, limiting voter choices to a privileged few. “It’s an illusion of choice,” she said. “We have one of the most expensive elections in the world and what exactly do Kenyans get out of it?”</p> <p>Last year, legislators <a href=\"https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/blow-to-iebc-as-politicians-now-free-to-spend-as-they-wish-on-campaigns-3805508\">turned down</a> a move by the electoral body to cap presidential campaign spending at 4.4bn shillings (£30m) and other political seats, including governor, senate and parliamentary positions, at between 21m and 123m shillings. Many politicians go into an election expecting to reap financial or social rewards, according to a <a href=\"https://nimd.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WFD_NIMD_2021_The-cost-of-politics-in-Kenya-1.pdf\">report on election costs</a>.</p> <p>“The ruling class have their own interests,” said Kasuku. “They are not going to manufacture consent from us.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ae09ec651a8358b30d5cdf9d5301138a4acfa0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ae09ec651a8358b30d5cdf9d5301138a4acfa0a/0_337_5628_3377/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘There’s a condescending idea that if you’re not voting it’s because you’re uninformed,’ said Mumbi Kanyogo, 26.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘There’s a condescending idea that if you’re not voting it’s because you’re uninformed,’ said Mumbi Kanyogo, 26.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Inganga/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others who won’t be voting have been put off by scandals, from allegations of <a href=\"https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/degrees-on-sale-politicians-fight-fake-academic-papers-allegations--3847722\">fake degrees</a> to <a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/high-court-forfeits-gachagua-s-sh202-million-to-state-3894790\">corruption</a>, that have implicated presidential and gubernatorial candidates.</p> <p>“We can’t keep electing crooks and corrupt leaders and expect saintly behaviour,” said Bonface Witaba, 39, a writer and researcher, who doesn’t support either of the two presidential frontrunners.</p> <p>Witaba said that candidates’ ethnicity allowed them to hold on to power: “This culture of sycophancy – of defending ‘our tribal kingpins’ even if they are implicated in corruption – will remain our biggest undoing.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/aug/01/martha-karua-wave-mother-of-nation-kenyan-presidential-elections\"> ‘Karua wave’ in Kenya’s elections may bring first female deputy president </a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Mose believes there has been a shift since the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/03/16/ballots-bullets/organized-political-violence-and-kenyas-crisis-governance\">2007 post-election violence</a>, which led to the deaths of more than 1,000 Kenyans. “We have a large constituency of young people that are refusing to be dragged into ethnic politics that used to define Kenya,” she said. “There’s an understanding that ethnic identity can be used politically in very violent and negative ways, so a number of people are going back to their ethnic identity as a cultural identity, but not a political one.”</p> <p>However, political analysts say that while there might be some shift in the city, it does not extend to more rural areas and is unlikely to have an effect on voting patterns. “The fact is, Kenyan politics are still very ethnic-based,” said the analyst Mark Bichachi, adding that this was evident in the contenders’ choice of running mates. Both leading presidential contenders have selected their deputies from the Mount Kenya region – an influential voter bloc.</p> <p>But Bichachi believes the youth vote could make a difference. “If the 18-to-25 age group were to vote, they could definitely swing an election.”</p> <p>In the few days before the polls open, civil society groups are continuing to encourage young people to cast their vote. “Power doesn’t only sit at the presidency,” said Mwakamba. “Other elective roles like members of parliament and county assemblies play an essential role on behalf of citizens.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/05/researchers-attach-body-cameras-to-children-to-study-new-zealand-poverty","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T06:10:44Z","webTitle":"Researchers attach body cameras to children to study New Zealand poverty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/researchers-attach-body-cameras-to-children-to-study-new-zealand-poverty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/05/researchers-attach-body-cameras-to-children-to-study-new-zealand-poverty","fields":{"headline":"Researchers attach body cameras to children to study New Zealand poverty","trailText":"Images from world-first project show ‘shameful’ differences between conditions faced by children in most- and least-advantaged households","byline":"Eva Corlett in Wellington","body":"<p>Body cameras attached to more than 150 children have captured the “shameful” extent of child poverty in New Zealand through a child’s eye in a world-first study.</p> <p>The University of Otago-led study, published in the <a href=\"https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/childrens-perspectives-on-the-wicked-problem-of-child-poverty-in-aotearoa-new-zealand-a-wearable-camera-study\">New Zealand Medical Journal</a>, involved 168 randomly selected 11- to 13-year-olds from across 16 Wellington schools wearing automatic cameras for four days.

Spin-off studies have also come from the camera data, including a look into the exposure children have to junk food and branding.</p> <p>Researchers compared images captured by children living in the lowest to highest levels of deprivation.</p> <p>They found that children from more deprived households had less healthy food available to them, fewer educational resources, lacked access to technology or quiet spaces to do homework, often lived in mouldy and overcrowded houses, had fewer opportunities to engage in structured physical activity and were more likely to be exposed to harms such as alcohol.</p> <p>“It’s heartbreaking and it’s shameful,” Signal said. “There’s no excuse for a country of our wealth.</p> <p>“We’ve always said we’re a great country to grow up in, but only for some children.”</p> <p>The study was conducted in 2014, with the results compiled and released this week. </p> <p>Reducing child poverty is one of the signature issues of the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. In her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/jacinda-ardern-takes-child-poverty-role-in-new-zealand-ministry\">newly created role as minister for child poverty reduction</a>, she introduced legislation in 2018 that set out to create political accountability for reduction targets.</p> <p>The measures of child poverty are beginning to trend downwards, according to Stats NZ, but roughly 150,400 children live in severe income poverty, while another nearly 600,000 are either living in after-housing costs poverty or income poverty. Stark disparities for Māori and Pasifika children remain – one in five Māori children live in material hardship and one in four Pasifika.</p> <p>Since the study’s data was collected, the government has made some improvements to housing, benefit levels and a cost-of-living payment to low-income earners, Signal said. “Yet the issue of child poverty remains in Aotearoa, damaging the health and wellbeing of our children.</p> <p>“We’re hoping that by sharing the children’s lives … that it maybe could motivate adults to really bite the bullet and deal with it.

He was a prolific writer, and his 1870s stint in Mersea led to a novel called Mehalah: A Story of the Salt Marshes, evoking this area “veined and freckled in every part with water”. As I trudge on along the pebbly shoreline, Baring-Gould’s description of it as desolate, but “not without beauty”, feels apt. He mentions summer carpets of pink thrift and purple sea lavender and the winter marshes “alive and wakeful with countless wild fowl”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fe19d5b9d1345409eec864dabe9046d591e15814\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe19d5b9d1345409eec864dabe9046d591e15814/0_334_3912_2347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boats regularly appear in the distance, drifting on inlets and creeks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boats regularly appear in the distance, drifting on inlets and creeks</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MARC_SETHI/Marc Sethi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The long beach has banks of shells: cockles, mussels, sea snails and big, bleached oysters.

The pub’s stylish incarnation includes a vaulted contemporary dining room and a colourful lounge in the older, weatherboarded section that dates back to the 16th century. It’s only been open two weeks when I arrive and is already popular. The menu includes a “casual” section of gourmet pub classics (soup, pasta, burgers, mussels with fries), alongside an upmarket selection of seafood, saltmarsh lamb and plant-based inventiveness. In the bar, there’s a very drinkable amber Island Bitter and the malty Brewer’s Gold from nearby Crouch Vale.

It’s cheery and jaunty for the most part but, as with Carson’s moment of doubt, there are feelings of vertigo too, when the women realise they’ve abandoned their comfort zones and there may be no way back.

It’s the underlying interest rate that in turn influences the rates those banks charge their customers for borrowing, or pay them for saving. It’s the biggest single tool the Bank has for fulfilling its role of keeping inflation close to an ideal of 2%.</p> <p>Inflation is much higher than that at the moment – and it is predicted to get even higher, and stay there. By putting the base rate up, the bank hopes that it will reduce spending, and counteract some of that inflation.</p> <p>The Bank usually hates to put rates up if it thinks a recession is coming, because doing so makes one more likely. But this time, it appears to think the problem with inflation requires it to do so anyway – and even that a recession may be part of the solution to bring inflation under control.</p> <p>If you take a very long view, a rate of 1.75% is still low. But when the increase is the sixth in succession with more all but certain to follow, and with many people having chosen to borrow more than they might have in higher-interest eras, to say nothing of a generational energy crisis in the offing, the historic comparison may not capture the impact of the change.</p> <p>***</p> <p>How will the news affect my finances?</p> <p>Rupert Jones and Hilary Osborne have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/bank-of-england-interest-rate-rise-first-time-home-buyers-credit-card-finances\">an excellent detailed guide</a>. Mortgage rates are going to go up, so for those not on fixed rate deals can expect an increase in their monthly repayments – and those seeking a new fixed rate deal will be spending significantly more. (The lowest fixed rates on offer have already jumped from 1.3-1.5% in January to 3.4-3.5% today.)</p> <p>That’s also bad news – when is there ever anything else – for first time buyers already contending with house prices that are continuing to climb. But, as Larry Elliott <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/31/era-of-soaring-house-prices-is-ending-as-central-banks-raise-rates\">set out earlier this week</a>, prices may finally start to come down as mortgages get more expensive and unemployment rises.</p> <p>Most credit card rates will not automatically rise, but they will reflect the new bank rate in the end, and more and more people are using credit or taking out loans to pay their bills. Of course, those who have no choice but to do so are already among the worst-off.</p> <p>Those minded to save will get a better rate than previously. But with inflation so high, the value of their savings will still be decreasing over time. As <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uk-interest-rate-rise-what-the-bank-of-englands-historic-hike-means-for-your-money-188042\">this piece points out</a>, people with their money in easy-access accounts last saw returns above inflation in 2008. It is good news for those looking to build a pension pot or cash in their fund for an annuity.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Why has the Bank done it?</p> <p>According to governor Andrew Bailey, the alternative is “even worse”. Bailey acknowledged in a press conference yesterday that the vast majority of inflationary pressure in the economy so far is caused by factors outside the bank’s control – overwhelmingly “Russia’s restriction of gas supplies to Europe and the risk of future cuts”. But he said that “domestic inflationary pressures have also remained strong”.</p> <p>The argument the Bank makes is that the impact of the energy crisis is likely to be temporary, and that it has to act now with a view to bringing inflation down as much as possible when it abates. In essence, it accepts that a recession is inevitable and its increase in interest rates is likely to contribute – but it sees an increase in unemployment and pain for borrowers as the unpalatable but unavoidable price of getting back on an even keel. Bailey argues that without doing so, those worst affected will be “those who are least well-off in society”.</p> <p>***</p> <p>What do its critics say?</p> <p>Plenty. Liz Truss and her allies have been arguing that the Bank has been “asleep at the wheel” by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/04/liz-truss-review-bank-of-england-mandate-says-tory-ally\">not pushing interest rates up further sooner</a> – and have threatened to end the independence which the bank has held for 25 years.</p> <p>Others argue that, on the contrary, putting rates up is a mistake because it will have no impact on the real driver of this crisis – energy prices. From that perspective, the Bank appears simply to be pushing rates up for the want of any other useful levers. Aditya Chakrabortty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/rishi-sunak-lis-truss-bank-of-england-lying-uk-economy-weak-rigged\">points out</a> that in May, Bailey said he was “helpless” to stop inflation, and argues that this rise is likely to “put firms out of business and sink households into a debt crisis”.</p> <p>The Guardian’s editorial from Wednesday is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/03/the-guardian-view-on-the-economy-a-mess-the-bank-is-making-worse\">worth reading in full</a>: it argues that with wages stagnant, “inflation is really a form of rationing – rationing by price, so that the wealthiest can afford to keep their houses warm this winter and their cars filled with petrol, while those with less money have to make some stark choices.” A rate rise, it goes on, “adds to the economic pain by making mortgages and credit card bills another worry for families already stressed about paying for energy and food”.</p> <p>***</p> <p>What happens next?</p> <p>The Bank has not committed to further rate rises, and Bailey says policy is “not on a pre-set path”. But in the monetary policy report, the Bank said it remained willing to act “forcefully”, the same language that preceded this increase. Analysts think there is a strong chance that in September the rate could rise further.</p> <p>In the meantime, there will be pressure on chancellor Nadhim Zahawi to alleviate the impact of this rise on the worst off – but with a new prime minister not in place until September, he may feel it is impossible to take significant action. Liz Truss has promised an emergency budget; she acknowledged in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/04/sunak-and-truss-clash-over-cost-of-living-crisis-and-boe-recession-forecast\">a Sky News discussion last night</a> that what the Bank says is “extremely worrying” but that a recession is “not inevitable” and that lower taxes are the solution. Sunak also suggested that he could “of course” avert a recession but that tax cuts would “put fuel on the fire.”</p> <p>The cold reality is that whatever happens will have no impact on the sharp increases to energy bills that are baked in over the next six months. And the Bank believes the most likely scenario is that household incomes will decline by 5% by 2024 – the biggest fall since records began more than half a century ago.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p>In this week’s edition of the heat or eat diaries, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/food-energy-bills-rising\">James explains </a>why <strong>rent strikes and energy bill boycotts</strong> could put him in an even more precarious position if he tried to take part. “Winter is coming, and a 40% hike in energy costs will accompany the cold,” James writes, “I don’t know how long we can continue to tolerate this.” <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/conservative-leadership-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-promise-the-impossible\">Polly Toynbee writes</a> that even as the economic outlook worsens, the two <strong>Tory leadership</strong> candidates appear to “inhabit another universe”.

It is closely allied to Nottingham’s Magpie Brewery, whose beers are a key draw across Barrel Drop’s 17 cask, keg and cider lines. Beer lovers longing for the bitter, resinous era of west coast IPAs will love Magpie’s Simcoe-packed Trailhound, while featured beers from the likes of Siren, Arbor and Wild Beer cover numerous stylistic bases. Of particular interest for travelling football fans, Magpie’s <strong>Crafty Warehouse</strong> brewery-tap (Fri-Sat, Unit 4-6, Ashling Court) is located next door to Notts County’s Meadow Lane, a 10- to 15-minute walk from Nottingham Forest’s City Ground. It opens on match days. <br>• <em>Pint from £3.60, <a href=\"https://magpiebrewery.com/shop/\">magpiebrewery.com</a></em></p> <h2>The Kilpin and Junkyard</h2> <p>Named after Nottingham-born AC Milan-founder Herbert Kilpin, the Kilpin shares a courtyard garden and ownership with the neighbouring Junkyard. Broadly, <a href=\"https://junkbars.com/\">Junkyard</a> is a hip, post-industrial bar dispensing 15 lines of every variety of craft beer, from complex imperial stouts to fruity pastry sours. Events with cutting-edge breweries, recently Poland’s Maltgarden or Sweden’s Brewski, complete this beer geek heaven. The Kilpin is more traditional: it looks like a pub, it shows live sport and its beer range goes deep on German and Belgian ales; try the zesty, elderflower-tinged Kilpin pale, made by Nottingham aces Black Iris. Fans of Trappist ales, wits, saisons and funky, spontaneously fermented sour beers may never leave. <br>• <em>Kilpin pint from £3.70, <a href=\"https://thekilpin.co.uk/\">thekilpin.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>BeerHeadZ</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e647fa677b43160395677e34c3319925b428b07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e647fa677b43160395677e34c3319925b428b07/13_0_2025_1215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BeerHeadZ Nottingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This Edwardian-era cab drivers’ shelter at Nottingham station is a vintage gem: a simple, wood-panelled room with 11 taps of immaculate cask and keg beer and a compact, discerning selection of cans, ciders and perry. Local breweries, such as Totally Brewed and Lenton Lane, share bar space with the cream of UK craft: Burning Sky, Buxton, Wander Beyond, Wilderness. There are a few outdoor tables, but stay inside if you like musical surprises with your pint – Jonathan Richman, on this visit. <br>• <em>Pint from £3.90, <a href=\"https://www.beerheadz.biz/\">beerheadz.biz</a></em></p> <h2>Malt Cross</h2> <p>A stone’s throw from Nottingham’s Old Market Square (fun fact: the UK’s largest public square after London’s Trafalgar), this architecturally stunning Victorian music hall is now a not-for-profit cafe-bar and event space operated by Nottinghamshire YMCA. The suitably named Malt Cross is also a keen supporter of craft beers. Its selection takes in national scene leaders such as Marble, Kernel and Verdant, with Nottingham’s Liquid Light, in particular, well represented on keg (the Malt was pouring Veloria, a blueberry and lemon sour radler, at the time of writing), and in several canned options. <br>• <em>Pint from £3.80, <a href=\"https://maltcross.com/\">maltcross.com</a></em></p> <h2>Kean’s Head</h2> <p>Nottingham’s Castle Rock started brewing in 1997 and, as a pub group, has enthusiastically supported the rise of modern craft ales. Its US-influenced, hoppy Harvest Pale was stylistically pioneering and, in its pubs, Castle Rock has always featured its beers alongside those of its international brewing peers. Its beer cafe, the <strong>Barley Twist</strong> (91 Carrington St), or the <strong>Canal</strong><strong>house</strong> (a pub with an actual canal running through it, 48-52 Canal St) would be worthy additions to this guide in their own right. However, the one-roomed Kean’s Head by Saint Mary’s Church, in Nottingham’s historic Lace Market district, is a place of pilgrimage for beer lovers. A screen whirring through 14 pages of bottles and cans gives you an indication of its range, even before you include six cask and 18 keg lines. In the kitchen, Paajis knocks out great food, too; try the Punjabi samosa chaat. <br>• <em>Pint from £3.90, <a href=\"https://www.castlerockbrewery.co.uk/\">castlerockbrewery.co.uk</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/15/10-best-uk-foodie-pubs-with-rooms-renovated\">The inn crowd: 10 of the UK’s best renovated foodie pubs with rooms</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The Angel</h2> <p>This large and busy boho hang-out in Nottingham’s hip Hockley enclave is both brewpub and music venue; you’ll find shelves of vinyl, reel-to-reel tape machinesand a gig space, the Chapel, that once hosted the Arctic Monkeys, upstairs. Alongside beers from Northern Monk or Glen Affric, expect to see the Angel’s own four-grain pale Exodus, Archangel IPA, and the nicely citrussy Genesis pale on the bar.

They are packed with beers from hot-tip breweries (Birmingham’s Dig, Derbyshire’s Bang the Elephant, Edinburgh sour specialists Vault City) covering every beer style imaginable, from dessert-inspired pastry stouts to lightly salty gose beers. If you want a 10% New England IPA from Dutch brewery Moersleutel, you are in the right place.

The scheme is due to be introduced from the autumn across the UK, at an initial cost of £6m.</p> <p>A Home Office data protection impact assessment (DPIA) from August 2021, obtained by the charity Privacy International through a freedom of information request, assessed the impact of the smartwatch technology before contracting a supplier. In the documents, seen by the Guardian, the Home Office says the scheme will involve “daily monitoring of individuals subject to immigration control”, with the requirement to wear either a fitted ankle tag or a smartwatch, carried with them at all times.</p> <p>Those obliged to wear the devices will need to complete periodic monitoring checks throughout the day by taking a photograph of themselves on a smartwatch, with information including their names, date of birth, nationality and photographs stored for up to six years. Locations will be tracked “24/7, allowing trail monitoring data to be recorded”.</p> <p>Photographs taken using the smartwatches will be cross-checked against biometric facial images on Home Office systems and if the image verification fails, a check must be performed manually.</p> <p>The data will be shared with the Home Office, MoJ and the police, with Home Office officials adding: “The sharing of this data [to] police colleagues is not new.”</p> <p>The number of devices to be produced and the cost of each smartwatch was redacted in the contract and there is no mention of risk assessments to determine whether it is appropriate to monitor vulnerable or at-risk asylum seekers.</p> <p>The Home Office says the smartwatch scheme will be for foreign-national offenders who have been convicted of a criminal offence, rather than other groups, such as asylum seekers.</p> <p>However, it is expected that those obliged to wear the smartwatches will be subject to similar conditions to those fitted with GPS ankle tags, with references in the DPIA to curfews and inclusion and exclusion zones.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/electronic-monitoring-a-progress-update/\">National Audit Office report</a> in June, the government said it “regards electronic monitoring as a cost-effective alternative to custody, which contributes to its goals to protect the public and reduce reoffending”.</p> <p>Campaigners say 24-hour surveillance of asylum seekers breaches human rights, and may have a detrimental impact on migrants’ health and wellbeing.</p> <p>Lucie Audibert, a lawyer and legal officer for Privacy International, said: “Facial recognition is known to be an imperfect and dangerous technology that tends to discriminate against people of colour and marginalised communities. These ‘innovations’ in policing and surveillance are often driven by private companies, who profit from governments’ race towards total surveillance and control of populations.</p> <p>“Through their opaque technologies and algorithms, they facilitate government discrimination and human rights abuses without any accountability. No other country in Europe has deployed this dehumanising and invasive technology against migrants.”</p> <p>Dr Monish Bhatia, a lecturer in criminology at Birkbeck, University of London, said: “Electronic monitoring is an intrusive technology of control. Some individuals develop symptoms of anxiety, depression, suicide ideation and overall deterioration of mental health.</p> <p>“The Home Office is still not clear how long individuals will remain on monitoring. They have not provided any evidence to show why electronic monitoring is necessary or demonstrated that tags make individuals comply with immigration rules better. What we need is humane, non-degrading, community-based solutions.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A Home Office spokesperson said a “portable biometrically accessed device” would soon be introduced to complement the existing fitted device, or ankle tag.</p> <p>“The public expects us to monitor convicted foreign-national offenders and to suggest this contract applies to asylum seekers who have arrived via illegal means is simply wrong.

It even became the subject of a highly fictionalised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/12/the-two-popes-anthony-hopkins-and-jonathan-pryce-divine-in-papal-faceoff\">bromance movie</a>, starring Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce.</p> <p>But three popes? That prospect was raised by Pope Francis last weekend when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/pope-francis-says-canada-trip-showed-he-may-need-to-retire\">told reporters</a> on his return to Rome after a penitential visit to Canada that the “door is open” to his retirement. It would not be a catastrophe, he said.</p> <p>His comments, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/30/pope-francis-says-canada-trip-showed-he-may-need-to-retire\">at the end of a testing six-day trip</a> during which the Holy Father was seen using variously a wheelchair a walker and a cane, were not the first time Francis has hinted at retirement.</p> <p>Almost as soon as he was elected, in March 2013 at the age of 76, Francis began alluding to a time when he would no longer be pope – either because of death or retirement.</p> <p>His health – which has been a concern since he had a lung removed as a teenager – has deteriorated in recent years. He has sciatica, and last year he underwent major surgery to remove a section of his large intestine. It required six hours of general anaesthesia, which caused lasting side-effects, and a 10-day stay in hospital. That, <a href=\"https://aleteia.org/2022/05/24/i-dont-want-surgery-pope-declares-in-discussing-knee/\">he said</a>, lay behind his reluctance to undergo further surgery to repair a strained ligament in his right knee, despite the near-constant pain it causes.</p> <p>The papal biographer Austen Ivereigh said: “From very soon after he was elected, Francis said that Pope Benedict’s resignation had changed the institution of the papacy and that all popes from now on would need to reflect on whether they should stand down for reasons of frailty.</p> <p>“Modern popes do a lot of gruelling and demanding travel. The extrovert nature of the contemporary papacy means endless meetings and crowd gatherings, and a certain level of fitness is required.</p> <p>“Plus modern medicine means you can carry on living in a frail state in a way that you couldn’t before. Being elected for life now needs to be understood as: so long as you have vitality.”</p> <p>On stepping down, Benedict took the title of pope emeritus. He has continued to wear the incumbent’s traditional white cassock, and lives within the Vatican at the Mater Ecclesiae monastery. Francis has already indicated that he would take the title of emeritus bishop of Rome, live quietly outside the Vatican, and eschew the papal white robes.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, in a television interview, Francis described his predecessor as “saintly and discreet”. But, he added: “In future, things should be delineated more, or things should be made more explicit.”</p> <p>The existence of two popes has not always been easy. Ivereigh said: “When the emeritus pontificate was created, effectively as a new institution, the fear was it would be confusing, it could act as a focus of opposition or contrast with the existing pope.</p> <p>“I don’t think Benedict himself has done anything to fuel that. But I think he’s allowed a kind of court around him. There have been many instances where the pope emeritus has effectively been manipulated in the service of traditionalist agendas. It creates a sense there is a rivalry.</p> <p>“Francis has been incredibly patient about this and it hasn’t appeared to have bothered him – but I think he’s very much taken note of it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the short term, Francis is likely to further reduce foreign travel, although he has announced a visit to Kazakhstan in September and is keen to reschedule a trip to South Sudan that was postponed earlier this year on medical advice.</p> <p>A decision on retirement would come after deep reflection and discernment, and would probably wait until Benedict – now 95 and extremely frail – had died, said Ivereigh.</p> <p>“Every papal transition is traumatic. But Francis will know when the church needs fresh energy and renewal. He will find the right time.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/04/american-imprisoned-venezuela-biden-release","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"Family of American imprisoned by Venezuela begs Biden administration to bring him home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/04/american-imprisoned-venezuela-biden-release","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/04/american-imprisoned-venezuela-biden-release","fields":{"headline":"Family of American imprisoned by Venezuela begs Biden administration to bring him home","trailText":"Eyvin Hernandez, a Los Angeles public defender, was jailed while on vacation. ‘Please do something,’ his mother said","byline":"Sam Levin in Los Angeles","body":"<p>The family of a Los Angeles man detained in Venezuela earlier this year is publicly appealing to the US government to help secure his release, fearing he could be held longterm as a political bargaining chip.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/29/california-returns-beachfront-property-taken-black-couple-bruces-beach\">California returns beachfront property taken from Black couple in 1920s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eyvin Hernandez, a 44-year-old lawyer and criminal justice advocate in LA, was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-american-prisoners-jailed-3a3db814884bd4bcc6666596a5389759\">picked up</a> by Venezuelan security forces on 31 March near the Colombia-Venezuela border and is facing “criminal association” and “conspiracy” charges, his family says.</p> <p>Hernandez is known in California for his longtime work as a public defender representing low-income defendants and his mentorship of new attorneys and students.</p> <p>“I beg the US government to do something for my son,” Ana Sandoval, Hernandez’s mother, pleaded in tears. “Me and my whole family are devastated.

He grew up in a working class neighborhood in South Central LA, his mother working as a housecleaner and nanny and his father as a caterer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Growing up in LA in the 1980s and 1990s and witnessing racial and social injustices ... motivated him to give back to his community</p> <footer> <cite>Drew Havens</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When friends and cousins asked him to hang out in high school, “He always said, ‘I can’t, I have to study,’ and he studied a lot,” his mother recalled.</p> <p>Hernandez was accepted to the University of California, Los Angeles, earning a degree in physics and mathematics before graduating from UCLA’s law school in 2005. “Instead of him getting a job where he can make a lot of money, he decided to become a public defender so he can help the community,” she said.</p> <p>Gladdys Uribe, a mentee of Hernandez at UCLA, described him as a “quiet leader” dedicated to service: “He’s always been guided by a very strong sense of justice and an ambition to represent indigent and immigrant and vulnerable populations. A law degree was never the road to riches or status for him, it was always about being a voice for those who don’t have one.” She added: “He’d kill me for saying this, but he really is the embodiment of the American dream.”</p> <p>At UCLA, he pushed for diversity: “There is an abysmal number of Latinos who go to law school, and he made sure I wasn’t feeling too isolated or overwhelmed,” Uribe said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84099c3815a889f2d65edd20f0eec0fa5b3c7cf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84099c3815a889f2d65edd20f0eec0fa5b3c7cf4/0_479_954_1190/802.jpg\" alt=\"four people posing for a photograph in which to men are standing at the back and a woman and a young man are sitting in front of them\" width=\"802\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry Martinez (top right) next to his brother Eyvin Hernandez, and with their mother, Ana Sandoval, and another brother. “My son is an honest man.

If he felt that his clients were being mistreated, he was very vocal,” said Traci Blackburn, a head deputy in the office.</p> <p>Hernandez also loves to travel, visiting dozens of countries over the years, his family said. He took time off in March to travel to Colombia and work on a novel he has been writing, inspired by his family’s migration, his brother said. </p> <h2><strong>Wrongful detentions a ‘global threat’</strong></h2> <p>It’s unclear how or why Hernandez was detained. The Colombia-Venezuela border has seen a dramatic <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/28/colombia/venezuela-border-area-abuses-armed-groups\">increase</a> in armed conflict in recent years, and the US state department has classified it as a high risk area where Americans are threatened with detention under the regime of the authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c025977bb18cb605e4483a1bb5c2fb573a98d91f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c025977bb18cb605e4483a1bb5c2fb573a98d91f/0_88_527_552/477.jpg\" alt=\"A group of people posing in front of a large gorilla-like figure\" width=\"477\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hernandez with his brother and niece on a trip to the Empire State building in New York City.

Venezuela subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/venezuela-releases-two-americans-energy-crisis\">released two jailed Americans</a>, and experts say it appears the White House and Maduro were attempting to improve relations amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting energy crisis.</p> <p>But Hernandez and another American were arrested soon after, in separate incidents. “The arrests come at a time when detainees are being leveraged in the context of negotiations between the countries to change policy,” said Brian Fonseca, director of the Institute for Public Policy at Florida International University and an expert on Venezuela. “But it further strains negotiations at a time when the Biden administration has signaled a willingness to engage. And the US has to think about how it wants to engage, because they don’t want to inspire more detainments.”</p> <p>There has been an alarming increase in wrongful detentions of Americans around the globe and in Venezuela in recent years, according to the James Foley Foundation, a US organization which tracks cases and assists families.</p> <p>“This isn’t just a citizen or two here or there, but a threat globally and a threat to our foreign policy, because it holds our government hostage,” said Diane Foley, whose son James, a journalist, was kidnapped and executed in Syria in 2012. She said the spike in cases could be due in part to increased reporting, adding, “This is becoming an increasingly complex problem. And what’s frightening now is that it seems to be a deliberate tactic of state actors.”</p> <h2><strong>‘He tries to reassure us’</strong></h2>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This isn’t just a citizen or two here or there, but a threat globally and a threat to our foreign policy, because it holds our government hostage</p> <footer> <cite>Diane Foley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hernandez’s family spoke out days after the Biden administration offered a deal to Russia to bring home jailed basketball star, Brittney Griner.</p> <p>Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for the International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention organization, said US intervention was critical for Hernandez: “Once you’re a prisoner of the Venezuelan state, it gets very complicated. There’s no independent judiciary or authority you can appeal to.”</p> <p>If Venezuela were treating the cases of detained Americans as unlawful entry, the country could expel them, but the country is pursuing much more serious charges, Gunson said, adding that some people can be held months or years without a trial, in effect turning them into hostages. While foreigners are less likely to face physical torture, they are often malnourished and denied medical care while in prison.</p> <p>Hernandez’s family is in contact with state department officials and<strong> </strong>has reached out to his elected representatives in California, but have gotten limited responses. The family is urging the US to formally designate him as wrongfully detained, which would direct resources to the case through the special envoy for hostage affairs.</p> <p>Foley, whose foundation has independently classified Hernandez as wrongfully detained, said it was vital that the US follow suit: “We’ve found that the longer people are held, the harder it is.” She praised Biden’s recent <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/07/19/executive-order-on-bolstering-efforts-to-bring-hostages-and-wrongfully-detained-united-states-nationals-home/\">executive order</a> to strengthen efforts to bring wrongful detainees home while also pushing to deter detentions through sanctions and other punishments against people responsible for the detentions. “Families are desperate and I think the Biden administration is recognizing this as a problem.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62e835d7f81ea78403d4fa4bd1cc890b4ef92ac3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62e835d7f81ea78403d4fa4bd1cc890b4ef92ac3/0_114_1707_2135/800.jpg\" alt=\"Man feeding a baby on his lap through a bottle\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hernandez, pictured with his nephew, told his family on a recent call from detention that he hoped the US special envoy for hostage affairs would take on his case.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Eyvin Hernandez’s family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A US state department spokesperson confirmed Hernandez’s arrest, saying, “We take seriously our commitment to assist US citizens abroad.

Spokespeople for California senators Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein said their offices were aware of the case, but declined to comment further. Congresswoman Karen Bass’ office did not respond to inquiries.</p> <p>Hernandez’s family has lost contact with an initial lawyer who had reached out, though Hernandez has recently been able to have brief phone calls with his family a few times a week.

There’s a lot more committed by Asian males than any other ethnicity.”</p> <p>Another of the 32 officers who talked in depth for the study said: “I’ve tended to find that the Asian community on the division are more likely to be obstructive and less likely to take the advice.”</p> <p>Turner said: “There is no evidence of ethnic minority groups more visibly flouting the rules than other groups. There was unwitting discrimination built into the processes of the organisation. None of the officers said anything they felt was outlandish in terms of bias.”</p> <p>Officers talked of issuing fines based less on the risk of rule breaking spreading the disease, and more because they felt people were not respecting their authority. Turner said: “There was not a lot of focus on the risk from the disease. It was: ‘There are these people flouting the rules and not accepting our authority to make them follow the rules.’”</p> <p>Andy George, the president of the National Black Police Association, said: “Of course there was bias there in how they interact with communities.

It should delight fans and newcomers alike","byline":"Rebecca Nicholson","body":"<p>It has taken 30 years for an adaptation of The Sandman (Netflix), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/30/neil-gaiman-sandman-netflix-interview\">Neil Gaiman</a>’s celebrated comic-book series, to make it to the screen, and little wonder. It is a big, bold story of gods and demons, so deep and rich that the idea of cramming its wonders into 10 episodes seems borderline ludicrous. Yet this is the era of megabudget fantasy television, with the imminent arrival of a small-screen Lord of the Rings and the return of the Game of Thrones universe in House of the Dragon. With its debut season, The Sandman can stand proudly among them, albeit as their moody goth older brother.</p> <p>The first couple of episodes exist firmly in the realm of fantasy. The notes I took when watching include “Patton Oswalt is crow?”. It’s that kind of show, and it immerses you in its world immediately, setting the Sandman off on his journey of discovery. It begins in 1916, when Lord Morpheus, or Dream, or the Sandman, or Lord Morpheus, Dream of the Endless, to give him his pedigree name (a sinewy Robert Smith type, played with breathy sulkiness by Tom Sturridge), is mistakenly captured by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/19/charles-dance-game-of-thrones-interview\">Charles Dance</a>’s sinister – and Dance is very good at sinister – magus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e32fee285ab09111b359a5aa2975e0333c5529b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e32fee285ab09111b359a5aa2975e0333c5529b/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sinister … Charles Dance as Roderick Burgess in episode one.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sinister … Charles Dance as Roderick Burgess in episode one.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Miller/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The magus wants to harness Death’s power to indulge in a spot of necromancy and revive his favourite son, who was killed in wartime. Instead, he ends up with Dream, and traps him naked in a glass sphere in his basement. For a while, the period setting feels a bit dark Downton Abbey, but it soon becomes clear that this is far too expansive to stick to one era or genre. Throughout the series, time flies, and slows, and we leap through different periods and cities and realms. It all feels like rather a lot, but it works well.</p> <p>Partly, that is because the pace is meditative, not frantic. Once the scene-setting and world-building has been done, it has the confidence to take its time over the big stuff. I am sure plenty of viewers will love its more fantastical elements, from a battle of imaginations with Lucifer (Gwendoline Christie) to a cute mythical creature called Gregory, but I found its finest moments in the more human, conversational, emotional strands. Jenna Coleman is strong as the messy, tough Johanna Constantine, a contraction of John and Johanna into one character (or two), whose nightmares are matched only by her exorcist duties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa106100929f7498678cd596f0a19c9e4c2a1b98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa106100929f7498678cd596f0a19c9e4c2a1b98/0_0_3600_1506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanjeev Bhaskar as Cain in episode two of The Sandman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"418\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nothing unnatural … Sanjeev Bhaskar as Cain in episode two of The Sandman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The big cast is largely excellent, with an impressive ability to deliver lines that could have sounded overly literary or convoluted, or both, in ways that sound neither woolly nor unnatural. Vivienne Acheampong as Dream’s right-hand man Lucienne, Boyd Holbrook as the gruesome walking nightmare Corinthian, and Kirby Howell-Baptiste as an empathic, big-hearted Death, are all fantastic. I spent some time mildly irritated at the idea that Joely Richardson, 57, could be cast as the mother of David Thewlis, 59, until I was reminded that in this world where teeth can replace eyeballs and getting sand in your eyes is far more troublesome than your typical trip to the beach, something as trivial as age is bound to be explained eventually. It is, and my outrage retreated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/30/neil-gaiman-sandman-netflix-interview\">‘I can’t do superheroes, but I can do gods’: Neil Gaiman on comics, diversity and casting Death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thewlis is brilliant as John Dee, naive and cruel and earnest and cynical, and he gets to lead the best episode of the lot. After an eerie car journey that plays out like a film of its own, Dee spends a day and night in a diner, experimenting on its staff and patrons by nudging them towards a policy of being honest. Each person’s feelings are teased to the surface, and it is horrible and mesmerising and thrilling, with an uncanny, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/08/twin-peaks-david-lynch-television\">Twin Peaks</a>-ish feel. This is surely a contender for best episode of the year, of any TV drama, and the point at which The Sandman really finds its feet.</p> <p>Yet it is engrossing from the start. It is transportive, playful at times, and certainly grand. But above all, it is dark. Bodies explode, limbs are severed, and demons crawl out of the mouths of professional footballers, fist-first. Nestled in among its more grotesque spectacles, though, is an emotional depth that elevates this far beyond the usual “let’s see what we can blow the CGI budget on” fantasy fodder. Given the source material, that’s no wonder. For fans, it may well turn out to have been worth the long wait, but for newcomers to the Sandman’s world, there is plenty to discover.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/05/al-qaida-chiefs-killing-comes-as-group-gains-ground-in-african-conflict-zones","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T05:00:36Z","webTitle":"Al-Qaida chief’s killing comes as group gains ground in African conflict zones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/al-qaida-chiefs-killing-comes-as-group-gains-ground-in-african-conflict-zones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/05/al-qaida-chiefs-killing-comes-as-group-gains-ground-in-african-conflict-zones","fields":{"headline":"Al-Qaida chief’s killing comes as group gains ground in African conflict zones","trailText":"UN says terror organisation, whose affiliate recently attacked Mali’s most important military base, ‘is once again the leader of global jihad’","byline":"Jason Burke","body":"<p>It was one of Ayman al-Zawahiri’s last victories.

Instead, he directed al-Qaida’s regional commanders to seek gains locally, without being distracted by attempts to attack international aviation or bomb European cities.</p> <p>The recent UN report warned that any territory carved out by al-Qaida or IS might be used as launchpads for such operations in the near future.</p> <p>“The threat from IS and al-Qaida remains relatively low in non-conflict zones, but is much higher in areas directly affected by conflict or neighbouring it. Unless some of these conflicts are brought to a successful resolution … one or more of them will incubate an external operational capability for Isil [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant], al-Qaida or a related terrorist group,” it said.</p> <p>Progress made in Mali vindicated another part of Zawahiri’s strategy: to build grassroots support. The grievances of marginalised communities could be exploited, particularly where government was weak or predatory, he told leaders of affiliates after taking control of al-Qaida in 2011. Strong ties could be built with local actors through collaboration and even inter-marriage. If they used violence, affiliates needed to seek targets that would be seen as legitimate.</p> <p>The strategy predated the rise of IS from 2014, but the success of the rival group added impetus. Where IS relied on fear and coercion to cow local populations, al-Qaida sought to appear as moderate in comparison.</p> <p>Al-Qaida has suffered major setbacks – almost eliminated in Syria and Iraq and unable to compete with IS in some theatres, such as Nigeria and Egypt’s Sinai desert.</p> <p>But in Africa particularly Zawahiri’s strategy has paid off. The late leader personally concluded an alliance with al-Shabaab, the extremist movement which controls much of Somalia’s rural areas and can field a force of thousands. In July 500 al-Shabaab fighters <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/us-warns-al-shabab-attack-on-ethiopia-not-a-fluke/6677868.html\">took on Ethiopian troops</a> in an unprecedented cross-border incursion. The Somali affiliate is also wealthy enough to send millions of dollars to the al-Qaida central leadership, intelligence suggests.</p> <p>Deep problems caused by competition for resources due to climate change, political instability, massive displacement of population and the recent withdrawal of French troops from Mali offer al-Qaida opportunities for further expansion, analysts say.</p> <p>Al -Qaida’s affiliate in Mali, Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), has been quick to exploit the presence of the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company with links to the Kremlin hired to support the country’s embattled military.</p> <p>Wagner has been repeatedly accused of systematic human rights abuses, including massacres of civilians, which turn local communities against the government and build support for extremists.</p> <p>The attack on the Kati base outside Bamako was a response to governmental collaboration with the Wagner Group, JNIM said.</p> <p>“We say to the Bamako government: if you have the right to hire mercenaries to kill the defenceless innocent people, then we have the right to destroy you and target you,” the group explained in a statement translated by the SITE Intelligence Group.</p> <p>Gen Stephen J Townsend, commander of the US Africa Command, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/special-online-briefing-with-general-stephen-j-townsend-commander-u-s-africa-command-u-s-africom/\">told reporters last week </a>that JNIM were “on the march towards the south”.</p> <p>“They are now nearly investing … Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso’s capital, and they are starting operations now in the … border regions of the coastal states. So this is of great concern, I think, for the world that’s watching,” he said.</p> <p>In north Africa, al-Qaida still has a presence but has been largely squeezed out of Libya and Tunisia as the chaos seen earlier in the decade has calmed.</p> <p>Its affiliate in Yemen, though also weaker than before, still exists and has long been considered by western security experts a potential threat. Outside Africa, the biggest gains have been made in Afghanistan.</p> <p>“The Taliban victory has very predictably strengthened al-Qaida’s hand … That is simply a fact,” said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, CEO of the US-based threat analysis firm Valens Global.</p> <p>Al-Qaida has built deep relationships with key factions and senior members of the Taliban who, though divided, appear prepared to offer the group a safe haven on certain conditions.

Although thankfully not as hot as it has been, the heat has temporarily defeated me and I have downed my spade for a rest.</p> <p>Our farm is part of Defra’s sustainable farming incentive (SFI) pilot, and we have several actions that we have to complete under this scheme. The SFI is one of three new environmental land-management schemes introduced since we left the EU. As part of the pilot I have to assess the soils on our farm.</p> <p>Today I am collecting soil samples to be sent to a laboratory to be analysed, and counting earthworms. In each field I have to dig 10 holes and remove a small sample of soil, then mix these samples together to provide my sample for that field, and bag it up ready to be posted. I also have to dig 10 larger holes looking for earthworms.</p> <p>Once I have dug the earthworm holes, the soil is spread out on an old feed bag and the earthworms removed, counted and categorised. I have photos of different types of worms and I am categorising them into epigenic (litter dwelling), endogenic (topsoil) and anecic (deep burrowing) worms.</p> <p>I am enjoying sorting and handling the worms, but all the digging on a hot day is exhausting, which is why I am lying in the grass looking at the sky. We have tested soils before on the farm, but this year will be the first time that we have to produce a written nutrient management plan.</p> <p>Later in the year, another of Defra’s post-Brexit schemes – the animal health and welfare pathway – will help us do a yearly review of animal health on the farm with our vet. Sometimes it feels as if everything is changing, but looking around at the landscape with my sheep and fell ponies grazing on the hillside, everything looks reassuringly familiar. I am disturbed from this blue-sky thinking by my phone ringing. A local farm has surplus bales of hay, do we want to buy them?</p> <p>We normally have enough of our own, but this extra will give peace of mind. Hastily I arrange to meet my neighbour to load it into our 18th-century barn. There will just be enough time to do that before I meet some of the Defra staff online to discuss how the scheme is going.</p> <p>• Country Diary is on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdncountrydiary?lang=en\" title=\"\">@gdncountrydiary</a></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/aug/05/sydney-morning-herald-slips-up-on-shape-of-water-nonsense","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-05T04:28:58Z","webTitle":"Sydney Morning Herald slips up on shape of water ‘nonsense’ | Weekly Beast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/05/sydney-morning-herald-slips-up-on-shape-of-water-nonsense","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/aug/05/sydney-morning-herald-slips-up-on-shape-of-water-nonsense","fields":{"headline":"Sydney Morning Herald slips up on shape of water ‘nonsense’ ","trailText":"Sunday Life story about the health benefits of ‘structured water’ is withdrawn over conflict of interest.

De facto it does, but legally it is less clear. Lendon writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), a country’s territorial boundaries extend 12 nautical miles (22.2km) from its coastline. The area above is considered the country’s territorial airspace. China is a signatory to Unclos, signing on 10 December, 1982, and ratifying it in 1996. Taiwan is not. </p> \n   <p>Most countries in the world do not <strong>recognise</strong> Taiwan as an independent country. However, Drew Thompson, visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore and a former US Defense Department official, said most of the world <strong>treated</strong> Taiwan as if it were an independent country – and for that reason, it should be considered as having its own airspace.</p> \n   <p>“Under that principle, then perhaps we decide that international law applies, in which case Taiwan’s airspace extends to 12 miles beyond its baseline. Beyond the 12-mile limit is international waters, international airspace,” he added.</p> \n   <p>Thompson said there was also a matter of precedent and that even China’s military appeared to tacitly recognise this.</p> \n   <p>Despite the “fact that the PLA doesn’t recognise Taiwan, they’ve respected Taiwan’s airspace,” he said. Chinese commercial aviation companies also respected Taiwan’s airspace, Thompson said, recognising a “convention that effectively treats Taiwan as independent under civil aviation guidelines.”</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62eb89bf8f08b58de97ec615\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T08:59:38.257Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Global Times, which is a Chinese state media outlet, has published this video, which purports to show China launching missiles earlier today aimed at the waters around Taiwan.

more details surrounding comments made by the <strong>Association of Southeast Asian Nations</strong> as foreign ministers meet in Cambodia today.</p> \n  <p>Foreign ministers from the 10-member bloc have called for “maximum restraint” regarding the Taiwan Strait, warning the situation could lead to “serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers.”</p> \n  <p>The bloc, which is currently gathering in Phnom Penh, said in a joint statement that it is “concerned with the international and regional volatility, especially in the recent development in the area adjacent with the Asean region, which could destabilise the region and eventually could lead to miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers.”</p> \n  <p>“Asean calls for maximum restraint, refrain from provocative action,” it added, without mentioning the US or China by name.</p> \n  <p>Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and his American counterpart Antony Blinken are both visiting Cambodia for talks with Asean ministers. However, they reportedly have no plans to meet together.</p> \n  <p>While some Asean members, including host country Cambodia, have close ties to Beijing, others are concerned by China’s growing assertiveness, including in the South China Sea.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The world is in dire need of wisdom and responsibility of all leaders to uphold multilateralism and partnership, cooperation, peaceful-coexistence and healthy competition for our shared goals of peace, stability, security and inclusive and sustainable development,” the Asean statement said. It also reiterated “Asean member states’ support for their respective One-China Policy”.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62eb4f8b8f08b58de97ec488\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T04:49:46.352Z\">5.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>We have a little more detail on how <strong>Taiwan is responding to the drills </strong>which began just after midday on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>Ten minutes before the drills were due to begin, Taiwan’s department of defence issued a statement accusing the Chinese government of “irrational behaviour” with its live-fire exercises. </p> \n  <p>The exercises had “the intention of changing the status quo and disrupting regional peace and stability”, it said.</p> \n  <p>“The national army will continue to strengthen its alert, and troops at all levels will conduct daily training.” </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MoNDefense/status/1555046182472536065\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ROCArmdForces?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ROCArmdForces</a> are operating as usual and monitor our surroundings in response to irrational activities from PRC, aiming for changing the status quo &amp; destabilizing the region's security.

blamed failure to recruit women and to deliver a national integrity commission as causes for defeat.</p> <p>The review, conducted by the former federal director Brian Loughnane and shadow finance minister Jane Hume, is probing the Coalition’s worst result in 70 years, in which it lost 18 seats, including six heartland Liberal seats to independents.</p> <p>The Young Liberals noted the Morrison

Now we have a new government with a more ambitious climate policy and that helps us enormously.”</p> \n<p>Pulch also praised “Australia’s very proactive engagement with Ukraine against Russia’s military aggression”, which wasn’t necessarily expected from such a geographically remote country. The prime minister Anthony Albanese’s participation in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/29/nations-must-work-together-through-conflict-and-crisis-to-reduce-climate-change-risks-albanese-tells-oecd\">the recent Nato summit</a> and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/03/australian-pm-anthony-albanese-visits-sites-of-alleged-russian-atrocities-in-ukraine\">visit to Kyiv</a> were politically important, Pulch said.</p> \n<p>“Opposing autocratic regimes imposing their will on neighbours is something everyone with our values system should stand against,” he said.</p> \n<p>“This creates a lot of goodwill in Europe.”</p> \n<p>The “reset” of the relationship with France also played a role, he said.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Recent events also showed the need for both countries to diversify their trade relations, Pulch said.

Chinese press condemned the US, suggesting it was a breach of the “one-China principle” and that Joe Biden was “hypocritical” in saying he was unable to rein in the House speaker. For a few days, this message echoed across the country’s news outlets.</p> <p>The fury resonated online through the writings of pundits and military bloggers. “The old witch,” some called Pelosi. “The old American woman,” others referred to her. Hu Xijin, a nationalist firebrand and former editor of the Global Times, even advised Chinese jets to obstruct Pelosi’s plane. And “if those are still ineffective, I think it is OK too to shoot down Pelosi’s plane”, he wrote, to much fanfare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/03/taiwan-nancy-pelosi-visit-ukraine-us\">In Taiwan, as in Ukraine, the west is flirting with disaster | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Chinese society today, such nationalistic rhetoric often creates an echo chamber, especially on issues related to China’s sovereignty. Beijing considers Taiwan a part of China’s own territory. Generations of Chinese leaders have wanted to “take it back”, and they have not renounced the option of a military takeover as a last resort.</p> <p>For a few days, Weibo hashtags criticising Pelosi and reiterating China’s resolve in deterring her remained some of the top trending topics. In the days that followed, a slew of defiant statements appeared in almost all official outlets. China’s foreign ministry spokespeople, who have been known for their “wolf warrior” style in recent years, continued to talk tough, and many commenters responded well to their harsh anti-American rhetoric.</p> <p>“The will of the people cannot be defied, and those who play with fire will perish by it,” Zhao Lijian declared, echoing the warning of his president, Xi Jinping, to Biden last week. “It is believed the US side is fully aware of China’s strong and clear message.” His boss, Hua Chunying, also invoked the memories of Mao Zedong, who in 1946 called America a “paper tiger”: “In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1553051976727937024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here’s the authentic origin and definition of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PaperTiger?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PaperTiger</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/yey0mvAKYO\">pic.twitter.com/yey0mvAKYO</a></p>&mdash; Hua Chunying 华春莹 (@SpokespersonCHN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpokespersonCHN/status/1553051976727937024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 29, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The mood intensified following a warning from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). When news of Pelosi’s visit was first leaked, the PLA was preparing for the celebration of its 95th founding anniversary. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as Pelosi embarked on her tour of Asia, the military vowed again that it would “not sit idly by” if the US politician eventually touched down in Taiwan.</p> <p>Then on Tuesday night, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit-speaker-pledges-us-solidarity-tsai-in-wen-china-military-drills\">Pelosi appeared in Taipei</a>. By then, Hu’s bellicose post suggesting downing her flight had been deleted by Twitter for violating rules. “Taiwan is close to the Chinese mainland and Beijing has sufficient cards at hand,” Hu said, shortly after the 82-year-old California democrat arrived. “We will play them one by one confidently. The PLA is announcing a series of actions.”</p> <p>It was also a huge event for China’s media operators, despite their hostility towards Pelosi. One state-owned website even set up a livestream on its official Weibo channel. At one point, 70 million viewers tuned in at the same time to watch Pelosi arriving in Taiwan, with many viewers responding by posting calls for “national reunification”.</p> <p>“Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan created a sense of unity on social media, which was flooded with comments expressing support for the Chinese military and calls for a unification with Taiwan,” said Manya Koetse, who runs WhatsOnWeibo website. “Multiple netizens also said: ‘I hope that when I wake up tomorrow, we’ll be unified with Taiwan.’ I’d never seen such strong unification sentiments on Weibo before this week.”</p> <p>Koetse added that frenzy around the Pelosi saga reminder her of last year’s return of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer from Canada. “Ahead of Meng’s arrival in China, there were days of buildup in rhetoric – just like this time around with Pelosi. But of course Meng was a symbol of national pride, but Pelosi was a humiliation to China.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"79111e7e065e38bf9e9e3e2c979e24a90265f461\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79111e7e065e38bf9e9e3e2c979e24a90265f461/0_48_5175_3105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A promotion for the People’s Liberation Army on a building in Beijing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A promotion for the People’s Liberation Army on a building in Beijing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having vowed to respond, the PLA announced it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/taiwan-preparing-for-war-without-seeking-war-as-china-begins-military-exercises\">conduct large-scale drills </a>and missile tests around the island of Taiwan from Thursday. State media said this was to show how reckless Pelosi had been. The military exercises have put Asia on edge and drew calls from Asian and European leaders to exercise restraint.</p> <p>Yet that was not enough for some. “I’m still angry! The four-day military exercise is too short. If a normalised round-the-island cruise is formed, I will admit that it is not a loss!” one Weibo user wrote. Another said. “If there is no follow-up action after the military exercise, then this time it is a complete failure of diplomacy and public opinion, and there is no point in saying too much.”</p> <p>They are not alone. A Beijing resident, who was only identified by his surname, Ou, said that when Taipei 101 lit up for Pelosi as a warm welcome, he saw it as a “huge humiliation for China”. “As a big nation with 1.4 billion people, we should not eat our words when it comes to uniting Taiwan,” he said. “We have the capability.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/china-taiwan-tensions-how-worried-should-we-be-about-military-conflict\">China-Taiwan tensions: how worried should we be about military conflict?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Jin Lihang*, a Taiwanese man who lives in Beijing, said he was worried. “It felt that Pelosi’s visit was exactly the kind of excuse the PLA was looking for to show what it would look like when the ‘military option’ is deployed in earnest one day. It seems the whole country may soon be on a war footing. This is scary.”</p> <p>The day before the drills began on Thursday, the Global Times quoted Herman Shuai, a retired Taiwan lieutenant general, saying the exercise areas were a “template” for “locking down Taiwan”. “This blockage [of Taiwan] could be part of action plans for future reunification-by-force operations,” he said.</p> <p>Hu, having failed to deter Pelosi through social media, is now under fire. To Ren Yi, another influential pro-government blogger, Hu’s militant tone is an embarrassment and sends a wrong message about Beijing’s real intention.</p> <p>“Hu Xijin’s longstanding rhetoric has made it clear that he loves war, desires war and is relentlessly promoting it, even at the expense of kidnapping our country’s credibility,” Ren, who goes by the nickname, Chairman Rabbit, wrote.</p> <p>“Hu Xijin harms the country and hurts the people.

I do love him but we started dating when we were very young and, although our thoughts and ideas align well as we have grown together, I still wonder if I could be better matched to someone else. I feel terrible for having these thoughts as I know he doesn’t. I know he will be an amazing husband and we can have a nice life together but I miss the passion of the early stages of a relationship.</strong></p> <p><strong> A new co-worker has started at my workplace and we have had some flirtatious moments.

Does this discontent lie within the relationship itself, or in what the commitment represents?

What can I do? | Leading questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That second kind of dissatisfaction, the loss of possibility, often envelops us in the lead-up to big commitments. Once we’ve settled on the big move, the career decision, the relationship milestone, a deflating sense of anticlimax can creep in. I think it’s because these moments mean our vision of how things <em>might </em>be starts to come into sharper resolution – we start to see how things really <em>will </em>be, and therefore, at the same time, what they won’t be. For every big choice we make we decline an alternative future. We say to ourselves that those doors are closed, and the versions of life that lie behind them will stay hushed and inanimate.</p> <p>That can be hard to stomach. Especially for the choices that take us from youthful things to grown-up things, from freedom to responsibility; they can make us feel as though we’re running out of possibilities. Sometimes that’s why flirtations have such kerosene power in moments of life transition – before a marriage, in midlife. It’s not so much that we’re transfixed by that particular other person but that we’re transfixed by getting to see ourselves, briefly, the way they do – as an unknown, as someone who crackles with possibility.</p> <p>It would be peculiar if you felt nothing like this as you approach your wedding. The whole point of getting married is that your life changes as a result. You promise to take another person’s wellbeing as seriously as your own. That’s a big decision about how your future looks (and how it doesn’t).</p> <p>But, if you really love someone, what on the surface looks like a “loss of possibility” should in fact feel like the exact opposite. True, monogamous marriage means you turn down the possibility of a new relationship, or the thrill of chemistry with a stranger, but what you get instead is the vast breadth of future that opens up between people who want to make a life together.</p> <p>When you really love each other, that seems expansive, not constraining. It makes you feel that there is more of you, and more of the world – more future; more possibility; more freedom – not less. This is one of the great mysteries of love and commitment – how we could, by taking on responsibilities to each other, come to feel more like ourselves.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/saved-for-later\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Saved for Later\" data-form-description=\"Weekly lifestyle and culture picks from Guardian Australia\" data-form-campaign-code=\"UK_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Get a week’s worth of must-reads, trends and pop-culture in your inbox\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the alterations that marriage asks of you already seem unwelcome and constricting, that’s when I would want to pause.

One line of inquiry is understood to be whether an illegal cannabis factory was operating inside the building, however it is not known whether any such activity is connected to the fire or to the victims.</p> <p>Hughes said: “Though we have reason to suspect that Cuong, Uoc, Duong and Nam may have been in the mill during the fire, we are keeping an open mind with regard to how many people were present and their whereabouts.

He helped Rihanna secure a career-defining hit with We Found Love, gave Cheryl her best song with Call My Name, and proved his pop prowess with Rita Ora’s I Will Never Let You Down.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMQuofsOOzo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eMQuofsOOzo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Then, in 2017, he pressed pause on the rave synths and body-quivering drops for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/30/calvin-harris-funk-wav-bounces-vol-1-review-edm-post-disco-rihanna-pharrell-solo-album\">Funk Wav Bounces Vol 1</a>. Featuring some of the world’s biggest pop and hip-hop stars – Frank Ocean, Pharrell Williams, Migos and Ariana Grande – it was a breezy, BBQ-ready slice of post-disco sunshine that flirted with 80s boogie and a light smattering of Parliament-Funkadelic.</p> <p>It was a mixed bag, though, its poolside sliders-and-sunglasses vibe often so relaxed it pushed into boredom. Still, the prospect of a followup volume piqued people’s interest. Even if the first volume was enjoyable but dull, Harris’s ability to draft in A-list talent was exciting. And Funk Wav Bounces Vol 2 delivers on that front. There’s a blinding amount of star power on display: Justin Timberlake, Halsey, 21 Savage, Dua Lipa, Normani, Pusha T and Busta Rhymes. Unfortunately, it has very little else to offer.</p> <p>Harris is playing in a similar retro sonic sandpit as on Vol 1, and it sounds lush: shimmering production and seductive guitars lace New Money, which features 21 Savage and the absurd lyric “Gucci garments / Kush smell like armpits”. Woman of the Year, a collaboration with Stefflon Don, Chlöe and Coi Leray, is a massage of a song, with the low bubble of an organ and the pulse of clavinet cushioning funk guitars and light percussion. New to You, which finds Tinashe, Normani and Offset battling for airtime, is a slinky blur of disco and boogie, the romantic crush of strings after the chorus providing a frisson of delight.</p> <p>The issue is that none of the songs that all this gorgeous production whirls around are actually any good. The biggest offender is closer Day One. After an opening reminiscent of the most innocuous of Ibiza chillout soundscapes, replete with electric pianos and wah-wah effects, Pharrell appears to sing on what has to be one of the worst songs of his career. The production is so sleepy that everything sounds off beat, while the melody is so limp and the vocal delivery so lifeless that you wonder whether Pharrell still had a pulse by the end.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFV6t4Dl_zQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FFV6t4Dl_zQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Similarly insipid is Stay With Me, which is another Pharrell collaboration although this time Justin Timberlake and Halsey are also clawing for your attention. With an echo of the sugary delights of Earth, Wind and Fire’s Let’s Groove, it should be a high point, yet the singers’ designated sections never quite slot together naturally, creating something sticky and awkward. As Halsey puts it on the under-baked chorus: “It’s a mess out here.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/28/calvin-harris-20-greatest-songs-ranked\">Calvin Harris’s 20 greatest songs – ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harris still has the capacity to engage. The neon-lit Somebody Else, with its swell of 80s guitars, offers a brilliant bit of late-night desperation, Jorja Smith and Lil Durk’s verses each aching with hurt and longing. Busta Rhymes provides the most animated guest appearance on Ready or Not, a beast of a G-Funk sundowner that, thanks to its dissonant synth chords, bongo drums, a good lashing of tambourine and Rhymes’s spitfire rapping, is vibrant and alive.</p> <p>But a couple of invigorating moments don’t absolve the album of its biggest sin: how dull it is. Funk Wav Bounces Vol 2 may often sound luxurious but there’s barely any substance. Unlike the spoils of his farming, Harris has crafted something that’s lacking in flavour.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/05/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-19-west-ham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T23:01:29Z","webTitle":"Premier League 2022-23 preview No 19: West Ham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/05/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-19-west-ham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/05/premier-league-2022-23-preview-no-19-west-ham","fields":{"headline":"Premier League 2022-23 preview No 19: West Ham","trailText":"The Hammers want to keep the top four in their sights but need the summer’s transfer spending to come off","byline":"Jacob Steinberg","body":"<p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted position</strong> 8th (NB: this is not necessarily Jacob Steinberg’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)</p> \n<p><strong>Last season’s position </strong>7th</p> \n<p><strong>Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) </strong>150-1</p> \n<h2>Prospects</h2> \n<p>The aim is to challenge for a place in the top four again. The question is whether West Ham have grown stale. They captured the imagination with their run to the Europa League semi-finals last season, but a small squad struggled to cope with the additional workload and David Moyes has spent the summer trying to add more quality in several positions.</p> \n<p>The positive is that West Ham have lessened their dependence on Michail Antonio, who looked weary during the second half of last season. The striker has had no competition for his place during the last 18 months, but the arrival of Gianluca Scamacca from Sassuolo gives Moyes’s attack a fresh look. A tall and powerful forward, Scamacca scored 16 goals in Serie A last season and has broken into the Italy squad. The 23-year-old has all the makings of a fan favourite, though the recent history of attacking players moving to the Premier League from Serie A is not hugely encouraging.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2d99be35-4dc4-427e-bac1-1d62251fd097\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Lam5pvzQmnk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the striking situation is not the only issue. Moyes needs more from Saïd Benrahma and Nikola Vlasic in attacking midfield. He will hope that Flynn Downes is capable of helping the overworked Tomas Soucek and Declan Rice in central midfield. As for the defence, all is not well. Nayef Aguerd, a Moroccan centre-back who has signed for £30m from Rennes, could be out for three months after undergoing ankle surgery. Angelo Ogbonna is just back from a long-term knee injury. Issa Diop wants to leave and Kurt Zouma picked up injuries last season. Another huge season for Craig “Ballon” Dawson, then?</p> \n<p>Of course, there is no need to panic yet. West Ham have made rapid progress in the last two years. But have opponents started to work them out? Moyes, who tore into his players after defeat to Brighton on the final day forced West Ham to settle for a place in the Europa Conference League, has sounded a little impatient recently. It could be a testing campaign.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2022/06/epl-preview/west-ham-united/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>The manager</h2> \n<p>Moyes has performed wonders since returning to the London Stadium. He has transformed a struggling team into top-six contenders, got a previously disgruntled crowd onside and taken the club on a dramatic European adventure. Gone are the days when West Ham were regarded as flaky pushovers. Moyes has made them resilient and hard to beat, but he has also succeeded in making his side fun to watch and capable of scoring against anyone. The perception of the Scot as a tactical dinosaur has been shown up as nonsense. Moyes has grown as a manager and is busy developing a solid culture at West Ham. However, there are slight concerns over some of the club’s recent recruitment. There have been some questionable signings recently and West Ham need Moyes to be sharper in the transfer market if they are going to maintain their rise.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9fb75e7c68e23d0a8defb2e95890bcc15597a76c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fb75e7c68e23d0a8defb2e95890bcc15597a76c/0_0_7362_4910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Ham manager David Moyes during the club’s media day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West Ham manager David Moyes during the club’s media day.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dael/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Transfer coup</h2> \n<p>West Ham went 18 months with Michail Antonio as their only senior striker after selling Sébastien Haller to Ajax in January 2021. It put Antonio and his notoriously shaky hamstrings under a lot of pressure, so the arrival of Gianluca Scamacca from Sassuolo in a deal worth £35.5m is a huge boost. The Italy striker was a target for Paris Saint-Germain this summer. West Ham will hope he’s more Paolo Di Canio than Simone Zaza.</p> \n<h2>World Cup impact</h2> \n<p>Much of West Ham’s squad could get a rest during the World Cup. Rice is a guaranteed pick for England while Jarrod Bowen will hope to stay in Gareth Southgate’s plans, and Aguerd is a key player for Morocco. Pablo Fornals will also hope to force his way into the Spain squad and Alphonse Areola could represent France. However, Tomas Soucek and Vladimir Coufal will be staying home following the Czech Republic’s failure to qualify.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-04:21:54/embed.html\" data-alt=\"f\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jul/2022-07-07-04:21:54/embed.html\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Alternative attractions during the World Cup</h2> \n<p>Anyone wanting to reminisce about London 2012 can register for the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park half marathon on 27 November. As a bonus you can limp over to Westfield to do your Christmas shopping once the race is done.</p> \n<h2>Leading the shirt sales</h2> \n<p>Rice is the obvious crowd favourite. The 23-year-old has developed into one of the best midfielders in the world and is about to take on even more responsibility following the retirement of Mark Noble. The worry, though, is that Rice does not plan to emulate Noble by becoming a one-club man. The England international has no intention of extending his current contract and is keen to play for a club in the Champions League. Chelsea, who let Rice go when he was 14, will be watching the situation closely. It is no secret that he is unlikely to stay at West Ham beyond next summer.</p> \n<h2>Social climber</h2> \n<p>Benrahma may not be a regular starter, but there are no concerns over his social media game. The Algeria winger leads the way on Instagram with an impressive two million followers. Fans can tune in for post-match reaction (sample caption: “Sunday win and three points”) and moody shots of Benrahma living his best life away from the pitch. Log on to see Benrahma smiling in a car.

To be fair, Keane seems in good spirits and is looking fit, tanned and extremely lean.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/04/is-the-premier-league-and-its-fans-ready-for-a-season-like-no-other\">Premier League’s power risks being weakened by another season of flux | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, so jovial does he appear to be, that when questions are opened to the floor it seems as good a time as any to inquire whether his well-documented, violent, on-field “previous” with Alfie Haaland could in any way cloud his judgment when at some point in the very near future he is called upon to lavish praise or criticism on Erling, the former Manchester City midfielder’s son. As <em>that</em> famous tackle on Haaland the elder demonstrated, Keane is after all a man who clearly knows how to hold a grudge.</p> <p>During a previous group discussion on City’s new star signing, Keane had remained silent as his colleagues took turns debating the pros and precious few cons of the club’s decision to sign the superstar striker from Borussia Dortmund but he was quick, at first with a conspicuous narrowing of the eyes, to rubbish the notion that he might be anything other than scrupulously fair in future assessments of the player’s Premier League performances.</p> <p>“I’ll judge on what I see,” he said. “In the game last week, Jamie mentioned he missed one or two chances but I thought his movement was absolutely fantastic. He’s absolutely an amazing player; there’s no doubt in my mind he’ll be a success at Man City and he’ll score bags of goals. When Phil Foden had the shot last week, if you look at his reactions he was way ahead of everybody else. So it’s no issue for me talking about a player because I might have had history with his dad. I’ll just hopefully give him a fair assessment, like I do with all my comments.”</p> <p>The eventual arrival of an apologetic Redknapp (airport issues) coincides with a discussion about the future whereabouts of Cristiano Ronaldo, with nobody on the panel seeming any wiser than the rest of us regarding the player’s short- or long-term future. To a man they expect him to get regular game time for United if he is unable to force a move. Curiously, the issue of the undeniably gifted but ageing and increasingly immobile striker’s complete unsuitability for Erik ten Hag’s high-intensity style of pressing went resolutely unraised.</p> <p>With Keane, Richards and Redknapp excused, the remaining trio stay behind to discuss the Sky Sports institution that is Monday Night Football. The difficulties of coming up with fresh themes to espouse or pick apart in their post-weekend slot is raised. In an age where there is an often overwhelming amount of forensic analysis of the game’s often excruciating minutiae available on multiple platforms, coming up with new topics to discuss can be tough.</p> <p>Neville explains that the opening hour of tactical discussion on the first episode of Monday Night Football in a little over two weeks will be devoted to Manchester United’s new manager and cannot stress enough that it is imperative he and Carragher do it better than anyone else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b4fa43dd4068a5292b7887fe6c6695387459ec92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4fa43dd4068a5292b7887fe6c6695387459ec92/0_72_5497_3298/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Micah Richards and Roy Keane have an excellent on-screen chemistry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Micah Richards and Roy Keane have an excellent on-screen chemistry. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/NMC Pool / the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During a cost of living crisis when many are struggling to make ends meet, I ask what they might say to somebody – with apologies to those in far more dire financial straits – who can no longer afford two overpriced TV subscriptions and is forced to choose between Sky and BT Sport.</p> <p>“We’re better than BT Sport,” says Carragher, matter-of-factly. Perhaps, but you don’t have the Champions League, comes the counter. “You can watch that in the pub,” says Neville, apparently oblivious to the fact that particular option will no longer be affordable to many when those energy bills for multiple thousands of pounds start arriving in the post.</p> <p>“To be fair, this shouldn’t be about BT or Sky,” says Neville. “What they’ve done over the last seven or eight years is fantastic. They have great pundits but so do we. I look at Super Sunday on Sky when I’m at home and I just think: ‘Wow!’ We’ve got 128 Premier League games, and I know I’m sounding like a corporate now, but you have to watch the Premier League.

After a timid start, Laugher’s form exploded in the second half of the men’s 1m springboard to help him clinch his third consecutive Commonwealth Games gold medal, his seventh medal overall. As the veteran Li Shixin of Australia finished with silver, England’s Jordan Houlden took an excellent bronze in his first Commonwealth Games.</p> <p>It was far from easy. Laugher had struggled in the preliminary round in the afternoon, feeling his nerves as he qualified in fourth place.

Is that why the Sky News audience of Tory members chose the former chancellor over Liz Truss, says Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff","byline":"Gaby Hinsliff","body":"<p>It’s often said that Westminster exists in a bubble, deaf to life outside the M25. But if that was ever true, SW1 now looks positively on the money compared to the massed ranks of Conservative party members. The Bank of England’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-1-point-75-per-cent-in-biggest-hike-in-27-years\">doomsday forecast</a> on Thursday – inflation rising to 13%, a long grim recession, rising interest rates and plummeting living standards – only confirmed what everyone involved in politics had been afraid was coming for months. But what were Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak asked as they roamed the country? Whether they’ll bring back grammar schools. How they’ll fight a “war on woke”. Whether Boris Johnson was shabbily treated. Meanwhile, neither candidate has demonstrated the sense of urgency you’d expect from someone applying to lead Britain through a full-blown national emergency. The gravity of the moment has somehow passed the whole contest by.</p> <p>Sunak has come closest to acknowledging reality by arguing that cutting taxes now – the answer the Tory faithful always reach for, whatever the question – is unaffordable. Truss has sunnily told them what they want to hear, even suggesting at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/aug/04/sajid-javid-liz-truss-conservative-party-rishi-sunak-tory-leadership-race-uk-politics-live\">Thursday night’s Sky News hustings</a> that this kind of recession isn’t inevitable, whatever the Bank says. As a result Sunak has become the “actually it’s a bit more complicated than that” candidate, struggling to explain without sounding patronising that if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. </p> <p>Anyone who remembers how that ended for remainers in 2016, or Hillary Clinton up against Donald Trump, will have some insight into why Truss has been wiping the floor with him. But she’s also a better player of Conservative internal politics. Sunak did the right thing for his country and his party by moving against Johnson, but alienated a significant number of Tories who have subsequently convinced themselves Johnson could have somehow staggered on. Truss has merrily attacked Johnson’s government over everything from lockdowns to tax policy but because she stood by him in those final days, still isn’t seen as disloyal. But if Sunak was ever to have his moment, a chance to stop her runaway bandwagon, this is it.</p> <p>At the height of the banking crash in 2008, with not just the Tories but Labour rivals nipping at his heels, Gordon Brown bought time by growling that this was “no time for a novice” in No 10. In a crisis, people become risk-averse. They seek leaders who know what they’re doing. Sunak is an ex-chancellor who has already navigated one once-in-a-lifetime crisis; Truss is a far less battle-hardened former chief secretary to the Treasury. She is the bolder but riskier choice for many Tories and while so far she has emphasised the boldness, this week the risks bubbled to the surface. Thursday’s interest rate rise significantly raises the cost of borrowing, on which her economic plans depend. She was forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/03/liz-truss-public-sector-u-turn-rishi-sunaks-tax-cuts\">to scrap</a> her own regional pay policy after being accused of inflicting a pay cut on the north. </p> <p>At the Sky hustings, she insisted that disowning her own policy was somehow an example of her honesty and straightforwardness. But a gimlet-eyed Kay Burley (never underestimate Kay Burley) gleefully listed all the things Truss once said she believed in – remaining in the EU, mass housebuilding, Britons going to fight in Ukraine – and has since renounced. Arguably the toughest question Truss faced was from the audience member who snapped: “We’re having this election because of poor judgment and trust. Why should we trust your judgment?”</p> <p>The first question to Sunak, however, was whether he should just throw in the towel given how badly it’s going. Things have reached the stage where merely dragging himself out of the dressing room for another mauling must take some doing. But his answers were punchier, more confident than usual; asked why he turned on Johnson, he reminded the audience of the Chris Pincher scandal and effectively challenged them to defend it. He not only said Truss’s plans would worsen the crisis but accused her of making a mistake “which I am just going to correct” by suggesting that taxes, not inflation, were the cause of Britain’s ills. Will her supporters call that mansplaining? Maybe, but if so we need a new word for what happens when men are actually right. Interestingly the studio audience, at the end of the night, voted for Sunak.</p> <p>The Conservative party of 2010 or even 2015 would have picked him over Truss. But the members who would have been most drawn to him then are also those most likely to have quit the party now, driven away by the Brexit Sunak himself backed and the post-truth politics it spawned. Are there enough of them left? We’ll have to wait until September to find out. What this country can’t wait another day for, however, is someone to get a grip on the economic horrors to come. Right now, that seems terrifyingly elusive.</p> <ul> <li><p>Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/04/england-defeat-world-champions-new-zealand-to-set-up-australia-semi-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T22:32:08Z","webTitle":"England beat netball world champions New Zealand to set up Australia semi-final","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/04/england-defeat-world-champions-new-zealand-to-set-up-australia-semi-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/04/england-defeat-world-champions-new-zealand-to-set-up-australia-semi-final","fields":{"headline":"England beat netball world champions New Zealand to set up Australia semi-final","trailText":"England vanquished world champions New Zealand 54-44 to take a crucial step forward in the defence of their Commonwealth Games title","byline":"Chloe Merrell at Arena Birmingham","body":"<p>England vanquished world champions New Zealand 54-44 to take a crucial step forward in the defence of their Commonwealth Games title on Thursday night.</p> <p>In front of a raucous crowd the Roses survived a second-quarter scare to finish on top of their pool, undefeated heading into Saturday’s semi-finals.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/aug/04/commonwealth-games-2022-athletics-cycling-and-more-on-day-seven-live\">Commonwealth Games day seven: road cycling, diving, hockey and more – live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Jamaica producing a stunning upset <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/04/commonwealth-games-netball-jamaica-australia-report\">over pre-tournament favourites Australia</a> earlier in the day to advance as top seeds into the semis the question of whether England should throw the game to avoid a wounded Diamonds hung like a cloud over the game.</p> <p>But from the first centre pass it was clear the Roses were out to win. Pressing the Ferns high and wide, England turned into scavengers hunting across looking to break the rhythm that typified the early stages.</p> <p>The contest between England’s veteran goalkeeper Geva Mentor, in her sixth Games, and New Zealand’s burgeoning talent, 20-year-old Grace Nweke, proved the point of difference with the England star getting the better of the green Fern. Shooting at just 63 per cent, and picking up significant whistle, the Roses stormed ahead for New Zealand to take the first round: 8-15.</p> <p>The second quarter will be one England will quickly forget. The injection of Te-Paea Selby-Rickit into attack proved to be a masterstroke by Silver Ferns’ head coach and renowned tactician Dame Noeline Taurua.

With Jo Harten, at the helm of goal shooter at the start of quarter three, England returned from the locker room inspired. Reclaiming the initiative, they reclaimed a five-goal cushion to stem the rising Silver Fern tide.</p> <p>The final 15 minutes was a battle of wills. New Zealand made several changes, looking to change their course, but a resolute England held firm.

There is no such thing as free money, and I just think we’ve got to be very careful if the UK gets a reputation for arbitrarily taking money in tax.”</p> \n<p>Sunak also said he would do more as prime minister to help hard-pressed consumers through the winter ahead. He recently announced a pledge to cut VAT on energy bills – a policy he had previously rejected. When asked about the recession, he said: “It’s not the tax burden that is causing the recession. That’s simply wrong. What’s causing the recession is inflation. That’s the root of the problems, not just here, but in America and elsewhere.”</p> \n<p>Truss was challenged robustly by two audience members – over the public finances, and her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/liz-truss-plan-to-cut-11bn-in-whitehall-waste-ludicrous\">botched announcement of pay cuts for public sector workers</a>.</p> \n<p>Jill of Tunbridge Wells accused Truss of failing to take seriously enough the need to balance the books. “The one thing Margaret Thatcher believed in was sound money,” she said. “Fifteen percent interest rates, I remember those days. I had to pay a mortgage of 15%, are we going back to that level again?”</p> \n<p>Truss replied “no”, and went on to stress the risks of high taxes for economic growth.</p> \n<p>Another audience member, Tom from Gateshead, pressed Truss on the plan for regional pay boards which she withdrew earlier this week. “Why should we trust your judgment?” Pointing out that it would have meant lower pay for public sector workers in his local area of Newcastle, he added: “Will you apologise because it was actually quite offensive?”</p> \n<p>Truss replied: “I don’t think there is anything to be ashamed of, of saying publicly that this is not working as I wanted it to work, and therefore, I have changed the position on it.”</p> \n<p>Sunak was accused by an audience member, Steven, of plotting to overthrow Johnson, and resigning last month in a cynical bid to win the leadership.</p> \n<p>Citing the scandal of former Conservative whip Chris Pincher, who was promoted by Johnson despite multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, Sunak insisted “that was a serious ethical question that the government was on the wrong side of, again, and I couldn’t defend it”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b664c8a6da92cb777bc42df0dcf4f4b563cda1cb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b664c8a6da92cb777bc42df0dcf4f4b563cda1cb/0_180_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak argued his rival’s tax plans will lead to ‘misery for millions’.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak argued his rival’s tax plans will lead to ‘misery for millions’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Lobina/Sky News/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By contrast, Truss gave a staunch defence of Boris Johnson.

Raducanu broke serve early but Osorio methodically dragged Raducanu into exhausting rallies in 35 degree heat and 51% humidity.</p> <p>From 4-1, Raducanu conceded four games in a row, double faulting on break point at 4-4. But Raducanu recovered, saving two set points on Osorio’s serve before reaching a tiebreak, where she trailed 3-5. When she most needed it, Raducanu found sufficient quality to distance herself from the No. 67, taking the set after 82 exhausting minutes.</p> <p>With the first set secured, Raducanu imposed her greater weight of shot and positioned herself for a simpler set, but her serve crumbled as she stood a game away. At 5-4, 30-15, she served two double faults and then dumped a forehand into the bottom of the net. But she recovered once again, dragging Osorio to a tie-break where she eked out the 88-minute second set.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.\">  <iframe id=\"the-recap\" name=\"the-recap\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-recap\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-recap\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors’ picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout this tough first full year on the tour, Raducanu’s body has too often been her biggest obstacle.

They found that those with the highest levels of prostasin, a protein that circulates in the blood, were almost twice as likely to have diabetes than those with the lowest levels.</p> <p>Some of those enrolled on the study already had diabetes, so the scientists looked at who among those without the disease went on to be diagnosed later. People in the top quarter for prostasin levels turned out to be 76% more likely to develop diabetes than those in the bottom quarter.</p> <p>Dr Xue Bao, the first author on the study at the Affiliated hospital of Nanjing University medical school in China, said prostasin was a potential new “risk marker” for diabetes, but also death from cancer, particularly in people who have high blood sugar.</p> <p>Prostasin plays several roles in the body, such as regulating blood pressure and blood volume, and it also suppresses the growth of tumours that are fuelled by high blood sugar. While type 2 diabetes is known to raise the risk of certain cancers, including pancreatic, liver, bowel and endometrial tumours, the biological mechanisms are far from clear.</p> <p>After investigating the link between prostasin and diabetes, the researchers looked at whether people with high levels of the protein were at greater risk from cancer.</p> <p>Writing in <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-022-05771-w\">Diabetologia</a>, they describe how those in the top quarter for prostasin levels were 43% more likely to die from cancer than those in the bottom quarter.</p> <p>Participants with high levels of both prostasin and blood sugar were at significantly higher risk of dying from cancer, according to the study. For every doubling in prostasin concentration, the risk of cancer death rose by 24% in those without high blood sugar, and by 139% in those with high blood sugar. “Particular attention should be paid to these individuals,” the authors write.</p> <p>It is unclear whether a high prostasin level plays a part in disease or is merely a biological marker that ramps up as the condition develops. One possibility, the authors suggest, is that prostasin levels rise in an attempt to suppress high blood sugar levels, but are not able to stop or reverse the damage caused.</p> <p>“The relationship between diabetes and cancer is poorly understood and this protein could provide a possible shared link between the two conditions,” said Prof Gunnar Engström, a senior author on the study at Lund University.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/03/hpv-vaccine-after-removal-of-precancerous-cells-may-cut-cervical-cancer-risk\">HPV vaccine after removal of precancerous cells may cut cervical cancer risk </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We now need to examine to what extent prostasin is causally related to these diseases or whether it is a valuable marker of increased disease risk,” Engström added.</p> <p>“It might also be possible to identify individuals with increased risk of diabetes and cancer, and offer preventive measures.”</p> <p>Because the findings are drawn from people in one city, they may not apply to wider populations. The researchers also point out that prostasin was measured from frozen blood taken at only one time point, and that the study was unable to distinguish between different types of diabetes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jessica Brown, at Diabetes UK, said: “We know there is a connection between diabetes and some types of cancer, and this study suggests levels of a particular protein, called prostasin, is linked to both conditions.</p> <p>“Gaining a better understanding of the changes inside the body that may put people at risk from diabetes and cancer will help scientists find ways to protect people from these serious conditions, but there’s still much to discover.</p> <p>“We need further research to find out if prostasin is playing a direct role in the development of type 2 diabetes and poorer cancer outcomes in people with high blood sugar levels.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/aug/04/sajid-javid-liz-truss-conservative-party-rishi-sunak-tory-leadership-race-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T21:43:13Z","webTitle":"Truss and Sunak face Sky grilling as Bank warns of long recession – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/aug/04/sajid-javid-liz-truss-conservative-party-rishi-sunak-tory-leadership-race-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/aug/04/sajid-javid-liz-truss-conservative-party-rishi-sunak-tory-leadership-race-uk-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Truss and Sunak face Sky grilling as Bank warns of long recession – as it happened","trailText":"Tory hopefuls face questions from party members and are interviewed by Kay Burley as interest rates go up sharply","byline":"Jane Clinton (now) and Léonie Chao-Fong (earlier)","body":"<div id=\"block-62ec38aa8f08cf33fef3555f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T21:43:13.016Z\">10.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is a summary of today’s events: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The <strong>Bank of England </strong>raised interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 1.75% and warned the economy is heading toward a recession.</li> \n   <li><strong>Labour</strong> said the interest rise was “further proof” that the Conservative party has lost control of the economy. </li> \n   <li>In light of the rise,<strong> Rishi Sunak</strong> said he would “prioritise gripping inflation, growing the economy and then cutting taxes” while <strong>Liz Truss</strong> said there was a need “for the bold economic plan that I am advocating.

When Forest were relegated in 1998-99 they went through three managers, a sign of their instability and a key reason they finished bottom, starting a trait that became all too common at the City Ground. Things have not changed much in recent years – they have gone through six permanent appointments since 2016 – but they hope Cooper has finally brought stability.</p> <p>“As we have gone on the journey last season and now into the Premier League, there’s a lot more people watching us and a lot more scrutiny and pressure, excitement,” Cooper says. “It is still the same feeling of: ‘We know how big the club is, we know what we want the team to look like, what the fans want to see and we are just doing it on a bigger scale.’ What’s great for the supporters, they’ve always been proud of the team but we have put Nottingham Forest back in a position that has reminded maybe the whole world who they are. What we have to do now is be a good representation of the city, the football club and do the best we can and try to win games.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/04/nottingham-forest-submit-improved-offer-for-wolves-winger-gibbs-white\">Nottingham Forest submit club-record offer for Wolves’ Morgan Gibbs-White</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fitting 12 signings into a cohesive unit from week one is tough. Many do not have Premier League experience but they have been targeted with precision to create a side capable of staying up. Despite all the arrivals, Cooper has appointed the academy graduates Joe Worrall and Ryan Yates as captain and vice-captain to bring continuity to a much-changed squad.</p> <p>“We’ve done a lot of due diligence on not just the type of player we have bought in but the type of person as well,” Cooper says. “Identifying a player can be the straightforward, easier bit; the more difficult part – and often more important part – is the attitude, the character, the teammate they are, the leadership they have, the ambition they have; the stuff it is not easy to find out. We are confident the players we have brought in are the right type of characters, the right type of professionals.”</p> <p>The level of investment provided by owner Evangelos Marinakis has surprised many outsiders. Other clubs have watched Forest’s dealings with intrigue, impressed by their smart workings in a difficult market, but what looks good on paper needs to perform on the pitch. Cooper would still like to sign Morgan Gibbs-White and a central midfielder, at least, to ensure they have the strength and variety required.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0901831d84b6567e1694f07b4181b5623f95da7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0901831d84b6567e1694f07b4181b5623f95da7/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Worrall celebrates Nottingham Forest’s promotion\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nottingham Forest captain Joe Worrall is an academy graduate and his role brings continuity to a much-changed squad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Sellers/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jul/21/jesse-lingard-nottingham-forest-200000-a-week\" title=\"\">Jesse Lingard is an outlier</a> within the recruitment, a player who has not played regularly in recent years. He could be the signing who defines Forest’s season. Lingard will play in the No 10 role and is expected to be hugely influential in the dressing room. A lot will be demanded of a man who made two Premier League starts for Manchester United last season but Lingard will have the extra motivation of Qatar 2022 to inspire him.</p> <p>Many have avoided mentioning Forest’s history in recent years, trying to distance the club from the Brian Clough years, but Cooper embraces it, hoping to build his own legacy. He has laid the foundations for a successful era, even if titles and European Cups are no longer the aim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It’s who we are,” Cooper says. “This club is built on eras like that. You often hear people talk about Nottingham Forest and being a historic club and having a good status in England. You have to know why, and one of the big reasons for that is Mr Clough and the teams he put together and the success they had. Those guys who are still around are a part of that. They will always be welcome. I like it when they are here because if other clubs can come and see a real joined-up club of past and present – that is a really good image.”</p> <p>Optimism abounds after years of hurt. The fans will be hoping the latest glory era did not end at Wembley in May. They are back and they want to stay.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/04/mikel-arteta-confident-arsenal-ready-to-go-to-a-different-level-with-signings","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T21:30:27Z","webTitle":"Mikel Arteta confident Arsenal ‘ready to go to a different level’ with signings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/04/mikel-arteta-confident-arsenal-ready-to-go-to-a-different-level-with-signings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/04/mikel-arteta-confident-arsenal-ready-to-go-to-a-different-level-with-signings","fields":{"headline":"Mikel Arteta confident Arsenal ‘ready to go to a different level’ with signings","trailText":"Mikel Arteta suggested the arrivals of Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City will add a winning edge to a side that finished fifth last season","byline":"Nick Ames","body":"<p>Mikel Arteta believes Arsenal are “ready to go to a different level” this season, suggesting the arrivals of Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City will add a winning edge to a side that finished fifth in 2021-22.</p> \n<p>Arsenal are looking for a return to Champions League football at the sixth time of asking and begin their campaign on Friday at Selhurst Park, where Crystal Palace have made their lives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/04/mikel-arteta-calls-arsenal-performance-against-crystal-palace-unacceptable\">distinctly uncomfortable in recent years</a>.

He took aim at familiar targets such as illegal immigration, same-sex marriage, “leftist media” and philanthropist George Soros while quoting the Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Clint Eastwood. There were frequent cheers and applause from those present.</p> <p>“We are not the favorites of the American Democrats,” Orbán said. “They did not want me to be here and they made every effort to drive a wedge between us. They hate me and slander me and my country as they hate you and slander you and America you stand for.</p> <p>“We all know how this works. Progressive liberals didn’t want me to be here because they knew what I would tell you – because I’m here to tell you that we should unite our forces because we Hungarians know how to defeat the enemies of freedom on the political battlefield.”</p> <p>Orbán’s invitation to CPAC reflects conservatives’ growing embrace of the Hungarian far-right leader whose country has implemented hardline policies against immigration and LGBTQ+ rights, and is governed by single-party rule. He addressed a special edition of CPAC in Budapest earlier this year.</p> <p>In another sign of how Orbán’s nativist white grievance politics have infused the American right, CPAC’s speakers include the far-right political provocateur Steve Bannon, Republican extremists Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene, entrepreneur and conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell, political commentator Jack Posobeic and, in Saturday’s closing address, Trump himself.</p> <p>On a stage stage branded “Fire Pelosi” – a reference to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi – and “Save America”, the Hungarian entered to enthusiastic applause in a dark suit, white shirt and red tie reminiscent of Trump. He buttoned his jacket and he stepped up the lectern and flattered his hosts in Texas, known as the Lone Star state.</p> <p>“If I am correct, Lone Star state means that independence, freedom and sovereignty are the dearest values in this part of America,” he said. “My country, Hungary, is the Lone Star state of Europe.”</p> <p>Orbán described himself as “an old-fashioned freedom fighter”, “the only anti-migration political leader of our continent” and “the leader of a country that is under the siege of progressive liberals day by day”.</p> <p>He mocked “the leftist media” for criticizing his visit and said those who accuse his government of racism and antisemitism were “simply idiots”, adding to loud applause: “They are the industrial fake news corporation.”</p> <p>Orbán urged his audience to have courage to address sensitive questions around migration, gender and “clash of civilizations”, assuring them: “A Christian politician cannot be racist.” He accused progressives of trying to separate western civilization from its Christian roots.</p> <p>“If you separate western civilization from its Judaeo-Christian heritage, the worst things in history happen. Let’s be honest, the most evil things in modern history were carried out by people who hated Christianity. Don’t be afraid to call your enemies by their name. You can’t play safe but they will never show mercy.”</p> <p>When the prime minister then named Soros, a Hungarian-born billionaire and philanthropist who has been targeted by antisemitic conspiracy theorists, there were boos from the audience. Orbán claimed that Soros had “an army” at his disposal – money, non-government organizations, universities and European bureaucrats in Brussels.</p> <p>He warned darkly: “The horrors of Nazis and communists happened because some western states in continental Europe abandoned that Christian values and today’s progressives are planning to do the same. They want to give up on western values and create a new world, a post-western world. Who is going to stop them if we don’t?”</p> <p>The authoritarian leader characterized Hungary as a “David-sized nation standing against the globalist Goliath” earned shouts of support when he claimed that he had fought back by making Hungary the first country in Europe to stop an “invasion” of illegal immigrants.</p> <p>“We actually built that wall and it stopped illegal migration. Tucker Carlson said, when he visited us, it’s not a hi-tech wall but guarded by people who love their country, and the border protection system works.”</p> <p>Orbán also contended that the family was under attack from progressives and said children must be protected from the “toxic stuff” of “gender ideology”. He added that a referendum in Hungary “rejected sexual orientation programs in schools without parental consent” and said the constitution protects traditional marriage. “To sum up: the mother is a woman, the father is a man. Leave our kids alone. Full stop. End of discussion!”</p> <p>This triggered a prolonged standing ovation and whoops of enthusiasm from the CPAC crowd.</p> <p>Orbán struck another popular note when, in closing his remarks, he said: “We have seen what kind of future the globalist ruling class has to offer. But we have a different future in mind. The globalists can all go to hell. I have come to Texas.”</p> <p>Democracy watchdogs have raised alarm over Orbán’s consolidation of power over the country’s judiciary and media. His party has drawn legislative districts in a way that makes it very difficult for opposition parties to win seats – not unlike partisan gerrymandering efforts for state legislative and congressional seats in the US.</p> <p>Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist, said he was concerned first about Orbán’s meeting with Trump, “considering what we all know about President Trump’s tone, posture, position, his policies, his politics, as well as we now know his direct engagements as relates to January 6 and what that means. As an American citizen, I question the motives and what the agenda is.</p> <p>“Secondly, when I think about the CPAC crowd, I think about a group of people who are interested in coddling and playing footsie with the extreme Maga election-denying wing of the Republican party and that’s become a growing majority. If you combine those two things for me and my political digestive system, you just have to couch that as concerned.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/05/morning-mail-climate-breakdown-supercharging-extreme-weather-fears-for-jailed-teens-chinas-military-drills","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T20:58:38Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: climate breakdown supercharging extreme weather, fears for jailed teens, China’s military drills ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/05/morning-mail-climate-breakdown-supercharging-extreme-weather-fears-for-jailed-teens-chinas-military-drills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/05/morning-mail-climate-breakdown-supercharging-extreme-weather-fears-for-jailed-teens-chinas-military-drills","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: climate breakdown supercharging extreme weather, fears for jailed teens, China’s military drills ","trailText":"<strong>Friday</strong>: New analysis reveals the devastating intensification of heatwaves, floods, fires and droughts.

It wasn’t so much that the winner gets to play India on Saturday, more that the loser has to face Australia, who haven’t lost a T20 game since March 2021. So New Zealand have two days to try and reassemble the bits and pieces of their batting lineup after it was wrecked by England’s attack. They say it’s batters who win matches, but not this one. England bowled so well that New Zealand barely cobbled together their total of 71 even though they had won the toss.</p> <p>It was Katherine Brunt who did the damage. New Zealand had made it this far through the tournament without losing a single wicket in a powerplay, as their two openers, Sophie Devine and Suzie Bates, put together back-to-back stands of 99 and 51 against South Africa and Sri Lanka. Then they ran smack bang into Brunt, who broke them in the first over. She nearly dismissed Bates with her third ball, and then did dismiss Devine with her fourth, a nip-backer that slipped through the gap in Devine’s defence like it had been greased and ripped out her leg stump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"504f00a56e26284a39982300f835c8aaf0939636\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/504f00a56e26284a39982300f835c8aaf0939636/133_166_3367_2021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England’s Katherine Brunt celebrates the wicket of New Zealand’s Amelia Kerr.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Katherine Brunt celebrates the wicket of New Zealand’s Amelia Kerr.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 37, Brunt does this for fun. Seeing her go to work on a top order is like watching a hobbyist mechanic dismantle an engine. A twist here, a turn there, and suddenly the thing’s in bits in front of you. She got New Zealand’s No 3, Amelia Kerr, four balls later, trying to hit an off-cutter which knocked over her middle stump. Brunt finished with figures of two for four in three overs, with one maiden. By then New Zealand had lost Bates too, who clipped a catch straight to mid-wicket off Issy Wong. That left New Zealand 21 for three at the end of the powerplay.</p> <p>It was always going to be a long climb back from a start like that, and it didn’t help that Brooke Halliday decided the best way to do it was by digging down deeper. Halliday was at the non-striker’s end when she called for a single off a delivery that squirmed past the wicketkeeper Amy Jones.</p> <p>Her partner Maddy Green kept shouting “no, no!” but it was like a dog-walker trying to call back a labrador going after a picnic. Green gave Halliday the sort of filthy look the walker might have used too, when they ended up standing at the same end while Jones removed the bails.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b59de2a3a0558a589027bc7e946c507c50dcbbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b59de2a3a0558a589027bc7e946c507c50dcbbf/0_0_5923_3949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans celebrate in the stands as England’s Amy Jones and Nat Sciver embrace after Jones scored a four to give England victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans celebrate in the stands as England’s Amy Jones and Nat Sciver embrace after Jones scored a four to give England victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TomJenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then Sophie Ecclestone removed Green, who never quite seemed to get over her disappointment, with a jaffa that spun between her bat and pad. At the other end, the leg-spinner Sarah Glenn tied up the tail. The only flaw in the performance was that England allowed the 10th-wicket pair of Hannah Rowe and Fran Jonas to bat through the last five overs, so New Zealand’s 57 for nine ended up 71 for the same. England missed two more run-out opportunities while they were doing it, as if they had switched off already.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-spin\" name=\"the-spin\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-spin\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-spin\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But they had more up their sleeve if they needed it. Brunt and Wong both had an over left unused, and Alice Capsey didn’t even get a bowl.</p> <p>After that, the job of knocking off the runs was easy enough. Capsey top-scored for them, for the third match in a row, with 23. One note of caution: good as New Zealand are, England have beaten them in 19 of their last 21 games in this format, India will be a stiffer proposition.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/05/commonwealth-games-2022-australia-day-seven-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T20:16:31Z","webTitle":"Australia’s Grace Brown and Rohan Dennis complete Commonwealth cycling clean sweep","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/05/commonwealth-games-2022-australia-day-seven-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/05/commonwealth-games-2022-australia-day-seven-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s Grace Brown and Rohan Dennis complete Commonwealth cycling clean sweep","trailText":"The Australian pair blew away the competition to each claim gold medals in the cycling time trials while para star Madison de Rozario won her second event of the Games","byline":"Courtney Walsh in Birmingham","body":"<p>As Grace Brown was preparing for the first leg of an Australian clean sweep of the Commonwealth Games individual time trials, the task ahead was brought into harsh focus.

Brown was the strongest woman by far. And Rohan Dennis, twice a world champion in the discipline, was finally the Commonwealth champion after posting a time of 46:21.20, with his early strength and speed critical.</p> <p>In both races, English riders finished second. But that is generous to silver medallists Anna Henderson and Fred Wright. In reality there was daylight behind the Australian champions. Both gold medallists had plenty of time in the latter stages of the time trial to consider their thoughts.</p> <p>Brown coasted home more than 33 seconds clear and Dennis eased late when triumphant over a field including 2018 Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas by just over 26 seconds.</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/04/commonwealth-games-netball-jamaica-australia-report\">Australia’s netballers suffered a shock loss to Jamaica</a> on day seven of the Birmingham Games, Brown and Dennis rode superbly to justify their favouritism. Watching Brown, who finished fourth in the Tokyo Olympics, over the course as she reeled in rival after rival was like watching Pac-Man mow down the ghosts in the classic arcade game. The 30-year-old chewed them up and charged on in pursuit of the next target on the way to a winning ride of 40:05.20 over the weaving, hilly and tactically complex 28.8km course. </p> <p>“The team didn’t tell me I was ahead until the last five kilometres, so I assumed no news was good news,” she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"311466c0ace15e364c3260a9e1416a805cb70f19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/311466c0ace15e364c3260a9e1416a805cb70f19/0_127_2987_1793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rohan Dennis storms round the course in West Park in Wolverhampton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rohan Dennis storms round the course in West Park in Wolverhampton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brown came to cycling later than most. Raised in the Victorian town of Camperdown, the gateway to the Otway Ranges and Great Ocean Road, she headed off to boarding school in the big smoke as a teenager.</p> <p>In Melbourne she was an outstanding athlete. Long distances were her go. She was quick enough to compete at national level, but her body was not designed for the rigours of long-distance running, with niggles and injuries ultimately frustrating her.</p> <p>But her discipline to training, combined with the independence gleaned from leaving home early, served Brown well when she jumped on a bike in her early 20s. She drew fans with her aggressive, attacking riding and the wins at professional level started flowing. So strong a rider has the Australian become, Brown was the clear pick to win here.</p> <p>Well before she crossed the line, it was clear the pre-race favourite was riding extremely well. As she said afterwards, she did was able to do what was expected of her. “I had the target on my back. I tried not to take on too much of the pressure of being the favourite, just staying calm and focusing on what I had to do,” she said.</p> <p>Dennis claimed a silver medal in the event in Glasgow in 2014, a year he won the first to two successive world championships in team time trials. He added individual successes to his distinguished resume with successes in Innsbruck and Yorkshire in 2018 and 2019. Last year he won bronze in Tokyo.

His youngest victim was 8 years old when the abuse began. Both victims faced two weeks of gruelling cross-examination, and it was the nature of Leiataua’s defence, rather than the trial’s final outcome, that prompted outcry among New Zealand advocates.</p> <p>Leiataua argued during the trial that his assault on one of the girls, who was 12 at the time of the attacks, was “consensual”, that she had “pursued” him, and that it was therefore not rape. </p> <p>His defence utilised an element of New Zealand’s laws not widely understood by the public – that while the age of consent is broadly 16 years in New Zealand, consent is still a legal defence available to those charged with sexual violation by rape. Advocates say that should change, to ensure that children cannot be regarded as consenting parties to sexual activity with adults.</p> <p>“There definitely needs to be change,” said Kathryn McPhillips, executive director of sexual abuse organisation HELP. She said it was “immoral to be putting those ideas forward that a child could consent … It’s way out of sync with what the general population thinks our law is.”</p> <p>McPhillips said being accused in court of lying and of consenting to sexual activity resulted in additional trauma for victims, particularly children. “As an adult, it’s bad enough to be blamed for something that was done to you, intentional harm that was done to you. That’s bad enough – but to be a child?”</p> <p>“When an adult has done this to you, and then another adult accuses you of it in court … that is layer upon layer of being the world turned upside down, where the rights of all of these adults to hurt you are sanctioned by the state.”</p> <p>Judge Richard Earwaker, who presided over the case, addressed the issue of consent on a person under 16 years old in the final days of the trial, <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/verdict-in-man-guilty-on-33-charges-of-sexually-abusing-underage-girls/AULVYUJWJKZ5HCATAWIUZ75VDA/\">the New Zealand Herald reported</a>.</p> <p>“Legally, a person under 16 cannot give consent for charges of indecent acts, therefore as a jury, all you need to decide is if the indecent acts took place,” he said. “But as for sexual intercourse, a person under 16 can give consent. You need to consider whether or not the consent was given based on the evidence you have.”</p> <p>Defence lawyer Mark Edgar argued that the victim had engaged in a consensual relationship she now regretted.</p> <p>“Has she detached herself from not remembering because she has regret? She was probably too young to appreciate it but that doesn’t mean she didn’t want to go along with it,” he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/03/child-victim-domestic-abuse-support-bill-services\">I was a child victim of domestic abuse – I know how badly kids like me need support | Terri White</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Leiataua was found guilty in Manukau District Court of four counts of sexual violation by rape, three counts of an indecent act with a young person, one count of indecent assault, 10 counts of sexual violation by unlawful sexual connection, seven counts of other sexual violations, two counts of other assault on a child and six charges of an indecent act on a child.</p> <p>Layba Zubair, a 17-year-old advocate and campaigner, has launched a petition to parliament for an overhaul of New Zealand’s consent laws, arguing that “the definition of consent in our current laws does not reflect the necessity for free and voluntary agreement at the time of the act”.</p> <p>She said New Zealand’s legislation needed an urgent review, and the country could consider affirmative consent laws such as those<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/01/nsw-affirmative-consent-laws-what-do-they-mean-and-how-will-they-work#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20new%20laws,that%20consent%20has%20been%20given.\"> introduced in New South Wales this year</a>. “The fact that our consent laws don’t even have a definition for consent, and the fact that our laws don’t protect people as young as 12-year-olds, it’s just horrifying,” she said.</p> <p>Zubair said she was appalled that lawyers could argue a 12-year-old can give consent. “A lawyer is trying to do their job,” she said, “but the fact that the law allows them to make that argument and the fact that the law supports them … is disgusting.”</p> <p>In 2021, a study commissioned by the chief victim’s adviser – a formal role which provides independent advice to the minister of justice – examined the transcripts of cross-examinations of children and adolescents from 15 sexual abuse trials.

They said he had died from complications caused by Covid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/29/albert-woodfox-43-years-solitary-confinement-wish-i-was-back\">43 years in solitary: ‘There are moments I wish I was back there’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Woodfox was a member of the so-called “Angola Three” – prisoners who were wrongfully convicted of the 1972 murder of a prison guard, Brent Miller, in Louisiana state penitentiary. The prison was built on the site of a former slave plantation and was commonly known as Angola, after the country from which most of the plantation’s enslaved people had been transported.</p> <p>Before the murder, Woodfox and his fellow Angola Three member Herman Wallace had set up a chapter of the Black Panther party inside the prison. They used it to protest against the segregation of prisoners and the unpaid cotton picking to which Black prisoners were subjected in chain gangs in the outlying fields.</p> <p>He always insisted that his false conviction and consequent treatment were punishment for his Black radicalism. Soon after his conviction in Miller’s death, Woodfox and Wallace were both placed in solitary confinement, where they both remained almost without break for more than 40 years.</p> <p>Wallace was released after a concerted legal battle in 2013, even as prison authorities continued to try to get him back inside. He died from cancer two days later.</p> <p>Woodfox was released in 2016 on his 69th birthday. Days after walking free, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/20/albert-woodfox-angola-3-first-interview-trump-confinement\">he told the Guardian</a> that he had managed to endure decades of solitary, despite frequent terrifying bouts of claustrophobia, through sheer force of willpower.</p> <p>“We made a conscious decision that we would never be institutionalized. As the years went by, we made efforts to improve and motivate ourselves,” he said.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/29/albert-woodfox-43-years-solitary-confinement-wish-i-was-back\">later interviews</a> with the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/19/albert-woodfox-interview-solitary-confinement-44-years\">over the years</a>, and in his 2019 book Solitary, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer prize, he gave more detail on the extraordinary strength that allowed him and Wallace – “the other part of my heart”, as Woodfox described his friend – to withstand solitary. The conditions they endured have been known to cause mental breakdown in individuals within a week, let alone 40 years.</p> <p>Woodfox said that he buried himself in prison books, studying Frantz Fanon, Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. He organized games played up and down the line of solitary cells by shouting down the tier or banging on pipes – that way they held maths tests and general knowledge quizzes about Black history.</p> <p>He was most proud of having in similar fashion taught several young prisoners how to read.</p> <p>“Our cells were meant to be death chambers but we turned them into schools, into debate halls,” Woodfox told the Guardian. “We used the time to develop the tools that we needed to survive, to be part of society and humanity rather than becoming bitter and angry and consumed by a thirst for revenge.”</p> <p>In the six years of freedom that Woodfox enjoyed he devoted himself to educating the public in the US and beyond about the atrocities of the US criminal justice system. He travelled widely domestically and around the world to address audiences of school children and judges.</p> <p>At home back in New Orleans, he found joy wherever he could. He visited the grave of his beloved mother, Ruby Mable Hamlin, who had died while he was still incarcerated, and enjoyed untrammeled time with his daughter, Brenda Poole, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and his life partner, Leslie George.</p> <p>He also adopted a stray dog found wandering on a levee near Lake Pontchartrain. He named the pup Hobo.</p> <p>Notwithstanding all the institutional cruelty that was rained down on him over so many years, Woodfox remained an incurable optimist to the end. In his book he writes: “I have hope for humankind. It is my hope that a new human being will evolve so that needless pain and suffering, poverty, exploitation, racism, and injustice will be things of the past.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2022/aug/04/make-every-penny-count-how-to-maximise-your-digital-marketing-budget","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T19:37:26Z","webTitle":"Make every penny count: How to maximise your digital marketing budget","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2022/aug/04/make-every-penny-count-how-to-maximise-your-digital-marketing-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2022/aug/04/make-every-penny-count-how-to-maximise-your-digital-marketing-budget","fields":{"headline":"Make every penny count: How to maximise your digital marketing budget","trailText":"Discover the importance of digital marketing for your business and how to budget, invest and maximise your return on investment, in this masterclass with Edwina Mullins, the head of marketing at SocialB","byline":"","body":"<ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/make-every-penny-count-how-to-maximise-your-digital-marketing-budget-tickets-396757260647\">Book now</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>How much should you spend on your digital marketing?

He also said he intended to comply with the requests unless a court order instructed him not to.</p> <p>The inadvertent transfer of the texts to Bankston, as well as his readiness to turn them over, could mark an extraordinary stroke of luck for the January 6 panel after Jones invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination in a deposition earlier in the committee’s investigation.</p> <p>Bankston has said in court that Jones’s texts cover a roughly two-year period dating back to 2019, which if true would include his communications from the weeks after the 2020 election that Trump lost to Joe Biden and leading up to the Capitol attack the defeated president’s supporters carried out in early 2021.</p> <p>But the Infowars host disputed that the texts to which Bankston has referred would contain anything of interest to the January 6 committee, saying <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidEdwards/status/1555238156693344257\">on his show</a> on Thursday that they actually covered a six-month period from 2019 to early 2020.</p> <p>The texts are potentially significant because Jones has claimed that on 3 January 2020 he was asked by the Trump White House and the Secret Service to lead a march from the Ellipse to the Capitol three days later. Just such an action by Trump supporters on 6 January disrupted the congressional certification of Biden’s presidential victory. The texts could shed light on the extent – if any – of that coordination.</p> <p>Jones’s claim that he was asked asked to lead that march is striking because the panel has heard that Trump later told an adviser he was unaware about such plans, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p> <p>Details about that supposed request from the Trump White House have been scarce. The committee has struggled to verify the Infowars host’s claims through records from the Secret Service after agents’ texts from January 6 were unlawfully <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/19/secret-service-one-text-message-january-6-committee\">erased</a>.</p> <p>A committee spokesperson declined to comment on Jones’s texts.</p> <p>The confirmation from Bankston on Thursday that he was prepared to turn over the text messages was the latest twist in a bizarre saga that could have far-reaching consequences for Jones, particularly as the justice department steps up its criminal investigation into January 6.</p> <p>Bankston revealed he was in possession of the texts a day earlier, when he told Jones – while he was on the witness stand – that his legal team had “messed up” and provided “an entire digital copy of your entire cellphone with every text message” from the past two years.</p> <p>Those messages included texts that contradicted claims made under oath that Jones had nothing on his phone pertaining to the Sandy Hook shooting.<br><br>Bankston said he immediately alerted Jones’s attorneys to the apparent error but they never took steps to keep the communications out of court by labeling them as privileged.</p> <p>Jones’s attorney, Andino Reynal, requested a mistrial on Thursday, over the purportedly accidental leak. The attorney argued that he feared the text message leak was introduced in court simply to create more press coverage, the Associated Press earlier reported.</p> <p>The emergency motion from Reynal sought the return and destruction of the documents, saying the defence had told Bankston to disregard the link to the files with the text messages, which also included messages from Robert Barnes, Jones’s other lawyer with ties to Stone.</p> <p>But the trial judge, Maya Guerra Gamble of Travis county, denied the motion.</p> <p>Reynal also asked Guerra Gamble to block the release of materials on Jones’s phone to anyone, including the January 6 committee. Guerra Gamble said she would let Reynal indicate what he wants to keep confidential, and then she would review that request, adding that she wasn’t sure she could block a subpoena, according to the <a href=\"https://www.statesman.com/story/news/local/2022/08/04/alex-jones-texts-sought-jan-6-committee/65392054007/\">Austin American-Statesman newspaper</a>.</p> <p>Jurors in the defamation case brought against Jones by Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis – the father and mother of Jesse Lewis, a six-year-old murdered in the Sandy Hook shooting – began deliberations late on Wednesday afternoon.<br><br>They resumed on Thursday, the ninth day of a trial which saw Jones apologize and admit that the 2012 shooting at the elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, was “100% real”.<br><br>Jones previously spent years claiming that the 20 children and six adults murdered at Sandy Hook were not killed and instead – along with their grieving loved ones – were “crisis actors” carrying out an elaborate ruse to force gun control reform.<br><br>Heslin and Lewis sued Jones for defamation and inflicting emotional stress, saying they suffered mental distress, death threats and harassment. They have demanded at least $150m, saying an apology would not be enough.<br><br>Jones lost on the merits of the case by default, because he failed to provide any documents in response to the lawsuit. The jury is deciding how much he owes Lewis and Heslin in compensation. In a later phase, it will determine whether he should pay punitive damages.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2022/aug/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-animation-with-danielle-rhoda","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T19:11:47Z","webTitle":"A complete beginner’s guide to animation with Danielle Rhoda","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2022/aug/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-animation-with-danielle-rhoda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2022/aug/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-animation-with-danielle-rhoda","fields":{"headline":"A complete beginner’s guide to animation with Danielle Rhoda","trailText":"Discover the basics of animation, how to ground them in your existing work, and even how to build a career in animation, in this practical and creative workshop with Danielle Rhoda","byline":"","body":"<ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-animation-with-danielle-rhoda-tickets-396741613847\">Book now</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Think about the roster of feature films being released this year.

The European Central Bank recently raised its main <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/21/european-central-bank-raises-interest-rates-for-first-time-in-11-years\">interest rate by 0.5 percentage points</a> and US Federal Reserve has rapidly raised rates to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/fed-increase-interest-rates-inflation\">range of 2.25% to 2.5%</a>.</p> \n<p>Most economists support such efforts to bring down inflation, but there are growing calls for restraint as economies head for recession and unemployment levels rise, depressing business and consumer spending without the need for further interest rate rises.</p> \n<p>Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said there was little evidence of widespread inflation-busting pay rises feared by the central bank, adding: “The view that underlying inflationary pressures are on the rise rests on limited foundations.”</p> \n<p>Economist Danny Blanchflower, a former MPC member, said the Bank had miscalculated the weakness of the British economy, which was poised for a deep recession and needed lower not higher interest rates.</p> \n<p>Debt charities urged the government to provide further subsidies for low-income households after an increasing number had turned to high-cost credit to keep afloat. Stepchange said the increase in borrowing costs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/bank-of-england-interest-rate-rise-first-time-home-buyers-credit-card-finances\">which push up mortgage and rent charges</a>, “will increase the pressure on households trying to keep up with their bills and avoid a problem debt situation”.</p> \n<p>The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the government had “lost control of the economy, with skyrocketing inflation set to continue, while mortgage and borrowing rates continue to rise”.</p> \n<p>Labour accused Johnson and his chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, of being “missing in action” as the cost of living crisis deepened. Zahawi was also away from Westminster when the rate rise was announced, accompanying his family who are on holiday – though the chancellor insisted he was not.</p> \n<p>In a statement, he said: “There is no such thing as a holiday and not working. I never had that in the private sector, nor in government. Ask any entrepreneur and they can tell you that.”</p> \n<p>Treasury officials said Zahawi and Bailey discussed the economic impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on global energy prices, which they agreed during a phone conversation was the “primary driver of inflation”.</p> \n<p>Eight MPC members voted for the 0.5% rise in interest rates, leaving Silvana Tenreyro the only member to support a smaller 0.25% increase. The MPC said inflationary pressures in the UK and the rest of Europe had intensified significantly since the Bank’s last review in May, largely reflecting “a near doubling in wholesale gas prices since May, owing to Russia’s restriction of gas supplies to Europe and the risk of further curbs”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian&nbsp;business&nbsp;email sign-up\"> \n <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It said higher energy costs would be responsible for half the 13.3% annual inflation rate in October, with global supply chain bottlenecks accounting for much of the rest.</p> \n<p>In addition to raising interest, the MPC also signalled that it would tighten policy accelerating the unwinding the money-creation process known as quantitative easing.</p> \n<p>Between 2009 and the start of the pandemic in 2020 the Bank bought £895bn of government and corporate bonds in an attempt to support the economy but is now planning to sell bonds at a rate of £10bn a quarter over the next year.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-un-to-investigate-pow-deaths-us-ratifies-sweden-and-finland-nato-bids","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T18:21:41Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv calls Amnesty report that says Ukrainian forces are putting civilians at risk a ‘perversion’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-un-to-investigate-pow-deaths-us-ratifies-sweden-and-finland-nato-bids","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-un-to-investigate-pow-deaths-us-ratifies-sweden-and-finland-nato-bids","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Kyiv calls Amnesty report that says Ukrainian forces are putting civilians at risk a ‘perversion’ – as it happened","trailText":"Kyiv hits back after charity says Russia’s attacks ‘unjustifiable’ but Ukraine’s tactics are endangering civilians.

It’s a powerful economy. So [it] can politically, economically influence Russia. And China is [also a] permanent member of the UN security council.” So far, China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion and Xi Jinping told Putin it would support Russia’s “sovereignty and security”.</li> <li><strong>Amnesty International has said the Ukrainian army is endangering the life of civilians by basing itself in residential areas, in a <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/08/ukraine-ukrainian-fighting-tactics-endanger-civilians/\">report</a> rejected by Ukrainian government representatives as placing blame on it for Russia’s invasion. </strong>The human rights group’s researchers found that Ukrainian forces were using some schools and hospitals as bases, firing near houses and sometimes living in residential flats.

The ship has been inspected by members of the joint coordination centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosphorus Strait “shortly”.</li> <li><strong>Ukraine failed to stop a Syrian-flagged vessel claimed to be carrying stolen Ukrainian grain from leaving Lebanon. </strong>The Lebanese government reported on Thursday that the Syrian-flagged Laodicea had left its territorial waters, despite appeals from Kyiv to reverse a court decision allowing its departure.

Here is the latest from our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine.</strong><br></p> <ul> <li><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/un-to-investigate-prison-attack-that-killed-dozens-of-ukraine-prisoners-of-war\">UN is conducting a fact-finding mission</a> in response to requests from both Russia and Ukraine after 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an explosion at a barracks in separatist-controlled Olenivka. </strong>The warring nations have accused each other of carrying out the attack. Ukraine claims it was a special operation plotted in advance by the Kremlin, and carried out by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group. Russia’s defence ministry, however, claims the Ukrainian military used US-supplied rockets to strike the prison.</li> <li><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wants to talk directly to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in the hope China can use its influence with Russia to bring the war to an end. </strong>According to a report in the South China Morning Post, Zelenskiy said: “It’s a very powerful state. It’s a powerful economy. So (it) can politically, economically influence Russia. And China is [also a] permanent member of the UN security council.” So far, China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion and its president, Xi Jinping, told Putin it would support Russia’s “sovereignty and security”.</li> <li><strong>The US Senate has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/nato-sweden-finland-us-russia-ukraine\">ratified Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato</a>, voting 95-1 in support.</strong> The US is the 23rd member state to ratify what would be the most significant expansion of the 30-member alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This historic vote sends an important signal of the sustained, bipartisan US commitment to Nato, and to ensuring our alliance is prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow,” the president, Joe Biden, said in a statement. All 30 Nato members must ratify the accession before Finland and Sweden can become members.</li> <li><strong>Ukraine is pulling out its 40 peacekeepers from the Nato-led mission in Kosovo, which totals 3,800 members, according to Ukrainian news.</strong> In March, Zelenskiy issued a decree for all missions to return to Ukraine to support the war.</li> <li><strong>The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog has again appealed for access to a Ukrainian nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces to determine whether it was a source of danger.</strong> Contact with the Europe’s largest nuclear plant, which is at Zaporizhzhia and is being operated by Ukrainian technicians under occupation, was “fragile” and communications did not function every day, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi told a Swiss newspaper.</li> <li><strong>The first shipment of grain to leave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. </strong>The Sierra Leone-registered ship Razoni set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the UN. The ship has been inspected by members of the joint coordination centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosphorus Strait “shortly”.</li> <li><strong>Ukraine failed to stop a Syrian-flagged vessel claimed to be carrying stolen Ukrainian grain from leaving Lebanon. </strong> The Lebanese government reported on Thursday that the Syrian-flagged Laodicea had left its territorial waters, despite appeals from Kyiv to reverse a court decision allowing its departure. Russia has denied stealing the grain on the ship, which was reported to be sailing to its ally, Syria.</li> <li><strong>The UN has said that there have been over 10m border crossings into and out of Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion of the country on 24 February.</strong> Data gathered by the UNHCR states that 6,180,345 individual refugees from Ukraine are now recorded across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a>. Ukraine’s neighbours have taken the largest individual numbers. Poland has 1.25 million refugees.</li> <li><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has branded “disgusting” the behaviour of the ex German chancellor Gerhard Schröder. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/ex-german-chancellor-gerhard-schroder-under-fire-for-meeting-putin\"> The former German leader has come under fire</a>, after he went on holiday to Moscow and had a private meeting with Vladimir Putin.

This is what we know so far.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The UN is conducting a fact-finding mission in response to requests from both Russia and Ukraine after 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an explosion at a barracks in separatist-controlled Olenivka</strong>. The warring nations have accused each other of carrying out the attack. Ukraine claims it was a special operation plotted in advance by the Kremlin, and carried out by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group. Russia’s defence ministry, however, claims the Ukrainian military used US-supplied rockets to strike the prison.</li> <li><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wants to talk directly to China’s leader, Xi Jinping</strong>,<strong> </strong>in the hope China can use its influence with Russia to bring the war to an end. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, Zelenskiy said: “It’s a very powerful state. It’s a powerful economy. So (it) can politically, economically influence Russia. And China is [also a] permanent member of the UN security council.” So far, China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion and its president, Xi Jinping, told Putin it would support Russia’s “sovereignty and security”.</li> <li><strong>The US Senate has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/nato-sweden-finland-us-russia-ukraine\">ratified Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato</a>, voting 95-1 in support</strong>. The US is the 23rd member state to ratify what would be the most significant expansion of the 30-member alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This historic vote sends an important signal of the sustained, bipartisan US commitment to Nato, and to ensuring our alliance is prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow,” the president, Joe Biden, said in a statement. All 30 Nato members must ratify the accession before Finland and Sweden can become members.</li> <li><strong>Ukraine is pulling out its 40 peacekeepers from the Nato-led mission in Kosovo</strong>, which totals 3,800 members, according to Ukraine news. In March, Zelenskiy issued a decree for all missions to return to Ukraine to support the war.</li> <li><strong>A Russian official in Ukraine has claimed Ukrainian forces are using western arms to attack the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant</strong>. Europe’s largest nuclear plant is now controlled by Russian forces and being used as a military base, according to Reuters. However, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Ukrainian forces are not firing against Russian forces “lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant”. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield accounts from either side of the war.</li> <li><strong>The first shipment of grain to leave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. </strong>The Sierra Leone-registered ship Razoni set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the UN. The ship has been inspected by members of the joint coordination centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosphorus Strait “shortly”.</li> <li><strong>The Ukrainian president has dismissed the importance of the first grain export shipment from his country since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> invaded, saying it was carrying a fraction of the crop Kyiv must sell to help salvage its shattered economy. </strong>In<strong> </strong>downbeat comments, Zelenskiy, via video to students in Australia on Wednesday, said more time was needed to see whether other grain shipments would follow.</li> <li><strong>The UN has said that there have been over 10m border crossings into and out of Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion of the country on 24 February. </strong>Data gathered by the UNHCR states that 6,180,345 individual refugees from Ukraine are now recorded across <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a>.

Davie was director of audio and music from 2008 to 2012, including having responsibility for its radio stations, before doing a brief first stint as the acting director general in 2012-13.</p> <p>The internal report follows an investigation by the Guardian and BBC News which published allegations of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour made by several women against Westwood, 64. He denied all the allegations, with a spokesperson saying they were “completely false” and there had never been any complaints against him “officially or unofficially”.<br><br>The BBC said it had now appointed an independent barrister, Gemma White QC, to lead a broader review to “fully examine” what was known about concerns regarding Westwood’s conduct during his 19-year career at the corporation.<br><br>The BBC board’s senior independent director, Sir Nicholas Serota, said: “In light of the BBC’s internal review, I believe that there may have been occasions in the past when the BBC should have further explored issues that were being raised.<br><br>“It now appears there are allegations against Tim Westwood dating to before, during and after his employment with the BBC and also elsewhere. The BBC is willing to work with any other employers in order to fully establish what happened.”<br><br>The corporation said it was in contact with the Metropolitan police and that appropriate information would be passed to them. It comes as the Met is understood to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/04/met-investigating-sexual-offence-allegations-against-tim-westwood\">investigating four reports of alleged sexual offences</a> against Westwood, two of which date back to the 1980s, and the other two in 2010 and 2016.<br><br>Westwood stepped down from his show on Capital Xtra in April after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/26/dj-tim-westwood-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-by-multiple-women?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other&amp;utm_source=ground.news&amp;utm_medium=referral\">seven women accused him of sexual misconduct and predatory behaviour</a> in the joint Guardian/BBC News investigation.<br><br>Ten more women made claims of sexual abuse, sexual misconduct and inappropriate behaviour in a further joint investigation in July. The report included a claim from a woman who said Westwood first had sex with her when she was 14 and he was in his 30s, in the early 1990s.</p> <p>The BBC admitted in July that it had received six complaints of alleged bullying and sexual misconduct relating to when the DJ was an employee, some of them received after publication of the first Guardian/BBC News stories.</p> <p>In its review published on Thursday, the BBC said it received two reports of sexual misconduct against Westwood in 2012, which were included in logs set up to record allegations in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.<br><br>One was an allegation made in October 2012 that Westwood had made inappropriate sexual remarks to a 15-year-old girl at a non-BBC event in 2007, which was passed to the police. The report said: “The person did not wish to provide the details of the witness, but confirmed that they were willing to speak to the police. This allegation was passed to the police in October 2012, who in May 2013 indicated they would take no further action in relation to it.”<br><br>The other report related to a press inquiry by a newspaper seeking comment from the BBC in November 2012 about a rumour of sexual misconduct against Westwood.<br><br>The review also found that two sets of internal complaints were made about Westwood’s behaviour, with one set complaining in 2011 and 2012 about the DJ’s alleged use of sexualised and inappropriate comments while on air.<br><br>Of a further report, the review added: “There was also an allegation in 2012 that Tim Westwood had created a toxic atmosphere amongst those he worked with at the BBC. A member of BBC staff recalls speaking to Tim Westwood about this at this time and that Tim Westwood denied all of the allegations made.”<br><br>The review found that further complaints were made about Westwood after the Guardian/BBC News investigation in April. It said these included a report from a BBC staff member who alleged Westwood had sexually assaulted a woman at a BBC-linked event in the mid-2000s. The person recalled reporting the matter at the time to someone at the BBC but they could not remember who or the precise year.<br><br>The BBC said it also received reports from two women alleging sexual assault by Westwood in the 1980s before his employment at the BBC. A third woman described a consensual sexual encounter with Westwood in the mid-2000s at a non-BBC event, which she now considers to have been inappropriate.<br><br>The BBC also noted that there were complaints made by the public in the past concerning the content of some of Westwood’s programmes, but said these did not form part of the internal review.<br><br>White, supported by the law firm Linklaters, will aim to complete her investigation in six months. The BBC has said it is willing to work with Westwood’s other employers, which include MTV and Capital Xtra’s owner, Global, to fully establish what happened.<br><br>Westwood denied all the allegations in the original investigation, with a spokesperson for him saying there had never been any complaints against him “officially or unofficially”. He did not respond to the allegations when contacted during the second investigation. He was approached for comment on Thursday.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/04/johnny-depp-and-jeff-beck-accused-of-stealing-incarcerated-mans-poem-for-album","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T18:13:37Z","webTitle":"Johnny Depp and Jeff Beck accused of stealing incarcerated man’s poem for album","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/04/johnny-depp-and-jeff-beck-accused-of-stealing-incarcerated-mans-poem-for-album","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/04/johnny-depp-and-jeff-beck-accused-of-stealing-incarcerated-mans-poem-for-album","fields":{"headline":"Johnny Depp and Jeff Beck accused of stealing incarcerated man’s poem for album","trailText":"A song from the pair’s 18 album appears to take several lines verbatim from Hobo Ben by Slim Wilson without giving credit","byline":"Laura Snapes","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/johnnydepp\">Johnny Depp</a> and Jeff Beck have been accused of stealing lyrics from a poem by an incarcerated man on their collaborative album, 18, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/johnny-depp-jeff-beck-sad-motherfuckin-parade-hobo-ben-1392180/\">Rolling Stone reports</a>.</p> <p>The song Sad Motherfuckin’ Parade appears to take several lines from Hobo Ben, a poem and song by Slim Wilson, the alias of a self-proclaimed cheat and pimp who served time for murder and armed robbery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/14/jeff-beck-and-johnny-depp-18-review-a-dull-display-of-colossal-self-pity\">Jeff Beck and Johnny Depp: 18 review – a dull display of colossal self-pity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1964, while in Missouri State Penitentiary, Wilson met the folklorist Bruce Jackson, who documented his poetry and toasts – a comic form of narrative Black folk poetry, akin to hobo balladry – for his 1974 book on the latter artform, Get Your Ass in the Water and Swim Like Me, accompanied two years later by an album of the same name in which Slim performed his works.</p> <p>In the toast Hobo Ben, the titular wanderer asks the hosts of a party:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Ladies of culture and beauty so refined, is there one among you that would grant me wine?</em></p> <p><em>I’m raggedy I know, but I have no stink</em></p> <p><em>And God bless the lady that’ll buy me a drink.</em></p> <p><em>Heavy-hipted Hattie turned to Nadine with a laugh</em></p> <p><em>And said, ‘What that funky motherfucker really need, child, is a bath.’</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Several lines from the song appear in Depp and Beck’s Sad Motherfuckin’ Parade, including the title, “I’m raggedy, I know, but I have no stink”, “God bless the lady that’ll buy me a drink”, and “What that funky motherfucker really needs, child, is a bath”.</p> <p>“The only two lines I could find in the whole piece that [Depp and Beck] contributed are ‘Big time motherfucker’ and ‘Bust it down to my level,’” Jackson, a professor at the University of Buffalo, told Rolling Stone.</p> <p>“Everything else is from Slim’s performance in my book. I’ve never encountered anything like this. I’ve been publishing stuff for 50 years, and this is the first time anybody has just ripped something off and put his own name on it.”</p> <p>The liner notes to the album credit Beck and Depp as the sole songwriters.

Her last role, before Covid hit, was as Irene Ruddock in Alan Bennett’s A Lady of Letters, at what by then had become the Leeds Playhouse. She had stints on television shows such as Emmerdale Farm, Heartbeat and The Royal, and her film work included Wetherby (1985) with another Vanessa (Redgrave).</p> <p>Later she wrote for radio and stage, including 28 plays for the BBC, some broadcast on Afternoon Theatre and Woman’s Hour. In 2008 she created Writing the Century for BBC Radio 4, a history of the 20<sup>th</sup> century told through unpublished letters, diaries and memoirs. One of her plays, Bye Bye Miss American High, was nominated for a Bafta in 2001. She and her play Exchanges in Bialystock were chosen to represent the UK for the European Broadcasting Union in 2003 in Helsinki. She was writer in residence at King’s College London in 2013.</p> <p>Vanessa was a passionate supporter of the arts. Exasperated at the lack of opportunity for older actors, in 2000 she founded the Yellow Leaf theatre company with Alan Meadows and Chris Wilkinson. The company wrote and performed many plays nationwide and in 2013 travelled to Jerusalem, where they presented my mother’s play Karen’s Way, an exploration of the Kinderstransport, to full houses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eedd72cdd2c07cf19a2ff93c6b59c9518cb6b413\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eedd72cdd2c07cf19a2ff93c6b59c9518cb6b413/0_4_893_1115/801.jpg\" alt=\"Vanessa Rosenthal\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vanessa Rosenthal in 1964, aged 21</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: from family/UNKNOWN USE AT OWN RISK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vanessa was born in Manchester. Her mother, Hilda, a Lancastrian from an Anglican background, had converted to Judaism in 1938 to marry Leonard Rosenthal, a GP of Russian decent. At that time, this was highly unusual and a shock to both communities. My grandfather’s family sat Shiva, the Jewish mourning ritual, on the eve of their wedding. This was a love match that withstood the storm of disapproval. Nevertheless, Vanessa’s quest to belong was an essential part of her life.</p> <p>She attended Manchester girls’ high school, where her determination to act grew, before heading to London, and the Central School of Speech and Drama, in 1962.</p> <p>Leeds became Vanessa’s home after she met, and in 1966 married, Jim Walsh, who became registrar of Leeds University in 1971. They had two daughters: my sister, Emilia, and me. Somehow, my mother managed to merge her lives as an actor and wife of the registrar – in university circles she was regarded as somewhat exotic.</p> <p>During lockdown my mother wrote her autobiography, Inside Out (A Life in Stages), documenting her life’s work and her journey of reconciliation with her Jewish faith, as, in her own words, “an insufficiently Jewish Jew”. She was a glorious storyteller, intellectually curious, always interested in whoever came into her life and passionately caring for friends and strangers alike.</p> <p>Jim died in 2008.

As the Premier League enters its third season of cut-and-shut schedules, relegated again to an insistent voice at the edge of larger things, it is tempting to wonder exactly when this state of flux is going to end; at what point the self-proclaimed world’s most important league will ever find its way back from the dark place. Or, indeed, if things will ever quite be the same again.</p> \n<p>It has, let’s face it, been three years now. A competition that predicates its existence on hogging the foreground, on being not the B-flick or the short but the <em>Premier,</em> will once again find itself frazzled by some truly mind-boggling logistics.</p> \n<p>In common with every other league, and indeed every other life, the last time the English top tier was able to contemplate an unclouded future was the pre-Covid lull of early 2020. The years since have brought a total shutdown, a summer half-life, a Super League insurrection, a winter of firebreak talk and cancelled dates and the enforced sale of one of its defining member clubs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/04/manchester-united-erik-ten-hag-journey-not-revolution\">There will be no immediate Ten Hag revolution at United.

More than any other competition the Premier League voice is all about control and certainty, about days and weeks – Super Sundays, Monday Nights, a complete televisual white-out from September to May – dominated by that in-house tone of homogenised triumphalism. Like it or not, that voice has become a little wrung-out, the matinee idol presence a little stretched, bow tie askew, clinging to the balustrade.</p> \n<p>As the league kicks into gear on Friday at Selhurst Park it is worth taking a moment to appreciate exactly how this thing is going to play out from here. Welcome to the season with a hole in it, 10 months during which the entire calendar must remain spinning in place, like a flywheel detached from its gears, while an enforced winter World Cup plays out. Stranger things have happened in the past three years of dissolution, but this is going to stretch everyone involved to their outer limits.</p> \n<p>The first instalment, which we might call block 1, extends from 6 August to 17 September, a run of eight Premier League games and two Champions League rounds. After that we have two quick-fire international friendlies, the last warmups before Qatar.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4d0ac10ab954cd2474734de58d91e4edfd086b4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4d0ac10ab954cd2474734de58d91e4edfd086b4/0_179_3424_2055/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aston Villa’s John McGinn (left) challenges Brighton and Hove Albion’s Tariq Lamptey during the Premier League match at the AMEX Stadium, Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Could a mid-table team with fewer World Cup players, like Brighton or Villa, be able to push for Europe?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is followed by block 3 from 1 October to 5 November, eight more league games and four more in the Champions League. Block 4 is the World Cup itself, a quick change to Arabian Standard Time and a maximum of seven matches between 21 November and 18 December. Then it’s back to the northern winter and Block 5, three Premier League games in a week from Boxing Day to 2 January. At which point the season is free to emerge gasping and wheezing, clinging to the nearest rock, and wondering exactly what just happened.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"23beff30-7484-43ab-8039-7f01c9b3346e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Chelsea 2 Hull 1<br></b><b>15 August 2009<br></b>Stephen Hunt’s tap-in gave visitors Hull a surprise lead, but a delightful double by Didier Drogba (pictured) – a 25-yard dipping free-kick and a deft dinked finish – clinched a last-gasp triumph for&nbsp;Chelsea.</p>\n    <p><b>Man Utd 1 Swansea 2<br></b><b>16 August 2014<br></b>Ki Sung-yueng struck first for Swansea, capping off a wonderful team move.

Take, for example, Harry Kane, who tends to play every game he can, as well as some he can’t. In the next five months Kane could feature in up to 34 matches under three different world orders – Premier League, Uefa, Fifa – crisscrossing the UK, mainland Europe and the Gulf. There will, of course, be teams of analysts studying how to peak through this period, when to rest those red-zoning muscles fibres. But there are also endless unintended consequences.</p> \n<p>England’s provisional World Cup squad is due to be announced on 21 October, with three league games and two in the Champions League still to play. This has never happened before, the league season skewed like this by outside pressures. How will it affect players and selections? Are you really going to give 200% over 94 minutes against Wolves away if your knee has started to click and the Qatar 2022 final squad date is three days away?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2022/aug/04/premier-league-season-preview-part-two-football-weekly\">Premier League season preview: Leicester to Wolves – Football Weekly</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The same goes for after the World Cup. Players discharged in the first 10 days will be thrumming up through the gears for the restart. Lose a semi-final and there will be some broken souls coming back to take up the slack. Last season Mohamed Salah scored 23 in 26 before the African Nations Cup, and eight in 28 afterwards. Never mind Covid. Never mind the post-World Cup transfer madness coming to mid-season for the first time. This already looks like the most fevered of times.</p> \n<p>It should be a source of unrest too. Part of the great public uprising last summer was the idea the European Super League would destroy the structures of the domestic season. Take a look at the shockwaves from Qatar 2022 and it seems pretty clear the same forces in another guise – the greed of nation-state football, as opposed to the greed of the cartel clubs – have achieved the same thing from a different angle.</p> \n<p>And while there is currently nothing in place to prevent next season becoming a return, four years on, to untroubled waters it is easy to feel a little sceptical. Another Super League brouhaha, another act of force majeure, some other ripple, some other break. Time continues to pass. It seems a reasonable question. Have we already seen the best of this thing?</p> \n<p>This is perhaps an unduly doom-laden, fin-de-siècle view. There is still a vast hunger for Premier League product, and a ringfenced broadcast income. Even during the in-between years the standard and the level of interest has remained remarkably high. But looking forward to what might actually happen, there are still some notes of unease.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e4e1e9a859b33e10eb9f3bcf633d106507485a2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4e1e9a859b33e10eb9f3bcf633d106507485a2/0_576_8640_5184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Norway not qualifying for the World Cup, Erling Haaland may benefit from the mid-season break.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Norway not qualifying for the World Cup, Erling Haaland may benefit from the mid-season break.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On one hand the Premier League field seems strong as ever. On the other Spurs have spent large parts of the summer as third favourites to win it. The change of ownership at Chelsea has thinned the field, in a league where Manchester City’s title dominance is in danger of becoming a little humdrum for the neutral.</p> \n<p>The Premier League is, we hear (most often from the Premier League) never stale and never staid. Perhaps the new season can present us with something genuinely valuable, if not new champions then new challengers, a bolter from the pack energised by these outside forces.</p> \n<p>It still seems odd to suggest a Manchester United revival might make for an appealing underdog story, although Erik ten Hag’s early clarity has already been undermined by a familiar whiff of rotten, celebrified club culture. Arsenal have recruited well but remain, in the end, Arsenal. Perhaps a team with fewer World Cup players, Aston Villa or Crystal Palace or Brighton, might make a genuine play for the top four.</p> \n<p>Otherwise Liverpool will still be very strong. City will be challenged by an intriguing tactical retread around that startling new presence up front. But they will also benefit from the World Cup break: the Pep-Erling interface is likely to be defined by some furious work over those few weeks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the other end it is hard to look past at least two promoted clubs struggling, and some further oscillation from Everton, as well as Leeds who are hard to call either way.</p> \n<p>Beyond this we can enjoy the benefits of five substitutes being used, and some younger refereeing appointments. Plus, in a note of reassuring normality, there is once again a new ball. The Nike Flight is basically the same as the previous ball. That AerowSculpt technology is still “giving a truer flight”. But the ball will also carry markings that hark back to the first ever Premier League ball in 1992.</p> \n<p>It feels like an oddly calming note of nostalgia in strange times. Keep moving forward. This too will pass. But not without another season of living dangerously.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/04/the-guardian-view-on-liz-trusss-new-backers-dont-delude-yourselves","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T17:59:41Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Liz Truss’s new backers: don’t delude yourselves | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/the-guardian-view-on-liz-trusss-new-backers-dont-delude-yourselves","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/04/the-guardian-view-on-liz-trusss-new-backers-dont-delude-yourselves","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Liz Truss’s new backers: don’t delude yourselves","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> More moderate Tories are endorsing the frontrunner in the leadership race in order to be on the winning side. They will not have much influence","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>There are no prizes for working out why Sajid Javid has just become the latest senior Conservative to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/03/sajid-javid-endorses-liz-truss-in-fresh-blow-to-rishi-sunaks-campaign\" title=\"\">endorse Liz Truss</a> in the party leadership contest against Rishi Sunak. Mr Javid is backing Ms Truss because he thinks she is going to win. He wants his slice of the ministerial action if she does. He has therefore put his earlier alliance with Mr Sunak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2022/jul/06/sajid-javid-resignation-speech-boris-johnson-video\" title=\"\">against Boris Johnson’s leadership</a> aside. It is as simple as that.</p> <p>By doing this, the former health secretary and chancellor has joined the list of prominent Tories who have decided which way the wind is blowing and backed Ms Truss, even though they do not particularly share her politics. Besides Mr Javid, that list now includes the trade minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/01/penny-mordaunt-backs-liz-truss-in-contest-to-be-next-tory-leader\" title=\"\">Penny Mordaunt</a> and the one nation Tory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/rishi-sunak-admits-it-was-silly-to-say-he-had-no-working-class-friends\" title=\"\">Tom Tugendhat</a>, both of whom are relative moderates who ran for the leadership, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/29/ben-wallace-attacks-rishi-sunak-cabinet-resignation-after-backing-truss\" title=\"\">Ben Wallace,</a> the defence secretary, whom many wanted to run and who still tops <a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2022/08/01/our-cabinet-league-table-wallace-top-truss-up-mercer-comes-in-third-and-dorries-falls-to-last/\" title=\"\">internal polls </a>of ministerial popularity. All of them, it is clear, are hoping for good jobs in a Truss cabinet.</p> <p>Being ready to work with people with whom one does not always agree is one of the preconditions of political life on all sides. But Mr Javid and the others need to ask themselves what they are getting into. The Conservative party to which Ms Truss appeals, and of which a majority at the moment looks likely to choose her as the country’s next leader, sees the world very differently and has very different priorities from several of those who have now jumped on the Truss bandwagon.</p> <p>A YouGov poll of <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/08/03/more-our-conservative-members-poll\" title=\"\">Conservative members</a> this week showed 67% who think the government is already spending enough on the National Health Service, 60% who want the next prime minister to delay Britain’s commitment to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and 75% who support deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda. The same poll also found that 53% of Tory members do not think Mr Johnson should have been forced to resign anyway, with a majority still seeing him as a better leader than either Ms Truss or Mr Sunak.</p> <p>If we also take account of the previously recorded popularity among Tory members for early tax cuts as a faith-based solution to Britain’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/03/the-guardian-view-on-the-economy-a-mess-the-bank-is-making-worse\" title=\"\">economic woes</a>, and the large and enduring majority for Brexit, it all adds up to a very right-of-centre party, with a very right-of-centre agenda that is about to elect a very right-of-centre leader. It is also <a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2022/08/04/conhomes-tory-leadership-election-survey-truss-58-per-cent-sunak-26-per-cent-12-per-cent-undecided/\" title=\"\">consistent</a> in its views. The party that elected Mr Johnson by around two-to-one over Jeremy Hunt in 2019 appears on course to back Ms Truss by a similar margin.</p> <p>One of the crucial tests of Ms Truss, if she becomes leader, will be whether she governs for that grassroots base and that worldview. If she does, the writing is now clearly on the wall for what this will mean. Unlike Mr Johnson, who managed to leverage his popularity in the party to embrace a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/22/tories-cake-stuffed-boris-johnson-covid-restrictions-freedom\" title=\"\">cakeist</a> policy of, for example, NHS spending and tax cuts financed by further borrowing, Ms Truss has shown little or no sign of unorthodoxy. With a general election looming, moreover, she is likely to play to her strengths with the membership.</p> <p>There will not be much room for alternative thinking from some of those who have now given her their backing. Good luck to them in their wish for cabinet posts. But their presence around the table is unlikely to change the reality, which was also the reality of the Johnson cabinet over the past three years – of a government chosen more for its ideological loyalty than for its ability. It is a path that Ms Truss will not alter even if she wishes to. Theirs is a party soaked in various forms of denialism about the problems facing Britain, the solutions that are required and the country’s place in the world. This will not be the new start that the Tory party needed.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2022/aug/04/edinburgh-fringe-performers-pitch-tents-and-caravans-as-rents-in-the-city-double","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T17:59:15Z","webTitle":"Edinburgh fringe performers pitch tents and caravans as rents in the city double","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/04/edinburgh-fringe-performers-pitch-tents-and-caravans-as-rents-in-the-city-double","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/aug/04/edinburgh-fringe-performers-pitch-tents-and-caravans-as-rents-in-the-city-double","fields":{"headline":"Edinburgh fringe performers pitch tents and caravans as rents in the city double","trailText":"Comics say they are being priced out, with venue directors warning that future of the event is under threat","byline":"Rachel Hall","body":"<p>Tony Law has been coming to the Edinburgh fringe to perform for 20 years, but he’s never had an experience quite like this year.</p> <p>Law is staying in a caravan on a working farmyard outside the city with his 13-year-old son, Atticus, and their German shepherd, Wolfie, after accommodation close to fringe venues doubled in price.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/16/edinburgh-fringe-unaffordable-for-many-young-performers-says-brian-cox\">Edinburgh fringe unaffordable for many young performers, says Brian Cox</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Law is an established comedian with a strong fanbase, and unlike many performers is expecting to make a profit from his performances. Yet he almost didn’t come this year because of accommodation costs – until a last-minute save from a friend with a caravan and a connection to a farmer willing to lease out his land – and he is unsure that he will return next year.</p> <p>“If you’re 22 and you’re able to stay in a flat with 7,000 people you can maybe make it work. It’s fine for them or for Ricky Gervais but for other performers, I’m not sure,” he said, adding that he is unable to pick up lucrative last-minute work on compilation shows because of the half-hour drive into town.</p> <p>Law is one of many performers who have opted for extreme measures to make ends meet at the fringe this year. Many feel priced out by accommodation costs which have soared as a result of tenancy reforms incentivising university students to hold on to their accommodation over the summer months, combined with cost of living rises.</p> <p>This is likely to be further exacerbated by proposals aimed at limiting the number of Airbnb-style lets in Edinburgh, which have been recently approved by Scottish ministers.</p> <p>While both sets of reforms bring benefits to local people, performers are concerned that, without loopholes for the fringe, working-class comics may be deprived of an important platform for their work and access to industry insiders.</p> <p>Speaking at a gala to celebrate 40 years of Assembly, one of the big four fringe venues, its director, William Burdett-Coutts, warned that “the future of the event is threatened by accommodation prices”. He called for a “serious debate about how this all works and how to find solutions to the problems faced by this festival”.</p> <p>Sian Davies, who runs Best in Class, which showcases working-class comedians at the fringe and provides crowdfunded grants to support them with their costs, said everybody she had spoken to had noticed that accommodation costs had “skyrocketed” this year, and many were reevaluating how regularly they should come, if at all.</p> <p>“It’s pricing people out, and you’re already on the back foot if you’re from a working-class environment,” said Davies. “You’ll end up with a fringe which is even more homogenous and middle-class. If one type of performer is here at the world’s biggest festival then all of TV and radio is just that. This is where deals are done and people are picked up.”</p> <p>Davies added that this is resulting in a “two-tier” system in which people staying on campsites have less access to the networking and paid opportunities.</p> <p>This is the case for Samantha Day, a full-time comedian who is staying on a campsite 45 minutes by bus outside the festival for the first fortnight. The site is so popular that she has to move for the second fortnight to an area without a bus link.</p> <p>“All the comedians I know are really nervous about their shows, I’m much more nervous about logistics. Will I have to walk home for four miles at 1am? It adds a layer of complexity,” she said.</p> <p>The fringe is aware of the challenges performers are facing, and has formed a partnership with universities in the city to offer 1,200 rooms this year for £280 or less a week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A spokesperson noted that short-term accommodation costs were increasing across the UK, including in Edinburgh, but said that the fringe continues “to lobby local government, universities and student accommodation providers to set aside affordable rooms for our artists”.</p> <p>Many performers feel that their future at the fringe is unsustainable unless more is done to support them with accommodation costs, given that many already leave with considerable debts from putting on shows.</p> <p>Sarah Archer is staying with three other performers in her comedy drama Three Women and Shakespeare’s Will in a tent outside town after her Airbnb from last year doubled its price.

In January, a 13-year-old from Darlington became the youngest person to be convicted of terrorism offences. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/04/teachers-fear-missing-signs-far-right-radicalisation-pupils-england\" title=\"\">Teachers and headteachers are struggling</a> to deal with the kinds of language and attitudes that pupils come across on their devices and then bring into classrooms.</p> <p>Given that 19 out of 20 children arrested last year for terrorism offences were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/03/revealed-uk-children-ensnared-far-right-ecosystem-online\" title=\"\">linked to extreme rightwing ideology</a>, the suggestion made in a leaked draft of William Shawcross’s review of the Prevent programme that far-right activists have received disproportionate attention compared with Islamists seems highly questionable – at least with regard to young people. When the review is finalised it should address teachers’ concerns. These relate to the tools available to tackle a growing problem, as well as the problem itself. Safeguarding training for education professionals, youth workers and others must extend to recognising where pupils have been harmed by material seen or read online. These adults need the confidence and knowledge to engage with and challenge young people – mostly teenagers – when they display such influences.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/06/uk-online-safety-bill-parliament-power-struggle\" title=\"\">online safety bill</a> has a crucial role. For too long children have been unprotected in virtual spaces. Whatever happens when the bill returns to parliament in the autumn, new rules compelling social platforms to ensure children do not encounter specified forms of inappropriate content, and obliging them to tell Ofcom how they will achieve this, should receive cross-party support. Businesses must be held accountable for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/03/former-facebook-employee-frances-haugen-identifies-herself-as-whistleblower\" title=\"\">the part algorithms can play in radicalisation</a> of various kinds, by amplifying what may begin as a user’s curiosity – expressed in a search term – into a preoccupation or fixation.</p> <p>This whole terrain remains complex and contested. Analysing the connections between, for example, the widespread availability of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jul/31/the-knock-that-tears-families-apart-they-were-at-the-door-telling-me-he-had-accessed-indecent-images-of-children\" title=\"\">violent internet pornography</a> and misogynistic attitudes “in real life” is not a straightforward task. While concerns around far-right extremism do of course include the potential for such ideas to be acted out, for example in violent attacks on minorities, it is not possible to draw a simple line between online and offline. Particularly in the lives of young people who have grown up with the internet, the two are intermingled.</p> <p>In the words of the radicalisation expert Prof Paul Jackson, the reality today is “much more messy” than models of far-right culture and organisation based on 20th-century events. The proliferation of highly discriminatory language and behaviour across the digital landscape must not be conflated with the threat of terrorism. But nor should anyone be blase about its impact – particularly on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/03/it-felt-so-powerful-how-i-was-seduced-by-the-uk-far-right\" title=\"\">minority of boys who are most susceptible</a>. Shielding young people from toxic ideologies and conspiracy theories is an urgent safeguarding issue.

It looked unassuming from the street but inside it was spectacular. Each room was generously portioned and flooded with light. Just being in the house seemed to elevate my mood, and make me feel clear and calm. But the most amazing thing was the outlook. It was on the harbour, with views that went right out to Manly. And not only that – it had two swimming pools, one that sat invitingly just outside the patio, decked with expensive furniture, while the second was at the garden’s edge – a harbour pool.</p> <p>A real estate agent materialised by my side as I marvelled at an en suite bigger than my flat.

My cheeks were getting red from trying to direct the words out my nose. Ugh!! I had to get out!! I turned on my heels and left with what I hoped was a convincing hauteur. On the street I burst out laughing. Rich people are absurd, I thought. Two swimming pools!</p> <p>I assumed that would be the end of it, but having been given my phone number for contact tracing purposes, the agent called me regularly over the next two weeks.</p> <p>Sometimes it took a while for the penny to drop and I’d be speaking normally, through my mouth, my mind whirling – Tom? Tom? That is until he started talking about other properties I might like – ones with six bedrooms, a boathouse, a private jetty, a tennis court, two tennis courts! Homes bigger than the<em> tiny box</em> I had seen at the open for inspection. Homes that were $10m, $11m, $12m. My heart would sink as I honked through my nose, “Oh Tom, sounds fabulous but …” I was travelling, my husband was away, I was indisposed, and then there was Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid. All the while Tom was lovely, just wanting me to be happy, to find a truly enormous, gigantic luxury house to call my own. I sat there feeling miserable. I wanted to correct him, but it just felt so awkward. I had left it too late! I was trapped in a lie.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was hungry. I seized my chance. I took a cake. A butler asked me if I wanted coffee. This was living!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Part of my reluctance to expose my true self stemmed from a humiliating encounter on the 35th floor of a big Melbourne bank, about a decade ago.</p> <p>I was a broke freelancer doing a story for a financial services magazine about private bankers. Who were they? And who were their clients? I was ushered into an inner sanctum where everything was not just marginally better than the public banking spaces – but phenomenally better, like a boutique five-star hotel. There were even butlers!</p> <p>After the interview concluded, the banker indicated that I should see myself out. On the way to the lift I saw about a dozen people milling around. Cake! A seminar or talk had just finished and people were standing around in pairs or alone eating petit fours.</p> <p>I was hungry. I seized my chance. I took a cake. A butler asked me if I wanted coffee. This was living!</p> <p>My reverie was interrupted by an older gentleman, impeccably dressed – a light grey suit with a faint pinstripe, tie in a Windsor knot. We engaged in small talk, but the feeling coming from him was absolute attention, a sort of rapt engagement in my observations on the weather, the paintings, the cake. I was loving it! We skated lightly from one topic to the next, as he manoeuvred me towards a comfortable chair. Seated, he leaned even closer and gazed at me as if I was the most fascinating person on Earth. I drank it in. At one point, seeing that my plate was empty, he motioned for the butler to bring me another coffee, another plate of cakes.</p> <p>Maybe 20 minutes passed this way until I asked him what he was doing here. He worked here. He was one of the private bankers. Then something slipped, his impeccable benevolent mask. What was<em> I</em> doing here? He asked. Relaxed in his company I told him I was a freelance journalist, doing a story on private banking and … I stopped. We both stopped. A mutual moment of cognitive reorganisation. A sort of horror passed quickly across his face, an expression strong enough to curdle the coffee in my stomach.</p> <p>“A journalist?”</p> <p>He didn’t have to say it but I knew. He had thought I was a high net worth individual. A client of the bank. <em>Rich.</em> He said journalist the way other people said murderer.</p> <p>With a different voice now, he told me I should leave – that this was for clients only. My cheeks burned as I walked to the elevator.</p> <p>Remember that famous scene in Pretty Woman where the shop assistant thought Julia Roberts was poor and treated her dismissively?</p> <p>Well here, the banker and the real estate agent thought I was rich and were treating me like a princess. I was a reverse Pretty Woman. I was Ugly Woman!

And again it took me a while to place him. He asked if I’d found anywhere suitable to live. “I like where I am,” I said, looking around my rented two-and-a-half room apartment, before realising it was<em> him</em>, Tom. He wanted to sell me another harbourside mansion. This one I would love. He could show me through tomorrow, a private viewing. I could get first dibs.</p> <p>I closed my eyes for a moment and felt the tug of fate. Surely it would be the easiest thing just to drift along into the natural conclusion of this misunderstanding – go to the house, say through my nose, “Oh Tom, it’s perfect, it’s just darling” and then agree to buy the house (a steal at $15m!) and somehow end up in an even more absurd situation than the one I was already in. I would buy the mansion in order not to make us feel awkward, in order to be polite.</p> <p>And that of course, ironically, was my class giveaway.

The planet is, to not put too fine a point on it, “spent”. Most people who can afford it spend their mornings climbing into gel-filled pods to log into a fun, more beautiful edition of Earth called Gaia, where advanced coding offers the sensation (or at least, a sensation) of taste, smell and even touch. The book’s central quartet, Tao-Yi and her boyfriend Navin, and their friends Zach and Evelyn, live so much of their lives there that when the technology arrives to allow full “upload”, it feels like a foregone conclusion. Except for Tao-Yi, it isn’t.</p> <p>Is her reluctance just nostalgia? What, exactly, is she worried about leaving behind? In digitalising the mind-body problem, Every Version of You transposes it into a literal and very material question: <em>if you could leave your body, would you? </em>In his unsettling 1909 story, <a href=\"https://www.classicly.com/bibi/pre.html?book=732.epub\">The Machine Stops</a>, EM Forster comes at this question from the other side: <em>if you could return to the physical world, would you? </em>In Forster’s story, a<em> </em>woman lives contentedly in her small pod below the earth, washed, dried and fed while she swaps “elevated” ideas with like minds in other pods around the world. All her needs are met by the Machine. Her son’s claustrophobia merely annoys her – she thinks he is a stubborn and backward heretic. He thinks the Machine has robbed humanity of “the sense of space and of the sense of touch”.

For him, uploading is a salvation, a no-brainer: only in virtual reality can he be his authentic self, not held back by the painful betrayals of his body. (Chan’s vision of the future includes a believably infuriating gap between advancements in consumer tech and those in more basic medical or social care.) But Tao-Yi struggles with a nebulous sadness, certain that with the loss of their tactile connection goes something fundamental to their bond. While the novel is told in third person, we inhabit Tao-Yi’s perspective, and her hunger for the physical sensations Gaia can never quite replicate (the taste of homemade mapo tofu, the smell of Navin’s neck, even the hot, toxic air of Melbourne’s increasingly uninhabitable streets). “Distance is irrelevant to intimacy, now,” she reflects after a reunion at a virtual party – yet she, and so we, are unconvinced.</p> <p>After upload, Navin’s brain expands and speeds up – he becomes a “digital sprite” chasing interests, passions, languages. Tao-Yi sees this limitless metamorphosing as a dissolving of the self, but Navin begs her to consider the risks of “lagging”: ageing, decay, the possibility she’s inherited her mother and grandmother’s depression. Chan, whose day job is in psychiatry, probes the fascinating idea of how well it’s possible to know our “selves” at all, and what we value in their formation. Are friction, trauma and discomfort so integral? Why <em>not</em> wipe them out, become “new humans, directly powered by solar and electricity”?</p> <p>Tao-Yi, looking back on the 21st century, wonders how much of her mother’s illness “might have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/22/almost-half-of-young-females-in-australia-report-mental-health-disorder-study-finds\">grief about the world</a>”.

Apple and then Dandelion have been superseded by Neuronetica-Somners, Gaia’s parent company, which caters to the rich. Many are locked out by cost, stranded on an Earth with no more trees. (It’s possible, after reading this book, that you never turn on a tap the same way again.) Those without homes shelter beneath UV-reflective blankets, bodies warped and broken by chronic sunburn and lung disease, ignored by those who’ve left them behind. (“It’s hard to think critically about the things that gratify your basest needs.”) Even people with access to Gaia’s addictive consolations seem to frequently be falling apart in ways their commercial system is utterly inadequate and unwilling to address. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/18/mark-fisher-k-punk-blogs-did-48-politics\">Mark Fisher</a>, Every Version of You argues that capitalism (more than say, the internet) is the cause of all the problems we keep using it to try to solve.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/apr/23/sarah-holdings-top-10-cli-fi-books\">Sarah Holding’s top 10 cli-fi books</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chan’s novel is laden with a feeling of precipice and inevitability, a quiet doom. As all her friends upload, Tao-Yi is swamped by the “perpetual homesickness” she’s felt since her teenage move from Malaysia. She cannot see Gaia as a home, and in pulling away from it, she is reaching for something linking her to her roots – but they are also “broken, or only ever half-built”. In a recent essay, <a href=\"https://www.killyourdarlings.com.au/article/novelists-still-dont-know-how-to-talk-about-the-internet/\">critic Cher Tan writes</a> that comparing life on and offline is asking “the wrong question” and falling into the (false) rut of “<a href=\"https://thenewinquiry.com/the-irl-fetish/\">digital dualism</a>” – because most of contemporary life is simultaneously woven of both.</p> <p>That’s not what Tao-Yi – or Chan – is doing.

That would be the main thing.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt6Wjhsxh5U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wt6Wjhsxh5U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A decade in the making, The Crowd and I is split into 13 chapters, with footage from around the world of every kind of crowd: a swarm at Coachella, sprawling refugee camps, packed commuter trains, drone footage of protests and close encounters with riots. Some footage was captured by the likes of artist Ai Weiwei and cinematographer Jon Frank, who worked closely with the ACO on The Reef.</p> <p>Tognetti compiled the soundtrack, zipping between Chopin, Sibelius and Beethoven to modern US composer Morton Feldman and even his own. Each piece gives rise to a different flavour of emotion in the viewer; to handle the dramatic switches in mood between the chapters, the ACO have expanded its ranks for the performance and will feature brass and woodwinds, live electronics and vocalists from the Song Company.</p> <p>The performance, which starts in Canberra on Saturday before touring, promises to be intensely emotional and thought-provoking – like the best of the ACO’s work over the last few decades, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/13/how-can-art-touch-your-soul-when-your-soul-is-busy-posing-on-instagram\">including 2005’s Luminous, made with photographer Bill Henson</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cde862aab04c3d49819e7660e813fc52732be8a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cde862aab04c3d49819e7660e813fc52732be8a8/193_0_1500_1875/800.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Tognetti of Australian Chamber Orchestra plays in front of The Crowd & I\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Like any good art, the more preachy it is, the less room there is for poetry’ … Richard Tognetti, centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ACO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout the performance the crowds shapeshift: sometimes they are menacing, sometimes celebratory, sometimes uplifting, sometimes dangerous. There is a spectacular clip of a moshpit – hundreds of young bodies hurtling towards each other, colliding without malice – which is accompanied by an original Tognetti composition titled Mosh Maggot. But the most affecting chapter (among many) is Tide, which includes CCTV footage of George Floyd’s murder and the subsequent Black Lives Matter marches across the world.</p> <p>“When you see the footage, it’s overwhelming,” says Tognetti. “The marches spread like a tidal wave throughout the world. We didn’t want to imbue the music with operatic drama – we didn’t need to. Like any good art, the more preachy it is, the less room there is for poetry.”</p> <p>Also overwhelming, even after all these years, is seeing footage of the Cronulla riots, filmed by photojournalist Craig Greenhill. “Some people may say ‘I’ve already seen this, I don’t need to see this again.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh yes you do’,” says Tognetti. “No one is innocent – no one is free from blame.”</p> <p>The show’s genesis was in 2008 when Tognetti was given funding to “dream up wicked and wild things. I wanted to do something on crowds and put it together really quickly – but what it lacked was an overarching directorial vision and so Jamieson came on board.” The two men picked the work up again during the 2020 lockdown and found that “the last 3% that takes 99% of the money and the time. It’s been a couple of years of crafting and chiselling away.”</p> <p>The Crowd and I has changed over the decade: “It started off with a more misanthropic bent – crowds are scary, mobs are dangerous. It was easier to be dark than light.” In the final version, there is an interplay of both: yes, crowds can be dangerous and scary – but as we’ve learned in the pandemic, we also often need and crave communal experience.</p> <p>Any fear of crowds also hits the bottom line of artists such as Tognetti. The arts need the crowd to survive.</p> <p>“I hope people continue to buy tickets and please turn up!” he says. “Not to just the gold-plated and big theatrical events but to the ecology underneath – all the smaller shows and venues, or all the undergrowth won’t be here in five years. You have to support it.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.aco.com.au/whats-on/2022/the-crowd-and-i\">The Crowd and I</a> is touring to Canberra (6 August), Melbourne (7-8 August), Sydney (9-14 August) and Brisbane (15 August).</em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/05/community-leaders-call-on-new-western-sydney-minister-to-invest-in-local-people-talent-and-diversity","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T17:30:24Z","webTitle":"Community leaders call on new western Sydney minister to invest in local people, talent and diversity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/05/community-leaders-call-on-new-western-sydney-minister-to-invest-in-local-people-talent-and-diversity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/05/community-leaders-call-on-new-western-sydney-minister-to-invest-in-local-people-talent-and-diversity","fields":{"headline":"Community leaders call on new western Sydney minister to invest in local people, talent and diversity","trailText":"Stuart Ayres’ replacement, David Elliott, urged to broaden scope of his portfolio beyond ‘roads and sports’","byline":"Mostafa Rachwani","body":"<p>Western Sydney community leaders are calling on the new state minister for western Sydney, David Elliott, to broaden the scope of his portfolio beyond “roads and sports”.</p> <p>Elliott, who also holds the transport and veterans affairs portfolios, will be sworn into his new role on Friday, after his predecessor, Stuart Ayres, stepped down on Tuesday.</p> <p>Ayres resigned amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/stuart-ayres-resigns-as-nsw-minister-after-questions-raised-by-john-barilaro-trade-role-review\">an ongoing crisis in the New South Wales government</a>, with the premier, Dominic Perrotett, saying an independent report had raised questions about Ayres’ involvement in the appointment of former deputy premier John Barilaro to a lucrative New York trade job.

All 10 are participating in the one sport in Birmingham: lawn bowls.</p> <p>A 35 square kilometre dot of land amid the vast Pacific Ocean, between New Zealand and New Caledonia, Norfolk Island was initially settled as a prison colony in the early 1800s. It was subsequently abandoned and remained uninhabited until 1856, when the community of descendants of the HMS Bounty mutineers – having outgrown the Pitcairn Islands, another British territory in the Pacific – relocated to Norfolk. Many Norfolk Islanders today are descendants of these settlers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/03/mabia-aktar-raising-the-bar-for-female-empowerment-in-bangladesh\">Mabia Aktar raising the bar for female empowerment in Bangladesh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Norfolk was governed from New South Wales for decades, and formally incorporated into Australia in 1913. In 1979 the islanders were granted limited self-government by federal authorities, with an elected assembly responsible for governance of Norfolk. This unusual status allows it to compete in the Commonwealth Games – which, unlike the Olympics, permit participation from certain non-state territories. Hence Norfolk Island joined the likes of the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Saint Helena, Turks and Caicos, Guernsey, Jersey, Isle of Man and Niue during the opening ceremony in Birmingham last week.</p> <p>“Norfolk Island has participated in the Commonwealth Games since 1986,” explains the team’s chef de mission Sheryl Yelavich, an administrator at the local hospital. The island has competed at every Games since and won two bronze medals; the appearance in Birmingham is the island’s 10th Games. “We’re part of the 72 Commonwealth nations,” she says. “We’ve been in the Games before as an external territory of Australia – nothing has changed, it has remained the same.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3a794ac40cce200cb64a928c06a31bc47f1e7c5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a794ac40cce200cb64a928c06a31bc47f1e7c5e/0_0_3204_5097/629.jpg\" alt=\"Norfolk Island bowling team member Carmen Anderson at a monument to mark the Women’s World Lawn Bowls Championships.\" width=\"629\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norfolk Island bowling team member Carmen Anderson at a monument to mark the Women’s World Lawn Bowls Championships.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Lewis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nothing might have changed on the sporting front, but politically much has changed in recent years – making Commonwealth Games participation even more symbolically important for Norfolk Islanders. In 2015, self-government was abolished by the federal government, “to address issues of sustainability”, including financial difficulties, that had arisen. From 2016, Australian laws have applied to the island and travel between Australia and Norfolk is considered domestic. The island is represented federally through the Australian Capital Territory; new-elected representative senator David Pocock visited recently.</p> <p>The end of self-government remains a sore point. Some locals have advocated for Norfolk Island to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/23/norfolk-island-should-become-part-of-new-zealand-says-former-chief-minister\">break away from Australia and join New Zealand</a>, which might permit greater autonomy (as it does with Niue and the Cook Islands). Norfolk residents have even petitioned the United Nations, represented by eminent barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC, seeking to be added to the body’s list of non-self governing territories, which have rights to self-determination under international law.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://citynews.com.au/2022/why-norfolk-islanders-are-taking-a-stand/\">recent column</a>, former ACT chief minister Jon Stanhope criticised the reforms for returning the island to “what is, in effect, colonial status”. He asked: “How long [does] the Commonwealth intend to deny the people of Norfolk Island a say in the governance of their community and the same democratic rights enjoyed by the residents of, let’s say, Canberra?”</p> <p>Susie Hale, a school teacher on Norfolk and mother of Ellie Dixon, the youngest bowler on the team in Birmingham, says that the Games are an important opportunity to be represented as Norfolk Islanders. “To march under our flag and sing our anthem, when all other rights and liberties have been stripped from the Norfolk Island people, it’s one of very few opportunities when we get to publicly represent under our flag,” she says.</p> <p>That’s particularly the case for descendants of the original Pitcairn settlers, who are represented in the team. “They’re very proud people and very proud to represent their club, their sport and their nation,” says Yelavich.</p> <p>One Norfolk Islander to march under the flag in Birmingham was Shae Wilson, who bowled her way through to the semi-finals. Wilson, 23, is competing in her second Games – she is considered a rising star in the Norfolk lawn bowls community. Back home Wilson works as an early childhood teacher. “I just do a few hours at the local bowling club in between,” she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"211253e84cccab250dd141874b9d37c91107378c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/211253e84cccab250dd141874b9d37c91107378c/0_60_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Norfolk Islanders march at the opening ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Norfolk Islanders march at the opening ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wilson came up against an Australian opponent, Ellen Ryan, in the semi-final. In the Australia vs Norfolk grudge match, Ryan stormed out to lead 9-0, before Wilson came back to level the score at 17-all. But a “loose end” from Wilson (bowls is scored first to 21) saw the Australian win through. While Wilson was not able to add a third medal to Norfolk’s all-time record, after losing to Malaysia’s Sita Zalina Abmad in the bronze medal decider, she reflects positively on the Games.</p> <p>“I couldn’t quite finish it off, but I nearly got there,” she says. “It’s such a great opportunity to compete with people from around the world. And it puts our island on the map. Obviously we’re tiny, in the middle of the ocean, and a lot of people don’t know we exist. It’s amazing to represent our home.”</p> <p>Back in Norfolk, locals have been delighted by the success of Wilson and strong performances from other bowlers. “It’s an absolute buzz,” says Phil Jones, who won bronze at the 2018 Games in the men’s triples but is not competing this time around. “The whole island is behind this team. Everyone is watching, listening, talking. It’s all about the Commonwealth Games here at the moment.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/03/rapper-pa-salieu-dropped-from-commonwealth-games-closing-ceremony\">Rapper Pa Salieu ‘dropped’ from Commonwealth Games closing ceremony</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even in Birmingham (or, more accurately, Leamington Spa, where the lawn bowls are being held), the support from home is being felt. “Obviously we know everyone, so everyone is very excited for us,” says Wilson. “Everyone is so supportive back home.”</p> <p>Jones, an elder statesman of the sport in Norfolk, attributes the island’s bowling prowess to the opportunities presented by the Games – in addition to the world championships and regional tournaments, like the Pacific Games, which also welcome the territory. “Everyone wants that opportunity to test themselves,” he says. “All of our players want to be in the [Commonwealth Games] team – they see what’s ahead of themselves, they put in the extra practice.” It helps they enjoy it, too. “There’s just a love of the game,” adds Yelavich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9249333e342f20b5cf5c756a4e0fa27a74910cee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9249333e342f20b5cf5c756a4e0fa27a74910cee/0_184_2434_2650/918.jpg\" alt=\"Carmen Anderson in action in the women's fours third round in Leamington Spa.\" width=\"918\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carmen Anderson in action in the women's fours third round in Leamington Spa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Lewis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lawn bowls competition at these Games concludes on Saturday, but the Norfolk Island team are already looking ahead to the 2026 Games in Victoria. Norfolk Islanders have previously competed in shooting at the Commonwealth Games, but the sport was dropped from the roster for Birmingham. Efforts are underway to push for shooting to be reinstated in four years’ time, which would be a boost for the islanders. “We’ll just have to wait and see what the scheduled sports will be for those future Games,” says Yelavich.</p> <p>While Norfolk’s political status hangs in the balance – senator Pocock has said he will advocate for the islanders, and might use his power in the Senate to push for reform – the territory’s relative sporting success looks set to continue. Whatever happens politically, the lawn bowlers of Norfolk Island will be back at the next Commonwealth Games.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"law/2022/aug/05/passenger-kept-from-boarding-after-jetstars-refusal-to-assist-with-wheelchair-makes-discrimination-complaint","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T17:30:24Z","webTitle":"Passenger kept from boarding after Jetstar’s refusal to assist with wheelchair makes discrimination complaint","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/aug/05/passenger-kept-from-boarding-after-jetstars-refusal-to-assist-with-wheelchair-makes-discrimination-complaint","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2022/aug/05/passenger-kept-from-boarding-after-jetstars-refusal-to-assist-with-wheelchair-makes-discrimination-complaint","fields":{"headline":"Passenger kept from boarding after Jetstar’s refusal to assist with wheelchair makes discrimination complaint","trailText":"<strong>Exclusive: </strong>Complaint lodged with human rights commission after man turned away at gate of Sydney airport flight","byline":"Elias Visontay","body":"<p>A passenger with a disability has lodged a discrimination complaint after he was turned away at the gate when trying to board a Jetstar flight in Sydney.</p> <p>Tony Jones, who suffered a spinal cord injury after falling off a balcony at the age of 18 and has since relied on a wheelchair, said he had contacted the airline to organise assistance in advance of his flight to Ballina in May last year.</p> <p>But at Sydney airport the airline refused to help him transfer from his custom electric wheelchair into an “aisle chair” – a narrow wheelchair that Jetstar requires passengers to use to be taken to their seat on the plane.</p> <p>“When I arrived they just said, ‘No, sorry, we don’t actually have anyone here to do that,’” Jones said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/08/this-was-indignity-passenger-with-disability-left-without-wheelchair-at-sydney-airport\">‘This was indignity’: passenger with disability left without wheelchair at Sydney airport</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As he was travelling on his own, he had no one to help him transfer into the aisle chair and was left stranded at the airport, unable to access the flight he had booked.</p> <p>Jones, who works as a policy and advocacy manager at Spinal Cord Injuries Australia, said Jetstar offered to put him on a later flight, when it could organise a chair transfer, but since he was planning to return the same evening that was of no use.</p> <p>He claims Jetstar broke its policy of requiring staff to transfer passengers into an aisle chair – which does not allow its occupant to move it and needs to be pushed from behind.

Stricken by a monstrous and unrelenting migraine, Mol, the bright young novelist, found himself unable to read or write. As the migraine dragged on – month after agonising month – he began to lose himself. Bereft and desperate, Mol took a job as a railway guard, but he was not the only person seeking refuge on the trains.</p> <p>His memoir is not a tale of triumphant recovery – of pain vanquished – but something far more tender, vital and quietly hopeful: a tale of remaking. How do we tell a new story of ourselves? To answer that question, Mol explores the craft, power and solace of tale-telling. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/30/oliver-mol-on-surviving-a-10-month-migraine-if-i-didnt-tell-this-story-it-would-rot-inside-me\">“I now understand this,” he writes, “stories are miracles.”</a> –<em> Beejay Silcox</em></p> <h2>Desire by Jessie Cole</h2> <p><em>Fiction, Text Publishing, $32.99</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"17bd3bdc1d851dd08e977154e8e6168b78bbfc4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17bd3bdc1d851dd08e977154e8e6168b78bbfc4e/0_0_1807_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"Desire by Jessie Cole\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Fodder for your fieriest dinner party takes this month, Desire is Jessie Cole’s attempt to reckon with an affair she had with an older man who, to put it simply, was just not that into her. It is presented in the past tense but, as Cole explains in the epilogue, it was “written close to real time … without the benefit of hindsight”.</p> <p>This means the reader is immersed in the deep pain, magical thinking and mortifying missteps that accompany near-obsessive longing – made all the more raw because Cole loves deeply, viscerally and with a trauma-informed corporality (rashes, tremors, twitches) that she can’t control, which gives her zero ability to play it cool. Desire is propulsive, honest and tender; it will hurl you back to your own worst heartaches, whether you want to revisit them or not. – <em>Steph Harmon</em></p> <h2>Around the Table by Julia Busuttil Nishimura</h2> <p><em>Cookbook, Plum, $44.99</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ae3d104c654664091900f4fe5f3f66cce5879f75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae3d104c654664091900f4fe5f3f66cce5879f75/0_0_640_873/367.jpg\" alt=\"Around the Table by Julia Busuttil Nishimura\" width=\"367\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With her first two cookbooks, Ostro and A Year of Simple Family Food, Busuttil Nishimura established a reputation as a cookery writer whose work is flavoursome, accessible and beautiful to look at. Focusing mainly on Italian and Japanese cooking, Around the Table will bring her existing fans plenty more of what they like, while first-time readers will pick up some new tricks.</p> <p>There’s some great inspiration for fast and fuss-free weeknight meals in this book and the sweet dishes stand out. Some are ambitious but, as Nishimura makes clear, a day in the kitchen is its own reward; and if by dessert-time you end up with a trifle where every component has been made from scratch, then that’s just icing (or ricotta cream) on the cake. – <em>Alyx Gorman</em></p> <h2>Sundressed: Natural Fibres and the Future of Fashion by Lucianne Tonti</h2> <p><em>Nonfiction, Black Inc, $32.99</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c78d342e1bd4de971e876dacf04dba8dfd2f4dbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c78d342e1bd4de971e876dacf04dba8dfd2f4dbd/0_0_903_1382/653.jpg\" alt=\"Sundressed: Natural Fibres and the Future of Fashion by Lucianne Tonti\" width=\"653\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In Sundressed, Lucianne Tonti – whose column <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/closet-clinic\">Closet clinic</a> I edit for Guardian Australia – tackles the ugly side of beautiful clothing with surprising tenderness. Tonti does not flinch away from the complexities of fashion’s impact on the planet, and is unafraid to call greenwashing when she sees it, but she never condemns the reader for wanting to dress well: this book is written from a place of love.</p> <p>Each chapter deep dives into the history, present and possible future of a different natural fibre. Together they form a tapestry of possibilities for mending a broken industry. For those working in the rag trade it is essential reading; for everyone else, the book is a well-taught lesson in the true cost (and value) of clothing. – <em>Alyx Gorman</em></p> <h2>Nimblefoot by Robert Drewe</h2> <p><em>Fiction, Penguin Random House, $32.99</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cae580161efbc2fe433c053708a6f2f7890aa2fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cae580161efbc2fe433c053708a6f2f7890aa2fe/0_0_1807_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"Nimblefoot by Robert Drewe is out August 2022 through Penguin Random House\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>John Day was a child superstar in the 1800s, an Australian world champion in the spectator sport of pedestrianism. As a teenager he became an apprentice jockey, winning the Melbourne Cup on a horse called Nimblefoot in 1870. Then he disappeared from recorded history – so Drewe decided to invent a life for him, starting from the night of his Melbourne Cup win.</p> <p>Of Drewe’s 18 books of fiction and nonfiction, Nimblefoot is probably his most imaginative novel – and as he told me in an interview that will be published to the Guardian on Saturday, it’s also the book he most enjoyed writing. During challenging times, his protagonist John Day began to feel like a friend to him; Drewe’s imaginative leaps – involving real and made-up historical characters – are full of droll humour, in this tremendous achievement of a book. – <em>Susan Chenery</em></p> <h2><strong>The Wrong Woman by JP Pomare</strong></h2> <p><em>Crime fiction, Hachette Australia, $32.99</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0d6b9863976a6d1847fc36dd646da218490d0b14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d6b9863976a6d1847fc36dd646da218490d0b14/0_0_1808_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"The Wrong Man by JP Pomare\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This breezy whodunnit is the latest small-town thriller from global bestseller Pomare, who was born in New Zealand and lives in Melbourne. His fifth novel follows Reid, a private investigator who turned his back on his hometown after a career-ending incident. After receiving an offer he can’t refuse, Reid returns to investigate a suspicious car crash – only to find himself drawn into the disappearance of two local teenage girls. Reid’s narration alternates with that of Eshana, one of two car crash victims, speaking from the past, before she was put in a coma.</p> <p>Pomare’s books are undeniably propulsive and the twists and cliffhangers in The Wrong Woman are clever enough to feel satisfying. Yes it’s all a bit familiar – but who doesn’t love to read about a PI with a troubled past? – <em>Sian Cain</em></p> <h2>Every Version of You by Grace Chan</h2> <p><em>Fiction, Affirm Press, $32.99</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"66b95e5616dfcb77be8068e68b46415ad33b0e6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66b95e5616dfcb77be8068e68b46415ad33b0e6d/0_0_1674_2560/654.jpg\" alt=\"Every Version of You by Grace Chan\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Chan’s speculative fiction debut is set in a near-apocalyptic Melbourne 60 or so years from now. Most of the middle class are fleeing (virtually) to Gaia, a commercial VR platform where they can meet, eat and go to galleries, while their bodies stay behind in tiny, sterile apartments, submerged in transmitter gel. When the chance comes to fully upload to Gaia, one couple, Tao-Yi and Navin, find themselves split: how can you give up life on Earth? On the other hand, why stay?</p> <p>Chan’s short fiction has been shortlisted for several sci-fi awards and with her first novel, you’re in confident hands. The science (for this layperson) feels seamless and believable – as do, more interestingly, Chan’s quiet, intelligent explorations of the psyche, family ties and what really connects us to each other. – <em>Imogen Dewey</em></p> <h2>Rigged by Cameron K Murray and Paul Frijters</h2> <p><em>Nonfiction, Allen &amp; Unwin $32.99</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"055824bd861c421484267727a59950b1c2bbbe2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/055824bd861c421484267727a59950b1c2bbbe2d/0_0_345_527/327.jpg\" alt=\"Rigged by Cameron K Murray and Paul Frijters\" width=\"327\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Initially self-published as a booklet by economists Murray and Frijters under the title Game of Mates, Rigged is a fascinating and infuriating exploration of how nepotism, corruption and dodgy deals among the aforementioned Mates have undermined Australian society and robbed the general population of half our wealth. “Every hour you work, 30 minutes of it goes to line the Mates’ pockets rather than your own,” they write.</p> <p>Murray and Frijters explore how big corporations, industry groups and government departments have skewed everything from the housing market to superannuation, to our medical system and transportation. Rigged is the right side of academic and the right side of entertaining, explaining in convincing detail how Australia has gone from one of the most equal societies in the western world to one of the most unequal in just a decade. – <em>Sian Cain</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/05/an0m-lawyers-challenge-encrypted-messaging-app-used-by-afp-in-global-sting","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T17:30:23Z","webTitle":"An0m: lawyers challenge encrypted messaging app used by AFP in global crime sting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/05/an0m-lawyers-challenge-encrypted-messaging-app-used-by-afp-in-global-sting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/05/an0m-lawyers-challenge-encrypted-messaging-app-used-by-afp-in-global-sting","fields":{"headline":"An0m: lawyers challenge encrypted messaging app used by AFP in global crime sting","trailText":"A year after app’s unveiling questions have been raised about legal grounds on which messages intercepted and warrants used","byline":"Josh Taylor","body":"<p>The legality of the encrypted app An0m, which Australian federal police used to run a global crime sting, is being challenged in the courts a year after its highly publicised unveiling.</p> <p>In the 12 months since the AFP and FBI let the world know they were behind an encrypted phone known as An0m, it has led to 340 alleged offenders being charged in Australia with 1,011 offences.

Cheika took the reins from Mario Ledesma as Los Pumas’ coach in March. Equally fluent in Spanish and attacking rugby, the 55-year-old is now a national hero after inspiring his men to an upset 2-1 win over Scotland before 30,000 fans in Santiago del Estero.</p> <p>Those fans had waited three years to see their team play Test rugby again and they will be in full voice again at the arena that hosted their famous 2014 victory over the Ewan McKenzie-coached Wallabies. That night, despite Australia leading 14-0 after 15 minutes, Los Pumas calmly clawed back the ascendency to win 21-17 and notch a maiden win in the Rugby Championship after 18 straight defeats, and first over Australia since 1997.</p> <p>That win was a turning point. Los Pumas have grown in strength and confidence ever since. With growing support from all over Latin America (a potential fan base of over 600 million) and a reputation as giant killers (they demolished Ireland 43-20 at the 2015 World Cup and shocked the All Blacks 25-15 in 2020) they pose a dangerous reality check for the Wallabies.</p> <p>Despite juggling his ongoing roles as coach of Lebanon for the 2022 Rugby League World Cup in October and director of rugby at the NEC Green Rockets franchise in Japan, Cheika has already instilled belief and tenacity into Argentine rugby. Trailing 31-20 with 15 minutes to go, Los Pumas nervelessly chased down Scotland to prove the 26-18 first test win in San Salvador de Jujuy was no fluke, and their coach has them on track for the 2023 World Cup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f65f7c1ed2953d2b275feb80793b5cce9ccbc2eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f65f7c1ed2953d2b275feb80793b5cce9ccbc2eb/0_0_3894_2596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Argentina and Australia at Cbus Super Stadium on the Gold Coast last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Argentina and Australia at Cbus Super Stadium on the Gold Coast last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jono Searle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cheika shares several traits with the big cats that prowl the chaparral terrain of Argentina. Pumas are cunning hunters famous for chasing down and hauling off prey far heavier than they are; Australia sit sixth in the World Rugby rankings, Argentina lurk nearby in ninth. They are also vocal beasts, much like Cheika, who inspired Australia’s epic win over Argentina in 2018, when they were down 31-7 but rallied to win 45-34.</p> <p>With one win from Dave Rennie’s past six Tests and a 39% win record as coach, his Wallabies must roar on Sunday if they are to win back the early momentum and public goodwill squandered at home against England. Australian rugby fans are restless. They want the rolling mauls and running rugby that is the Wallabies’ trademark but they’ll settle for true grit and grinding to victory.</p> <p>Rennie lost nine good men to injury in the England series and a few more have fallen since. Form front rowers Dave Porecki and Angus Bell are out and although Samu Kerevi was always absent for these Argentina Tests, the game breaking centre’s ACL injury at the Commonwealth Games means he is gone for the season. It gives the new young 12-13 pairing of Len Ikitau and Hunter Paisami time to alchemise in the midfield and bend the thick blue line made formidable by ex-NRL enforcer David Kidwell as Cheika’s defence coach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/21/jock-campbell-handed-wallabies-call-up-as-rory-arnold-returns-for-argentina-tests\">Jock Campbell handed Wallabies call-up as Rory Arnold returns for Argentina Tests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With fast-rising flyer Tom Wright preferred at fullback and Jordan Petaia returned to the wing, Rennie has let another opportunity go begging to unholster Suliasi Vunivalu, criminally underused against England, on the right wing to mirror his wrecking ball Marika Koroibete. With such big guns shooting from each hip, even Cheika’s Los Pumas would run for the hills. Instead Rennie plays it safe with veteran utility Reece Hodge on the bench.</p> <p>Although Noah Lolesio played a bravura hand in Australia’s victory over England in Perth, Eddie Jones’s men quickly dismantled him. Lolesio is the future but for now only the hair-trigger hands of recalled wildcard veteran Quade Cooper can conjure the time and space his match-winners need out wide.</p> <p>Cooper gave Cheika a memorable adios when the coach quit as Wallabies boss in 2019, tweeting: “If he cared about Aus rugby he would have done it a while ago.” Now the exiled playmaker is back, he can deliver for the ones who care most about “Aus rugby” – the fans.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/04/we-will-see-a-death-advocates-fear-for-children-inside-maximum-security-perth-prison-after-boy-swallows-glass","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia

The main part of the previous bill – an emissions trading scheme, introduced by the Gillard government with the support of Greens and independents – was repealed by the Coalition under Tony Abbott in 2014.</p> \n<p>Here’s what we know about what the bill means for climate action, and what happens once the country has legislated emissions targets.</p> \n<h2>What does the climate bill do?</h2> \n<p>The climate bill enshrines into law two national greenhouse gas emissions targets: a 43% cut below 2005 levels by 2030, and a reduction to “net zero” by 2050.</p> \n<p>The bill emphasises that the 2030 target is a floor not a ceiling, which means it is the minimum cut that can happen but there is nothing to legally prevent deeper cuts. The legislation requires several government agencies to consider the targets – that is, factor in climate change – when making investment decisions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/04/albanese-declares-coalition-stuck-in-time-after-labors-climate-bill-passes-lower-house\">Albanese declares Coalition ‘stuck in time’ after Labor’s climate bill passes lower house</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The legislation beefs up the role played by the Climate Change Authority, a decade-old agency responsible for giving policy advice. The authority was cut back and largely ignored under the Coalition after it failed to abolish it. It will now be expected to give annual advice on progress towards meeting Australia’s climate targets and to advise later this parliamentary term on a new target for 2035. The government will have to release the advice and publicly explain why if it doesn’t follow it.</p> \n<p>The bill requires the climate change minister, currently Chris Bowen, to give an annual statement to parliament on progress towards the targets. Bowen has likened it to the annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/28/australia-still-failing-to-hit-more-than-two-thirds-of-closing-the-gap-targets-new-data-shows\">Closing the Gap statement</a>.</p> \n<h2>What doesn’t the climate bill do?</h2> \n<p>It doesn’t include a mechanism or funding to cut emissions from electricity, industry, transport, agriculture or other parts of the economy.</p> \n<h2>What happens now?</h2> \n<p>The bill has to clear the Senate when parliament next sits in September, but that’s now a formality. Before then, a Senate committee will hold an inquiry. The Greens want it to address whether new coal and gas developments are consistent with Australia’s climate commitments. There is no shortage of evidence and rhetoric – from climate scientists, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/03/greed-of-fossil-fuel-companies-is-grotesque-says-un-secretary-general\">United Nations secretary general</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist\">International Energy Agency</a>, among others – to say they aren’t.</p> \n<p>But the inquiry won’t change the text of the bill. The fight over stopping new fossil fuels – the Greens’ primary climate policy goal – will continue independently of that.</p> \n<h2>How will we meet the 43% target?</h2> \n<p>Labor’s <a href=\"https://keystone-alp.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/prod/61a9693a3f3c53001f975017-PoweringAustralia.pdf\">climate plan</a>, called Powering Australia, includes two main policies plus a few add-ons.

How will baselines be set? What will be the relative responsibility of different industries and facilities to make cuts? What steps will be taken to ensure the cuts are real (given facilities largely report their own emissions)?</p> \n<p>Will there be limits on the number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/australias-carbon-credit-scheme-largely-a-sham-says-whistleblower-who-tried-to-rein-it-in\">carbon credits</a> that businesses can buy to claim as their own cuts so they have to actually cut emissions onsite (given, as the truism goes, you can’t just offset your way to zero)? There is a proposal to grant companies that cut emissions more than they have to – so, below their limit – credits they can sell, creating a carbon trading scheme. How will that work?</p> \n<p>And – crucially – how will new fossil fuel developments that would increase total industrial emissions be treated?</p> \n<p>As they say in the classics, it’s complicated.</p> \n<p>The second major policy is called <a href=\"https://alp.org.au/policies/rewiring_the_nation\">Rewiring the nation</a>.

But also because he has kept in shape by riding from his home in Edmonton to the Palace of Westminster, where he works as a doorkeeper, responsible for both security and ceremony.</p> <p>“The journey into work is about 12 miles on a hybrid commuter bike,” he explained afterwards, flanked by his Slovakian wife Lucia, and his kids Jakub and Lukas. “You try to work up a head of steam, but it’s not easy with all the traffic lights.” His bike is not parked in the House of Commons, however. “It’s safer in the House of Lords, to be honest!” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a142b13a282f8c92ab2b209f88846648f930891c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a142b13a282f8c92ab2b209f88846648f930891c/0_25_5909_3546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist Rohan Dennis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rohan Dennis finished 16 minutes ahead of Chris Symonds in the men’s individual time trial.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked about his job, Symonds had a glint in his eye as he explained: “I’ve been a doorkeeper for 20 years, since Gordon Brown and David Cameron were prime ministers. We keep the doors to the chamber, to make sure people like you don’t get in. I’ve barred entry to a few famous people, but I’d better not say who.”</p> <p>Symonds is able to compete at the Commonwealth Games because cycling is an open event with no qualifying time. Not everyone is happy with having cycling Eric the Eels in Birmingham. But Symonds, who was born in London to an English father and a Ghanian mother, believes he and others are inspiring the next generation of riders from Africa and elsewhere who don’t necessarily think cycling is for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"24ecbe8c0bc43404a122d90e6df75eea4766e9f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24ecbe8c0bc43404a122d90e6df75eea4766e9f8/20_0_555_555/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Symonds pictured whilst at work as a House of Commons doorkeeper.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Symonds whilst at work as a doorkeeper at the House of Commons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Chris Symonds</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The Commonwealths get a full spectrum of athletes and if countries are to develop and get alongside the likes of Australia and Great Britain, they need these types of races to learn,” said Symonds, who is the oldest road cyclist at these Games. “How to set up a bike. What wheels to use. All that type of stuff. Training programmes.</p> <p>“You need to do these events to get better and better and better. So maybe in 10 or 20 years, maybe the smaller nations will be able to compete with the bigger nations.” One place above him was another history-maker, 46-year-old Jim Horton, who became the first cyclist to compete for the Falkland Islands. His average speed was 35km/hour – far slower than Dennis, who sped around the course at 48km/h. But as Horton pointed out afterwards, his £2,700 bike was the heaviest in the field, while the position of his gear-shifter meant he had to adjust his riding position in order to change them.</p> <p>“I’m sure I’m living the dream,” he said. “I think there is a place for the Commonwealth Games, I think there is a place for amateurs who train hard and get to the top of their game. I think this is the exact place for it. I think there are other places for professionals, the Grand Tours, the world championships, this is a home for both, I think it works.” Horton also revealed that he had approached his idol, Geraint Thomas, to wish him all the best. However it wasn’t the best day for the Welshman as he crashed in the opening two minutes of the race after skidding on the road paint and into a barrier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d991ad018bab82fbb5366524f2cf2ac519d2e795\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d991ad018bab82fbb5366524f2cf2ac519d2e795/0_258_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist Jim Horton of the Falkland Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m sure I’m living the dream’… Jim Horton of the Falkland Islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The recon I did in traffic so there’s no barriers up or anything,” Thomas said. “So I was thinking it’s a sweeping left but suddenly there are barriers in the way and their legs sticking out and it’s like: ‘Oh shit.’ It is never straightforward is it?

US officials say Russia wants to swap Griner and Paul Whelan, a former US marine arrested on spying charges in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/viktor-bout-brittney-griner-paul-whelan-prisoner-swap\">for the convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout</a>.</p> \n<p>A handcuffed Griner said, “I love my family,” as she was led out of the courtroom.</p> \n<p>“She’s very upset,” said Maria Blagovolina, one of her lawyers. “Very upset, very stressed. She can hardly talk. It’s a difficult time for her.” Griner had referred to the upcoming sentencing as “doomsday”, Blagovolina said. “It turns out she was right.”</p> \n<p>“Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney,” said the US president, Joe Biden. “It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends and teammates.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he was “committed to ensuring we do everything we can to bring home Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan as soon as possible”.</p> \n<p>Griner’s defence team said they were “disappointed” by the verdict and would appeal. It is unlikely any swap would be made before the appeals process is exhausted. </p> \n<p>Although she pleaded guilty to the drug charges, the US has classified Griner as “wrongfully detained”, launching a process similar to hostage negotiations with Iran and other countries. A senior US embassy official attended Thursday’s hearing and verdict, where police <em>spetsnaz </em>(special forces) and bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled the hallways.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors asked for a nine-and-a-half-year prison sentence for Griner and a hefty fine, nearly the maximum in her case. Lawyers said they considered Griner’s sentence extremely harsh, noting that many Russians arrested in similar cases are served suspended sentences on parole. </p> \n<p>In an emotional closing statement on Thursday, Griner apologised to her teammates and told the courtroom that she had made an “honest mistake”, adding: “That is why I pled guilty to my charges, but I had no intent of breaking the law.”</p> \n<p>She also rejected the political implications of her case, making an emotional appeal directly to the judge, Anna Sotnikova.</p> \n<p>“I know everybody keeps talking about ‘political pawn’ and ‘politics’, but I hope that is far from this courtroom,” she said, asking for leniency. In the end, it was not shown.</p> \n<p>Her legal team also said they would not engage in the political aspects of the case, saying that was up to the US embassy and government.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors in the Russian court said Griner’s arrest on drug charges was “fully proven”. Her defence lawyers pointed toward irregularities in the investigation and described the pressures on the basketball star, whom they compared to the sprinter Usain Bolt.</p> \n<p>A conviction is usually required in cases that could lead to a prisoner exchange, because it would allow the Kremlin to issue a pardon or reduce a sentence without blatantly interfering in an ongoing trial.</p> \n<p>A lawyer for Whelan told the Guardian on Thursday that he was “sure that a trade will eventually be made”, but added that a final agreement did not seem to have been reached. He claimed that the US said Russia offered a trade for Bout in 2020 shortly after Whelan’s conviction on spying charges.</p> \n<p>Russia is said to be seeking the freedom of Bout, who is believed to have armed the Taliban and the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone, Charles Taylor’s regime in Liberia, Unita in Angola, various Congolese factions, and Abu Sayyaf, a militant Islamist group in the Philippines.</p> \n<p>He was arrested at a luxury hotel in Bangkok in a US sting operation and was sentenced in 2012 to 25 years in prison. His case has become an unlikely cause célèbre among some senior Russian officials.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Russia has already exchanged Trevor Reed, a former marine arrested in Moscow, for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot who was held for nearly a decade in the US on a drug smuggling conviction.

The report concluded that this meant in some instances Russian forces would respond to an attack or target residential areas – putting civilians at risk and damaging civilian infrastructure.</p> <p>It also criticised the Ukrainian army for not evacuating civilians who could be caught up in the crossfire.</p> <p>“We have documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general. <br></p> <p>However, the head of Amnesty Ukraine’s office, Oksana Pokalchuk, wrote on Facebook that her operation disagreed with the report. She said they were cut out of the pre-publication process when they complained that the report was based on incomplete evidence compiled by foreign colleagues. </p> <p>“Our team’s arguments about the inadmissibility and incompleteness of such material were not taken into account,” wrote Pokalchuk. “The representatives of the Ukrainian office did everything they could to prevent this material from being published.”</p> <p>Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, accused Amnesty of “distorting the real picture” and of failing to understand the situation on the ground. She said Ukrainian soldiers were deployed in cities and populated areas to defend them from Russian attack.</p> <p>“There is no chronology of events [in the report]. The Russian Federation is committing the crime here. Ukraine is protecting its land. Moscow ignores all the rules of war. And unlike Ukraine, it doesn’t let in international organisations like Amnesty,” said Maliar.</p> <p>Speaking at a briefing in Kyiv, Maliar stressed that the Ukrainian armed forces laid on buses to evacuate civilians from the frontline. Some refused to go, despite repeated pleas and offers of transport to safer regions. Ukraine gave access to outside agencies including the international criminal court and carried out its own investigations into abuses committed by its troops, she said.</p> <p>Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s minister of defence, said “any attempt to question the right of Ukrainians to resist genocide, to protect their families and homes … is a perversion” and presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted that “the only thing that poses a threat to Ukraine is a Russian army of executioners and rapists coming to Ukraine to commit genocide”.</p> <p>Amnesty researchers investigated Russian strikes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv, Donbas and Mykolaiv regions between April and July. They found 19 villages and towns from where the Ukrainian forces had either launched strikes or were basing themselves. In these three regions, Amnesty found five locations where hospitals were “de facto” used as bases and out of 29 schools visited by Amnesty, they concluded 22 had been used as bases.</p> <p>Schools were closed on the first day of the invasion and pupils have been learning remotely, where possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/blast-that-killed-ukraine-pows-was-kremlin-operation-kyiv-claims\">Blast that killed Ukraine PoWs was Kremlin operation, Kyiv claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report noted that most of the civilian infrastructure repurposed by the Ukrainian army was located kilometres from the frontlines and argued that alternative locations were available.</p> <p>Maliar argued at the briefing that Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems needed to be based in towns to protect civilian infrastructure and if Ukrainian forces were only based outside urban settlements “Russian armed forces would simply sweep in unopposed”.</p> <p>Ukrainian social media users also responded with examples of when Russian forces have hit buildings being used by civilians, as well as the scores of crimes committed against Ukrainian civilians under Russian occupation.</p> <p>Guardian reporters have seen at least seven instances in three regions of Ukraine where schools and nurseries in residential areas were used as bases by the Ukrainian army. Five of the schools and nurseries the Guardian visited had been bombed. In each instance, several surrounding buildings were damaged in the attack.</p> <p>In one instance, in Donetsk region, at least three people died when the wave of the blast that destroyed a base hit a neighbouring residential building. </p> <p>In one school that was being used as a base by Ukrainian forces in central Ukraine, the commander said schools and kindergartens across Ukraine were being bombed because they were being used as bases. The commander said that schools provided the necessary facilities: showers, multiple toilets, large kitchens, dining areas, basements and rooms. He said the invasion had meant the army had to accommodate masses of new recruits quickly.</p> <p>Steven Haines, professor of public international law at London’s University of Greenwich who drafted <a href=\"https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/ils/vol97/iss1/28/\">non-legally binding guidelines</a> on military use of schools and universities during conflicts – which 100 states, including Ukraine, have endorsed – said Ukraine’s actions had not necessarily broken them.</p> <p>“The use of schools – if they are not also being used for their primary purpose – is not invariably unlawful. Very obviously, the situation in Ukraine counts as exceptional in this respect … so the Ukrainian military are not necessarily breaching the guidelines,” he said.</p> <p>Guardian reporters have also seen three instances of empty schools that have been repurposed for civilian use since the war, such as a school in Kharkiv region now being used as a humanitarian aid centre and a school in Kyiv which is housing people displaced by the war.</p> <p>Amnesty acknowledges that international humanitarian law does not ban parties from basing themselves in schools that are not in session, but the report emphasised “militaries have an obligation to avoid using schools that are near houses or apartment buildings full of civilians … unless there is a compelling military need”.</p> <p>Haines agreed with Amnesty’s assessment. He said it was the responsibility of military commanders on the ground to avoid collateral damage and try to choose buildings that if attacked as legitimate military targets, would be hit without risking the lives of the civilians nearby.</p> <p>In an ideal scenario, populated areas would not be part of the war, but the nature of the invasion meant city warfare had become inevitable in Ukraine, said Haines.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/04/biden-brittney-griner-prison-sentence-antony-blinken","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T16:59:40Z","webTitle":"Joe Biden condemns Griner sentence and calls for ‘immediate release’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/04/biden-brittney-griner-prison-sentence-antony-blinken","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/04/biden-brittney-griner-prison-sentence-antony-blinken","fields":{"headline":"Joe Biden condemns Griner sentence and calls for ‘immediate release’","trailText":"President calls basketball star’s detention ‘unacceptable’ as Tony Blinken reiterates commitment to bringing Griner home from Russia","byline":"Gloria Oladipo in New York","body":"<p>The nine-and-a half-year <a href=\"https://t.co/DmeQ34V5C2\">sentence</a> handed down by a Russian court to WBNA player and US Olympic gold medalist Brittney Griner after she was found guilty of drug possession was greeted in America with outrage and condemnation.</p> <p>Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/04/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-sentencing-of-wrongfully-detained-american-brittney-griner/\">released a statement</a> following Griner’s sentencing, calling her detention “unacceptable”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/04/russian-court-convicts-us-basketball-star-brittney-griner-on-drug-charges\">Russian court jails US basketball player Brittney Griner for nine years on drug charges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US president said: “American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney.

More than 100 are from abroad, 40 of them from the UK, 17 from the US and four from Australia.</p> <p>The Birth Information and Tracing Act allows adoptees or relatives to register their preference for contact with a parent of child until October, when the tracing process can legally start. In October they can apply to obtain the data.</p> <p>Patricia Carey, AAI chief executive, said: “We are very encouraged by the number of people who have registered. Come October, when the free services under the legislation open, adoptees will finally have the right to access all of their birth information held by the state.

Just as in 2009 and again in 2013, when massive rainstorms inundated Cumbria and the West Country, lives were lost, thousands of homes were flooded, it took months to recover from and cost hundreds of millions of pounds.</p> <p>But how far have these winter storms been caused by the climate crisis? Until 2015, the stock answer of government and meteorologists was that it was impossible to attribute the climate emergency to any particular weather event and that they were most likely extreme, once-in-a-century disasters and by implication not much for politicians to worry about.</p> <p>In 2009, Labour environment secretary Hilary Benn could say that the huge floods in Cumbria were a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4cae3af6-112d-11df-a6d6-00144feab49a\">once-in-a-millennium</a>” meteorological event against whose consequences no community could wholly protect itself. He was right – up to a point. Many studies assessed in t<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/syr/\">he 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report</a> suggested that extreme weather events should be expected in a heating world – after all, the warmer the air, the more moisture it could hold – but attributing links between unusual flooding and the climate crisis could only be made with “medium” certainty.</p> <p>That caution was correct and understandable, but it provided fuel for the arguments of deniers and rightwing thinktanks, giving governments around the world the perfect excuse to do little or nothing. Fortunately, climate science moves fast and has a way of catching up with events. Advances in computer modelling meant that given enough long-term data it was possible to estimate the contribution made by the climate crisis to flood events. It was made easier in Britain because of the existence of detailed climate models and regional maps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/04/climate-breakdown-supercharging-extreme-weather\">Revealed: how climate breakdown is supercharging toll of extreme weather</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pioneered by teams from Oxford university and the Netherlands, who used the computing power of thousands of desktop machines in people’s homes to run <a href=\"https://www.climateprediction.net/human-influence-on-climate-in-the-2014-southern-england-winter-floods-and-their-impacts/\">tens of thousands of simulations</a> of individual weather events either with or without the climate crisis, it was shown conclusively by 2016 that global heating was at least partly responsible for increased flooding in Britain.</p> <p>Now, with even greater computer power and insight, comes the most comprehensive compilation of global attribution studies, analysing more than 500 recent extreme weather events, including heatwaves, droughts, floods and storms. It shows beyond doubt that we are in the era of climate destruction and that the human destabilisation of the climate is global and worsening. At least 12 of the most serious events, the authors conclude, would have been all but impossible without human-caused global heating.</p> <p>The implications are sobering and must galvanise action. Not only does the new database show that climate breakdown is already ruining economies and costing tens of thousands of lives every year, but that the continuing refusal of governments to act decisively will inevitably prove ecologically disastrous without immediate action.</p> <p>It shows that a future of spiralling human disasters is all but certain. This year’s record-breaking heatwaves, the wildfires hitting the northern hemisphere, and the floods sweeping Australia, Bangladesh, Uganda and elsewhere will almost certainly be attributed to global heating. Astonishingly, it suggests that one in three deaths caused by summer heat over the last 30 years were the direct result of human-caused global heating, implying a death toll of millions – potentially more than Covid and HIV/Aids. Without rapid action to slash carbon emissions – by 50% by 2030 – far worse extreme weather will ensue.</p> <p>With these new studies, the most important argument of deniers, oil companies and reluctant governments not to act has been removed. With an immediate and growing global energy crisis gathering pace, and extreme weather affecting most people on Earth, governments must surely come together at the next UN climate summit in November to pledge immediate action.</p> <p>That means the UK government must urgently invest billions of pounds to insulate buildings, oil companies must drop all plans to extract more oil, and renewable energy must be prioritised over all fossil fuel burning.</p> <p>For 30 or more years we have had glimpses of what a hotter world would look like but have had only limited ways to understand what was happening. Now we begin to see the full picture of global heating. We are clearly all in it together.</p> <ul> <li><p>John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/04/jessica-korda-handles-missing-luggage-with-strong-start-at-womens-open","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T16:16:40Z","webTitle":"Jessica Korda handles missing luggage with strong start at Women’s Open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/04/jessica-korda-handles-missing-luggage-with-strong-start-at-womens-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/04/jessica-korda-handles-missing-luggage-with-strong-start-at-womens-open","fields":{"headline":"Jessica Korda handles missing luggage with strong start at Women’s Open","trailText":"Jessica Korda’s opening 66 at the Women’s Open was worthy of extra credit given her luggage remains trapped in Zurich airport","byline":"Ewan Murray at Muirfield","body":"<p>It is difficult enough to negotiate the vagaries of Muirfield without the associated hassle of doing it in borrowed attire.

We’ve run out of fingers and toes keeping track of the number of occasions that the MPC has revised upwards its inflation forecasts in the past year. UK headline inflation is now expected to peak at 13.3% in October, and remain just shy of double-digits in twelve months time.</p> \n   <p>Of particular concern is the bank’s appraisal on the impact of the cost of living crisis on economic activity.

In terms of the rate decision itself, a 50-basis point hike is expected and as such won’t come as surprise. But if the BoE once again opts for 25 bp hike, this will surprise the markets and could send the pound tumbling back to $1.20.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Vote split</strong><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Size matters, but so does the vote split. In June, the MPC had voted 6-3 in favour of a 25bp hike, although this time Governor Bailey will be pushing for a 50-basis-point move, which means all those 3 hawks who had dissented in June, will be happy this time.</p> \n   <p>Still, the decision to hike by 50 basis points is unlikely to be unanimous in my view, given that there are doves in the BoE camp such as Silvana Tenreyro and Jon Cunliffe. So, we are probably looking at a 7-2 or 6-3 split in favour of 50 bp hike.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Forward guidance</strong><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the BoE’s policy statement echoes that of Federal Reserve and Reserve Bank of Australia to give it more flexibility on policy, then the pound could fall. So, watch out for a statement in the lines of “the size and timing of future hikes will be guided by the incoming data.” </p> \n   <p>However, if the BoE is more explicit in terms of acting forcefully to tackle 40-year-high inflation, then this could see the pound make more ground against the dollar and euro.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62eb9a728f0878ca99e20e91\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T10:23:41.922Z\">11.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the City, the financial markets are calm as traders await the Bank’s decision.</p> \n  <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> index of blue-chip shares is slightly higher, while the pound has risen almost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.219, near Monday’s five-week high.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TraderMarcoCost/status/1555132619494494208\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Stocks?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Stocks</a> steady as markets bet on hefty Bank of England hike</p>— Marco Ða ℂosta (@TraderMarcoCost) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TraderMarcoCost/status/1555132619494494208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 4, 2022</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-62eb8e108f08b58de97ec650\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-04T10:01:15.061Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full story: Is Bank of England about to break precedent on interest rates?</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>There’s an hour to go until the Bank’s eagerly awaited interest rate announcement, which could bring the biggest increase in borrowing costs in 27 years:</strong></p> \n  <p>After edging rates up by a quarter-point at a time, the financial markets are betting that Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee (MPC) will announce a 0.5 percentage-point jump at noon, something that has never happened since the Bank was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/independence-day-why-gordon-brown-gave-the-bank-the-right-to-set-interest-rates\">granted independence</a> in 1997.<br></p> \n  <p>The previous time interest rates were raised by such a margin, John Major was the prime minister, Ken Clarke was the chancellor and Eddie George was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> governor.

Where before they would simply hire a van and set off, now they spend precious time compiling mindless lists: a description, value and weight for every single work being exhibited, the weight of the packing cases, a list of the tools needed for installing the exhibition, together with the value of each. The list goes on.

If Brexit is a good thing, it must have benefited someone at least in a measurable way. Who is that someone (excluding politicians and the media)? We need only one name. We need empirical proof that there is at least one more winner than there are losers.</p> <p>Unless we can be introduced to this model Brexit citizen by Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss, all politicians should start undoing the damage caused by the ineptitude of the Conservative party. The result of the 2016 referendum can be respected while applying the pre-2016 British virtues of common sense and moderation. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Nick Inman</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Larreule, Hautes-Pyrénées, France</em></p> <p>• John Harris writes that the government has tried to patch up the damage to universities caused by our exit from Erasmus+ by introducing the Turing programme. Unlike Erasmus+, this is not a reciprocal scheme. He doesn’t mention the effect that withdrawing from Erasmus+ has had on schools, youth groups and adult education. For schools especially, it was particularly damaging to be denied access to collaborative projects, teacher in-service programmes and job shadowing. The Turing programme has no provision for these enriching activities and nothing for youth groups or adult education. The cost of Erasmus+, which Boris Johnson gave as a reason for our withdrawal, took no account of the spending power of incoming groups; Erasmus+ students now take their grants to Ireland or the Netherlands. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Ray Kirtley</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Chair, UK Global Learning Association for Schools</em></p> <p>• An eleventh reason why Brexit has been a disaster is a major deterioration in political morality, since both parties feel compelled to lie about Brexit. The competition for Tory leader has particularly highlighted this, but virtually everyone is at it. The effect on the electorate’s faith in politics, and consequently the future of democracy, is deeply damaging.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Jeremy Cushing</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Exeter </em></p> <p>• John Harris does not mention Boris Johnson and rightly so. The Brexit disaster is not simply the work of one rogue prime minister.

Described in his personal website’s bio section as “one of today’s premiere [sic] standup comics,” his best-known screen work may be his 140-plus appearances on the late-night talkshow Chelsea Lately. Despite a seemingly low-ish profile, he is now starring in the wide-release studio vehicle Easter Sunday, the golden-ticket gig daydreamed about by all joke-tellers. This is because Koy’s site wasn’t exaggerating his onstage success: he has sold out stadium shows months in advance across America, still without making much of a dent in the cultural mainstream. Like Sebastian Maniscalco – or in a more general sense, Yellowstone and The Big Bang Theory – he really is immensely popular, just not with the tastemaker class of media consumer acting as arbiters of what’s current and relevant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/02/bodies-bodies-bodies-review-gen-z-comedy-horror\">Bodies Bodies Bodies review – Gen Z comedy horror plays a fun game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The challenge of carrying a whole movie, put to an actor whose last credit was a bit part as Vladimir Lenin in 2019’s possibly nonexistent Anastasia: Once Upon a Time, goes a way toward explaining the overall vibe that this substandard product shouldn’t have passed Universal’s quality control. He appears visibly uncomfortable as alter ego Jo Valencia, grinning with his full count of blindingly white teeth every few seconds as if to reassure us that everything’s all right and we’re all having a good time, like a parent trying to calm a shrieking infant in an airport. And yet he’s right at home in a film that never rises past his level, meeting him on the low bar he’s set for himself and eventually beckoning him downward toward intriguing, unexpected forms of badness. What begins as a broad comedy pursuing the workable angle of a My Big Fat Filipino Easter, its cardinal sin topping out at mere corniness, slowly mutates into something more confused, incompetent and arrogant.</p> <p>Jo Valencia must return to the Filipino enclave of Daly City, a hop and a skip south of San Francisco, to appease his lovably overbearing immigrant family. He’s a struggling no-name trying to make the jump to legitimate actor, vexed by his past gig as a beer-commercial sloganeer, just like in Party Down. He’s this close to clinching a network job, but they want him to do an accent he’d rather not, just like in Master of None. And the divorcee balances it all with caring for his kid (internet comic Brandon Wardell, reading his hackneyed lines in such a way as to convey an ironic remove from them), who is named Jo Jr and getting a C- in math, just like in the life of Koy’s real-world son.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIixb42aJPg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YIixb42aJPg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>We know that by the end of all this, the pair will have bonded and accepted that even though they may push our buttons, our loved ones are all we have. In a 96-minute movie, however, that still leaves a lot of room to fill. Koy, director Jay Chandrasekhar (who also literally phones in a supporting turn as Jo’s smarmy talent agent), and writers Ken Cheng and Kate Angelo break up the afternoon with a ludicrous subplot about Jo’s knucklehead cousin (Eugene Cordero, always a treat), a $15,000 debt and a scramble to unload a pair of legendary boxing gloves owned by the Filipino community’s apparent pride and joy, Manny Pacquiao. This occasions the most laugh-heavy scenes in the movie – a pair of detours to visit a fence played by the reliable Jimmy O Yang and then a celebrity buyer, though it also has a way of warping the plausibility of the down-to-earth segments of the script.</p> <p>More than just killing time, Jo’s shenanigans seem geared to prove what a cool, great guy he is. There’s a hint of self-aggrandizement that grows more palpable as we learn that Jo can stunt-drive with the fastest and furiousest (a skill that goes unexplained), or punch a gangster out cold with a one-hit KO that Manny would approve of. In the handful of scenes that show Jo busting out his standup act to quell tensions at a church service or family get-together, the copious cutaway shots to applauding onlookers and roaring piped-in laughter confirm that he is indeed killing it. Koy’s impulse to have his way comes across most blatantly in the resolution with his son, which ends with the teen realizing that he should be more patient and understanding of his father’s workaholic absenteeism. Even the formulaic Jim Carrey pictures this plot schematic rips off knew how to do pat sentimentalism right.</p> <p>The saving grace here should be the win for the Filipino community, commanding a big-screen moment with a cast of undervalued Asian stars. But they’re all short-changed by a hypocritical sense of heritage and pride. Jo makes a thing out of his reluctance to perform caricature for the amusement of whites, except that doing a funny auntie voice is the cornerstone of his live show <em>and </em>the snippets he recycles within the film. The Filipino experience is reduced to a halo-halo metaphor, mixed-up and harmonious and beautiful, a writerly device that sounds more offensive the more demographics one mentally applies it to. (“Being Italian is like a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs,” etc.) The joy of solidarity within a tight-knit ethnic group ultimately boils down to a karaoke rendition of I Gotta Feeling by the Black Eyed Peas, a lunging attempt for lowest-common-denominator relatability disguised as cultural distinction.

At least a dozen of the most serious events, from killer heatwaves to broiling seas, would have been all but impossible without human-caused global heating, the analysis found.</p> \n<p>Most worryingly, all this is happening with a rise of just 1C in the planet’s average temperature. The role of global heating in supercharging extreme weather is happening at “astonishing speed”, scientists say.</p> \n<p>“The world is changing fast and it’s already hurting us – that is the blunt summary,” said Prof Maarten van Aalst, the director of the International Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. The world is currently <a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/\">on track for a rise of at least 2.5C</a>. Based on what we have experienced so far, that would deliver death and destruction far greater than already suffered.</p> \n<p>The studies analysed used a scientific technique called attribution to determine how much worse, or more likely, an extreme weather event was made by human-caused global heating. The technique’s power is in drawing a direct link between the disasters that people suffer through and the often abstract increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases caused by the mass burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. It brings the scientific reality of the climate crisis crashing home.</p> \n<p>The climate information website <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world/\">Carbon Brief compiled</a> a new database of attribution studies of more than 500 events – every such study available – and shared it exclusively with the Guardian.

The goal of limiting heating to 1.5C was <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2022-07-18/secretary-generals-video-message-the-petersberg-dialogue\">“on life support” with a weakening pulse</a>, said the UN general secretary, António Guterres, in July. Without very rapid action to slash carbon emissions – by 50% by 2030 – far worse extreme weather will ensue.</p> \n<p>“Gone are the days when global heating was in the future,” said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who delivered the 2015 Paris climate deal. “Human-induced heating is wrecking lives and livelihoods today. Every day of higher emissions increases human poverty and misery. Continuing on the path of rising emissions is senseless, selfish and avoidable.”</p> \n<p>Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a youth activist and survivor of the super typhoons that have hit the Philippines, said: “These studies are proof that what is being done is nowhere near enough. This is a life and death situation.” </p> \n<p>There is no time to waste, says Prof Bill McGuire, at University College London: “What is astonishing is the speed with which global heating is translating into a hike in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather when the average temperature of the planet is up by just a little more than 1C.”</p> \n<p>Attribution studies have so far assessed only a small fraction of extreme weather events, with particularly concerning gaps in the global south, which is least responsible for the climate crisis but home to many of the people most vulnerable to its effects. </p> \n<p>But the following is what we know for sure about how much human-caused climate change is to blame for supercharging extreme weather, where it has already hit, and what it has cost us in lives and damage. It is a sobering reckoning of how deeply the climate crisis has already cut into societies and how desperate the need is to stop further deterioration.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<h2><strong>Finding the footprint</strong></h2> \n<p>The fact that global heating drives more extreme weather is no surprise, even if the pace of change is shocking. Greenhouse gases pumped into the atmosphere by human activity trap more of the sun’s heat, putting more energy into weather systems, worsening their impacts.</p> \n<p>Scorching heatwaves are the most obvious manifestation, and can also set forests ablaze. Hotter air can hold more water vapour – about 7% more per 1C rise – which means more intense downpours and greater floods. The oceans absorb most of the planet’s trapped heat, and warmer seas fuel more powerful hurricanes and typhoons. Those heated waters also expand, pushing up sea level and enabling storms to crash further inland.</p> \n<p>The question the world’s scientists are tackling is to what extent human-caused global heating is to blame for a particular extreme weather event as opposed to natural variability in weather patterns.</p> \n<p>Scientists calculate this by using weather records and computer models to compare two worlds. One is the world we are in, heated by our carbon emissions. The other is the world before the mass burning of fossil fuels and rising temperatures. Researchers assess how frequent a specific extreme weather event is in both worlds. If it is more intense or more frequent in our heated world, then the footprint of global heating is clear.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<h2>Jacobabad, Pakistan</h2> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/25/it-seems-this-heat-will-take-our-lives-pakistan-city-fearful-jacobabad-after-hitting-51c\">Heatwave, May 2022</a></strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"65384d2c996c6ec95e25e26cab55dc93ad0bc2c5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65384d2c996c6ec95e25e26cab55dc93ad0bc2c5/0_0_4956_2974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman uses a paper sheet to fan her child amid a power cut during a heatwave in Jacobabad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Because of the heat, we do not get enough sleep.

Otto said: “It broke records by 5C and really brought home to me that something that was impossible from a statistical point of view can now happen as a new extreme. That is scary.”</p> \n<p>Yet this once unimaginable calamity would be expected every 10 years on average if the world heats to 2C, Otto said. Her fear is that action to protect people from extreme weather normally uses past disasters as a guide – an approach that is useless if the new extremes are far worse. “It’s really hard if you have never experienced anything even remotely like it.”</p> \n<p>The searing summer of 2018 saw simultaneous heatwaves stretch across the northern hemisphere from the US to <a href=\"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sola/15A/0/15A_15A-002/_article/-char/en\">Japan</a>, and bears a striking resemblance to the events unfolding in 2022. “It is virtually certain the 2018 events <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019EF001189\">would not have occurred without human‐induced climate change</a>,” scientists found.

Another study found that in many areas, the hottest days and seasons “<a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2f1a\">would not have occurred in thousands of years</a>” without global heating.</p> \n<p>Normally cold places are particularly vulnerable as they are warming the fastest. The phenomenal heat in Siberia in 2020, when the Arctic town of Verkhoyansk registered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/15/climate-change-made-siberian-heatwave-600-times-more-likely-study\">record high of 38C in June</a>, “<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03052-w\">would have been practically impossible</a>” without human influence.

The study covered 732 locations in 43 nations; a lack of data limited wider coverage. It is tricky to extrapolate these findings to a global figure, but a rough estimate given by the scientists is more than 100,000 deaths a year. Over decades, that implies a toll of millions of lives.</p> \n<p>Some places are being hit especially hard. About three-quarters of heat deaths in Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala and Peru result from human-caused global heating, far above the 37% average in the study. This is a consequence of especially rapid heating in these regions combined with the high vulnerability of poorer people.</p> \n<p>About 66% of heat deaths in Kuwait and Iran are also attributed to the climate crisis, while in Norway the proportion is almost 50%. Southern Europe has a high number of deaths owing to an elderly population and the rapidly rising frequency of heatwaves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/twenty_countries-zip/giv-6562ofmnUSLCnOTc/\" data-alt=\"Chart depicting summer heat deaths attributable to global heathing\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/twenty_countries-zip/giv-6562ofmnUSLCnOTc/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>“These estimates of impacts, although a little apocalyptic, are very much needed as they convey a clear message,” said Vicedo-Cabrera. “[These deaths] have occurred with an average global temperature increase of only 1C, which is lower than even the strictest climate targets outlined in the Paris agreement (1.5-2C) and are a fraction of what may occur if emissions are left unchecked.”</p> \n<p>The grim toll of human-caused global heating on children was revealed in a study that found it had <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac7ac5/meta\">killed 7,000 to 11,000 children</a> under five every year for the last decade in sub-Saharan Africa. The level of heat-related child deaths was double what it would have been without climate change, the researchers said.</p> \n<p>Prof Dann Mitchell, of the University of Bristol, UK, warned that countries lacking the health data needed for such studies were often <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01049-y\">among the poorest and most vulnerable</a>, and, worryingly, also major hotspots of rapid population growth, such as India and Nigeria.</p> \n<p>However, pinning the blame for deaths on global heating does not mean they cannot be prevented with early warnings and adaptation. In Europe, for example, said Van Aalst, “these are almost entirely avoidable deaths”.</p> \n<p>The number of global heating deaths caused by more complex extreme weather is trickier to assess. But the increased intensity of Hurricane Maria due to human-induced climate change led to the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096321000140\">deaths of up to 3,670 people</a> in 2017, according to one study.</p> \n<p>Extreme weather also destroys houses, businesses, roads, bridges and more, and researchers have begun adding up these costs. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-020-02692-8\">Hurricane Harvey’s $67bn in climate costs</a> was in part due to global heating having increased the extreme rainfall by about 20%.

It was not just the scientists’ conclusion that “remarkably, the <a href=\"https://ascmo.copernicus.org/articles/6/205/2020/\">heatwave might not have been possible without climate change</a>”, but the scale of the soaring temperature increases.</p> \n<p>“The heatwave we looked at in Toulouse would have been 4C cooler without climate change, and that was in a world that had only had 1C of global warming,” Otto said. “A change of 4C is incredible.” </p> \n<p>Scientists are increasingly concerned that the steady rise in global average temperature is not mirrored by a gradual rise in extreme weather but is delivering extraordinary events. “We so often see things that take us by surprise,” said Van Aalst. “The heat trends in western Europe, for instance, are so much faster in the observations than we would expect from the models.” Researchers think the models do not yet capture all the factors involved.</p> \n<p>Records were also shattered by the downpours that caused fatal flooding across Germany and Belgium in July 2021, killing at least 243 people. Those rains were found to have been made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/23/climate-crisis-made-deadly-german-floods-up-to-nine-times-more-likely\">up to nine times more likely by global heating</a>.</p> \n<p>The climate crisis is also manifesting in places better known for mild weather.

Each statistic reflects a community that experienced that extreme weather event – a family, an individual, a student, a young person whose lives were devastated because of the climate crisis.”</p> \n<p>China in particular is enduring a rollercoaster of extreme weather made worse by global heating. Exceptional rains at the start of 2019 were made 30% more likely and blocked out the sun in the Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain, <a href=\"https://www.ametsoc.net/eee/2019/EEEin2019.pdf\">cutting sunshine hours by 57%</a> and reducing rice production.</p> \n<p>By May that year, drought conditions had arrived in south-west China. The severe low rainfall event was made about <a href=\"https://www.ametsoc.net/eee/2019/EEEin2019.pdf\">six times more likely by human climate influence</a>. Extreme wildfires followed in south China, with the weather-related risk <a href=\"https://www.ametsoc.net/eee/2019/EEEin2019.pdf\">ramped up sevenfold by global heating</a>. In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/world/asia/china-fire-sichuan.html\">one conflagration</a>, “a huge fireball was formed in an instant”, the authorities reported, killing 30 people.</p> \n<p>A year later, it was heavy rain that struck south-west China in August. Flood waters reached the toes of the famous <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-53831271\">Leshan Giant Buddha</a> statue for the first time since the communist state was formed in 1949.

Global heating made them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/13/south-africa-floods-climate-crisis-global-heating\">twice as likely</a> and more intense. Drought has also been exacerbated, with the high-profile “day zero” event in Cape Town in 2018 the result of an exceptionally dry three years – a pattern made “<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2009144117\">five to six times more likely</a>” by global heating.</p> \n<p>The rest of Africa has been poorly studied. But global heating played a <a href=\"http://www.ametsoc.net/eee/2015/15_african_drought.pdf\">significant role</a> in the 2015 drought in Ethiopia, the <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/science-summary-drought-ethiopia-2015#:~:text=The%20worst%20drought%20in%20decades,and%20weakened%20or%20dead%20livestock.\">worst in decades</a>, affecting nearly 10 million people and killing crops and livestock. In Lesotho, global heating was a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83375-x\">“critical driver” of a food crisis</a> that gripped the nation in 2007.</p> \n<p>Van Aalst said it is vital to remember that these climate-driven events do not act alone but compound other problems. “For instance, there is terrible hunger in the Horn of Africa, with literally thousands of people dying right now and the potential for hundreds of thousands more,” he said. “That is partly drought and other climate-related hazards – they’ve had floods and locust infestations as well.” But the extreme weather had intensified the problems caused by conflicts, a Covid-related rise in extreme poverty and high food prices due to the war in Ukraine, he said.</p> \n<p>Not all extreme weather events analysed find an influence from global heating. But these studies are revealing too, said Otto, in highlighting the depth of existing fragility. The recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/01/poverty-not-climate-breakdown-caused-madagascars-food-crisis-finds-study\">famine in Madagascar was the result of poverty</a> and overreliance on annual rains, not global heating, research found. “This showed just how much there is to do to even be resilient in the face of the current climate that we have,” let alone a worsening one, Otto said.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<h2>Zway, Ethiopia</h2> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.namibian.com.na/141508/archive-read/Millions-at-risk-as-severe-drought-hits-Ethiopia\">Drought, 2015</a></strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b82ad1a9788e4d56c2ca6528ad2d6864f85418f7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b82ad1a9788e4d56c2ca6528ad2d6864f85418f7/0_131_5760_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sara, 50, scoops muddy water from a hand-dug well in hopes of bringing something home for her family to use in Ethiopia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There is nothing we can do.

It was part of a week of downpours that led to catastrophic floods and landslides, killing at least 133 people and displacing tens of thousands more. A <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-increased-heavy-rainfall-hitting-vulnerable-communities-in-eastern-northeast-brazil/\">rapid assessment found global heating</a> was at least partly responsible.</p> \n<p>But few other attribution studies have been done in Latin America, home to 650 million people. One found the fingerprints of global heating on a severe drought in the southern Amazon in 2010. The subsequent die-off of trees, and stunted growth of others, <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GB005133\">resulted in 4bn more tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub></a> in the atmosphere, roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of the European Union.</p> \n<p>Even more temperate parts of South America have been affected. In December 2013, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-25564633\">Argentina endured a heatwave</a> made <a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-ExplainingExtremeEvents2014.1\">five times more likely</a> by global heating, and in 2017 major floods in Uruguay were <a href=\"http://www.ametsoc.net/eee/2017a/ch9_EEEof2017_Abreu.pdf\">made more likely by the same factor</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Conclusions:</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Known unknowns</strong></h2> \n<p>The scarcity of studies in the global south worries scientists. “It’s a huge concern and is adding to the injustice of climate change,” said Van Aalst. “The people that have contributed the least to it are hit the hardest and we can’t even tell how bad it really is.”</p> \n<p>The lack of knowledge is preventing people from finding the best ways to deal with the impacts, says Otto. “Attribution studies are not just about distilling the role of climate change but about trying to disentangle drivers of disasters.” The problem is the lack of local scientific expertise and funding – most researchers work on attribution studies as volunteers.</p> \n<p>“Without crucial support for global south-based research, we will be forgotten once again,” said Tan.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Long tail</strong></h2> \n<p>The heaviest footprint of the climate crisis on human suffering has been found in recent events, but global heating has been hurting us for many years. There are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0771-7\">traces of its influence on the heatwaves</a> that caused the Dust Bowl in the US in the mid-1930s. The starving families forced to leave their homes, immortalised in John Steinbeck’s novel The Grapes of Wrath, are mirrored by those enduring heat, drought and hunger today.</p> \n<p>A global study of <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL067448\">hot weather events since 1900</a> also found “a significant human contribution to the probability of record‐breaking global temperature events as early as the 1930s”.</p> \n<p>More than 20 years ago, before many of today’s youth climate strikers were born, Australia’s “millennium drought” was “<a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00322.1\">partially attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse warming</a>”. In England, two-thirds of the autumn floods in 2000 were made <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v470/n7334/full/nature09762.html\">90% more likely by global heating</a>. And researchers now estimate that flood heights from Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005, would have been <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-1011-1\">15-60% lower without global heating</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>The future in our hands</strong></h2> \n<p>The science of attribution has delivered a bleak but undeniable picture of how global heating is already bringing death and destruction. But what about the future?</p> \n<p>“This is what a feverish Earth looks like today,” said Bill McKibben, a climate author and campaigner. <strong>“</strong>The fact that we’re currently headed for 3C of temperature rise, in the light of these studies, is of course terrifying. And 3C won’t be three times as worse – the damage will be exponential, not linear.”</p> \n<p>Vicedo-Cabrera was blunt about our prospects.

But the disgraced former leader will be an albatross around Truss’s neck with the general electorate. Chris Hopkins of Savanta ComRes says: “He has done so much damage to the Tory brand.” He is still wildly unpopular with voters, and Partygate is still a cause of outrage.</p> <p>Naturally, voters worry most about the cost of living, but that doesn’t mean they back tax cuts, says Gideon Skinner of Ipsos Mori. They are split, and prefer rising spending to spending cuts. And, he says: “They want to know more about what they would actually do about the cost of living, about people’s rising bills.” That <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp#:~:text=The%20Laffer%20Curve%20is%20a,in%20increased%20total%20tax%20revenue.\">Laffer curve</a> of unicorn economics that says tax cuts perversely bring in more to the Treasury doesn’t seem to convince most people.</p> <p>Just look at the promises of this Conservative party. Despite exports to the EU falling by 14% last year, its Northern Ireland protocol bill threatens a trade war. The ominously bellicose Truss talks as if she were confronting the Nazis or Stalin: “We’ve learned from history that there is only one thing the EU understands and that is strength.” A bonfire of EU regulations “further and faster” will find no favour, as pollsters say voters want higher not lower standards for food quality, chemical and goods safety, animal welfare and worker rights. Voters want more people let in from the EU to fill vacancies. Few leave voters want to feel they were wrong. But Labour’s “make Brexit work” will stand in good contrast with Truss’s intent to make Brexit worse.</p> <p>People want higher business taxes, but Truss would stop that, even as profiteering by the likes of BP and Shell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/shell-staff-bonus-record-profits-oil-gas-prices\">pours billions into shareholder pockets</a>. Neither candidate calls for them to use the bonanza to ease consumer prices or to invest in renewables.</p> <p>As for the climate, voters rank it high in their concerns, including Tory voters, though it barely features in this debate. Truss backs fracking (unpopular) and would stop land being used for solar farms, while Sunak would ban the onshore windfarms that are the cheapest renewables. Ipsos’s Skinner finds a majority of voters wanting to meet net zero targets and half want that target reached sooner than 2050.</p> <p>Housing? As prices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/02/uk-house-prices-cost-of-living-crisis-price-rise\">rise by another 11% this year</a> and mortgages move even further out of reach of the young, Truss abandons targets for housebuilding. Both want higher education standards, but neither offers money.</p> <p>Neither says much about the collapsing NHS, though it is voters’ second highest concern in most polls. Sunak would charge £10 for missed GP appointments, something opposed by GPs who know their patients’ many problems – and collecting it would cost more than that. His “taskforce” to bring down waiting lists was greeted with derision by desperate NHS staff: where’s the money for training more clinicians? Truss would cut NHS “bureaucracy”, despite <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reducing-bureaucracy-in-the-health-and-social-care-system-call-for-evidence/outcome/busting-bureaucracy-empowering-frontline-staff-by-reducing-excess-bureaucracy-in-the-health-and-care-system-in-england\">only 2% of UK healthcare spending going on administration</a> – less than half what France and Germany spend. “Bureaucracy” is a phoney saving that is the last refuge of scoundrel politicians. Should scarce doctors and nurses spend more time on admin?</p> <p>As they compete to send most refugees to Rwanda, even that is not straightforwardly popular: immigration has lost its saliency and, says Skinner, “views are quite nuanced”.</p> <p>Now that’s something you couldn’t say about the ever more extreme positions taken by these two. Sunak would cut income tax by 4%! Truss revived her old idea of cutting public sector pay in all the regions relying on it most, though she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/liz-truss-u-turns-plan-cut-public-sector-pay-outside-london-tory-leadership\">forced to U-turn</a>.

It would be hard to find a worse set of conditions for a government before a general election.</p> \n<p>Threadneedle Street was taking plenty of flak even before it announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-1-point-75-per-cent-in-biggest-hike-in-27-years\">its latest gruesome forecasts</a>. It can expect no letup now, because the government will need to find a scapegoat for the misery to come.</p> \n<p>And there could be plenty of that. The fact that the Bank’s monetary policy committee raised interest rates for a sixth meeting in a row came as no shock. More surprising was the downbeat nature of the predictions that accompanied the MPC’s decision.</p> \n<p>Inflation is now expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-1-point-75-per-cent-in-biggest-hike-in-27-years\">peak at 13.3% in October</a> – its highest since September 1980 – and will still be close to 10% in a year’s time. The economy will begin to contract in the final three months of this year and not start to grow again until early 2024. Living standards will fall by 5% over the next two years – a drop unmatched since modern records began in the early 1960s.</p> \n<p>Against this backdrop, the MPC pushed up interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 1.75%. Not only was it the biggest increase in the official cost of borrowing since 1995, it was also the first time the committee has raised rates while forecasting a recession.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2ae93d06-4d43-4eba-a374-fe541091508a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FbFiwflKrcY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Eight of its nine members voted for a 0.5-point increase, on the grounds that the labour market remained tight and there was a risk of inflation becoming embedded. But the labour market is not expected to stay strong for long – the Bank thinks a recession, projected to last as long as those of the early 1980s and the late 2000s, will push unemployment from under 4% to well over 6% by 2025. Longer dole queues and higher interest rates will lead to a marked cooling in the housing market.</p> \n<p>The forecasts are based on two assumptions: that the financial markets are correct to think interest rates will peak at 3% and that there will be no further government support for struggling households. Both are questionable. Some analysts think the economy is so weak the Bank will stop tightening after one or two more rate rises. There will certainly be more help with energy bills this autumn, whoever is prime minister.</p> \n<p>Politically, the Bank has rarely been in a tighter spot. A year ago it thought inflation would peak at 4% but it has raised its forecast steadily ever since. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, rejected criticism that the MPC had been asleep at the wheel and was now slamming on the brakes at exactly the wrong time. The Bank says higher energy prices, which alone account for half the 13% annual inflation rate, and global supply chain bottlenecks are responsible for most of the increase.</p> \n<p>Bailey said pain was inevitable but it would be even worse if the Bank allowed inflation to take root. The MPC’s warning that it will be “particularly alert to indications of more persistent inflationary pressures” means another half-point increase is possible next month.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business&nbsp;email&nbsp;sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for&nbsp;Business&nbsp;Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden&nbsp;email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Both Conservative leadership contenders said the Bank’s forecasts supported their economic plans: in Rishi Sunak’s case, that bringing down inflation was the number one priority; in the case of Liz Truss, that tax cuts were needed to fend off recession. </p> \n<p>Truss, the frontrunner to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/04/liz-truss-review-bank-of-england-mandate-says-tory-ally\">openly critical of Threadneedle Street</a>.

It’s worth applauding not because of the mere fact of what it is and what it means but because screenwriter Patrick Aison (a TV pro with credits including Jack Ryan and Wayward Pines), finds a way to make it all seem perfectly seamless, the setting an inventive way to impose a new set of restrictions on a story we’ve seen a few too many times before.

It’s an interesting puzzle for a writer and Aison finds nifty ways to work around it, focusing on stripped-back ingenuity rather than mere weaponry (some of Naru’s ideas will be met with a vocal aha).</p> <p>While it’s a treat for those at home, streaming exclusively on the small screen, it’s a bit of a shame that something with such impressively grand vistas and intricate, well-choreographed action won’t be seen at the cinema, yet another recent digital premiere that feels suited for a life less ordinary (and one like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/16/father-of-the-bride-review-slick-comedy-remake-piles-on-the-charm\">Father of the Bride</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/good-luck-to-you-leo-grande-emma-thompson\">Good Luck to You Leo Grande</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/13/spiderhead-review-netflix-prison-experiment-fable-is-going-nowhere\">Spiderhead</a> that could have made some considerable money at the box office). The Predator franchise has never been a particularly complex one and has always suffered from the inescapable comparisons to Alien but the pleasingly self-contained Prey is made with an awareness of what simple pleasures we expect and enjoy and unlike some of the weaker entries, there’s no muddled or misfiring attempt to add much depth or exposition (the moment in the often brilliantly silly Alien vs Predator when the Predator explains to Sanaa Lathan’s character that he’s set a timed bomb by doing an explosion sign with his hand is an all-timer). Despite being a prequel, there’s mercifully no attempt to delve into the mythology and origins of the Predator and no suggestion that the world is receiving a deeper expansion anytime soon.</p> <p>It works best when it’s at its most B-movie basic and while it doesn’t quite have the giddy highs of last year’s similarly meat-and-potatoes monster movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/29/godzilla-vs-kong-review-duelling-monsters\">Godzilla vs Kong</a>, it smashes through a low bar with ease. Said smashing is done with gusto from 25-year-old Midthunder who rises to the challenge of taking on the Predator even if her character’s ascent from unsure warrior-in-training to top-of-the-food-chain action hero is missing a few beats or, dare I say, a training montage. It leaves a few how-did-shes in the second act before a rousing finale leaves us in no doubt of her powers.</p> <p>We didn’t need a Predator prequel (have we ever really needed <em>any</em> prequel?) but Prey is a nimble beast, far nimbler than it could have been and while it’s not quite enough to make us crave more from a franchise that’s already given us too much, it’s enough to justify the journey way back.</p> <ul> <li><p>Prey is available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ elsewhere on 5 August</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/04/sussex-police-officers-investigated-over-death-of-man-93-after-being-tasered","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T15:25:49Z","webTitle":"Inquiry after 93-year-old man with one leg dies after being Tasered by police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/04/sussex-police-officers-investigated-over-death-of-man-93-after-being-tasered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/04/sussex-police-officers-investigated-over-death-of-man-93-after-being-tasered","fields":{"headline":"Inquiry after 93-year-old man with one leg dies after being Tasered by police","trailText":"Donald Burgess, who had dementia and had threatened care home staff, died three weeks after incident in Sussex","byline":"Matthew Weaver Josh Halliday Jane Clinton","body":"<p>Two police officers involved in firing a Taser at a 93-year-old man in a wheelchair, who had threatened care home staff with a knife, are being investigated for manslaughter after the man’s death.</p> <p>Donald Burgess, who had one leg and had dementia, died last month, three weeks after being hit by the Taser.</p> <p>On Thursday the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) confirmed it was investigating the 21 June incident, which involved two constables from Sussex police.</p> <p>They were responding to calls that a resident at a care home in St Leonards-on-Sea had a knife and was threatening staff.</p> <p>One of the officers tried to restrain Burgess using an incapacitant spray and a baton.

Cristiano Ronaldo and the new gaffer Erik ten Hag are said to be on <em>collision course</em> after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/03/cristiano-ronaldo-behaviour-unacceptable-leaving-game-early-erik-ten-hag-manchester-united\">the forward’s decision to nick off early</a> from last Sunday’s friendly draw against Rayo Vallecano. As pre-season statements of intent go, this is apparently akin to the <em>wantaway</em> forward clearing his locker and booking a one-way flight to Spain (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/04/football-transfer-rumours-chelsea-manchester-united-frenkie-de-jong-marc-cucurella\">or Italy</a>). The insatiable press pack are limbering up for the new top-flight season by frothing at this clash of the titans, and making whispered references to Ten Hag’s reign being <em>in trouble</em>.</p> <p>At which point, a reminder: the Premier League campaign is scheduled to end on 28 May 2023. Can any of us seriously hope to stomach another 10 months of this nonsense? Hopefully not: Ronaldo simply needs to accept a £350,000-per-week wage reduction to sign for Nottingham Forest, which seems to be all the rage this summer. Anyway, is the bronzed Portuguese Adonis even Ten Hag’s biggest problem? The Fiver would say the continuing failure to successfully tempt Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong to Old Trafford is potentially more serious, evoking as it does memories of David Moyes’s fruitless quest to sign Cesc Fàbregas in 2013, early in his ill-fated reign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/04/manchester-united-erik-ten-hag-journey-not-revolution\">There will be no immediate Ten Hag revolution at United. It is a journey | Karen Carney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ah … 2012-13. That was the last year that mighty United won the Premier League, when Alex Ferguson brought the curtain down on his 26-year tenure with one last title. Since then Moyes, Ryan Giggs, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick have all been at the wheel. It’s almost as if the United job has become a poisoned chalice. Along with Ronaldo-gate, Ten Hag’s in-tray includes trying to muster an acceptable performance level from Anthony Martial, the spectre of more anti-Glazer protests, and a surfeit of sub-standard centre-backs.</p> <p>Not to mention that Brighton, who gave United <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/brighton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">an unforgettable 4-0 pummelling</a> at the Amex in May, will come calling at Old Trafford on Sunday. Manchester United in crisis? Now that the Fiver thinks about it, maybe they are. Best of luck, Erik.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“It’s a reality. Racism is there.

Sunak attacks Truss tax cut plan after big interest rate rise","trailText":"Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi said to be on holiday as Bank of England adds to dire economic outlook","byline":"Heather Stewart, Aubrey Allegretti and Jessica Elgot","body":"<p>Rishi Sunak has seized on the Bank of England’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/04/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-1-point-75-per-cent-in-biggest-hike-in-27-years\">historic half-point rate rise</a> to claim that Liz Truss’s plan for unfunded tax cuts would “make everyone poorer”.</p> <p>The Bank’s gloomy forecasts, published alongside the rate decision, underline the scale of the challenge facing the next prime minister, with the economy projected to plunge into a prolonged recession by the end of the year.</p> <p>Despite the dire economic outlook, the Guardian has learned the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, is away from Westminster, as the caretaker government takes a back seat while the leadership contest rages.</p> <p>Zahawi was said to be working remotely from a family holiday.</p> <p>In a statement, the chancellor said: “There is no such thing as a holiday and not working. I never had that in the private sector, nor in government. Ask any entrepreneur and they can tell you that.”</p> <p>He added: “Millions of us dream about getting away with our families, but the privilege and responsibility of public service means that you never get to switch off, that’s why I have had calls and briefings every day and continue to do so.” The prime minister is currently on holiday.</p> <p>Zahawi put out a written statement on the Bank’s announcement and is holding meetings with its governor, Andrew Bailey, later on Thursday and the Treasury’s chief economist.</p> <p>Sunak, the underdog in the leadership race, has repeatedly said throughout the contest that he would wait until inflation was under control, before embarking on a tax-cutting spree.</p> <p>By contrast, Truss has promised £30bn worth of tax cuts, which Sunak has claimed would push up borrowing and boost inflation.</p> <p>“The Bank has acted today and it is imperative that any future government grips inflation, not exacerbates it,” he said.</p> <p>“Increasing borrowing will put upward pressure on interest rates, which will mean increased payments on people’s mortgages. It will also make high inflation and high prices last for longer, making everyone poorer.”</p> <p>Truss has cited the rightwing economist Patrick Minford to support her argument. As he stepped up his attack on her approach, Sunak tweeted a link to a ready reckoner showing the cost to mortgage borrowers, if interest rates rose to 7%, as Minford has said they might have to.</p> <p>Truss said the rate rise “underlines the need for the bold economic plan that I am advocating”.</p> <p>She promised an emergency budget to “kickstart my plan to get our economy growing and offer immediate help to people struggling with their bills” though she has so far proposed few measures to deal with the cost of living, aside from suspending the green levies on energy bills, and reversing recent tax rises.</p> <p>Earlier, Truss supporter Suella Braverman said that if the foreign secretary became prime minister, she would review whether the Bank’s mandate was “fit for purpose” and examine its “exclusionary independence on interest rates”.</p> <p>Braverman, the attorney general, told Sky News the Tory leadership frontrunner would look again at the Bank’s powers. “Interest rates should have been raised a long time ago and the Bank of England has been too slow in this regard,” she said.</p> <p>She added: “Liz Truss has made clear that she wants to review the mandate that the Bank of England has, so that’s going to be looking in detail at exactly what the Bank of England does and see whether it’s actually fit for purpose in terms of its entire exclusionary independence over interest rates.”</p> <p>Truss told a Conservative hustings on Wednesday night she would alter the Bank’s mandate because of the changing economic picture. “The best way of dealing with inflation is monetary policy, and what I have said is I want to change the Bank of England’s mandate to make sure in the future it matches some of the most effective central banks in the world at controlling inflation.</p> <p>“The last time the mandate was looked at was in 1997 under Gordon Brown. Things are very, very different now.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mel Stride, the chair of the Treasury select committee and a Sunak supporter, said it would be dangerous to cut taxes this autumn. “What we must do now is avoid stoking the inflation and making the problem even worse,” he said. “One of the ways you can make the problem very significantly worse is by coming forward with large-scale, tens of billions of pounds’ worth, of unfunded tax cuts.”</p> <p>He added: “The big decision, fiscally, here is around tax. You have to do it in a measured way and at the right time but not start coming forward with tens of billions of unfunded tax cuts right now. I think that would be really quite dangerous.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/04/bad-luck-batgirl-the-cancellation-of-the-dc-superheros-film-is-only-her-latest-misfortune","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T15:06:56Z","webTitle":"Bad luck Batgirl: the cancellation of the DC superhero’s film is only her latest misfortune","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/04/bad-luck-batgirl-the-cancellation-of-the-dc-superheros-film-is-only-her-latest-misfortune","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/04/bad-luck-batgirl-the-cancellation-of-the-dc-superheros-film-is-only-her-latest-misfortune","fields":{"headline":"Bad luck Batgirl: the cancellation of the DC superhero’s film is only her latest misfortune","trailText":"The Gotham vigilante was patronised in The Lego Batman Movie, paralysed in The Killing Joke and underwritten in Batman and Robin.

Not content with adapting a comic known for its infamous depiction of The Joker shooting and paralysing Gordon, the movie added a misogynistic 30-minute opening in which Batgirl is schooled by Batman for her superhero failings, has impulsive sex with him, and basically ticks off every trope you can think of to suggest women should leave crimefighting to the men.</p> <p>Warner may also want to bear in mind the history of women in comic-book movies, because the optics of this decision are terrible. Until fairly recently, studios ran scared of ever putting a woman’s name to a superhero film, largely thanks to the famously terrible box office and critical return for 2004’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,1276885,00.html\">Catwoman</a>, starring Halle Berry. Never mind that it had nothing whatsoever to do with the slinky comic book catburglar invented by Bill Finger and Bob Kane (Berry plays Patience Phillips rather than Selina Kyle), and was made by someone, French director Pitof, with no previous Hollywood experience. There wasn’t another big screen DC movie with a female superhero as the title character until Wonder Woman in 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"933774c5395d89fbe21f682defd8773aa225e01a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/933774c5395d89fbe21f682defd8773aa225e01a/0_0_2334_3500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Leslie Grace, centre, and Ivory Aquino, right, on the Glasgow set of Batgirl in January 2022.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New ground … Leslie Grace, centre, and Ivory Aquino, right, on the Glasgow set of Batgirl in January 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ewan Bootman/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What’s most upsetting is that Batgirl was experiencing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/13/batgirl-dc-comics-series-reboot\">a headline-making renaissance in the comics</a> as recently as the early 2010s, when Gail Simone’s nuanced and refreshingly modern run introduced a version of the character who has survivor’s guilt and PTSD after her recovery from the injuries inflicted on her by the Joker following experimental surgery in South Africa. Some fans were concerned that Gordon’s return to the persona of Batgirl – she had been known as Oracle during her time in a wheelchair, and took on more of background role as an information broker for the superhero community – effectively removed one of the rare DC disabled characters. Nevertheless, the run was incredibly popular and broke new ground. It even featured one of the first major transgender characters in mainstream comic books: Barbara’s friend Alysia Yeoh, who was due to be portrayed by Ivory Aquino on the big screen.</p> <p>We’ll probably never know whether the abandoned film was canned due to being terrible – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/03/irredeemable-batgirl-movie-unexpectedly-cancelled-despite-being-in-final-stages\">as studio suits have clearly been briefing to the Hollywood Reporter</a> – or simply became the unfortunate victim of a new regime at Warner Bros. But its disappearance from the DC slate will only serve to increase clamour for the studio to finally get Batgirl right.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bleedingcool.com/comics/dc-comics-creators-discuss-the-new-52-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/\">Simone revealed in 2021</a> that during her time writing the comics, the DC powers-that-be refused to allow the superhero her own secret superhero base – despite this being a staple of many DC costumed titans. Taken together with all the other travails faced by Gordon over her five decades in the spotlight, it starts to look as if there simply isn’t the confidence in Batgirl that’s required for her to truly prosper amid a crowded superhero slate. That’s gutting for long-term fans of the character. Unfortunately, only DC and Warner Bros are in a position to explain why the superhero never quite gets her moment to battle through the streets of Gotham.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/04/generally-ignored-species-face-twice-the-extinction-threat-warns-study-aoe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T15:00:17Z","webTitle":"‘Generally ignored’ species face twice the extinction threat, warns study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/04/generally-ignored-species-face-twice-the-extinction-threat-warns-study-aoe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/04/generally-ignored-species-face-twice-the-extinction-threat-warns-study-aoe","fields":{"headline":"‘Generally ignored’ species face twice the extinction threat, warns study","trailText":"Wildlife with little data faces double the risk of dying out – which may mean many more species are endangered than previously thought","byline":"Phoebe Weston","body":"<p>Plants and animals that do not have enough data to be properly assessed appear to be at twice the risk of extinction as those that have been evaluated, meaning more species may face being wiped off the planet than previously thought, a study has warned.</p> <p>Researchers looked at the extinction risk of species assessed on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/iucn-red-list\">red list</a> of endangered species and found that 56% of species in the data deficient (DD) category were threatened, compared with 28% of those that had been assessed.</p> <p>A species is considered DD if there is not enough data on their distribution or population, and these species are “generally ignored” in studies analysing biodiversity impacts, researchers wrote in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03638-9\">the paper, published in Communications Biology</a>. The red list, which is created by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is used by governments to work out which species should be prioritised for conservation action.</p> <p>The IUCN assesses more than 140,000 species based on criteria such as population size, trends and threats.

Researchers said that 85% of DD amphibians were at risk, as well as more than half of mammals, reptiles and insects.</p> <p>Species might be DD because there are very few of them, sightings are rare or they could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/25/discovery-of-cryptic-species-shows-earth-is-even-more-biologically-diverse-aoe\">cryptic species</a>, making it difficult to estimate their population. To overcome these problems, researchers created an algorithm that predicted the probabilities of species being at risk of extinction based on key factors they did know, such as the global distribution of those species, climatic conditions, land use changes, pesticide use and threats from invasive species. Researchers ran the algorithm on DD species if their geographical distribution was known, which i twas for about 38% of them.</p> <p>Some DD species with very high probabilities of being at risk included the Sierra Miahuatlan spikethumb frog, which has a 95% chance of being threatened with extinction, as does the Sholai night frog, and a Mexican fish called the Ajijic silverside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5d9878a40dc350510baff4cc21ab695368083b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d9878a40dc350510baff4cc21ab695368083b1/0_0_3872_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A female furcifer timoni, a chameleon species found in Madagascar.

So even though this study provides more information on DD species, we still know very little about most species on Earth.”</p> <h2><strong>Some of the DD species under threat</strong></h2> <p>• One example where the algorithm could be used is with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/08/rices-whales-new-species-discovered-southern-us-coast\">newly recognised </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/08/rices-whales-new-species-discovered-southern-us-coast\">Rice’s whale</a></strong>, which scientists thought could be a species for almost a decade, although it took years to get official recognition. Now there are only about 50 of them left, in the area affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, where there is a large amount of boat traffic and oil and gas extraction. There is no local outcry because no one knows it exists, says marine researcher Dr Chris Parsons from the University of Exeter, who believes the DD category should be given an “assume threatened” status. He said: “If immediate precautionary measures were put in years ago when they first suspected a new species, it could have forced research to be immediately conducted and set in motion emergency measures that might have stopped it from becoming critically endangered.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0db8a566abd55d72031fa443412c875774ef33e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0db8a566abd55d72031fa443412c875774ef33e4/107_0_1369_650/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A beaked whale in waters off Mexico’s western coast.

Earlier, in a televised speech, Taiwan’s leader, Tsai Ing-wen, urged Beijing to exercise restraint and warned residents to be extra vigilant about information coming from the mainland.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\"> \n <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Foreign governments and multilateral groups including the G7 and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) condemned the hostilities and called for calm.</p> \n<p>Taipei earlier accused Beijing of imitating North Korea, a global pariah.</p> \n<p>The exercises, which are due to run until Sunday, began at midday local time on Thursday, with the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV announcing the beginning of an “important military training exercise”.</p> \n<p>The People’s Liberation Army’s eastern theatre command said it had conducted “long-range live-fire shooting training” in the Taiwan strait, including “precision strikes on specific areas in the eastern part”.

There is no chance of a quick fix given the number of issues that need addressing.</p> \n<p>Whenever a manager arrives expectations naturally rise but it will be important for United fans to limit theirs for this season. Last season showed how far behind Manchester City and Liverpool they are and trying to get to their level will take time. United have to embrace the journey they need to go on.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/03/cristiano-ronaldo-behaviour-unacceptable-leaving-game-early-erik-ten-hag-manchester-united\">Ronaldo behaviour ‘unacceptable’ in leaving game early, says Erik ten Hag</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Many are used to the United of old, the team that dominated the Premier League and challenged for the Champions League with a swagger. That team are long gone and a new one has to be built if they are to dream of those successes once more. They do, however, need some short-term ambitions to help them achieve the long-term ones.</p> \n<p>Ten Hag will have been keen to implement his style during pre-season. He has arrived at a good time in a summer without a men’s tournament, meaning no one was playing until the second week of July and then having to take a break. Ten Hag will have banked on someone such as Raphaël Varane having a good, strong pre-season to reach the level required and settle into the system after the defender was in and out of the team and had some injuries in the last campaign.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6a9178a3-09da-4eb7-b01a-ce6c411dc3dd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hh_CtvYZUug?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He will have been identified as integral in a youthful side thanks to his experience. There will be higher hopes, too, for Jadon Sancho, who struggled after the Euros. </p> \n<p>This summer’s episode with Cristiano Ronaldo can’t have helped Ten Hag because it will have sent a message throughout the club. It shone a spotlight on the club’s failure to get signings done early because they were struggling to attract the players required.</p> \n<p>A notable focus for new arrivals has been players Ten Hag knows well from the Netherlands or has worked with at Ajax. It is a really smart thing to do. They understand his philosophy and he can also influence the culture in the dressing room through them setting the standard. He is not the first manager to bring in players who know how to execute the gameplan, and it can help speed up the long-term process. Building a culture within the club from Ten Hag down through the squad will be imperative if he is to be successful. That will require the players to understand his demands and execute them perfectly season after season.</p> \n<p>Those who are new to Ten Hag will be learning about him and what he demands. As a player you want the manager to be the focal point on the training ground. It is not necessarily a fear factor you need but as a player you want to be a little fearful of your manager. At the same time, you want them to be empathetic and understanding of circumstance, and to be clear and decisive when making decisions and setting out a plan – with no hesitation. The most successful teams have a dominant character at the top. They have to set the culture and start to bring players along with them to make sure everyone is part of it and going in the same direction. They have also got to be inspirational inside the dressing room, or it will not work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"478ddbac46da063cb5aadc8a7f97716f11a22918\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/478ddbac46da063cb5aadc8a7f97716f11a22918/569_775_4547_2728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raphaël Varane tackles Liverpool’s Luis Díaz during United’s 4-0 win in Bangkok\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raphaël Varane tackles Liverpool’s Luis Díaz during United’s 4-0 win in Bangkok.

Players have to buy into the manager and he has to be clear and have that authority and empathy so players jump on board. You can see this at other clubs. Look at James Milner at Liverpool. I know United fans will not appreciate the example but these sort of players are key because they keep the positive culture going and make sure everyone is doing the right things by setting an example. United need that buy-in if Ten Hag is to implement effective changes because otherwise they will be in the same vicious cycle they have been in for a number of years.</p> \n<p>Winning a cup would be a successful season, and it does not matter which one because success breeds success. They cannot just focus on the Premier League and ignore the Europa League. It is a chance to win a competition and secure a Champions League place, and if they do want to reach the top once more they need to get used to playing twice a week. It should also give more players a chance to impress in difficult circumstances.</p> \n<p>United supporters might want instant success but sadly for them the club is a long way from where it was. Sometimes the best things do not come easily and take a little time to grow but that is not a bad thing as long as you can witness the green shoots of promise. That is what Ten Hag will be hoping to see this season.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2022/aug/04/teachers-fear-missing-signs-far-right-radicalisation-pupils-england","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T14:00:10Z","webTitle":"Teachers in England ‘fear they are missing signs of far-right radicalisation’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/04/teachers-fear-missing-signs-far-right-radicalisation-pupils-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2022/aug/04/teachers-fear-missing-signs-far-right-radicalisation-pupils-england","fields":{"headline":"Teachers in England ‘fear they are missing signs of far-right radicalisation’","trailText":"Headteachers say pandemic has worsened extremism among pupils as staff call for more training","byline":"Sally Weale Education correspondent","body":"<p>Teachers in England who feel overstretched by pandemic catchup and curriculum demands fear they are missing signs of far-right radicalisation in classrooms, and lack the training to effectively challenge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jul/24/children-could-be-radicalised-over-summer-break-met-police-warn-parents\">extremist views among pupils</a>.</p> <p>Swastikas doodled on a chemistry book, white-power slogans daubed on exam papers, pupils quoting from videos by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson and hate speech against refugees are a few of the more obvious signs of the influence of the far right on schoolchildren, as reported by teachers and other staff.</p> <p>They are also starting to hear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/aug/13/plymouth-shootings-may-be-a-sign-the-incel-culture-is-spreading\">language associated with “incels”</a> – a subculture of men who describe themselves as involuntarily celibate, with links to the “alt right” in the US – whose misogynistic views are considered to be extremist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/signs-of-hate-parental-guide-to-far-right-codes-symbols-acronyms-uk\">Signs of hate: Parental guide to far-right codes, symbols and acronyms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Owen Jones, the director of education and training at the anti-racism charity Hope Not Hate, said many teachers felt ill-equipped to deal with the issue of rightwing radicalisation in classrooms. “The language [of the far right] and what they talk about has moved on so much. Pupils can use it in front of a teacher and they would not have a clue what they what they are talking about,” he said.</p> <p>Research by University College London’s Institute of Education found racism, misogyny and homophobia are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/sep/07/extreme-views-and-conspiracism-rising-among-englands-pupils-research-finds\">widespread in schools in England</a>. Although some pupils are actively seeking out far-right material online, others are either unwittingly stumbling across it while doing research for homework or are groomed through online gaming platforms.</p> <p>“Young men, it’s always young men,” said one headteacher in Greater Manchester when asked about signs of far-right influence in schools where he has worked. He has made one referral under the government’s Prevent anti-radicalisation programme – a 15-year-old whose behaviour immediately rang alarm bells.</p> <p>“The child had provided us with a level of detail which made it very likely they had attended a far-right march and they were very determined to pursue that way of thinking. He was viewing far-right material on YouTube,” the headteacher said.</p> <p>“It came out in an RE [religious education] lesson. The young man concerned ticked all the boxes in terms of vulnerabilities. He was not a particularly high achiever, he did not come from a very stable background and he carried with him some of the attitudes that are aligned with being at risk of radicalisation by the far right. He had unsavoury attitudes about women and he found it hard to have that challenged.”</p> <p>Another headteacher, working in a remote coastal school serving a mainly white, disadvantaged community, said: “The kind of thing we are coming across is a really strong sense of us and them. The idea that if you are not white, your voice and presence are not as welcome.</p> <p>“There’s a lot of low-level ‘banter’, some of it is quite insidious, a lot of it’s coming from home. There’s also a real undercurrent of misogyny here – some of the language we are hearing is quite worrying, from the incel movement, which is linked to the far right.”</p> <p>One pupil was heard using the word “Chad”, referring to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-44053828\">sexually active alpha males</a> who are resented by incels. “If you’ve got awareness of that kind of group at secondary school level, they are accessing content that’s worrying,” the headteacher said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/03/study-guides-trolling-raids-how-uk-far-right-groups-target-children-online\">From ‘study guides’ to trolling raids: how UK far-right groups target children online</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pandemic, lockdown and remote learning has made children more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/19/extremists-using-online-gaming-and-covid-conspiracies-to-recruit-youngsters\">vulnerable to far-right grooming</a>, mainly online, though sometimes through relatives. “Where you’ve got children who’ve been online for 18 months, their homes are an echo chamber,” the headteacher said.</p> <p>“We are fighting against some really quite entrenched attitudes and values that don’t belong in a 21st-century school. A lot of our kids, they’ve had no challenge. They’ve just been exploring stuff at home.”</p> <p>In the headteacher’s previous two schools, a small number of children aged 15 to 16 were referred to the government’s Channel programme for specialist support because they were deemed to be at risk of radicalisation. In one case, a child had an obsession with Nazi Germany and was doodling swastikas.</p> <p>Teachers face a difficult task trying to decide whether pupils are at risk of radicalisation and require external intervention, or can be dealt with in school through informed, critical discussion.</p> <p>In another case, a student was drawing symbols linked to Combat 18, a neo-Nazi group <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51219274\">founded in the early 1990s</a> as a militant wing of the British National party (BNP). “They knew what it meant,” the headteacher said. “One of the family members was part of the far-right movement. </p> <p>In an earlier case, the school raised the alarm after a student accessed material about Islamic State in Syria. “That was taken really, really seriously, a lot more seriously than the far right was,” the headteacher said, adding: “By the time you’ve made a referral, it’s too late. There needs to be a lot more education in teacher training around spotting very specific signs – attitudes that might belie something.”</p> <p>A modern foreign languages teacher working in a predominantly white school in north-east England echoed those concerns. “I worry about these young boys. They are vulnerable. They are easily influenced. It’s the vulnerable ones you need to help, they are being dragged into these things and teachers need to know how to help,” the teacher said.</p> <p>“The far-right language changes all the time. I know there are terms we need to learn and I know some teachers don’t always feel confident. I think we need more help with it, particularly on things like the language and how to be empowered in challenging that, to ensure our students are really savvy, particularly on the internet.”</p> <p>Organisations such as Hope Not Hate are working to fill the gap, sending expert educators into schools to run workshops for pupils and training sessions for teachers about the threat of far-right extremism among young people. </p> <p>Other school workers, including catering staff and caretakers, also undergo training. Jemma Levene, the deputy director of Hope Not Hate, said: “Often they hear things and see things which teachers don’t. Students will have an informal chat with them in a way they wouldn’t with a teacher.”</p> <p>Levene said the organisation had never been busier. “For the first time in May, we taught 5,000 students in a month. We definitely saw a lot of online radicalisation during lockdown, just because that was the only thing that students had – technology – and they had access to it 24/7, without other distractions.</p> <p>“As soon as you have a smartphone, you have a window on a world. As soon as you start to explore, you have access, and obviously the way the algorithms are set up, once you access one piece of content, it’s suggesting more of the same, or more extreme.”</p> <p>Hope Not Hate has also set up a “deradicalisation unit” to support vulnerable individuals before they drift further towards far-right extremism and violence. It has hired a dedicated case worker, supported by a consultant psychologist, who will make onward referrals where necessary.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/18/children-coming-across-far-right-material-when-researching-teachers-say\">issue of far-right extremism</a> was raised by the NASUWT in April at the teaching union’s annual conference, which heard that children are accidentally coming across far-right material online while carrying out research for school projects.

It’s a bit of a jumble and sometimes makes selecting a single work rather unwieldy; the final disc consists entirely of early pieces, including the Simple Symphony, a Quartet in F, composed when Britten was 14, and the 1932 Phantasy for string quintet, with which he won the Cobbett chamber music prize at the Royal College of Music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8803594598b5baa6bbeb6851e64afb0582911c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8803594598b5baa6bbeb6851e64afb0582911c8/0_0_3284_2541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benjamin Britten at the Royal Festival Hall in London in October 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"774\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benjamin Britten at the Royal Festival Hall, London, in October 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erich Auerbach/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Emperor are at their most convincing in these early works, when their bright sound and matter-of-fact approach are well suited to music that sometimes comes close to the neoclassicism of Stravinsky and Prokofiev. In the later numbered works they seem to leave quite a lot unexplored. There’s too often a brittleness and lack of warmth about the playing that is rather offputting, and in particular makes the Third Quartet, already a rather chilly experience, even bleaker.

The recorded competition in all of these works is even more fierce that it is for the quartets, of course, not least from Britten’s own recordings with Peter Pears, for whom two of the cycles, the Serenade and Nocturne, were composed. Staples is hugely impressive in both of those works, reinforced in the Serenade by superb solo horn playing by Christopher Parkes, but he seems to me to be at his very best in Les Illuminations, where he brings just the right amount of steeliness to its powerful declamations.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2022/aug/04/greta-gerwig-films-ranked","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T13:53:16Z","webTitle":"Greta Gerwig films – ranked!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/04/greta-gerwig-films-ranked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/aug/04/greta-gerwig-films-ranked","fields":{"headline":"Greta Gerwig films – ranked!","trailText":"Ahead of her starring role in White Noise, which opens the Venice film festival later this month – as well as her eagerly awaited Barbie movie – we rate Gerwig’s finest work","byline":"Ryan Gilbey","body":"<h2>20 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/24/no-strings-attached-review\">No Strings Attached</a> (2011)</h2> <p>Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher may be the stars of this friends-with-benefits romcom, written by New Girl creator Elizabeth Meriwether and originally titled Fuck Buddies.

Playing a teacher who is sleeping with the dean’s daughter and being romantically pursued by a transgender man, Gerwig arrives in Pacino’s life with a collection of sex toys and promptly disavows her former lesbianism.

Highlights include Gerwig expertly friend-zoning a hapless suitor. “That’s what’s so great about you,” she tells him. “You’re, like, my best friend but also like my brother!” Harsh.</p> <h2>14 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/18/the-house-of-the-devil-review\">The House of the Devil</a> (2009)</h2> <p>Gerwig may not last long in this indie horror, but she helps establish its retro, off-kilter flavour. In a Farrah Fawcett-style blond feathery disco-flick, she signals trouble ahead by overreacting to dinner (“This pizza’s nasty today!”), then warns her best friend not to accept a babysitting job from a creepy stranger (Tom Noonan of Manhunter fame) and casually delivers some atmospheric scene-setting: “I’m so sick of hearing about that stupid eclipse!”</p> <h2>13 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/12/wiener-dog-review-todd-solondz-daschund-danny-devito\">Wiener-Dog</a> (2016)</h2> <p>The changing ownership of one dachshund links four tales of hard knocks and thwarted dreams from indie provocateur Todd Solondz. Gerwig plays Dawn Wiener, the beleaguered teenage protagonist of Solondz’s 1995 breakthrough Welcome to the Dollhouse. But wait – didn’t he kill her off in his 2004 film Palindromes? “I thought it would be nice to give her an alternative existence,” the director <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2016/08/easy-hope-todd-solondzs-playful-misery\">explained</a>.

Gerwig is Violet, one of a trio of East coast bright sparks dedicated to improving the lives of their fellow students. In her spare time, she also plans to launch a global dance craze. This is a woman so relentlessly upbeat that she responds buoyantly even to criticism: “Thank you for this chastisement,” she trills after having her flaws itemised.</p> <h2>11 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/19/jackie-review-natalie-portman-kennedy-assassination\">Jackie</a> (2016)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96b44b333f1a49cee3684d7ff1311010b4978fa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96b44b333f1a49cee3684d7ff1311010b4978fa0/0_145_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Nancy Tuckerman in Jackie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Nancy Tuckerman in Jackie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Branchu/Fox Searchlight Pictures/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the most piercing films ever made about grief, Pablo Larraín’s claustrophobic portrait of Jackie Kennedy in the immediate aftermath of her husband’s assassination would grab a higher place on any ranking of Gerwig’s movies if she had more to do in it. She is soothingly attentive, though, as Jackie’s friend and confidante Nancy Tuckerman. Listing for her the dignitaries who have confirmed their attendance at the funeral, Gerwig’s delivery lends a matter-of-fact roll-call the consoling softness of a lullaby.</p> <h2>10 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/mar/11/southbysouthwest.festivals1\">Nights and Weekends</a> (2008)</h2> <p>Gerwig and Joe Swanberg co-directed and co-wrote what appears at first to be a shapeless rag-bag of vignettes. They also play the central couple, whose relationship is disintegrating due to emotional and geographical distance. Opening with a candid sex scene and populated by characters who are sometimes light on charm, it is one of the key works of mumblecore – that small but influential pocket of no-budget, DIY indie film-making pioneered by Swanberg, Andrew Bujalski, Aaron Katz, the Duplass brothers and Lynn Shelton (the late Humpday director who has a small role here), and mostly devoted to meandering tales of troubled or unrequited love.</p> <h2>9 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/mistress-america-review-anxieties-of-youth-and-middle-age-on-a-wave-of-zane\">Mistress America</a> (2015)</h2> <p>For her second co-writing credit with Noah Baumbach, Gerwig helped create one of her spikiest roles: Brooke, a wannabe restaurateur and socialite, somehow both laser-focused and flailing, more If-girl than It-girl. At the grand old age of 30, she is dispensing life lessons to her protege and stepsister-to-be (Lola Kirke). This was a new direction for Gerwig, with intriguing flashes of flintiness beneath the sparkling exterior. These surface during a startling scene in which Brooke is accused of youthful bullying by a former classmate. The subject is never resolved conclusively but the cold glint in Gerwig’s eye hints at an icy core.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z8MCW16uZY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6z8MCW16uZY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>8 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/07/20th-century-women-review-mike-mills-annette-bening\">20th Century Women</a> (2016)</h2> <p>Mike Mills’s comedy about growing up in late-1970s California with a flamboyant, unorthodox mother (Annette Bening) has a blank space at its centre in the shape of 15-year-old newcomer Lucas Jade Zumann, who doesn’t make much impression as the teenager surrounded by complex women. These include Gerwig as Abbie, the photographer to whom his mother, Dorothea, partly entrusts his emotional education. Mills’s script articulates beautifully the parental pain of waving children off into adulthood. “You get to see him out in the world as a person,” Dorothea tells Abbie, before adding sadly: “I never will.”</p> <h2>7 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/07/maggies-plan-film-review-metropolitan-comedy-greta-gerwig-julianne-moore-ethan-hawke-rebecca-miller\">Maggie’s Plan</a> (2015)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff7ea00318df7fc598093c2b026f47a56ea4a849\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff7ea00318df7fc598093c2b026f47a56ea4a849/0_0_3504_2355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Ethan Hawke in Maggie’s Plan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Ethan Hawke in Maggie’s Plan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Pack/Sony Pictures Classics/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stealing a teacher and would-be novelist (Ethan Hawke) away from his wife (Julianne Moore), Maggie (Gerwig) then has second thoughts when her life with him goes askew – which leads her to play matchmaker to the estranged couple. The scene in which she pitches this loopy romantic solution to a fierce, incredulous Moore is fantastic, and there are some choice run-ins with Bill Hader as Maggie’s closest confidante, who balks at her scheme and accuses her of “playing Titania and sprinkling stardust in their eyes”. There is real pain in Rebecca Miller’s film, not all of it neutralised by laughter.</p> <h2>6 LOL (2006)</h2> <p>Less shambolic than most mumblecore endeavours, the first of Gerwig’s collaborations with Swanberg examines the corrosive effects of technology on the romantic lives of a group of twentysomethings. It boasts intricate dialogue and an inventive use of split-screen; Gerwig is at first amusing and eventually agonising as a woman trying to placate her boyfriend with nude selfies, after rebuffing his demands for phone sex. A genuine <em>cri de</em> mumble-<em>coeur</em>.</p> <h2>5 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/25/little-women-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-emma-watson\">Little Women</a> (2019)</h2> <p>For her second solo directing gig, Gerwig adapts Louisa May Allcott’s evergreen 1868 novel, reshaping its chronology in a way that teases out telling ironies. The movie zigzags between different stages in the Massachusetts adolescence of fledgling novelist Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her three sisters. Oscar-nominated Florence Pugh expresses infinite varieties of frustration and heartbreak as Amy, Jo’s rival among her siblings. In her second performance for Gerwig, Ronan doesn’t shrink from the dislikable: she makes the sight of Amy losing composure in the face of criticism a cringing high-point.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AST2-4db4ic\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AST2-4db4ic?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>4 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/09/hannah-takes-the-stairs-review\">Hannah Takes the Stairs</a> (2007)</h2> <p>The Avengers Assemble of mumblecore movies. Swanberg directs Gerwig as Hannah, the comedy writer bouncing between three men, two of them played by other mumblecore auteurs (Andrew Bujalski and Mark Duplass) and the third by Kent Osbourne (real-life writer for animated series such as Adventure Time). Funny and fraught with pass-agg tensions, the film – on which Gerwig and her co-stars get co-writing credits – contains an unflinching break-up scene: “I don’t think you can touch me any more,” Hannah tells her boyfriend, squirming against the wall to escape his goofball antics. Whether furiously rage-dancing, tearfully admitting “I tend to leave destruction in my wake”, or playing the trumpet naked in the bath, Gerwig’s range here is impressive.</p> <h2>3 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/15/lady-bird-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-laurie-metcalf\">Lady Bird</a> (2017)</h2> <p>The loosey-goosey naturalism that Gerwig had displayed in front of the camera for more than a decade was richly felt behind it, too, in this self-penned, solo-directing debut for which she was double Oscar-nominated. Christine (Saoirse Ronan), AKA Lady Bird, is a low-level rebel on the brink of graduating from a Catholic high school in Sacramento. Orbiting around her are a sweetly dopey best chum (Beanie Feldstein), two potential boyfriends (Timothée Chalamet, Lucas Hedges) and a perpetually disapproving mother (Laurie Metcalf), who believes that if you can’t say anything nice, it’s better to be brutally frank instead. Gerwig keeps the vignettes popping; they’re the colourful dots that form a pointillist portrait of Lady Bird’s life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBn5dgXFMis\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YBn5dgXFMis?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>2 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/25/frances-ha-baumbach-gerwig-review\">Frances Ha</a> (2013)</h2> <p>An actor couldn’t hope for a better showcase than this ecstatic comic character study. Frances (Gerwig) is a budding dancer making her way in New York City as her money runs out, her dreams wilt and her best friend moves to a swankier neighbourhood. Gerwig co-wrote this, her second movie with Noah Baumbach. (They were a couple by this point, the film-maker having left Jennifer Jason Leigh, with whom he co-wrote Greenberg.) Together, Gerwig and Baumbach exploit her character’s ungainly gait, propensity for slapstick, and innate giddiness. Frances is prone to flights of euphoria, such as the celebratory sprint through Manhattan where her speeding steps give way to leaps and pirouettes while David Bowie’s Modern Love clatters magically on the soundtrack – a near-exact restaging of Denis Lavant’s running dance from Leos Carax’s 1986 Mauvais Sang.</p> <h2>1 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/10/greenberg-review\">Greenberg</a> (2010)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07d2b4907a0ca308f4965e6e5c2bb06b2fc0c97e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d2b4907a0ca308f4965e6e5c2bb06b2fc0c97e/0_0_1417_943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Florence Marr in Greenberg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Florence Marr in Greenberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No movie has ever needed Gerwig so much, or used her presence as adroitly, as Noah Baumbach’s itchy, melancholy romcom. For the first 10 minutes, it appears to be her gig alone. As Florence, a chaotic twentysomething au pair, she dashes around Los Angeles on errands, walks the dog, goes to a party and has a joyless one-night stand, all while exuding an air of distracted, good-humoured disappointment. Then Ben Stiller shows up as Roger Greenberg, her boss’s neurotic brother, and snatches the narrative away. Cleverly, this makes the audience pine for her – who wants to be stuck with a whingeing fussbudget after chilling with the sad-but-sunny Florence? When (or if) we grow to like Roger, it’s largely as a byproduct of the attention he receives from her: if <em>she</em> notices something in him, then maybe he’s not as intolerable as he seems.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdliqOGTLw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cwdliqOGTLw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Greenberg dragged mumblecore into the mainstream (Mark Duplass also has a small role) and ignited a professional relationship between Baumbach and Gerwig that soon morphed into the personal. They have now collaborated on six occasions, including adaptations of Don DeLillo’s White Noise, which opens this year’s Venice film festival, and an unreleased HBO pilot from 2012 based on Jonathan Franzen’s The Corrections, as well as next year’s Barbie, which Gerwig has directed from a script they wrote together. It is Greenberg, though, that remains among the strongest, strangest films of the century – and the one that made Gerwig a star.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/04/us-border-patrol-accused-taking-turbans-sikh-asylum-seekers","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T13:52:30Z","webTitle":"US border patrol accused of taking turbans from Sikh asylum-seekers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/04/us-border-patrol-accused-taking-turbans-sikh-asylum-seekers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/04/us-border-patrol-accused-taking-turbans-sikh-asylum-seekers","fields":{"headline":"US border patrol accused of taking turbans from Sikh asylum-seekers","trailText":"ACLU says there are nearly 50 cases of Sikhs saying religious headwear was taken as they passed through CBP checks in Arizona","byline":"Lauren Aratani","body":"<p>Agents from US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) have been accused of seizing turbans from Sikh asylum seekers at the southern border.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22125092-aclu-of-arizona-letter-on-border-patrol-confiscating-sikhs-turbans\">letter</a> to CBP, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Arizona said there had been nearly 50 documented cases of Sikhs saying religious headwear was taken and never returned as they passed through CBP checks in Yuma, Arizona.</p> <p>The cases were reported by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), a humanitarian nonprofit that helps asylum seekers released by CBP. The nonprofit has reported a sharp increase in turban confiscations since June.</p> <p>“While [IRC] has encountered cases of religious headwear being confiscated every month of this year,” the ACLU said, “in June 2022 the number of reports rose sharply, prompting concern that border officials have ramped up their efforts to seize these sacred items.”</p> <p>The ACLU is asking CBP to investigate the confiscations as civil rights violations, citing policy that says officers should “remain cognizant of an individual’s religious belief while accomplishing an enforcement action in a dignified and respectful manner”.</p> <p>The ACLU wrote: “For many Sikhs, the turban is a central aspect of their religious identity; exposing their ‘naked’ heads to others is considered sacrilegious and shameful.</p> <p>“By confiscating and failing to return Sikh individuals’ turbans, CBP directly interferes with their religious practice and forces them to violate their religious beliefs.”</p> <p>Gurjodh Singh, an asylum seeker from India, told <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/sikh-turban-border-patrol/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=theintercept&amp;utm_medium=social\">the Intercept</a> and Arizona Luminaria that while he tried to insist to CBP agents his religion forbade taking off his turban, they forced him to remove it and put it in a trash pile.</p> <p>He said: “They told me to take off my turban. I know a little English and I said, ‘It’s my religion.’ But they insisted. I felt so bad.”</p> <p>IRC volunteers have contacted local Sikh communities to find replacements for seized turbans.

The invasion of Ukraine in late February then prompted a further jump in prices, as western allies sought to economically isolate Russia, a major gas and oil supplier.</p> <p>The knock-on effects of the energy price rises have been felt across the world, and in the UK it exposed a price cap system that was “not fit for purpose for the kind of market we have today”, said Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of Ofgem.</p> <p>The regulator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/03/uk-households-face-record-54-energy-bill-rise-as-price-cap-is-lifted\">raised the cap on the average dual-fuel tariff</a> by 54% to £1,971 from April, the biggest increase since the cap was introduced in 2019.</p> <p>Consumers have been warned they face another big hiketo just under £3,500 when the next cap – which comes into effect in October – is announced later this month.</p> <p>Analysts at Cornwall Insight have predicted the price cap is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/02/energy-bills-great-britain-winter-discount\">on track to rise to £3,615</a> a year from January, piling further pressure on households as the cost of living crisis intensifies.</p> <p>In an indication of the difficulties facing the gas supply market, the average price of gas bought on the day by UK distributors jumped to 9.8p per kilowatt hour over the week, the highest level since the middle of March, when markets went haywire after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Office for National Statistics, which compiled the data, said it had seen “significant increases”.</p> <p>Increasing the cap every three months instead of every half year will mean that prices will rise more quickly for consumers to reflect higher wholesale prices – as well as falling more quickly when they dip.</p> <p>Ofgem has faced some criticism of the timing of the move, which will mean consumers paying more this autumn if, as expected, wholesale energy prices remain high.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the campaign group End Fuel Poverty Coalition said: “Households will face a two-stage cost of living crisis this winter, thanks to Ofgem’s confirmation that energy bills will go up in October and again in January.</p> <p>“Ultimately, this decision will force more people into fuel poverty in the middle of winter, causing additional stress on the NHS and it may ultimately lead to increased levels of excess winter deaths this year. It is simply inhumane.”</p> <p>Brearley defended the move towards the more frequent updates on the energy price cap, and said it would prevent the failure of more suppliers, the cost of which is indirectly passed to consumers. The National Audit Office has said the failures of 28 energy firms during the crisis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jun/22/failing-energy-suppliers-cost-uk-consumers-2-billion-pounds-watchdog\">will cost consumers £2.7bn</a>.</p> <p>“The price cap may well go up if costs go up, and I’d caution against too many predictions of change,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Those predictions far out are hard to make. But equally when prices come down the price cap will come down equally quickly.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brearley added: “I know the changes we are seeing do not feel fair to anybody, but these are ultimately driven by the changes we are seeing globally in the gas price, and that’s not a British problem.

I’ve always been quite a good boy – I’m not the kind to glue myself to the M25. But I’ve come to realise that it is only by collective action that we can persuade the government and the energy companies to make some very drastic changes. That’s why I’ve joined the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jun/24/campaign-calls-1m-uk-consumers-stop-paying-energy-bills\">Don’t Pay campaign</a>. On 1 October, when the next price cap comes into effect, I will be phoning EDF and telling them that, out of solidarity with millions of others, I will not be paying any more until they reduce their prices.</p> <p>Before the price cap rise on 1 April, I was already concerned that I might not be able to afford any dramatic price increases. I’m a chronically ill, and therefore disabled, pensioner. I was managing to pay £106 a month for dual fuel. Then it increased to about £170 – this is pretty high for me, but I can just about afford it. Now we’re hearing that there’s likely to be an increase of 60% to 70% in the price cap this winter. Well, I’m afraid I won’t be able to pay that. I will find it unaffordable. And there will be millions of others like me.</p> <p>Keep in mind that I live on my own. During the winter, I don’t have any heating downstairs at all; I only use a radiator in my bedroom (because of my health condition I need to spend a lot of time lying down) and a heated towel rail in the bathroom. But I will still be in fuel poverty: I’ve calculated that I will be paying more than 10% of the money I have coming in on energy costs. I read that, from October, <a href=\"https://www.nea.org.uk/news/charities-warn-3000-energy-bill-could-leave-8-5-million-uk-households-in-fuel-poverty/\">one in three households</a> are likely to be in fuel poverty. That’s what’s behind the Don’t Pay campaign – it’s just a community of ordinary people who have been pushed into an intolerable situation.</p> <p>There may be critics who say refusing to pay bills is irresponsible or too risky. I would reply that it’s a risk the energy companies and the government are pushing us into. What’s more, the companies are making vast profits at the expense of ordinary people. Shell has made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/shell-posts-10bn-quarterly-profits-as-households-struggle-with-bills\">£9.5bn</a>, which is an increase of 26% on its previous profits. Don’t Pay hopes that it doesn’t get to the point where energy companies are penalising anyone for acting: it clearly should never get to that stage, because we should have a responsible government that will step in and avert this catastrophe before October.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jun/24/campaign-calls-1m-uk-consumers-stop-paying-energy-bills\">Campaign calls for 1m UK consumers to stop paying energy bills </a> </p> </aside>  <p>I’ve convinced about half a dozen people whom I communicate with on social media to make the pledge, too. Don’t Pay is aiming to get 1 million people to pledge to strike. It’s a big number but it matches the scale of this crisis. I understand that 70,000 have already signed up and, as people talk to one another, non-payment will become more and more socially acceptable. Someone on Facebook the other day asked: “Well why don’t you do it now?” But we need to have the impact of a collective action happening at the same time.</p> <p>I’m not party-political at all – I don’t have an axe to grind for the left or the right. The government does seem to be failing the poorest people, though. There have been several years where wages, particularly in the public sector, have been suppressed; hence all the talk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/21/hot-strike-summer-britain-unions-spiralling-inflation\">of strikes</a>. By suppressing these wages, the government has been pushing people towards poverty. Decisions it has made over the past several years – including the failure to sufficiently insulate the huge number of homes leaking heat energy – have made this worse, particularly for poorer people. As for the opposition: I don’t know what Labour’s policies are on the energy price rises.</p> <p>To have an adequately heated home is a human right. There are a huge amount of <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/Excess-winter-deaths-UK/\">excess winter deaths</a> every year – I fear there will be many, many tragedies linked to the cold weather among elderly and disabled people this winter, as people dare not turn on their heating.

This is abstract art – and it shouldn’t be condemned because of one interpretation out of many","byline":"Jonathan Jones","body":"<p>If this is a penis, it’s a tragicomic one. Antony Gormley’s six metre tall cubistic sculpture Alert, which the artist describes as a kneeling figure, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/03/antony-gormley-phallic-statue-imperial-college\">accused by students at Imperial College London</a> of seeming to have a startling three-metre erection. But imagine being that man, with tiny legs and a colossally inconvenient horizontal arousal. Phallocratic? It would be more like a phallic farce, a depiction of masculinity collapsing under the weight of its own penis, disabled by its obsession with its own member.</p> <p>Or not. Alert is an arrangement of rectangular blocks to roughly form a human figure: an abstract work. Gormley says he’s playing with architecture and anatomy. He certainly has not said it is meant to be phallic. He would be a better artist if he did put it out there. Tracey Emin’s colossal naked statue The Mother has been unveiled in Oslo this summer and there are no secrets for suspicious minds to detect: everything is on view, the stuff of our human fragility celebrated next to the Munch Museum. Emin seems explicit and brave, while Gormley has made his reputation with a kind of bland humanism that doesn’t frighten the middle class – or didn’t. His famous casts of his own body have barely noticeable members.</p> <p>The new attack on Gormley for supposedly hiding a giant erection in plain sight might be the return of the repressed. He has always said he believes in the “beholder’s share”: the meaning the viewer brings to a work. The openness, or a critic might say banality, of his images leaves plenty for the beholder’s imagination to do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84064b457964325cdd17b241d7e4105da9d3fb40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84064b457964325cdd17b241d7e4105da9d3fb40/138_344_3095_1857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mocked and accused of obscenity … the works that featured in a previous Gormley furore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mocked and accused of obscenity … the works that featured in a previous Gormley furore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sculpture is still at the design stage and students who look at the plan and see a huge penis should also consider the fact that it may not be there. For this reason, and others, I feel obliged to defend Gormley. Alert has been donated to Imperial College by venture capitalist Brahmal Vasudevan and his wife, Shanthi Kandiah, to decorate its new Dangoor Plaza in South Kensington. But student Alex Auyang, in a motion on the student union website, says it could “hurt the image and reputation of the college” because of its potential “phallic interpretation”. This colossal male presence could be seen as “exclusionary”, says the motion, given Imperial’s problem with gender imbalance: just 41.8% of full-time students were female in the 2020-2021 academic year.</p> <p>Is the motion a joke? Auyang told the Times: “I think it’s fairly clear that the motion has a sense of humour behind it, but my points stand.” It’s so important to make a stand. The trouble is that this act of attempted censorship, or ironic censorship, or whatever, is ultimately just another sad chapter in Britain’s flight from modern art. It seems this ambitious artist can no longer express himself without being mocked or accused of obscenity. This row follows criticism of Gormley’s bronze street bollards as abstract willies or, when they were displayed horizontally on a beach, dog poo.</p> <p>Gormley claims the protrusion suggests the sticking out legs of a crouching figure, bending at the knee. But that’s almost beside the point. This not a realistic portrayal: it is a geometric extrapolation, a non-representational work. You know – modern art. The student complaint highlights one possible “interpretation”, then says it raises problems. But how can you find fault with just one interpretation of a work that is open to many?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"826ed0f47edc270f7a0a11ac3062a010722bcb70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/826ed0f47edc270f7a0a11ac3062a010722bcb70/958_696_5801_3480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Even if Gormley’s unconscious has released a priapic dream, so be it.

Being a gay woman didn’t save Hambling from being accused of “insulting” the Georgian feminist by putting a naked female body in public space. Now Gormley has been detected just possibly – if you happen to see it that way – putting a phallus in public space.</p> <p>I’m no big fan of Gormley’s oeuvre, but you simply can’t subject artists to this kind of suspicion and control and still expect them to do good work. Powerful public art only happens when artists are allowed to pursue their own impulses. Even if Gormley’s unconscious <em>has</em> released a priapic dream, so be it. That’s art for you.</p> <p>Accusing a statue whose meaning is ambiguous of being exclusionary is as daft as seeing Hambling’s nude as misogynist. Imperial College has a public artwork already – a statue of Queen Victoria, Empress of India, fully clad with her head covered and not a sexual innuendo in sight. Is that the kind of statue we want more of? Thought not.

Pharrell Williams, Slipknot, Ed Sheeran, John Mayer, Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and the Killers have also had to act as crowd control.</p> <p>This cautiousness is evidently the product of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/07/rapper-travis-scott-devastated-after-astroworld-festival-deaths-houston\">Astroworld festival disaster</a> last November. Run by the rapper Travis Scott, the event saw a fatal crowd crush cause the deaths of 10 fans and injure more than 300.</p> <p>Scott was criticised for allegedly disregarding fans’ pleas to stop the show, continuing to perform until the arrival of an ambulance caused him to cut the music. He has denied responsibility, saying he was unaware that anything was amiss until after his set.</p> <p>“I would guarantee that since Astroworld, management companies are saying to their artists: if you see this happening, do not in any circumstances incite the crowd,” says Steve Allen. A tour manager for Led Zeppelin, Blur, Pulp and Red Hot Chili Peppers, he is now <a href=\"http://crowdsafety.org/\">head of the consultancy organisation Crowd Safety</a> and was an expert witness in the Astroworld civil lawsuits. “If someone is saying stop the show, then stop the show.

At a gig in Aberdeen, the energy of the crowd was so “off the Richter scale” that it necessitated establishing a formal plan of action in the event of future mishap. “I explained to Noel that if we didn’t have this system in place, there’s a strong possibility that someone’s going to get seriously hurt.”</p> <p>The system he set up saw him stand on the stage barrier ready to signal to the Gallaghers if the crowd’s safety was compromised. It was an overwhelming success, he says. “We had it down to a tee. We must have stopped 17 to 25 different shows around the world; the band were 100% compliant. They didn’t want a death or a major incident at their concerts, simple as that.”</p> <p>The founder of <a href=\"http://momconsultancy.com/\">Mind Over Matter Consultancy</a>, Prof Chris Kemp, who started <a href=\"https://www.momconsultancy.com/professor-chris-kemp/\">the world’s first crowd management degree</a>, says that the procedure worked because it came from the band themselves. “Anybody else who tried to get on stage and do that [wouldn’t have worked]. The Gallagher brothers actually cared about what happened.”</p> <p>So did Allen’s team, who he says accepted ridicule for wearing noise-cancelling headphones to communicate with one another – as opposed to clip-on mic headsets – before they went mainstream. Given that people die within three minutes of not having oxygen, he says, you “need to hear”.</p> <p>While shows had been stopped before – <a href=\"https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/kurt-cobain-stopped-sexual-assault-during-nirvana-concert/\">Nirvana stopped a show in Oakland in 1993</a> to challenge a sexual assault in the crowd – it was Allen’s codification of the procedure in 1997 that made it a serious tool in the crowd manager’s arsenal, and one now widely used by security staff worldwide.</p> <p>The vast majority of crowd management today is still preventive rather than – as with the showstop procedure – reactive. “There needs to be a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities,” Allen explains, referencing the extensive planning he undertook for Eminem’s <a href=\"https://southpawers.com/2021/11/22/eminem-big-proof-crowd-surge-2002/\">Anger Management tour</a>, in which they invited the police force from the city of the subsequent gig to prepare by attending the one before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6527cf8e23726e32b54f3f9c6aea4b077bbe83ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6527cf8e23726e32b54f3f9c6aea4b077bbe83ba/0_0_1890_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The aftermath at the Roskilde festival in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The aftermath at the Roskilde festival in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Meilvang/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2016, Kemp <a href=\"https://www.momconsultancy.com/blog/2016/02/01/chris-kemp-ceo-of-mind-over-matter-wins-the-excellence-passion-award-at-the-european-festival-awards-2015/\">worked with the Roskilde festival in Denmark</a> – the scene of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/02/burhanwazir.theobserver\">a 2000 tragedy where nine people were crushed to death</a> during Pearl Jam’s performance – to establish a meticulous protocol including a system of staggered entry to reduce crushes. “The more you plan, the more you can mitigate the chances,” says Kemp.</p> <p>“Shit,” though, as Allen says, “can happen.” It’s why the showstop procedure is still a key part of reactive management, the final emergency mechanism at the end of a daisy chain of safe practices.</p> <p>Astroworld has made touring teams aware of the risks of not having such a procedure in place: as well as the potential injury to life, musicians may face legal, reputational and financial repercussions. <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2017/07/17/artists-touring-revenue/\">The world’s richest artists make more than 75% of their income from touring</a>. A gig in which a crowd feels unsafe or prompts backlash online could mean ticket sales plunging or heightened infrastructure fees. “The promoter will turn around and say: ‘For you to play here the local authority have insisted I have to double my security, so my profit is now cut,’” says Allen.</p> <p>Increasingly, it’s the artist who triggers it. Fans have quickly come to understand these gig pauses as reflecting genuine concern on the part of the artist. Post-Astroworld, Billie Eilish was widely praised as one of the first musicians to pause proceedings in order to get a fan an inhaler. In turn, this reactivity from artists has created an expectation of safety among fans – particularly as they and their favourite artists return to a changed industry.</p> <p>After nearly 18 months of being deprived of live music, crowds are generally more excited across the board. “You might think Rod Stewart: no problem at all. Wrong!” says Allen. “I see the genuine excitement among [all people at gigs] as if they have a Willy Wonka ticket.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/01/woodstock-99-full-metal-racket-the-jaw-dropping-story-of-a-disastrous-music-festival\">Break stuff!

It’s not just about money.”</p> <p>Another side-effect of the pandemic is that many highly trained security staff were forced to retrain in other fields owing to the absence of work, which has led to venues working with less-qualified operatives. “The pedigree that was there has been diluted significantly,” says Allen.</p> <p>Allen and Kemp are divided on whether the performer should hold the ultimate responsibility for crowd safety. “Everyone has a duty of care, but the artists are up on that stage to perform for a crowd,” says Allen. “They should have people in place via the promoter.”</p> <p>Kemp disagrees. “If [they] believe the whole show is about them, that’s when you’ve got to challenge it. The artists have to accept the show is for the audience and deliver the safest [performance].” And while AI technology, such as <a href=\"https://www.dynamiccrowdmeasurement.com/\">dynamic crowd measurement</a>, can record crowd mood and compliance, it’s the artist who has the best view, he says. “And that links the artists and the teams in the venue.”</p> <p>Regardless, seeing artists getting involved in crowd safety is undoubtedly a positive trend, says Kemp. “If you haven’t actually got an audience, what use is that?”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/04/rare-coloured-sea-slug-spotted-in-british-waters-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T12:56:08Z","webTitle":"Rare coloured sea slug spotted in British waters for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/04/rare-coloured-sea-slug-spotted-in-british-waters-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/04/rare-coloured-sea-slug-spotted-in-british-waters-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Rare coloured sea slug spotted in British waters for first time","trailText":"The <em>Babakina anadoni</em> – less than half the size of a little finger – was sighted off the Isles of Scilly","byline":"Helena Horton","body":"<p>An extremely rare multi-coloured sea slug has been spotted in British waters for the first time.</p> <p>The multi-coloured sea slug, <em>Babakina anadoni</em>, measures just 2cm in length and was confirmed as a first sighting by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust and the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust.</p> <p>It was spotted off the Isles of Scilly by Allen Murray, a volunteer diver taking part in the Wildlife Trusts Seasearch initiative, where citizen scientists are asked to dive and record the wildlife around the coast.</p> <p>The snail is usually found in warmer climes.

The school funded the team to play in the North Manchester Girls League and allowed them to practise on the school grounds.</p> <p>However, the school pulled the funding a couple of years ago, leaving the team to fundraise in order to practise at another venue. “We gathered the parents together and explained to them what had happened,” Richards says. “The parents that could afford to pay, do so; the kids that can’t, don’t, and are supported by the parents who can.

We look at what that means for your finances.</p> <h2><strong>So what does it mean for mortgages?</strong></h2> <p>It depends what type of deal you are on. Most borrowers are on fixed-rate mortgages, and so for the time being at least they are insulated from the impact of the latest interest rate rise.</p> <p>However, the banking body UK Finance says about 21% of households are on a variable rate – either a tracker mortgage, where the rate you pay is explicitly linked to the Bank base rate, or their lender’s standard variable rate (SVR).</p> <p>About 800,000 borrowers have a tracker mortgage, while approximately 1.1 million are on an SVR.</p> <p>A tracker mortgage will directly follow the base rate – the small print of your mortgage will tell you how quickly the rise will be passed on, but next month your payments are likely to go up, and the extra cost will fully reflect the base rate rise.</p> <p>On a tracker at 2.5%, the interest rate would rise to 3%, adding £38 a month to a £150,000 repayment mortgage with 20 years remaining.</p> <p>With SVRs, things are less straightforward: these can change at the lender’s discretion, but many people will probably see an increase in their monthly costs. However, banks and building societies are likely to come under pressure to either pass on none of the latest increase, or only a proportion of it, to their SVR borrowers. Some lenders may not immediately declare their intentions, or may say that any increase won’t take effect for perhaps a few weeks or more.</p> <h2><strong>So people on fixed-rate mortgages don’t have to worry?</strong></h2> <p>Some with fixed-rate deals that are due to end later this year or early next are likely to be very worried – mainly because the price of new fixed-rate mortgages has shot up during the last few months.</p> <p>Overall in the UK there are just under 9m residential mortgages outstanding, of which 75% are on a fixed rate, according to UK Finance.</p> <p>In total, about 1.3m fixed-rate mortgage deals are<em> </em>scheduled to end during 2022, though of course that includes a number that have expired since January, and where in many cases a new deal will have already been taken out.</p> <p>During the past few years the vast majority of people taking out a mortgage have been opting to fix their payments, mainly because fixed rates have been so competitive, but more recently in order to seek protection from rising interest rates.</p> <p>“Everyone’s been fixing for years,” said David Hollingworth, an associate director at the broker firm L&amp;C Mortgages. He estimated the proportion of clients who had been opting for a fix at 90-95%.</p> <p>Two- and five-year deals are traditionally the most popular, while there has been an increase in demand for 10-year fixes, so some people will be protected from rising interest rates for some time, but those whose deals are ending very soon may be in for a shock.</p> <p>An analysis by L&amp;C Mortgages found the average lowest two- and five-year fixed rates were 3.46% and 3.5% respectively. That’s up sharply on January when the figures were 1.34% and 1.55%.</p> <p>That means a borrower taking out a £150,000 repayment mortgage over 25 years at the current average two-year rate would face monthly payments that are £159 higher than those paid by someone who signed up for an equivalent deal in January. Over a year that adds up to an extra £1,908.</p> <h2><strong>What about first-time buyers?</strong></h2> <p>They have been very much impacted by the issue of pricier deals outlined above. On top of that, house prices have continued their relentless march upwards: on Tuesday, Nationwide said the annual rate of property price growth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/02/uk-house-prices-cost-of-living-crisis-price-rise\">had accelerated to 11%</a>.</p> <p>Data by the property website Rightmove says the combination of more expensive mortgage deals and rising house prices mean the average monthly home loan payment for a new first-time buyer is £976 a month. That is 20% higher than in January when it was £813 a month. If the 0.5% interest rate rise is reflected in the pricing of new fixed deals, that would push up the monthly payment figure to £1,030.</p> <h2><strong>What about those having difficulty paying their mortgage?</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/data-and-research/data/arrears-and-possessions\">most recent UK Finance data</a>, which goes up to the end of March, presents a mixed picture.</p> <p>The total number of customers in arrears with their mortgages continued to fall in the first quarter of this year. At the end of March there were 75,670 homeowner mortgages in arrears to the tune of of 2.5% or more of the outstanding loan. That compares with 79,620 in the last three months of 2021, and 84,010 in the first three months of last year.</p> <p>But at the same time repossessions have gone up: 580 homeowner mortgaged properties and 370 buy-to-let properties were taken into possession in the first three months of this year, up from 390 and 320 in the previous quarter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business Today email sign-up\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, UK Finance said repossessions had been “rising from a low base” as courts continued to work through a backlog of cases that built up during the pandemic as a result of a possession moratorium that ran from March 2020 until April 2021. In the first three months of 2019, almost 1,400 homeowner-mortgaged properties were taken into possession.</p> <p>During the pandemic, millions of mortgage, credit card and personal loan borrowers were granted payment holidays, which helped some people who were struggling.</p> <p>The banking body said lenders were continuing to provide tailored forbearance and support to borrowers who needed help.</p> <h2><strong>What’s happening with loans and credit cards?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab8484136f3d0da1abb64fd10638966d7cd8a136\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab8484136f3d0da1abb64fd10638966d7cd8a136/0_277_3168_1901/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Credit cards in a wallet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cost of living crisis is forcing people to spend on credit cards and take out loans to pay their bills.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stelios Varias/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most personal loans are taken on fixed rates, as is most car financing, so if you have unsecured borrowing, you should continue to repay it as agreed.</p> <p>Credit card rates are variable but not typically explicitly linked to the base rate, so will not automatically go up, although they have been increasing in recent months.</p> <p>The cost of living crisis is forcing people to put more on credit cards and take out loans to pay their bills, according to Laura Suter, the head of personal finance at the investment firm AJ Bell.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/29/consumer-credit-races-ahead-as-uk-households-struggle-to-cope\">Bank of England data issued last week</a> showed that people borrowed an additional £1.8bn in consumer credit in June. Households loaded an extra £1bn on their credit cards, with another £800m on car dealership finance, personal loans and other forms of credit.</p> <h2><strong>But it’s good news for savers, isn’t it?</strong></h2> <p>Savers were the losers from years of interest rate cuts, and are now finally seeing savings rates climb. Last month NS&amp;I (National Savings &amp; Investments) upped the interest rates on many of its products.</p> <p>In response to previous base rate increases, account providers have boosted some rates, although often not in line with the Bank’s move.</p> <p>But even if the latest increase is passed on in full, rising inflation – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/uk-inflation-rise-petrol-diesel-prices\">currently 9.4%</a> and set to go higher – is eroding the value of people’s nest-egg cash.</p> <p>Meanwhile, annuities – the products offering a guaranteed income for life in exchange for a lump sum – have become better value as interest rates have risen, and are likely to improve again.</p> <h2><strong>How might house prices be affected?</strong></h2> <p>The housing market has been fuelled by cheap mortgages, so increases in the cost of borrowing are likely to have an impact.</p> <p>Nationwide said this week that while there were tentative signs of a slowdown in activity, with a dip in the number of mortgage approvals for house purchases in June, this had yet to feed through to price growth.

(When I lived in Britain, I could stretch this period of relaxation out to a fortnight. In the US, where no one takes two weeks off at a time, anxiety kicks in after roughly 10 days.) It’s the most self-defeating dynamic there is – taking leave, only to fret that you’re not “using” it profitably. How am I being improved by this holiday? Am I catching up on my reading? Am I seeing and doing new things? Am I recharging in a way that will sharpen my performance come the first week of September? It would be nice, one day, to stop doing this.</p> <p>This summer, I’ve come the closest I’ve been to silencing this voice. It hasn’t happened by design, but rather, as is often the case with parents of young children, by becoming aware of an unhealthy behaviour because I’m passing it down. In June, I chose a summer camp for my kids that promised to improve them through eight hours of intense activity a day. From nine to five, for six weeks, they would be in a programme with almost no breaks, no fun in the sprinkler, no goofing off. Instead, they would be living (my) dream of having new skills – in this case, ballet, music and voice – drummed into them. After a week, one came home crying and the other looked miserable. I ripped them both out, with no idea how we’d get through a further eight weeks of summer.</p> <p>There are practical reasons behind the seasonal warehousing of kids, particularly if you’re a single parent who works. But obviously, it’s not only that. The mad impetus to ruin the good times comes from some other, deep place. What is it? Capitalism? Calvinism? Two summers ago, I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/12/martin-amis-i-was-horrified-that-trump-got-in-now-its-looking-scary\">interviewed Martin Amis</a> and think often of how he framed his struggle with this type of guilt. We were at the tail end of the first intense Covid wave, during which, he said, he’d found it increasingly hard to work. “Well, I’m having a rest,” he told himself, but it didn’t hold water. “There’s the horrible Protestant work ethic that says otherwise. The word ‘God’ didn’t come up in the house when I was growing up, but the ethic was there by osmosis. I remember once having a really nice drink in Paris with my wife and a friend of ours; and being really uneasy because I wasn’t getting on with something.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/paul-newman-joanne-woodward-the-last-movie-stars-ethan-hawke\">Who knew a six-hour documentary about a Hollywood marriage would be so electrifying? | Emma Brockes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I think of Bill Gates, who famously said he loved getting sick while on holiday, since it meant the time was at least put to good use. I think of an assembly at my high school – intensely weird that I should remember this, three decades on – in which the head of the business studies department told us that summers were for self-improvement, and that the previous summer, he’d taught himself touch-typing. I was thrilled by this message, which is probably appropriate at 15 when you’re fresh out the gate. But maybe – just maybe – 30 years on, it’s OK to take a break.</p> <p>So here we are at the beginning of August, navigating endless, rudderless days. With nowhere to be in the mornings, my children have become practically nocturnal. Every night, we potter about until after midnight, which means they sleep until lunchtime the next day. The black circles under their eyes have disappeared. No one is shouting at anyone to put on their shoes and get out the door. I get my work done in the five hours before they wake up, then we go to the pool, the park or the climbing gym. They’ve learned to ride bikes. They’re watching a lot of telly. I’m spending an enormous amount of money on snacks and swim lessons, but apart from that, there’s zero outlay. It’s like we’re cosplaying the 70s.</p> <p>Still, the guilt is there, lurking in the shadows. Is this really OK? What are we achieving with all this? Is it making us better people? Are we “wasting” the summer? Last week I panicked and asked my children if they wanted to do a week of martial arts camp. They looked at me, appalled. Quite apart from the fact that getting anywhere for 9am would probably kill us at this stage, it went against the ethos of the summer. Patiently, as if explaining it to someone who is slow on the uptake, my daughter spelled out why this is the best summer ever: “Every day is a weekend.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist based in New York</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
