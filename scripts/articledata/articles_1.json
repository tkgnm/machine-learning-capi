But Tuesday’s legal advice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/23/scott-morrison-secret-ministries-minister-portfolios-fundamentally-undermined-responsible-government-advice-shows\">accused the former prime minister of “undermining responsible government</a>”.</p> \n<p>Donaghue’s eagerly-anticipated advice did not implicate Morrison in any legal wrongdoing but the report was scathing of the attitude to government conventions, and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has flagged a further inquiry into who else knew and whether there are further legal implications.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/04/tableizer/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What did the solicitor general’s advice say?</h2> \n<p>Donaghue’s advice was critical that Morrison could not be held to account for the five departments to which he was secretly appointed.</p> \n<p>Morrison again protested on Tuesday he had only exercised those powers once, in the resources space to strike down the Pep-11 gas exploration project.

Donaghue said that process was followed, there was no legal requirement for such an appointment to be publicised, or for a minister to subscribe to an oath.</p> \n<p>“Accordingly, Mr Morrison was validly appointed to administer DISER on 15 April 2021,” he said.</p> \n<h2>What was unconventional about Morrison’s actions?</h2> \n<p>Despite Donaghue’s advice that the appointment was legal, immediately afterwards he noted the appointment was “inconsistent with the conventions and practices that form an essential part of the system of responsible government”.</p> \n<p>“That is because it is impossible for parliament and the public to hold ministers accountable for the proper administration of particular departments if the identity of the ministers who have been appointed to administer those departments is not publicised,” he said.</p> \n<h2>What will the government do?</h2> \n<p>Albanese said his cabinet had agreed a further inquiry is necessary to probe remaining questions.</p> \n<p>The solicitor general said the government had “many options” to remedy the issues raised by Morrison’s actions, including legislating that all ministerial appointments be published in the gazette and all ministers be published on a department’s website.</p> \n<p>Albanese said he had directed the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to work with the Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor General to publish future appointments in the gazette and was still considering “further immediate changes”.</p> \n<h2>How will the inquiry work?</h2> \n<p>At this stage, it’s not settled. Albanese said he was considering a range of options, with cabinet to debate them further. He flagged it would be led by an “eminent” legal expert, adding “it needs to be not a political inquiry”.</p> \n<p>Asked if the inquiry into Morrison’s actions would be wrapped into a wider inquiry on the pandemic response, Albanese said “this will be a stand-alone issue”. </p> \n<p>“I want this to be quite an expeditious inquiry. I don’t want this to drag on. I want to get conclusions and then act on them.”</p> \n<p>Greens Senator David Shoebridge said he wanted any inquiry to have “royal commission powers” to demand documents and compel witnesses – including Morrison himself.</p> \n<p>“Too many inquiries are announced to respond to pressing political pressure, but don’t have the powers, scope or resources to get to the bottom of the problem and make the changes needed,” he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/20/calls-for-governor-general-to-explain-exclusion-of-morrison-ministries-from-official-diary\">Calls for governor general to explain exclusion of Morrison ministries from official diary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In his statement, Morrison said he would “appropriately assist any genuine process to learn the lessons from the pandemic”. Despite calls for an inquiry specifically into his own secret actions, the former prime minister said he also wanted scrutiny on the actions of the states and territories.</p> \n<h2>Will there be any further consequences for Morrison?</h2> \n<p>Albanese stopped short of endorsing any potential censure motion or other parliamentary process to reprimand Morrison.

Asked what he would do to bring down inflation, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think we need to let the Bank of England get on with its job with interest rates.</p> <p>And I’m worried, quite frankly, by reports from others that they want to curb the independence of the Bank of England. I think that would be a mistake, and I think it would spook international investors into the United Kingdom and will be bad for all of us.</p> </blockquote> <p>Truss and her supporters say that the Bank of England has not managed to keep inflation down and that its mandate should be reviewed because there has not been a proper reassessment since it was given its independence 25 years ago. Critics claim this means the independence of the Bank is under threat, but the Truss camp dispute this.</p> <p>In the interview Sunak also rejected the suggestion that he should stand down to allow Truss, the clear favourite, to take over as prime minister now and start implementing an economic rescue plan. Asked if he would do that, Sunak said he had many campaign events organised and that he was “focused relentlessly” on persuading people that his plan was best for the country.</p> <p>There has been at least one call <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/07/28/time-has-come-rishi-stand-aside/\">from a newspaper columnist</a> for Sunak to stand aside in favour of Truss.

The system was put in place by George Osborne to discourage the Treasury from making dubious claims about what its tax and spending announcements might be able to achieve.</p> <p><strong>Mel Stride</strong>, the Conservative MP (and Rishi Sunak supporter) who chairs the committee, has <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/158/treasury-committee/publications/3/correspondence/\">written to the Treasury and the OBR </a>asking for assurances that both organisations are doing what they can to ensure that the OBR can produce a new forecast in time for a possible budget on 14 or 21 September. Stride said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>OBR forecasts provide transparency and reassurance to the markets on the health of the nation’s finances. As a committee, we expect the Treasury to be supporting and enabling the OBR to publish an independent forecast at the time of any significant fiscal event, especially where, unlike other recent fiscal interventions, this might include significant permanent tax cuts.</p> <p>Whether such an event is actually called a budget or not is immaterial. The reassurance of independent forecasting is vital in these economically turbulent times. To bring in significant tax cuts without a forecast would be ill advised.

That might be a consequence of growing alarm about the energy bills crisis, and support for Labour’s plan for a price cap freeze (a rare example of a policy announcement that seems to have single-handedly generated a significant poll boost).

We will hear from Boris Johnson for the first time since he got back from his holiday in Greece later today when he gives a speech to the International Crimea Platform, a virtual conference organised by the Ukrainian government, at 12.30pm. Tomorrow marks the six-month anniversary of the (most recent) Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>The Conservative leadership contest has not been going on for quite that long (although it may feel like it) and at 7pm tonight Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak will take part in the 10th official party hustings, in Birmingham. Truss remains the clear frontrunner, but her attempt to present herself to the party as the new Margaret Thatcher took a knock last night when <strong>Paul Johnson</strong>, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the highly respected public spending thinktank, said her policies were more like those of Edward Heath. It is almost 50 years since Heath left office, but he remains a potent hate figure for many Tory rightwingers (which, given the current composition of the party, means many Tories).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PJTheEconomist/status/1561829277968089088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Cutting taxes and growing deficit in face of high inflation has clear echoes of Ted Heath in 1973.

Ahead of tonight’s hustings she has set out her plan for the West Midlands economy. Here is an extract from the press release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Liz’s bold plan for the economy will tackle the Treasury orthodoxy and unleash the power of the private sector through lower taxes, better regulation and supply side reform. She will unshackle the private sector and get behind West Midlands firms, using their growth to turbocharge the UK economy.</p> <p>Liz’s low tax, low regulation investment zones will empower local leaders to bring new investment into the areas that need it most. A Truss government will deliver key infrastructure projects including the Midlands rail hub and support Andy Street [the Conservative West Midlands mayor] to deliver the Wednesbury to Brierley Hill metro extension in full – and his efforts to obtain the necessary funds, including via the new devolution deal. She will also put the government’s full weight behind efforts to bring a battery gigafactory to the West Midlands, ensuring that the region continues to play a critical role at the forefront of our economic development.</p> </blockquote> <p>I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all.

This year, she has struck a £120m deal to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, has asked Royal Navy vessels to rescue boats in UK waters, and has threatened to turn boats around and send them back to France.</p> <p>Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “It is clear this government’s cruel and nasty plan to treat people as human cargo by sending them to Rwanda is doing absolutely nothing to stop people feeling forced to cross the Channel.</p> <p>“That is because these dreadful plans fail to address the reasons people come in the first place.

I played the then-unreleased Nintendo Wii for the first time at my first Gamescom. A few years later, I got a look at Project Natal, Microsoft’s mad motion-controlled game experiment that later became the Kinect. I once had the uncomfortable experience of being driven around Cologne in a limo for 20 minutes, while being shown dodgy footage of a licensed Stargate online game that was never released. For more than 15 years, I have honed my journalistic technique by plying tipsy, jetlagged American game developers for rumours after a few pints of Kölsch by the river.</p> <p>Gamescom has never had the LA glamour of E3; it was always more workmanlike, great from a coverage perspective but light on pizzazz. I’m fond of it though, not least because as the biggest games convention in the world – with more than 300,000 attendees – it challenges the video games industry’s US-centrism. There are many millions of gamers in Europe too, folks! We deserve a big event. PlayStation, Nintendo and EA have eschewed this show for a while, and in their place you get a mish-mash of unexpected exhibitors that reflect gaming tastes on mainland Europe. Simulation games are huge here, and massive swathes of the show floor are usually given over to games like Farming Simulator. PC gaming is bigger here, so point-and-click adventures, war games and strategy games are also more prominent.</p> <p>Gamescom has become even more consumer-focused, with behind-closed-doors presentations for journalists, investors and publishers replaced by exhibition areas full of paying customers queueing for an hour to play 10 minutes of the next Call of Duty. The same has happened to E3 – once an industry show, now a public one. This reflects how game development and marketing has changed, and how the world has changed: where once media were the gatekeepers, now the creative industries talk directly (and endlessly) to fans through social media, livestreams and events like this.</p> <p>My task now is to filter that information, and find what’s most interesting. And lemme tell ya, that task is a whole lot easier and more enjoyable when I actually see games and talk to people rather than watch a bunch of marketing videos. I’ll be returning at the end of the week with some good stories, some new games to keep on your radar, and hopefully not another Covid variant.</p> <h2>What to play</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40cd391802479ed01223540924a8c6ba86f9e4d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40cd391802479ed01223540924a8c6ba86f9e4d9/33_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We Are OFK STeam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Music-making and late-stage capitalism … We Are OFK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Team OFK/Steam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1490340/We_Are_OFK/\">We Are OFK</a></strong> is a video game band biopic about four friends making music and trying to get their act off the ground.

Remember that all of your unstarted and unfinished games will be there for you whenever you do have time for them, whether that’s in a few months or a few years. In the meantime, my rules for keeping the backlog relatively under control are: play only one game at a time; don’t worry about completing games; and consider them finished when you’ve had enough of them. Also, play for an hour here and there instead of waiting for, say, an entire free weekend or evening to play. And a Switch or Steam Deck liberates your gaming time from your time at home in front of a TV – that gives you more opportunities to play.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/23/annie-leibovitz-ketanji-brown-jackson-vogue-photos","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T10:25:03Z","webTitle":"Annie Leibovitz proves yet again: she can’t photograph Black women | Tayo Bero","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/23/annie-leibovitz-ketanji-brown-jackson-vogue-photos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/23/annie-leibovitz-ketanji-brown-jackson-vogue-photos","fields":{"headline":"Annie Leibovitz proves yet again: she can’t photograph Black women","trailText":"Leibovitz’s photographs are what happens when Blackness is seen through a white gaze incapable of capturing its true beauty","byline":"Tayo Bero","body":"<p>“A thing that you see in my pictures is that I was not afraid to fall in love with these people,” Annie Leibovitz has said. Yet if you were looking at any of her portraits of Black women, you’d have a hard time seeing that love.</p> <p>Last week, the famed Vogue photographer shared a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annieleibovitz/status/1559581506959396865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1559581506959396865%7Ctwgr%5E74d6efee444caad5a9868b46ebc60a268ee11ff5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fwhere-did-vogue-go-so-wrong-with-its-historic-justice-ketanji-brown-jackson-photo-by-annie-leibovitz\">sneak peek</a> from the magazine’s September issue, which features a profile of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. The images were a disaster, and the backlash on social media was just as chaotic, with Twitter users fuming over yet another failed attempt by Leibovitz to photograph Black women properly.</p> <p>The portraits were taken at the National Mall, with the first of them depicting Brown Jackson leaning on a column, hidden behind the shadows while the large marble statue of Abraham Lincoln looms over her in the background. In the other, she is seated centrally with the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool stretching behind her.</p> <p>Both images have Brown Jackson’s skin tone looking exceptionally dull, and don’t portray any of the power and grace that one would expect from a Vogue profile of the first Black woman on the US supreme court. Many have also scrutinized the images’ composition. Having Abraham Lincoln be the focal point of the first image came off to many critics as projecting a white savior narrative. Brown Jackson is portrayed stepping into her new role as part of a larger tradition in the US government, while the man who, ostensibly, made it possible for a Black woman to even hold that position hangs literally over her head.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She manages to make her subjects look dull, ashy and sad, a far cry from the lively and graceful people that they usually are</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a longtime problem of Leibovitz’s. The photographer has dropped the ball many times in her depictions of other powerful Black women, including <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21330898/vogue-simone-biles-vanity-fair-viola-davis-cover\">Simone Biles</a>, <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2022/08/19/annie-leibovitz-criticized-for-her-dark-photos-of-ketanji-brown-jackson/\">Viola Davis</a>, Serena Williams and Rihanna. In all cases, she manages to make her subjects look dull, ashy, pained and sad, a far cry from the lively and graceful people that they usually are.</p> <p>And don’t get me wrong; I’m not suggesting there is some grand conspiracy concocted by Leibovitz (or Vogue for that matter) to make Black women look bad. The 72-year-old is famous for her portraits of world leaders, sports figures and the Hollywood elite, many of them captured in that same “dark” aesthetic.</p> <p>The real issue is that when white people are her subject, Leibovitz manages to capture them beautifully in that style. But the dreary, low-light aesthetic simply does not work the same way on Black people. Leibovitz’s photographs are what happens when Blackness is seen through a white gaze that is incapable of capturing its true beauty.</p> <p>While she may be one of the most accomplished photographers of her age, it’s clear she doesn’t have what it takes to photograph Black women in a way that shows their true light. And sometimes, what that takes is being Black.</p> <p>In 2018, the New York photographer Tyler Mitchell made history when he photographed Beyoncé for Vogue’s September 2018 cover – making him the first Black person to do so in the magazine’s 128-year history. That fact alone is a shame, and a symbol of the woeful lack of diversity the magazine’s talent pool. Why does Leibovitz keep being called upon to do work that she’s clearly not qualified to do, while many talented Black photographers languish in obscurity?</p> <p>Black women can be photographed beautifully in their most natural state without making their features look sad, washed out and completely unnatural.</p> <p>There are many ways to capture Black women’s beauty, but whatever Annie Leibovitz is doing simply isn’t it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnist</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/23/tell-us-are-you-over-50-and-living-in-a-flat-share-in-the-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T10:21:00Z","webTitle":"Tell us: are you over 50 and living in a flat-share in the UK?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/23/tell-us-are-you-over-50-and-living-in-a-flat-share-in-the-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/23/tell-us-are-you-over-50-and-living-in-a-flat-share-in-the-uk","fields":{"headline":"Tell us: are you over 50 and living in a flat-share in the UK?","trailText":"We’d like to hear from over-50s in the UK who are living in shared accommodation amid rising housing costs","byline":"Guardian community team","body":"<p>An increasing number of over-50s are searching for house and flat-shares due to the prohibitive cost of housing in the UK, according to property-sharing websites.</p> <p>Flat-sharing site SpareRoom <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62344571\">told the BBC</a> that since 2011 it had seen a 239% rise in 55 to 64-year-olds looking for house-shares and a 114% increase for the 45-to-54 age group.</p> <p>We’d like to hear from renters over 50 who live in a flat or house-share.

A study by the City analysts Bernstein using data gathered by Cambridge Architectural Research for the government examined the options that could make the biggest difference, cutting gas usage by nearly a third in a best-case scenario. Here, we examine the measures.</p> <p><strong>1. Turning down the thermostat by a degree, from 20C to 19C </strong><strong>(estimated gas consumption saving: 7%)</strong></p> <p>Gas demand doubles in the winter as households turn on the heating. About 80% of household gas demand comes from heating space, with the remaining 20% used in hot water and cooking. The International Energy Agency has said that if Europeans turned down their thermostats by a degree it would save significant amounts of gas and drastically reduce the need for Russian imports.</p> <p><strong>2. Turn down the thermostat by a further degree</strong><strong>, to 18C </strong><strong>(estimated gas consumption saving: 7%)</strong></p> <p>A more bullish public information campaign may encourage consumers to go further. Pujarini Ghosh, a senior research associate at Bernstein, said: “Some people are already taking measures to limit their energy use to save money on bills. A public information campaign could make this more widespread. Turning down the thermostat and turning off the heating in unoccupied rooms could be effective and easy to implement.”</p> <p><strong>3. Wear a thick jumper at home </strong><strong>(estimated gas consumption saving: 4%)</strong></p> <p>Researchers estimated that wearing a warmer garment could encourage people to notch down the thermostat by between 0.5C and 2C, though they admit there is limited research on how wearing extra layers affects people’s perception of temperature and whether they then turn the heating down.</p> <p>Any direct government advice on this could risk a backlash akin to that experienced by energy companies last year, when tips to keep warm such as cuddling pets and doing laps of the house were widely condemned. Robert Buckley, of the consultancy Cornwall Insight, said: “A campaign would have to be done sensitively. We have seen suppliers be pilloried for being patronising. If it’s a government campaign, it should explain the global insecurity in the market that is behind the need to cut usage.”</p> <p><strong>4. Delay turning the heating on and turn it off earlier next year </strong><strong>(estimated gas consumption saving: 3-6%)</strong></p> <p>Many households switch the radiators on as they turn their calendars from September to October. But delaying putting the central heating on by a month until November, and switching it off early in February rather than in March, could make a dent in national consumption. However, researchers caution that heating demand in October and March is still relatively low compared with in peak winter months.</p> <p><strong>5. Install a water-efficient shower head and limit boiler usage</strong><strong>(estimated gas consumption saving: 4%)</strong></p> <p>More efficient shower heads can reduce water consumption and gas usage – heating water accounts for about 20% of household gas consumption. “Low flow” shower heads are estimated to reduce water consumption by about 40%. Limiting boiler usage to twice a day can also help.</p> <p><strong>6. Turn off heating in unused rooms </strong><strong>(estimated gas consumption saving: 3%)</strong></p> <p>Bernstein researchers based their calculations on an average household size of 2.4 people, with 2.7 bedrooms. In their analysis, they argue that leaves at least one room vacant at any time. If consumers are savvy about which rooms they use and when, and use the radiator valves to turn the heating off, they can cut energy usage significantly.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/23/anglo-french-oil-firm-perenco-threatens-amazon-reserve-for-isolated-indigenous-people-peru","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T10:09:42Z","webTitle":"Anglo-French oil firm threatens Amazon reserve for isolated Indigenous people ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/23/anglo-french-oil-firm-perenco-threatens-amazon-reserve-for-isolated-indigenous-people-peru","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/23/anglo-french-oil-firm-perenco-threatens-amazon-reserve-for-isolated-indigenous-people-peru","fields":{"headline":"Anglo-French oil firm threatens Amazon reserve for isolated Indigenous people ","trailText":"Perenco sues Peru government for repeal of law that offers recognition to proposed Napo-Tigre reserve","byline":"Arthur Neslen","body":"<p>Isolated Peruvian tribes face a threat to their existence from a push to scrap a planned Indigenous reserve led by an Anglo-French oil company, Indigenous groups say.</p> <p>The firm, Perenco, whose <a href=\"https://www.perenco.com/\">slogan</a> is “Oil remains an adventure”, <a href=\"https://www.planv.com.ec/historias/derechos-humanos/peru-la-demanda-perenco-que-buscaria-parar-la-reserva-napo-tigre\">filed an injunction</a> in May for the repeal of a law offering preliminary government recognition to a proposed Napo-Tigre reserve.

They are forecasting demand to outstrip supply at least until 2024, which is likely to lead to even higher sales and profits in the next two years.</p> <p>Food prices have surged more than 20% this year, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. About 345 million people are experiencing acute food insecurity, according to the World Food Programme, compared with 135 million before the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Olivier De Schutter, a co-chair of IPES-Food (the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems) and UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said: “The fact that global commodity giants are making record profits at a time when hunger is rising is clearly unjust, and is a terrible indictment of our food systems. What’s even worse, these companies could have done more to prevent the hunger crisis in the first place.”</p> <p>Four companies – the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, known collectively as ABCD – control an estimated 70-90% of the global grain trade. “Global grain markets are even more concentrated than energy markets and even less transparent, so there is a huge risk of profiteering,” said De Schutter.</p> <p>He said this year’s food price surge happened despite what are thought to be abundant global grain reserves, but there was insufficient transparency from the companies to show how much grain they hold and no way to force them to release stocks in a timely way.</p> <p>“We need to be looking at the grain giants and asking what they could have done to avert the crisis, and what they could be doing now,” De Schutter said.</p> <p>Cargill reported a 23% increase in revenues to a record $165bn (£140bn) for the year ended 31 May, while Archer-Daniels-Midland made the highest profits in its history during the second quarter of the year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9b467ec416a95b62eb599dcfcfedce3f428d85d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9b467ec416a95b62eb599dcfcfedce3f428d85d/423_535_4212_2527/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Cargill inland grain terminal near Nesbitt in Manitoba, Canada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Cargill inland grain terminal near Nesbitt in Manitoba, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terrance Klassen/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sales at Bunge surged by 17% year on year in the second quarter, though its profits were affected by previously incurred charges. Louis Dreyfus reported profits for 2021 up by more than 80% on the previous year, as revenues rose by nearly a quarter to $1.62bn.</p> <p>John Rogers, an analyst at the credit rating service Moody’s, said it was not surprising that supply constraints and rebounding demand had increased food prices and led to higher profits. “I don’t think they are colluding for outsize profits,” he said, adding that many more companies were also taking an increasing share of global grain markets. “I don’t think they are acting immorally – they’re not intentionally driving up prices.”</p> <p>He said the profits for grain companies had been increasing overall but their margins had not markedly increased in percentage terms. “This is a relatively efficient market – I don’t think these guys can ramp up the prices.” </p> <p>However, unpublished analysis by an NGO, seen by the Guardian, suggests some food companies may be increasing their margins too. The analysis found Archers-Daniels-Midland increased its profit margin to 4.46% in the first quarter of this year, up from 3.65% in the same quarter in 2021, and Cargill’s margin increased from 2.5% last year to 3.2% this year.</p> <p>Sandra Martinsone, a policy manager at Bond, a network of international development charities, said a windfall tax would be a way to restore some balance to food markets and help the poorest. </p> <p>“[The big agrifood companies] are clearly capitalising on the reduced supply and increased demand, further exacerbated by commodity trading,” she said. “When supply is significantly lower than demand, it gives space for price increase. But this is also exacerbated by speculative stock markets, since wheat and other commodities are traded on stock markets and therefore prices fluctuate.”</p> <p>Oxfam has also called for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/27/windfall-tax-on-covid-profits-could-ease-catastrophic-food-crisis-says-oxfam\">windfall tax on food company profits</a>. Alex Maitland, a senior adviser at the charity, said: “There are fears that speculation could be a driver in food price rises. Anything that causes hunger and starvation is immoral.”</p> <p>Natalie Bennett, a UK Green party peer, joined the call. “As a short-term measure there are strong arguments for a windfall tax on the food oligopoly – the handful of companies, with significant cross-ownership from hedge funds, that from seeds to supermarkets are major contributors to the inflation that’s driving the cost of living crisis to new heights,” she said.</p> <p>Vicki Hird, the head of sustainable farming at the UK food coalition Sustain, stopped short of calling for a windfall tax as she said it was hard to separate out the price effects in supermarkets where consumers buy most of their food. But she called for the government to regulate to stop abuse. “While farmers, consumers and food workers are suffering in the face of spiralling food and fuel prices, those sitting in the middle of the food chain – a small number of huge, dominant grain traders – are raking in vast profits.”</p> <p>If governments reject a windfall tax they should consider other means to curb prices, said Martinsone, including price caps or tighter regulation of commodity trading, such as the ban on commodity trading introduced in India to limit inflation and price hikes. She said food companies and commodity speculators were also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/sep/13/financial-speculators-spiralling-food-prices\">blamed for fuelling the food price rises</a> seen more than a decade ago, when surging prices led to riots in many countries.</p> <p>The causes of the food price rises are complex. The Ukraine war has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/ukraine-wheat-harvest-may-fall-by-35-percent-satellite-images-suggest\">played a big part</a> as Ukraine is one of the world’s top producers of grain, sunflower oil, maize and fertiliser. The war sent food prices soaring to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/08/global-food-prices-rise-to-highest-ever-levels-after-russian-invasion-ukraine-wheat\">highest ever levels in March</a>, though some have fallen back slightly since. A standoff with Russia over moving grain shipments from Ukraine for export has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/22/ukraine-russia-sign-un-backed-deal-restart-grain-exports\">partially resolved</a> and some shipments have now moved, but harvests from Ukraine and Russia will be affected this year and next.</p> <p>Rising energy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/21/fertiliser-prices-hit-new-highs-as-multiple-problems-affect-global-supplies\">fertiliser prices</a>, which have also spiralled due to the invasion of Ukraine, have an impact, while the rebound in demand after Covid lockdowns has added further pressure.</p> <p>Grain harvests in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/27/big-falls-in-crop-yields-across-europe-feared-due-to-heatwaves\">Europe</a>, North America and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/india-wheat-farmers-40c-heat-food-security\">India</a> have also been affected by the climate crisis. Last year’s heatwaves in Canada <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/22/climate-food-biodiversity-five-charts\">hurt wheat crop yields there</a>, and high temperatures and wildfires this year are likely to inflict damage.</p> <p>This all adds up to a rosy picture for grain producers. Demand for their product is surging, supplies are constrained, and despite rising input prices in the form of energy and fertiliser, their profits look secure.</p> <p>The Guardian contacted all four of the ABCD companies for comment but has not received replies.</p> <p>De Schutter said: “Ultimately, we need to break up the monopolies that have a stranglehold on the food chain. A handful of companies control global seed and fertiliser markets, animal genetics, the global grain trade, and food retail. They are making huge profits at the cost of farmers, consumers and the environment.”</p> <p>In the UK, food prices have risen for many staples, adding to woes over energy prices that are set to top £3,500 a year this winter for the average household. Poverty campaigners have warned people are facing harsh choices this winter over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/30/food-food-fuel-tripled-citizens-advice-charity-eating-heating\">whether to eat or heat their homes</a>.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/23/china-property-market-world-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"China’s property market is in freefall.

At its peak, it accounted <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/chinas-looming-property-crisis-threatens-economic-stability\">for a quarter</a> of the nation’s economic output, broadly measured. And it sees people in Beijing and Shanghai paying house prices similar to those in San Francisco and New York, despite having just a <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gnp-by-country\">quarter the income</a> of American buyers.</p> <p>Now many believe that we are about to see a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/27/china-property-sales-could-plunge-by-one-third-analysts-say-as-crisis-deepens\">violent contraction</a> of the property market in China. The government wants to intervene to curb speculation, and rein in what it calls the “three high” problem: high prices, high debt and high financialisation. The approach has been nothing short of dramatic. Financing for property developers has tanked. Earlier this year, property sales declined by as much as 20-30%, in-progress developments are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-29/china-mulls-seizing-builders-idle-land-to-fund-frozen-projects\">not being completed</a><strong> </strong>and people have taken to the streets, banding together to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/china-mortgage-protests-why-people-refusing-to-pay-loans-2022-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\">stop mortgage payments</a><strong> </strong>on such projects in protest.</p> <p>Many of China’s largest property developers are failing<strong> </strong>to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-19/china-to-offer-special-loans-to-troubled-property-developers#xj4y7vzkg\">repay their debts</a>. Even the survivors are cash-strapped and in a liquidity crisis. The risk is that the property market crisis will drag the broader economy down with it, hitting suppliers, small- and medium-sized companies in construction, as well as household consumption. And dangerously, the banking system has at least <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/chinas-looming-property-crisis-threatens-economic-stability\">a quarter of its assets</a> in property. </p> <p>What is currently needed is a backstop to the self-fulfilling crisis: the belief that property developers will be insolvent impels buyers to hold off their purchases and financing to dry up. Some monetary easing and relaxation in the mortgage market is not enough: stimulating demand by loosening mortgage lending won’t solve the problem and a proposed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/777fc269-e54f-442e-8b43-115c4937b421\">bailout package</a> will probably not move the needle. The government would need to offer much more relief to property developers, despite their past unscrupulous behaviour. To break the cycle, the government will need to send a much stronger message and instil confidence.</p> <p>The short-term pressure on the Chinese economy is real, but China is not about to experience a severe housing crisis. For one, Chinese households<strong> </strong>historically have very high <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-15/chinese-households-pivot-to-thriftiness-is-bad-news-for-world-economy#xj4y7vzkg\">rates of savings</a>, which should allow them to address interest payments relatively easily. This is not a situation like in the US or Europe in 2008, which saw highly indebted homeowners unable to make their basic payments.</p> <p>And<strong> </strong>pent-up demand for housing is still there: rapid urbanisation means that new residents will want a place in the city; in a gender-skewed country with a highly competitive marriage market for men, bachelors become more “eligible” when in possession of a property.</p> <p>Nor is a full-blown financial crisis likely. Major banks are state owned, and will not be allowed to fail. There are no complex, opaque chains of intermediation that characterise the western banking system. Foreign creditors to Chinese property developers will have to take a massive haircut, but the ripple effect on the international economy is likely to be limited. Foreign players have limited exposure to Chinese assets in general: today, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/overseas-investors-buy-up-mainland-chinese-bonds-in-a-search-for-yield.html\">less than 5%</a> of Chinese equities and bonds are held by foreigners. This is unlike mortgage-backed securities, where the whole world was exposed leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>What we are seeing today is already the third major property market cycle in the last 10 years. The state has its reasons to intervene: winning the hearts of the middle class starts with providing them with more affordable housing. An overheated sector also poses a threat to financial stability. In the past, profligate real estate companies have expanded into areas unrelated to property, while many other businesses turned to investing in property rather than focusing on their core operations.</p> <p>But methods to cool down the market that are too quick and too draconian will backfire. The problem in the housing market is a structural one and needs to be resolved over time. One such problem is China’s financial system itself. Investing in property has consistently outperformed the market as a whole. Around <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264275118318201#:~:text=China%20is%20a%20country%20of,short%20period%20of%20three%20decades\">80% of the population</a> owns property, and an astoundingly high proportion – reportedly over 20% in urban areas, and I have seen estimates as high as 40% in total –<strong> </strong>own more than one property.</p> <p>Another problem is the “mayor economy”. Local government sells land to raise revenues, and additionally uses land as collateral to borrow profusely. Property has often been a catalyst for development: when a developer builds residential housing, it also brings along infrastructure investment, retail, services and jobs. This explains why in the last decade, local governments’ zeal has rapidly switched from industrialisation to massive urbanisation – a faster way to foster local GDP.

You might even say it’s helped to forge some of the great cinematic cliches about prostitution, going as far back as Sarah Bernhardt’s turn, adapted from a stage production, as a courtesan-with-a-heart in a 1912 adaptation of Dumas’ La Dame aux Camélias.</p> <p>French director Cécile Ducrocq takes some of those cliches and shreds them with her perceptive, humane film, a feature debut that’s at least partly inspired by her award-winning <a href=\"https://en.unifrance.org/movie/38342/back-alley#\">2014 short Back Alley</a>. As in the latter, Laure Calamy (best known outside France for playing lovelorn personal assistant Noémie in Call My Agent!) plays Marie, a self-described “pute” of a certain age somewhere on the other side of 35. Marie walks the streets and sees a slowly dwindling roster of regular clients, but she’s largely unashamed of her line of work, to the point that she can nonchalantly tell a bank manager that’s what she does for a living and he doesn’t even bat an eye. She’s actively involved in a sex workers’ political movement to change the law so that clients can’t get away with paying too little for their services.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyugOODIHBs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HyugOODIHBs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But her teenage son Adrien (Nissim Renard), who also knows she does sex work, is at that critical age where he needs to get a job or a college place if he’s to achieve his dream of becoming a chef. The problem is he’s in with a rum lot of peers, is doing too many drugs and has already been expelled from a state-paid course. To keep his place at a private school, Marie has to raise 5,000 euros in just a few months, which means giving up her self-employed independence to work at a club.</p> <p>It sometimes feels like Ducrocq didn’t quite trust that viewers would be fascinated enough by the credible, deeply plausible portrait of the milieu itself so she throws in a moral dilemma or two to up the stakes. That adds some drama but it’s not really that necessary given how mesmeric Calamy is just living in the role. But Calamy gets to show off her astonishing dynamic range as an actor, adept at comedy, anxiety, maternal rage and kittenish coquetry, all in the space of a single scene.</p> <p>• Her Way is released on 26 August in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/23/uk-customers-face-catastrophic-winter-as-energy-costs-soar-says-edf-retail-boss","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T09:57:22Z","webTitle":"UK customers face ‘catastrophic winter’ as energy costs soar, says EDF retail boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/23/uk-customers-face-catastrophic-winter-as-energy-costs-soar-says-edf-retail-boss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/23/uk-customers-face-catastrophic-winter-as-energy-costs-soar-says-edf-retail-boss","fields":{"headline":"UK customers face ‘catastrophic winter’ as energy costs soar, says EDF retail boss","trailText":"Half of UK households could be in fuel poverty by January unless government steps in, says managing director for customers","byline":"Jasper Jolly","body":"<p>The UK faces a “dramatic and catastrophic winter for customers” as energy prices soar, according to a stark warning from the head of EDF Energy’s retail business.</p> <p>Philippe Commaret, the energy firm’s managing director for customers, called for extra government intervention, including help for households to insulate their homes and a VAT cut for small businesses as prices jumped to record levels.</p> <p>Prices for gas and electricity, which had already shot up around the world as economies recovered from coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, have been sent soaring by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/15/gas-blackmail-how-putins-weaponised-energy-supplies-are-hurting-europe\">Russia using its control over European gas supplies</a> to try to gain political leverage.</p> <p>“We face, despite the support the government has already announced, a dramatic and catastrophic winter for customers,” Commaret told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “In January, half of the UK households might be in fuel poverty.”</p> <p>The regulator Ofgem will publish its latest update to the energy price cap on Friday, with a uniform expectation of a steep increase in the price households pay for energy.

In 1939, at the beginning of the second world war, Victor, an engineer, was required to work at a power station, and the family moved to Tetschen-Bodenbach in what was then the Sudetenland (now Děčín in the Czech Republic). When the Russians arrived in 1945, Ingrid and her family were displaced as refugees and headed back towards Dessau, frequently on foot and at the point of Russian guns. </p> <p>They settled near Quedlinburg, about 50km west of Dessau, in what became East Germany, or the DDR. Aged 13, Ingrid was identified as malnourished by social workers and sent away as a <em>Ferienkind</em> (“holiday child”) to live and work at a farm where food was more readily available. She had various tasks helping with the animals, and developed an affinity with them and the surrounding forest. After a few months her health began to improve, and she returned to her family.</p> <p>After completing school at Gutsmuths Schule, in Quedlinburg, Ingrid trained as a nurse, initially in Torgau and Havelberg in the DDR. In 1954 she obtained a pass to work in Hamburg, West Germany, where she was obliged to repeat much of her training before specialising as a surgical nurse. In 1959 she moved to London, where she worked with the pioneering obstetrician <a href=\"https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fviewer.gutools.co.uk%2Fnews%2F2007%2Fmay%2F02%2Fguardianobituaries.monarchy&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7C2c336d0dfc034dc78cd108da7aeb343c%7C4eed7807ebad415aa7a99170947f4eae%7C0%7C0%7C637957447873238612%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=CiH4%2BrRJACnuU5vWYBK3iZXVWFjr5s%2Fibgjqc7BndLI%3D&amp;reserved=0\">Sir George Pinker</a> at St Mary’s hospital, followed by St Mary Abbots hospital and the Samaritan Hospital for Women.</p> <p>She met Virén Sahai, an architect, in a chance encounter on a Channel ferry, and they married in 1966. Virén encouraged Ingrid to study further, and in 1969 she obtained a degree in German from Bedford College, University of London followed by a postgraduate diploma in linguistics at Soas University of London. Subsequently she worked as a lexicographer on Harrap’s Standard German and English Dictionary, and as a translator.</p> <p>I was born in 1973, and two years later our family settled in Abbot’s Leigh, near Bristol, for 12 years, before moving to Barton in Cambridgeshire. Even as life became comfortable, Ingrid remained committed to giving back to society. She served as a magistrate on the Bristol and Cambridge benches and continued to work part-time as a community nurse.</p> <p>She also expanded her views of healing, in the 1990s qualifying as a reflexologist and setting up a small practice. The reunification of Germany in 1990 led to the joy of reconnecting with schoolfriends from Quedlinburg not seen for half a century. </p> <p>My father suffered a stroke in 2013, and my mother’s devotion in caring for him and positivity in the face of her own health challenges were inspiring.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/mar/02/viren-sahai-obituary\">Virén died in 2014</a>.

Overall, those who included regular physical activity in their weekly routine had an 11% lower risk of infection with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid. They also had a 36% lower risk of hospital admission, a 44% lower risk of severe Covid-19 illness and a 43% lower risk of death from Covid-19 than their physically inactive peers.</p> <h2><strong>Don’t miss this: James Webb telescope shows incredible view of Jupiter</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"015063dcff2282ccd979d63b0dcc9ccdc350e303\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/015063dcff2282ccd979d63b0dcc9ccdc350e303/46_0_1707_1707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Nasa image shows a false color composite of Jupiter obtained by the James Webb space telescope\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Nasa image shows a false color composite of Jupiter obtained by the James Webb space telescope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nasa/Zuma Press/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The world’s newest and biggest space telescope is showing the solar system’s biggest planet, Jupiter, as never before, auroras and all.

No major work had been done to the hotel since its construction in the 1900s. The first weekend of the new constructor’s commission saw the kitchens, basement and staff areas condemned under public health regulations, with the team given 48 hours to get it fit to avoid closure. After that, each room was refitted and redecorated – many with designs from leading interior designers – all while remaining open to guests.</p> <p>Alan was born in London, to Charles, a quantity surveyor, and Eleanor (nee Hubbard), a housewife, and was the younger brother of Helen. On leaving King’s College school, Wimbledon, he started training as a quantity surveyor before being called up to the RAF in the second world war. Still in uniform, he served as an RAF steward at the Wimbledon tennis championships when they resumed in 1946.</p> <p>He met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2020/jun/10/gillian-maddison-obituary\">Gill Prickett</a> while they were both doing Christmas Post Office work. It was clearly love at first sight for him: he had a box of chocolates delivered to her home, anonymously, later owning up after inquiring disingenuously if she had received any good parcels.</p> <p>They married in 1952, initially living in Worthing, West Sussex, then Dorking in Surrey. For the rest of his professional life Alan commuted every day to London, working for a succession of building companies, including 25 years at Trafalgar House, on increasingly challenging projects, such as the refurbishment of the Royal Society of Arts in John Adam Street and the St Ermin’s hotel in Victoria.</p> <p>In 1996 Alan and Gill moved to the Oxfordshire village of Barford St Michael. Alan entered many village shows, making strange cakes or (with more competitive success) wooden toys and models for his grandchildren, drawing on his carpentry and woodworking skills. Village life was a happy personal expression of their enjoyment of the English countryside, historic houses and gardens, which they visited on short holidays throughout their retirement.</p> <p>Gill died in 2020, before which Alan had cared for her at home for as long as possible. He is survived by his children, Sarah and me, and grandchildren, Jamie, Leo, Jacob and Molly.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/23/tomato-flu-outbreak-in-india-spreads-to-two-more-states","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T09:17:08Z","webTitle":"Tomato flu outbreak in India spreads to two more states","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/23/tomato-flu-outbreak-in-india-spreads-to-two-more-states","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/23/tomato-flu-outbreak-in-india-spreads-to-two-more-states","fields":{"headline":"Tomato flu outbreak in India spreads to two more states","trailText":"New viral infection detected in dozens of children in Kerala, and now also in Tamil Nadu and Odisha","byline":"Amrit Dhillon in Delhi","body":"<p>An outbreak of a new viral infection referred to as tomato flu that was first detected in children in the southern Indian state of Kerala in May has spread to two other states.</p> <p>According to an article in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine, 82 children aged under five had been diagnosed with the virus in Kerala as of 26 July. </p> <p>Cases have now been reported in neighbouring Tamil Nadu state and in Odisha in the east, where children as old as nine have been infected, even though the virus usually affects under-fives.</p> <p>Scientists are still trying to identify exactly what this virus is. It has been referred to as tomato flu because of the painful red blisters it produces on the body, and it is very contagious. Children are particularly vulnerable because it spreads easily through close contact, such as via nappies, touching unclean surfaces or putting things in mouths.</p> <p>“The rare viral infection is in an endemic state and is considered non-life-threatening; however, because of the dreadful experience of the Covid-19 pandemic, vigilant management is desirable to prevent further outbreaks,” the Lancet article said.</p> <p>Doctors say diagnosing tomato flu is difficult because its symptoms are very similar to those of Covid, chikungunya and dengue fever. The latter two are common in India during the rainy season and are spread by mosquitoes. Chikungunya is particularly widespread in Kerala.</p> <p>The Lancet article says tomato flu could be an after-effect of chikungunya or dengue fever in children rather than a viral infection.</p> <p>It adds: “The virus could also be a new variant of the viral hand, foot and mouth disease, a common infectious disease targeting mostly children aged one to five years and immunocompromised adults, and some case studies have even shown hand, foot and mouth disease in immunocompetent adults.”</p> <p>Dr Suneela Garg, a senior health official in the Delhi government, said: “I agree that chikingunya and dengue can leave children vulnerable to tomato flu because their immune systems are weaker. We don’t have any cases in Delhi yet and I am confident it won’t become a problem.”</p> <p>The spread of tomato flu comes as India has recorded a steady rise in Covid cases in the past few weeks, along with cases of swine flu.</p> <p>Prof Dileep Mavalankar, of the Institute of Public Health in Gandhinagar, said: “Swine flu had declined during Covid but it is now on the rise again in the big cities.

Even though the city is not supposed to host internal refugees, because it is not considered completely safe, there are 140,000 registered refugees and many more who have escaped privately.</p> <p>Some gather at the Red Cross distribution centre, one of 11 in the city, at a former bank near the Maidan square in the heart of the city where food and medical parcels are handed to families, pensioners and those with disabilities, often on small incomes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29da87e2b6276c720656af057f071357eecfda41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29da87e2b6276c720656af057f071357eecfda41/1723_1102_2546_2546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tetiana Goienko says the number of displaced people is rising\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tetiana Goienko says the number of displaced people is rising.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vudi Xhymshiti/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tetiana Goienko, the head of the Kyiv Red Cross, said “because Kyiv is not supposed to host any displaced people, they have to rent their own accommodation”. But the capital is expensive and the available financial support is limited – a pensioner is given 3,000 hryvnas (£69) a month, jobless adults 2,000, while families get an extra 3,000 per child.</p> <p>It can be hard to find jobs, with positions attracting dozens of applicants, although some sectors such as construction are said to be busy for obvious reasons. Those that do get work may carry the burden of this year’s events, which have forced as many as 13 million from their homes across Ukraine.</p> <p>Katerina, 43, was a dental surgeon from Mariupol, who found herself in Kyiv for work at the start of the war, and so was separated from her 77-year-old mother, Raisa, for an agonising month. Eventually, after a desperate search, a colleague found her mother and she was able to get her safe passage out of the besieged southern city.</p> <p>The apartment she lived in was destroyed, Katerina added, and she and her mother lost almost all their possessions in flight. With the Russians now in control of the city, ruined by the spring fighting, there is no prospect of returning.</p> <p>Eventually Katerina began to rebuild and found a job working as an administrator for the Red Cross team, although she said “what I earn here in a month is what I used to earn in two days”. It is slow work rebuilding, although Katerina, who was born in Moscow and describes herself as ethnically Russian, is emphatic about the need for Ukraine to fight on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"659a487a3a9322bfc5116122b0e29e8eb083dfc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/659a487a3a9322bfc5116122b0e29e8eb083dfc5/1730_0_3648_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katerina, a paediatric dental surgeon and a lawyer from Mariupol, fled the city when it came under attack from Russian forces.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katerina, a paediatric dental surgeon and a lawyer from Mariupol, fled the city when it came under attack from Russian forces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vudi Xhymshiti/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“The only thing Russia has brought us is pain and suffering.

Its owner, Liubov Tsybulska, says it is as busy as it was before the war, although there are some obvious changes, including a predominantly male waiting staff because so many women have fled the country, while men between 18 and 60 are normally prevented from doing so.</p> <p>It has been a year of transformations for ZigZag. When the Russians were at the edge of the city it provided 700 meals for soldiers with the help of volunteers, then reopened on a part commercial, part voluntary basis, before gradually returning to near normality, aside from the curfew, which forces it to close at 9pm or 9.30pm when it would have been open until 2am at weekends.</p> <p>For Tsybulska, ZigZag was always also a patriotic endeavour. “We are pulling Ukraine from Russia here with our food and values. Since we were open in 2016, when it was not fashionable, we insisted that waiters spoke in Ukrainian not Russian.”</p> <p>But rather than the ostentation of the past, when the restaurant celebrates its seventh birthday shortly it will not have its customary party but instead donate the money that would have been spent to the armed forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d0157552cb2e94336a3dcfdfe1784ae803b3577\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0157552cb2e94336a3dcfdfe1784ae803b3577/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Internally displaced people collect their food and hygiene package in Kyiv.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Internally displaced people collect their food and hygiene package in Kyiv.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vudi Xhymshiti/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So normal seeming is much of Kyiv life that some in the middle classes hope for a loosening of the remaining wartime restrictions.</p> <p>On the beach one Sunday afternoon, Oleskandr, 52, says the war has made him very much in demand as a psychologist, but he hopes for a break from the pressure of his work, where he counsels soldiers dealing with life-changing injuries.</p> <p>However, it is difficult to make plans, say Oleksandr and Svetlana, 44, because it is impossible to rely on normality lasting. He would like to take a short break abroad – “we hope martial law is eased at least so we can get out of the country for a holiday” – although they, too, insist Ukraine must fight as long as it takes to defeat the invaders.</p> <p>But there remain worries about the medium-term health of the economy, whether winter will lead to another wave of displaced people arriving, and whether patience will wear thin with a war where a hoped-for counterattack shows no signs of materialising.</p> <p>One opposition MP, who asked not to be named because they did not want to make criticisms in public, said they were worried “when people’s expectations finally hit reality” and they realise that war would be long and expensive to win.

After being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in 2007 he suffered through five recurrences despite multiple rounds of chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. Now he struggles with chemo-related neuropathy in his arms and legs, and new tests show the cancer is back.</p> <p>Langford blames his cancer on his longtime use of the popular weed-killing product Roundup, which he applied countless times over decades using a backpack sprayer around his five-acre California property and a vacation lake home. He alleges in a lawsuit that Monsanto, the longtime Roundup maker now owned by the German company Bayer AG, should have warned of a cancer risk.</p> <p>Last month, a San Francisco<a href=\"https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Order-agreeing-to-Langford-preference-trial.pdf\"> judge ruled</a> that Langford’s health is so poor that he is entitled to a speedy hearing of his claims. A trial is set for 7 November in San Francisco county superior court.</p> <p>“I’ve had it so long. I’m very angry,” Langford told the Guardian a day after doctors biopsied an enlarged lymph node. “The future doesn’t look too terribly promising,” he said, trying to hold back tears. He learned last week that the preliminary biopsy results show a return of NHL.</p> <p>Langford’s is just one of a long list of upcoming trials complicating Bayer’s efforts to escape the costly, ongoing litigation over the health effects of Roundup. As part of the sweeping, nationwide legal battle that has so far run seven years, approximately 140,000 plaintiffs have alleged they developed NHL from exposure to Roundup, and should have been warned of the risk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"88abe74bf9afc0452d4d685dcbce04ae41032ed0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88abe74bf9afc0452d4d685dcbce04ae41032ed0/0_0_5451_3673/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Images of a display of Round-up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The active ingredient in Roundup, a chemical called glyphosate is the most widely used weed killing chemical in the world.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brent Stirton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One trial is underway now in Monsanto’s former hometown of St Louis, Missouri, while another in Missouri is scheduled for October, and yet another is set in Hawaii in November. Several others are on court calendars in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida and elsewhere well into 2023.</p> <p>For plaintiffs lawyers, the new trials mark a renewed effort to either force Roundup off the market or ensure a cancer warning is added to the weedkiller’s label. For Bayer, they mark a chance to add to its current Roundup trial record of four wins and three losses.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, Bayer said there is “overwhelming scientific and regulatory support” for the safety of Roundup, and the “strength of the science” is on its side.</p> <h2>Paying cancer patients</h2> <p>It’s been four years since Bayer bought Monsanto for $63bn careening almost immediately into three costly Roundup trial losses. A plunge in investor confidence shaved<a href=\"https://companiesmarketcap.com/bayer/marketcap/\"> more than 40%</a> off its market valuation, and if faced calls in several countries for bans on the active ingredient in Roundup, a chemical called glyphosate that is the most widely used weed killing chemical in the world.</p> <p>The first lawsuits were filed in 2015 shortly after the International Agency for Research on Cancer<a href=\"https://monographs.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mono112-10.pdf\"> (IARC) classified glyphosate</a> as a probable human carcinogen, finding <a href=\"https://www.iarc.who.int/featured-news/media-centre-iarc-news-glyphosate/\">“strong” evidence</a> of genotoxicity and a “statistically significant association between non-Hodgkin lymphoma and exposure to glyphosate.” <a href=\"https://www.iarc.who.int/featured-news/media-centre-iarc-news-glyphosate/#:~:text=Real%2Dworld%20exposures%20that%20people,cancer%2C%20non%2DHodgkin%20lymphoma.\">IARC</a> said it reviewed “all of the available studies” about a glyphosate connection to NHL when coming to its conclusions.</p> <p>Despite Bayer’s insistence that the IARC scientists were wrong and that there is no evidence that glyphosate or Roundup cause cancer, it has spent the last few years<a href=\"https://media.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-announces-agreements-to-resolve-major-legacy-Monsanto-litigation\"> trying to settle</a> the majority of the cases, paying cancer patients and their families to avoid trials. Bayer has spent or otherwise set aside more than $16bn for settlements and other costs, including paying out more than $130m to winning plaintiffs in the first three trials.</p> <p>Many plaintiffs say they have declined settlement offers, saying the amounts they would receive – less than $50,000 for some – were too low to make up for the suffering cancer had caused them.</p> <p>In an 4 August call with investors, Bayer CEO Werner Baumann told them that the company was “making good progress in putting major litigation behind us”, and was buoyed by winning the last four Roundup trials after losing the first three. He said the company has successfully settled or otherwise disposed of about 108,000 cases so far. He confirmed about 30,000 claims remain unresolved.</p> <p>“We are sufficiently provisioned to deal with the current and also with the future cases,” Baumann said in the investor call.</p> <p>Still, the latest series of trials threaten to rattle investors again, especially if Bayer loses significantly large verdicts, said<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/susquehanna-financial-group-lllp-announces-tom-claps-in-new-role-as-litigation-desk-analyst-152264795.html\"> Susquehanna Financial Group</a> analyst Tom Claps.</p> <h2>‘Flawed’ EPA assessment</h2> <p>The cases largely hinge on conflicting scientific views about the safety of Roundup, and on the interpretation of internal Monsanto documents that plaintiffs say show wide-ranging corruption and collusion with regulators but which Bayer says are being taken out of context.</p> <p>In these trials, Bayer has repeatedly used the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) endorsement of the safety of Roundup’s main ingredient, glyphosate as evidence in its defense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"19b6ef652fb6db91f99035e673c16ec901d4d1d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19b6ef652fb6db91f99035e673c16ec901d4d1d6/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the compound of German chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant Bayer in Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of the compound of German chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant Bayer in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in June, a federal appellate court invalidated the EPA’s favorable human health safety assessment for glyphosate,<a href=\"https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/9th-circuit-on-glyphosate.pdf\"> ruling</a> that the EPA did not properly follow scientific guidelines when it determined glyphosate was not carcinogenic.</p> <p>The court found that EPA officials discounted several important studies and said “most studies EPA examined indicated that human exposure to glyphosate is associated with an at least somewhat increased risk of developing NHL”.</p> <p>The court said that the EPA ignored expert advice from scientific advisors, and used “inconsistent reasoning” in concluding that the chemical poses “no risks to human health”. Overall, the EPA determination that glyphosate was “not likely to be carcinogenic” was “flawed” in multiple ways, the court said. The EPA faces an Oct. 1 deadline for redoing the work.</p> <p>Bayer said in a statement that it believes the EPA “will continue to conclude, as it has under Administrations of both parties for more than 40 years, consistent with other regulators worldwide, that glyphosate-based herbicides can be used safely and are not carcinogenic”.</p> <p>Bayer points to three recent large epidemiology studies it said have each found no association between glyphosate-based herbicides and NHL overall in “real-world use when adjusted for the use of other pesticides”. Moreover, Bayer said, “EPA published its own new meta-analysis of epidemiology studies in 2020 and, with the benefit of additional data, reported that there was no association between NHL and glyphosate in the human population.”</p> <p>Many scientists say the weight of scientific evidence does show a cancer association, just as IARC concluded. They also point out that many of the studies the EPA relies on were studies produced by Monsanto.</p> <p>One of the company’s most significant legal strategies has also recently taken a hit. It has asserted that because the EPA – acting under federal law – has not required cancer warnings on Roundup labels, the company can’t be accused in state courts of failing to warn users of a cancer risk.</p> <p>But this approach has so far been unsuccessful – the supreme court, for instance, has twice declined Bayer’s requests for a review of the issue. The US Department of Justice<a href=\"https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hardeman-supreme-court-brief.pdf\"> issued a brief</a> stating that Bayer’s position was not backed by the law.</p> <p>These recent developments favor the plaintiffs, according to Brent Wisner, the California lawyer who was a member of the legal team that won the first three trials. Wisner and other plaintiffs’ lawyers presented juries with internal corporate records they said showed Monsanto colluded with EPA officials on glyphosate assessments, and<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-09/monsanto-was-its-own-ghostwriter-for-some-safety-reviews#xj4y7vzkg\"> ghostwrote scientific studies</a> that said Roundup was safe.

The appellate court “confirmed what we have been saying for years – the EPA didn’t follow their own guidelines..” (Bayer did not respond to a request to address Wisner’s comment.)</p> <p>Wisner is among several members of the original leadership team for the plaintiffs’ side who have decided to jump back into the litigation after sitting on the sidelines for two years since settling most if not all of their cases. Along with Virginia lawyer David Dickens and other attorneys, Wisner represented<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/11/one-mans-suffering-exposed-monsantos-secrets-to-the-world\"> plaintiff Dewayne Johnson</a> in the first Roundup trial, which Johnson won in a unanimous jury decision.</p> <h2>Considered incurable</h2> <p>The trial currently underway in St Louis involves<a href=\"https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Alesi-v-Monsanto-amended-complaint.pdf\"> three plaintiffs</a>: Cheryl Davis, 70, who has suffered through two bouts with follicular lymphoma her doctors have told her is considered incurable; 65-year-old Marty Cox, a retired US Army veteran diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; and 75-year-old Gary Gentile who also has been diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma.</p> <p>Each alleges their cancers developed as a result of their use of Roundup products at their residences.</p> <p>Missouri resident Nathanial Evans, 32, also will face Monsanto<a href=\"https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Evans-v-Monsanto-david-wool-case.pdf\"> in court</a> soon. Evans started working as a landscaper after graduating from high school, using Roundup QuikPro, a blend of glyphosate and a chemical called diquat. He was diagnosed with NHL at the age of 26. His trial is scheduled for 31 October.</p> <p>Also among those headed to trial is Bruce Pied. Pied, 69, operated a coffee and macadamia nut farm in Kealakekua, Hawaii for years, spraying Roundup to kill weeds on the farm. His mother frequently would help with the spraying until she died from NHL in 2007. In 2012, Pied himself was diagnosed with NHL. Though treatment helped, the cancer has recently come back in a more aggressive form.<a href=\"https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pied-v-Monsanto-Hawaii-case.pdf\"> Pied’s trial</a> against Monsanto is set to start on 29 November in Hawaii state court.</p> <p>In San Diego,<a href=\"https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Frank-Johnson-v-monsanto.pdf\"> plaintiff</a> Frank Johnson is luckier than others. He was diagnosed with NHL in 2014 at the age of 46 after using Roundup on his residential property starting in 2006.

He didn’t wear gloves or other protective clothing because he thought it was safe. He said he rejected a settlement offer from Bayer. He had a trial date set for October but it has been rescheduled for June of next year.</p> <p>“I’m a strong believer in corporate and social responsibility, and companies that put profits above the well-being and safety of human life need to be held accountable,” Johnson said. “To still see it on the shelf advertised with no warning at all infuriates me.”</p> <h2>‘This isn’t fair’</h2> <p>Michael Langford feels the lack of a cancer risk warning on Roundup products is a betrayal. When he would mix and apply Roundup he didn’t worry when some of the product would splash or spill onto his skin.</p> <p>“It’s absurd I wasn’t aware of it,” Langford said of the IARC classification of glyphosate as a probable carcinogen. “This isn’t fair. How many other people that have this cancer are in similar situations?</p> <p>As part of its plan to try to limit future lawsuits, Bayer has said it will stop selling glyphosate herbicides in the US consumer market starting next year.</p> <p>That won’t stop the lawsuits, predicted Jennifer Moore, the lawyer representing Langford and several other clients with trials scheduled. She said the legal efforts would not stop until a cancer warning was added to the label or the product was removed from the market.</p> <p>* This story is co-published with<a href=\"https://www.thenewlede.org/\"> The New Lede</a>, a journalism project of the Environmental Working Group.

As nurses have left the bedside, adverse health events in hospitals <a href=\"https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2022/adverse080322.html\">increased</a> by 33% from 2020 to 2021.</p> <p>The union has <a href=\"https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/06/01/minnesota-nurses-attack-hospital-executive-pay-amid-union-negotiations/\">criticized</a> high hospital executive pay during the contract negotiations as hospital executives have deemed the wage increase requests by the union as “unrealistic”.</p> <p>“Six months ago, a year ago, our management would say, this is just temporary, we can get through this, we just have to do this for now and recently, the messaging from management has become, this is the new normal, and that’s when I realized, they don’t have any intention of fixing them. They are expecting us to continue to work in these conditions forever,” said Chris Rubesch, a registered nurse at Essentia in Duluth and first vice-president of the Minnesota Nurses Association.</p> <p>“Nurses want to be at the bedside, giving care to our patients and doing our jobs. So the fact that we are willing to take this extraordinary step is reflective of the severity of our staffing crisis,” added Rubesch. “We’ve tried legislatively. We tried to address this in contract language. Our employers refused to work with us on that. And so we’re left to take this extraordinary step, and we don’t take it lightly. We find it’s the only path to address the problem.”</p> <p>Ali Marcanti, a nurse for seven years at Allina Health in St Paul, Minnesota, criticized hospitals’ talking points throughout the pandemic of praising nurses as healthcare heroes while refusing to address staffing issues in contract negotiations.</p> <p>“Negotiations, in our eyes have been our employers’ opportunity to put their money where their mouth is, and instead of pithy statements, like ‘you’re a hero’, actually give us some substantial improvements to our work environment that make us actually want to continue working for Allina,” said Marcanti.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Essentia Health said: “We are disappointed by the vote because we believe no one wins in a strike – and we have a shared responsibility to provide quality care to the patients and communities we are privileged to serve.

Its developers explain how they’re trying to make a beat ‘em up that everyone can play","byline":"Tom Regan","body":"<p>If there’s one name synonymous with fighting games, it’s Street Fighter. Dominating arcades in the late 80s and 90s and spawning the living room-conquering Super Nintendo classic Street Fighter II, Capcom’s beat ’em up became a cultural phenomenon. But since the death of the arcade, fighting games have become more niche. While 2016’s Street Fighter V slowly became a competitive esports sensation, it lacked the earlier games’ universal appeal. Now, 31 years after Street Fighter II, Capcom is reinventing its prize fighter for a new generation. Visually, Street Fighter 6 is forging a new identity for the franchise, sporting an eye-catching aesthetic that combines unattainably bulging biceps with attacks that explode in a burst of colour.</p> <p>“I really want to make Street Fighter a game that everyone can play, like it used to be,” producer and series veteran Shuhei Matsumoto tells the Guardian. Offering a radical overhaul to its controls, Street Fighter 6 is a more accessible twist on spin-kicking, fireball-throwing fighting spectacle. A newbie-friendly control option ditches the classic six-button setup of high and low punches and kicks in favour of a simpler three-button structure, allowing first-timers to pull off a Shoryuken without spending months developing the muscle memory.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1INU3FOJsTw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1INU3FOJsTw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>​Wisely, however, this new control method is entirely optional: veterans can still get their KOs the old way. “That’s our concept for Street Fighter 6: we need to not only meet the needs of hardcore fighting game fans, casual fighting players and those who love the world and characters of Street Fighter, but also players who are thinking of starting out with this new game,” says Matsumoto.</p> <p>The fiction and characters of Street Fighter – mostly explored in manga and anime spin-offs, so far, rather than in the games themselves – actually take centre stage in an intriguing new story-led adventure mode, inspired by the Dreamcast classic Shenmue. “The game is expanding beyond battles to include a World Tour mode, where you can explore the world of the game,” says Takayuki Nakayama, director of Street Fighter 6. Instead of fighting a lineup of opponents in a tournament, World Tour has players guiding a custom fighter through, for instance, the graffiti-coated streets of Metro City.</p> <p>“I felt like most of the Street Fighter games in the past have only been able to offer a versus mode and a training mode,” Nakayama adds. “So, I wanted to approach SF6 as if the versus mode were endgame content, and before you got into that, you would have an introduction into the world of Street Fighter … a way to get to grips with the game.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1766616aa9d2f9bb44ffe3aeeadcecdb15dbd91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1766616aa9d2f9bb44ffe3aeeadcecdb15dbd91/167_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Get your kicks … Juri gives what for in Street Fighter 6\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Get your kicks … Juri gives what for in Street Fighter 6.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This contrasts favourably with the barebones offline experience offered by Street Fighter V, which launched without even a single-player arcade mode. It wasn’t until years later that V packed enough content to justify its hefty £49.99 price tag. “I know that we need to make sure the volume of content in the game is satisfying,” replies Nakayama, when asked what lessons have been learned.</p> <p>“One of the lessons of SFV was that communication with the fanbase is key,” Matsumoto adds. “For SF6 we definitely want to make sure that players get a very clear message from the director and the dev team on what it is we are making, and what we want to achieve.”</p> <p>As one of the first ever properly competitive video games, Street Fighter should be one of the world’s most watched esports, too. Thanks to massive health bars, mesmerising attacks and their simple 1v1 format, fighting games are contests that casual onlookers can immediately understand. But despite this, viewing figures for beat ‘em ups lag far behind shooters like Call of Duty and Fortnite. Is this something that Street Fighter 6’s creators want to chase?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9ee3b2b39fa137800de0078e56712055b1298f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9ee3b2b39fa137800de0078e56712055b1298f6/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Here to spray … Kimberly is one of the new characters in Street Fighter 6\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Here to spray … Kimberly is one of the new characters in Street Fighter 6.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Capcom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I think that the directness and readability of fighting games make them a great fit for esports. But I don’t think that the fighting genre necessarily needs to be the most watched in the world in order to have meaningful impact,” says Matsumoto. “I’m happy that we have a great fanbase and fighting game community who have been playing the games for years, and will continue to do so as long as we release them. I’m grateful for the support of the FGC [fighting game community] … that’s all I need!”</p> <p>Street Fighter 6 is still a year away from release, so much of Capcom’s colourful scrimmage remains a mystery – leaving the internet to spawn its own amusing theories. Thanks to snippets of dialogue from the trailers – and a particularly haggard-looking redesign of iconic character, Ken – fans <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/ken-masters-street-fighter-6-memes-divorce-eliza-shoryu-1849024285\">have concluded</a> that his old rival Ryu has stolen his wife. While the developers sadly declined to comment on the “Hot Ryu v Divorcee Ken” meme, patter like this is building a buzz in the gaming world.</p> <p>“I really think that we are making a new kind of Street Fighter in SF6,” says Matsumoto. For the first time in decades, Street Fighter feels unpredictable again.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Street Fighter VI will launch on PC, PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series S|X in 2023.</em></p></li> </ul> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/aug/23/its-a-magical-experience-children-never-forget-why-toy-shops-flourish-while-others-struggle","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T09:00:05Z","webTitle":"‘It’s a magical experience children never forget’: why toy shops flourish while others struggle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/23/its-a-magical-experience-children-never-forget-why-toy-shops-flourish-while-others-struggle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/23/its-a-magical-experience-children-never-forget-why-toy-shops-flourish-while-others-struggle","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s a magical experience children never forget’: why toy shops flourish while others struggle","trailText":"The internet is killing the high street? Not if you’re in the market for a doll’s house, a pedal car or a make-your-own nodding cat. We get hands-on with a retail success story","byline":"Sam Wollaston","body":"<p>Once upon a time – well, only the other day, actually, a Monday morning during the summer holidays – in the beautiful city of Bath, there stood a building. Just across from the railway station. It was – still is – a grand, handsome building, built not so long ago but in a Georgian style befitting its historic surroundings. But it is not a happy building because its owners fell on hard times and left. Now the Debenhams building stands empty, haunted by the ghosts of sales assistants, a relic of a different, happier retail age.</p> <p>Hold the violins, though, and walk round the corner to St Lawrence Street, where you will find a little pocket of life – joy even – occupying a unit within the same building. Here is a window filled with hot-air balloons, a red pedal car, mice, a huge fantasy wooden castle. It could be Mr Magorium’s Wonder Emporium, Toy Story 2, Big, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/01/angela-carter-far-from-fairytale-edmund-gordon\">Angela Carter</a> even, if you want to go darker or classier: choose your own cultural comparison. This independent toy shop, called My Small World, is run by a woman called Dawn Burden and I’m spending the morning here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"476614775aceaf483b7e1c0d3bfaab3308ccdb94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/476614775aceaf483b7e1c0d3bfaab3308ccdb94/0_0_5504_8256/667.jpg\" alt=\"Fun and games … Jo Salmon and her children, Thea and Laurie, at My Small World.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fun and games … Jo Salmon and her children, Thea and Laurie, at My Small World.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, before going inside to play, the why part. Because this little scene in Bath is a bigger retail picture in microcosm. Amid widespread high street misery, department stores closing, and familiar names moving online or vanishing entirely, for toy shops the story is less doom and gloom, more boom.</p> <p>Sales in toy shops from January to June 2022 were up 44% on the same period last year. Duh, you say: lockdown at the start of 2021, that’s why. True, that does have a lot to do with it – but what about this? Even in the second quarter of 2022, sales were up 13% versus the same period in 2021, when shops <em>were</em> open.</p> <p>Speaking from his home in Donaghadee, County Down, Alan Simpson, who has been in the business for more than 40 years and is chairman of the Toy Retailers Association, says there was a bit of extra money around for some people. “People on furlough didn’t have the expense of going to work; they weren’t able to get away on holiday. I think parents felt able to push the boat out a bit when it came to expenditure on toys and the kids reaped the benefit.”</p> <p>There are about 600 toy shops in Britain, well down on 900 five years ago, but that trend is changing. After what it describes as a bumper year, the Toy Retailers Association expects the number of actual physical shops to <em>increase</em> by 10% over the next two years. As well as chairing the association, Simpson runs the Toytown chain, which has about 30 stores across the UK. Last year it opened two new shops; this year it will be three. “If your competitors are moving forward and you’re not, you’re basically reversing.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My son wants to play Minecraft, he wants to play Roblox. But here he’s like: ‘Look, a balancing bird!’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My Small World in Bath is not part of a chain. Burden opened up 17 years ago, in a different part of town, next to Waitrose, and she admits that is her target market. The stuff she sells is tasteful, old-fashioned, wholesome. There are no batteries, not a lot of plastic, plenty of wood. It’s not displayed according to age or gender. “Boys love doll’s houses; girls like building things. I think we’re beyond that,” she says. “It’s important we’re edging boys towards being nurturing and girls towards engineering.”</p> <p>It’s not cheap. You can get a string of coloured twist-and-lock blocks for £2 or a make-your-own nodding cat for £3, but the most expensive doll’s house is 300 full-sized adult quid, as is the red metal pedal car in the window. “Things like that will last,” says Jo Salmon. “They’ll pass them down to their kids. It’s important to be sustainable now.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"494d87dbb62e47122863dd54cc549a5349809674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/494d87dbb62e47122863dd54cc549a5349809674/0_378_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn Burden, with curly hair, smiling and holding an armful of six long-legged cloth dolls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It’s important we’re edging boys towards being nurturing and girls towards engineering’: Dawn Burden, owner of My Small World.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jo is here with her children, Thea, eight, and Laurie, five. It’s Laurie’s favourite shop. Thea likes the books and the arty stuff. They are local; hadn’t planned to come in, were just passing. Mum got steered through the door.</p> <p>Pester power, plus the lure of the toy shop window, is paying off – soon after opening time, it’s already busy. “I like it because there are things my seven-year-old only wants to do on the screen,” says Cheryl Burnside about her son Sam, who is there along with three-year-old David. “He wants to play Minecraft, he wants to play Roblox. But here he’s like: ‘Oh, look – a balancing bird!’ That’s not something he would have been exposed to. It’s important to let them go in and play around.” She ends up getting the bird for Sam and a book for David. They are not local – they are on holiday from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p> <p>It’s good to have the tourists back, says Burden. While I’m in the shop, French, German and Cornish (“escaping the crowds”) families come into the shop. The Cogswell family – mum Millie, Arthur, 10, and Phillip, three – aren’t tourists. They are from Bath but currently living in Saudi Arabia for work; they have returned for a visit. “It’s nice to be back where anything goes, and kids are still kids and allowed to play with rainbow toys,” says Millie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"98c4e466707f0115d6ca7a4c122bb041acb6b871\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98c4e466707f0115d6ca7a4c122bb041acb6b871/0_0_5504_8256/667.jpg\" alt=\"Millie Cogswell with Phillip, left, and Arthur.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kids’ stuff … Millie Cogswell with Phillip, left, and Arthur.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“They’re banning rainbow toys and clothes,” explains Arthur about the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/15/saudi-authorities-seize-rainbow-toys-crackdown-homosexuality\"> Saudi authorities seizing kids’ stuff</a> they think promotes homosexuality. He leaves with a build-your-own crank-operated doorbell, natural wood coloured, but it could be painted like a rainbow. Phillip gets a tugboat for the bath.</p> <p>Louise Evans and Emily Weston don’t have kids but do work with them. They are primary school teachers from Swindon, and understand the importance of the physical shop. “If you can see something, you can visualise your child, or someone else’s child, with it,” says Louise. “If I buy something online for the classroom I don’t really know what it’s going to be like.” Again they were just passing by. They are in town on a girls’ day out to visit an actual bricks-and-mortar bookshop. Hey, shopping on the internet is so pre-pandemic – the future is in-store.</p> <p>Juno, 10, agrees about the importance of going into a shop. “You can interact with stuff and they let you try things out,” she says. Right now she is interacting with a mouse wearing a striped dress lying in a little bed inside a matchbox. “I love tiny stuff and making tiny little worlds.” A mouse in a matchbox is £23.50.</p> <p>“We’ve been known to spend far too much money in here,” says Juno’s dad, Joe Short. But in tough times, maybe especially in tough times, people spend money on different things. “Even in the shit, people look after their kids. That’s not a bad spend. You don’t tell yourself off for that, whereas you don’t feel so great about drinking that extra bottle of wine. Buying a toy for your loved one is sort of righteous.”</p> <p>Burden thinks the past couple of years might have seen some family bonds strengthened. “I wonder whether people are more tuned into their children because they spent a lot of time with them in lockdown. Maybe children are more visible in their lives than they were pre-pandemic.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There’s a lot less disposable income. People are starting to batten down the hatches</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Good news for children, good news for toy shops, good news for Dawn. Last year was My Small World’s busiest ever. By November, sales were back to where they were before Covid. Now, month on month, they are pre-pandemic plus 24%. Even taking into account higher-than-average inflation, that is doing well. I’m not a financial journalist but I believe the technical term is ker-ching.</p> <p>Incidentally, here they have a little set of steps at the counter so smaller people can climb up and get involved. The woman currently paying, Felicity Lynch, doesn’t need it: she hasn’t brought any of her five children along “because they grab everything”. But she likes to come in rather than going online. “I prefer to be able to look and touch and feel.” Today she is getting a wooden puzzle toy for her soon-to-be two-year-old daughter for £16.</p> <p>Simpson agrees about the need for physical shops – that’s why he keeps opening his own Toytown stores: “It would be incredibly detrimental for toy shops to go only online. You remember being brought into a toy shop when you were a child – it’s a magical experience children remember for the rest of their lives. There’s no magic in a cardboard box arriving.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/playing-dolls-helps-children-talk-about-how-others-feel-study\">Playing with dolls helps children talk about how others feel, says study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tough times ahead though, right? “I’m cautious without getting depressed about it,” Simpson says. “We know what’s going on out there with petrol and electric and gas prices. There’s a lot less disposable income about. I think people are starting to batten down the hatches and look for value. We’re aware that going into the back end of the year isn’t going to be the same as last year.”</p> <p>A lot will depend on what kind of support the new prime minister is going to deliver. But for his business, and for Burden and all the others, there is another, potentially even more important saviour who never fails to deliver, even if it is only once a year. “The difference between toys and most retailers is that Santa comes at Christmas time, and parents push the boat out to try to make sure there’s a good Christmas for the kids.”</p> <p>And so they all lived happily ever after. For the time being at least.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/23/transfer-rumours-chelsea-anthony-gordon-manchester-united-antony-cody-gakpo-cristiano-ronaldo","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T08:40:54Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: Chelsea to seal £60m deal for Anthony Gordon?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/23/transfer-rumours-chelsea-anthony-gordon-manchester-united-antony-cody-gakpo-cristiano-ronaldo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/23/transfer-rumours-chelsea-anthony-gordon-manchester-united-antony-cody-gakpo-cristiano-ronaldo","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: Chelsea to seal £60m deal for Anthony Gordon?","trailText":"Rafael Leão to Chelsea? | Jack Harrison to Newcastle? | Layvin Kurzawa to Fulham? | Cristiano Ronaldo to Sporting Lisbon?","byline":"Luke McLaughlin","body":"<p>Things are changing fast at Old Trafford after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/22/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester United’s epic win over Liverpool</a>, with a number of potential arrivals and departures likely before the transfer window is bolted shut.</p> <p><strong>Antony</strong> of Ajax and <strong>Cody Gakpo</strong> of PSV remain firmly on the radar.

\n  <p><strong>David Shoebridge</strong>, the Greens’ spokesperson for justice, said he wanted to see a full inquiry into the episode, with substantial powers. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Greens will work with the Government to ensure this inquiry has full Royal Commission powers with the power to compel witnesses including the former Prime Minister.</p> \n   <p>The core issue here is the balance between the powers of the executive and the powers and privileges of Parliament, and all parties have a stake in the inquiry and its outcomes.</p> \n   <p>Too many inquiries are announced to respond to pressing political pressure, but don’t have the powers, scope or resources to get to the bottom of the problem and make the changes needed.

after he was born in Operating Theatre Eight in the Bankstown hospital on 13 July 2016.</p> \n  <p>He required resuscitation after his birth and while medical staff believed they were administering

<strong>Christopher Laurie Turner</strong>, 61, attended Bankstown police station on Monday and was arrested.</p> \n  <p>He now faces charges of manslaughter by criminal negligence and causing grievous bodily harm by a negligent act or omission.</p> \n  <p>Police allege Turner failed to adhere to the Australian standards when certifying oxygen connections within the neonatal medical gas outlet at the hospital in July 2015.</p> \n  <p>The gas fitter, according to a court in 2020, signed a form stating he’d tested the Operating Theatre Eight outlets and 100% oxygen was flowing from the pipe labelled oxygen.</p> \n  <p>A magistrate on Monday granted Turner bail on the condition he report thrice weekly to police, live in a specific address near Lake Macquarie and have someone put up a $10,000 surety.</p> \n  <p>He’s also banned from contacting prosecution witnesses except through his lawyer.</p> \n  <p>The matter was adjourned until 26 October to allow the brief of evidence to be

workforce round table on Tuesday.</p> \n  <p>He will tell peak medical bodies, unions and Indigenous health groups that he wants an “honest conversation” about what more can be done to address chronic skills shortages in the sector, listing workforce challenges as a priority in his portfolio.</p> \n  <p>Butler will say, according to draft excerpts of his speech:</p> \n  <blockquote

\n   <p>The challenges ahead of us are not insurmountable, rather many of these challenges present opportunities for us to improve and future-proof our health workforce.</p> \n   <p>We must get the distribution of the health workforce on track to strengthen the role of primary care and make sure people, no matter where they live, can access the care they need, when they need it.</p> \n

So what should homeowners do about their biggest monthly outgoing – the mortgage?</p> <p>Here are some of the ways you could trim it back.</p> <h2>Mortgage payment holidays</h2> <p>In March 2020 all banks were told by the government they needed to offer any customers who asked for one a break on repayments of any loans, credit cards and mortgages of up to six months, to help alleviate some of the financial pressures people faced during lockdown. </p> <p>While this scheme came to an end last year, you can still contact your mortgage lender and ask for a payment holiday if you are concerned about how to meet monthly bills. Whether it is granted or not is now at the lender’s discretion. If they do offer you a break it would typically be for about six to 12 months.</p> <p>“If you are ever struggling with repayments, always get in touch with your lender at the earliest opportunity,” says Brian Murphy, head of lending at the Mortgage Advice Bureau.</p> <p>“They are required to exercise forbearance and to do whatever they can to help you through a difficult financial period. ”</p> <p>There are major downsides to taking a payment holiday, however, so treat it as a last resort.</p> <p>Even if a bank approves your application for a short break, brokers warn it will show on your credit file that you have not met your monthly repayments. This could damage your ability to remortgage, or take out other types of loans for years to come.</p> <p>Banks will also only be offering a pause on repayments, not writing them off, which means once the holiday is over your monthly bill will be higher than it was before, to make up for repayments and interest the bank has missed.</p> <h2>Extend the term </h2> <p>A better option for the health of your credit file is to extend the length of your mortgage term, which will bring down monthly payments by spreading what you owe over a longer period.</p> <p>Take a property that cost £450,000, with a mortgage of £200,000, and 15 years left to go. On an interest rate of 2% for a five-year fixed-rate loan, you could reduce your monthly repayment by £130 (from £1,287 to £1,157) by adding two years, or £275 (from £1,287 to £1,012) by adding five years, according to figures from mortgage broker John Charcol.</p> <p>The catch is, you will pay more interest in the long run. Nicholas Mendes, mortgage technical manager at John Charcol, says this can be thousands of pounds based on just two or three years’ added interest. </p> <p>The average term for first-time buyers is extending to at least 30 years, he says, as prices on mortgages and homes have increased, and deposits are even more stretched.</p> <p>Younger borrowers have more time to increase their earning potential and move to a different deal in future. Banks may be more reluctant to extend your term if you are in later life, and may question whether it will put you in a worse position in retirement.</p> <p>Also consider that you are introducing more volatility. The longer you have your mortgage to repay, the more you are exposed to rising interest rates.</p> <p>Next month it is expected that the Bank of England will raise the base rate, on which mortgage interest rates are pegged, by a further 0.5 percentage points, from the current 1.75% to 2.25%.</p> <h2>Go interest-only</h2> <p>Another popular option during the pandemic was to switch styles of loan, from a mortgage where you repay both the capital and interest of your home, to an interest-only deal, where you clear just the interest that accrues.</p> <p>This will cut your monthly repayments dramatically.</p> <p>On the same £450,000 property, with a £200,000 mortgage outstanding, and a 2% interest rate, you would cut your monthly bill by £953 a month (from £1,287 to £334) by stopping capital repayment.</p> <p>Again, most lenders will entertain this, but they will take into account how much you earn. Some have strict lower limits of income – of between £50,000 and £100,000 – says Mendes. “If this is a joint income, the minimum threshold will be higher.”</p> <p>You also need to have a plan in place for what you’re going to do when the income-only period comes to an end. Most interest-only borrowers expect to sell their property and downsize to repay the capital sum left over.</p> <p>If this isn’t for you, you could decide to overpay later down the line and make up the difference more gradually, or shift on to an interest-only loan for a short period while needed, and then repay in a lump sum before the term ends.</p> <p>Again, discuss with your lender what is possible.</p> <h2>Consider overpaying</h2> <p>It may feel counterintuitive, while the cost of living is becoming so high, to consider throwing even more money at your mortgage than you already are.</p> <p>But if you have a healthy amount of emergency cash savings, and are lucky enough to still be on a fixed-rate loan from before the base rate started to rise, and with a very competitive interest rate, you could save a lot of money over the long term by overpaying now.</p> <p>“While reducing the balance directly cuts the amount of interest you pay, it also helps build up the equity in the property, which could make more, and cheaper, options available when you come to refinance,” says Peter Gettins, product manager at L&amp;C Mortgages. “Consistently overpaying can ultimately mean the mortgage is repaid years early.”</p> <p>He says pretty much all mortgages allow some level of overpayment – usually about 10% if you’re on a fixed-rate deal – but read the terms and conditions so that you do not accidentally incur charges.</p> <p>“As always it’s important to pay off the most expensive debt first, so any credit card balances incurring interest, or more expensive unsecured loans should take priority,” warns Gettins.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/23/childrens-and-teens-roundup-the-best-new-chapter-books","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T08:00:05Z","webTitle":"Children’s and teens roundup – the best new chapter books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/23/childrens-and-teens-roundup-the-best-new-chapter-books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/23/childrens-and-teens-roundup-the-best-new-chapter-books","fields":{"headline":"Children’s and teens roundup – the best new chapter books","trailText":"Estranged friends navigate a sleeping world, a boy discovers he is part-alien, and the hunt for a missing mother touches lightly on mental health issues","byline":"Kitty Empire","body":"<p>Sometimes, things are not as they appear.

But some of the most effective kids’ books play on the queasy disconnect between what should be and what is.</p> <p>First, though, aliens. In Polly Ho-Yen’s latest book, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-day-no-one-woke-up-9781471193569\">The Day No One Woke Up</a></strong> (Simon &amp; Schuster, £7.99), all the adults are sound asleep. Young Ana and her neighbour Tio are the only people awake, a disquieting situation for a kid. Ho-Yen milks the strangeness: city streets deserted, two former best friends, now seemingly enemies, problem-solving on the hoof. Ho-Yen was nominated for awards for her first book, 2014’s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/sep/19/reader-reviews-roundup\">Boy </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/sep/19/reader-reviews-roundup\">in </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/sep/19/reader-reviews-roundup\">the Tower</a></em>, and these are more ordinary kids trying to solve extraordinary problems. This big sleep is all the fault of “monoctohogs”, monkey-octopus-hedgehog-like aliens who are studying humanity and becoming too close to their subjects.</p> <p>Further up the age range (but not too scary) is PJ Canning’s debut thriller, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/21-monster-9781474984416\">21% Monster</a></strong> (Usborne, £7.99). It stars a 14-year-old misfit whose bewildering school life and anger management problem mean he’s being chased by police – and more obscure agencies. Plucky, sensitive Darren meets Marek, a sneering tech genius (19% alien, also on the run) who explains they were part of a genetic experiment that went wrong. Canning is a sure-footed storyteller, not sacrificing character to his fiendish plot. Both boys are very human, too, and brawn and brain bounce off each other in unpredictable ways.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-mystery-of-the-missing-mum-9781782693529\">The Mystery of the Missing Mum</a></strong> (Pushkin, £7.99) looks innocuous enough: cartoony front cover, lots of lists. First-timer Frances Moloney’s protagonist Jake <strong>SPEAKS IN BOLD CAPS A LOT</strong>. But what seems like a lighthearted romp – has his mum gone Christmas shopping? – gradually unfurls into something more subtle. Through the use of flashback, Moloney evokes Jake’s bewilderment while gently feeding us detail. His mum has, in fact, been sectioned, and Jake has repressed the memory. It’s an age-appropriate ode to “perfectly imperfect” families.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A mysterious figure gives Hex a tempting choice: he can face the music or reset the past</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Age appropriateness is one of those sliding scales in kid-lit, with books sometimes proving younger or older than they first appear. Generously illustrated and with big print, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-little-match-girl-strikes-back-9781398512818\">The Little Match Girl Strikes Back</a></strong> (Simon &amp; Schuster, £12.99 hardback, out 15 September) is a feminist reworking of the Hans Christian Andersen tale by Emma Carroll, with instantly recognisable art by Lauren Child. It’s too gritty for picture-book ages, with the hardscrabble life of a Victorian child eloquently evoked by young flame-haired Bridie, who sells the matches her mother makes in the Bryant &amp; May factory. Spoiler alert: it’s 1888 and the women go on strike: a timely summer read that might prompt discussions of why people are forced to take industrial action.</p> <p>Similarly, the award-winning AF Harrold’s latest, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-worlds-we-leave-behind-9781526623881\">The Worlds We Leave Behind</a></strong> (Bloomsbury, £12.99 hardback), is luxuriantly illustrated by the fabulous Levi Pinfold. But Pinfold’s images get very creepy, matching the fairytale subject matter. Young Sascha follows Hex and his best friend Tommo to a rope swing in the woods; something bad happens. A mysterious figure gives Hex a tempting choice: he can face the music or reset the past, obliterating people and relationships so that the event never happened. What ensues is a take on alternative universes in which moral quandary plays off against philosophical inquiry: who are we all, really? This exceptional book about friendship and paths not taken should rake in awards.</p> <p>Carnegie-shortlisted Chris Vick’s latest outing, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-last-whale-9781803281629\">The Last Whale</a></strong> (Head of Zeus, £14.99 hardback), is officially 12+, but that YA designation is contradicted by much younger cover art. This is a story untroubled by sex or drugs; the bleak future of the planet is spelled out, though. Activist Abi is stuck on a Norwegian island for the summer, hoping to see whales. Unbeknown to the authorities, she has borrowed a powerful AI with which she monitors natural populations and, clandestinely, tries to divine ways to disrupt international conventions.</p> <p>Soon, appalled by her ancestors’ whaling pasts, she sets the AI on cracking whale code. Vick’s generation-spanning eco-thriller zooms around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/31/can-artificial-intelligence-really-help-us-talk-to-the-animals\">up-to-the-minute themes</a> as the AI becomes sentient, Abi’s little sister Tig makes friends with it and the AI’s makers send in the drones.

These sharks are great models in starting to look at how these changing conditions may affect vertebrates in general, and other species, and can help us reflect what we might see in future oceans.”</p> <p>Epaulettes are not the only shark species known to have ambulatory abilities.

Watson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/18/deshaun-watson-suspension-fine-nfl-union-settlement\">was suspended last week for 11 games and fined $5m</a> in a settlement with the NFL, which investigated sexual misconduct claims against him by more than two dozen women.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/deshaun-watson-suspension-reaction-cleveland-browns\">The Deshaun Watson outcome shows women where they stand in the NFL’s eyes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Grand juries in two counties in Texas, where Watson played for the Houston Texans, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/deshaun-watson-grand-jury-sexual-misconduct\">declined to file criminal charges</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/21/deshaun-watson-sexual-misconduct-allegations-lawsuits-settlement-nfl\">Watson has settled</a> 23 of 24 civil lawsuits against him, which accused him of coercive and lewd sexual behavior during massage appointments. “I continue to stand on my innocence,” Watson said Thursday, which raises questions for some critics about the NFL’s assertion that he “has committed to doing the hard work on himself that is necessary for his return.”</p> <p>So: Does Cleveland cheer for him – or even for the Browns? The Browns acquired Watson in March knowing about Watson’s alleged behavior, then handed him a five-year, back-loaded $230m guaranteed contract. Without question, he is a talented quarterback. But many are understandably wary of cheering for him.</p> <p>“It’s very real that the Watson acquisition from the start polarized the fan base,” says Tony Grossi, the ESPN Cleveland reporter who has covered the Browns for nearly 40 years. “The fissure deepened as unsavory details of the Watson case came out.”</p> <p>Fans canceled their season tickets. Many who don’t hold season tickets “are totally turned off by this,” Grossi said.</p> <p>“I have loved this team,” one Browns fan, Kyle Marvin, <a href=\"https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2022/08/22/fmia-nfl-cleveland-browns-deshaun-watson-los-angeles-rams/\">told NBC’s Peter King</a> recently, “but I will not be a Browns fan this year. It’s going to be hard for me to be a Browns fan again. I’ll watch the NFL on TV, but not the Browns.”</p> <p>Watson’s new No 4 Browns’ jersey is not among <a href=\"https://www.nflshop.com/top-selling-jerseys/x-249520+z-98608802-3043109587\">the big sellers at NFLshop.com</a> (though the No 6 Carolina Panthers’ jersey worn by Baker Mayfield, the quarterback whom the Browns traded after Watson was acquired, did make the top 10 in July.) <a href=\"https://www.rallyhouse.com/b/cleveland-browns?show=48\">No piece of Watson merchandise</a> is among the top 100 sellers on rallyhouse.com’s Cleveland Browns page.</p> <p>But the effects of Watson’s arrival in Cleveland go deeper. Donisha Green, the director of community engagement for the Cleveland Rape Crisis Center, says that calls to the center increased by 150% after Watson was signed. She says 2,000 new donors collectively pledged more than $100,000. Many donated $22, for the 22 women who originally accused Watson of sexual assault.</p> <p>“You have the die-hard fans who want to rock with the Browns regardless of the situation, and they’re going to be able to move past the headlines,” Green says. “But there are a number of folks who thought this to be devastating. They were all Browns fans and had season passes, and they’ve given up their tickets and they’ve donated the cost to our organization. It really was triggering for them.”</p> <p>Green grew up 130 miles away in Pittsburgh as a fan of the Steelers, making it hard for her to root for the Browns under any circumstances. But she says of her adopted city: “Cleveland is definitely a football town, rooted in very deep, deep, deep, deep tradition.”</p> <p>She adds: “People will have short memories, unfortunately, especially if the Browns win, especially if Deshaun Watson is successful. [The Browns] have their PR strategy and they’re executing it. They kind of just want to get past it, and people will respond. But for people who are actual survivors or are family members who are victims of sexual assault, it will be a little bit deeper for them.”</p> <p>The matter has been difficult for Robyn Lockner to resolve. A season-ticket holder for six years, she launched the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/clevelandbrownswomensgroup/about/\">Cleveland Browns Women’s Group</a> on Facebook because there was not exactly an organization for “women die-hard fans.” There are now 6,300 members.</p> <p>The group, reads the cover page, is “for WOMEN ONLY who love their Cleveland Browns....the good, the bad and the ugly years.....for those of us who have endured it all....for those of us tired of men acting like we don’t know anything about football....this group is for year-round Cleveland Browns football talk.”</p> <p>Lockner says she did not like the acquisition of Watson at first “because of the baggage.” She knew he was a phenomenal football player, an upgrade over Mayfield, but, as she says, “in the beginning, it was like, ‘What are we doing? Why are we getting into all of this?’”</p> <p>She decided to read as much as she could, including a deposition from a Houston detective. “I kept an open mind, and this just didn’t add up,” she says. “It wasn’t making any sense.” She says that two or three of the women who made allegations against the quarterback were believable, but Watson generally was “not getting a fair shake here. They just wanted money.”</p> <p>So far, Watson has not come up with a public explanation for why, according to the New York Times, he sought treatment from 66 massage therapists in 18 months (mostly on social media) when his team had full-time staff to treat him. </p> <p>Lockner understands why some women left the group (although, perhaps buoyed by news coverage of the controversy, about the same number of women have since joined the group). She encouraged members to read the depositions and make up their own minds, and, as she says, “You’re either onboard, or you’re not.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/14/deshaun-watson-chants-cleveland-browns-nfl-football-fans-jaguars\">‘No means no’: Deshaun Watson greeted with hostile chants in NFL return</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Everybody’s sick of it,” she says of the matter. “We have a decision, and we are just ready to move on.”</p> <p>For at least 11 games, the Browns will be able to do that. Had Watson played a full season, Grossi thought the team could win 11 games and qualify for the playoffs. Had Watson been suspended for a full season, he thought the Browns would win only eight or nine games. As it stands, the over-under among most bookmakers for Browns’ victories this season is 8.5.</p> <p>“The only way the talk about his conduct goes away is for him to get back on the field and play like a franchise quarterback,” Grossi says. “That’s why I always have said he has to do whatever takes – take whatever medicine the league offers – to get back on the field as soon as possible.”</p> <p>That is scheduled to happen on 4 December when the Browns play in, of all places, Houston, the metropolitan area where Watson’s misconduct occurred. The game will be a national circus. If his one preseason appearance for the Browns, at the Jacksonville Jaguars, is anything to go by, Watson will be subject to plenty of hostility. In Florida, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/14/deshaun-watson-chants-cleveland-browns-nfl-football-fans-jaguars\">fans chanted</a> “no means no” and “you sick fuck” at the 26-year-old. But the Browns knew what they were doing when they decided to take on Watson and all his baggage.</p> <p>The Cleveland Rape Crisis Center will continue to monitor incoming calls and donations because, as Green says, “We do recognize that this is not just a local story, but a national story.”</p> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/23/the-misfits-review-feeble-heist-tale-pierce-brosnan-tim-roth","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"The Misfits review – feeble heist tale wastes actors’ time and yours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/23/the-misfits-review-feeble-heist-tale-pierce-brosnan-tim-roth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/23/the-misfits-review-feeble-heist-tale-pierce-brosnan-tim-roth","fields":{"headline":"The Misfits review – feeble heist tale wastes actors’ time and yours","trailText":"Pierce Brosnan and Tim Roth are among the actors cheapening their reputations with half-baked tale of noble robbers in caricatured nation of ‘Jazeristan’","byline":"Leslie Felperin","body":"<p>This film is the utterly mirthless equivalent of someone who takes you out to dinner, buys a terrible meal, keeps cracking rubbish jokes and then pokes you in the ribs every 10 minutes as they repeatedly ask (without listening for an answer): “Isn’t this fun?

About halfway through, he was bumped by a rival car and sent spiraling into a barrier. Seeing red, Ward exited his vehicle and charged down the banked circuit to vent his frustration. Several cars tacked down to the inside-most line to avoid him. But when the car that had ended Ward’s race approached, it veered up toward the young driver, and flung him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/10/nascar-crash-tony-stewart\">25 feet across the track to his death</a>. Spectators at Canandaigua Motorsports Park gasped. They hadn’t just witnessed the horror of a driver killed in competition. They saw Ward, a local hero and ascendent talent, run over by Nascar megastar Tony Stewart.</p> <p>A three-time Cup champion, Stewart, then 43, was moonlighting in the race ahead of a Nascar road race at Watkins Glen. Immediately after Ward’s death, officially ruled an “accident,” public sympathy swamped Stewart. Ward, on the other hand, was demonized as a hothead – and shortly afterwards a drug user when a post-mortem toxicology report didn’t just find THC in Ward’s system, but enough to impair his judgment according to Ontario county district attorney Michael Tantillo. Something about that picture always seemed off. Now a recent documentary shows just how far off, down to the pixel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/10/nascar-crash-tony-stewart\">Nascar driver Tony Stewart hits and kills fellow sprint-car racer</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.mountaindogfilms.net/\">The Hit</a> premiered at this year’s DC Independent Film Forum. And the sports world-rocking accident it painstakingly revisits wasn’t an obvious project for writer-director Chris Halsne. An <a href=\"https://www.chrishalsne.com/\">award-winning investigative reporter</a> and broadcaster-in-residence at American University, Halsne doesn’t cover motorsport or follow it for fun. But then he was tipped off about a presentation on the accident that would be given at a conference for the National Academy of Forensic Engineers. “[I thought], wow, that’s a visual, interesting, new piece of science,” he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Until then, the death of Ward was a story told through grainy cell phone and trackside video that left plenty of room for reasonable doubt as to whether Stewart was truly at fault. The analysis in Denver narrowed that knowledge gap considerably. Using a 3D animation sourced from more than a billion data points the analysis makes clear that Stewart accelerated and fishtailed his car in the direction of a defenseless man. The only thing it couldn’t say for certain is whether Stewart did this on purpose (He has never been charged with a crime over Ward’s death.)</p> <p>The analysis, which is freshly presented in The Hit, is the biggest bombshell in the 80-minute documentary. And it comes well after Halsne and his team bombard viewers with multiple replays of the crash, and in HD-caliber quality that was not available at the time of Ward’s death. In between, The Hit takes stock of the two drivers who came together on that fateful night in Canandaigua – one, a throwback on the downslope now racing for the pure fun of it; the other, a dirt track lifer who couldn’t have been more satisfied with his minor-league lot. (Not surprisingly, Halsne and his team had vastly more access to Ward’s family than to Stewart, who declined to participate in the film.) And the film thoroughly explores <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_car_racing\">the world of sprint cars</a> – which aren’t just dynamically different from tarmac-based open-wheel machines, but also a subculture where pros mix it up with weekend warriors and provide rural communities like Canandaigua reliable weekend entertainment.</p> <p>But where The Hit really hits its stride is in its review of the accident investigation. Not least, it reveals local authorities stumbling over the accident scene and the mechanics of sprint cars, which are engineered to turn left and are guided as much by the throttle as by steering wheel. It exposes the VIP treatment that was extended to Stewart – who flew out of town under cover of darkness without having to part with any in-car recording equipment following Ward’s death. His police interview barely takes up half a page. As to the question of Stewart’s intent, The Hit scoops never-before-seen deposition footage of Stewart – the only time on record in which he explains his side of the accident. He says he was actually trying to speed downtrack, away from Ward, when the car fishtailed. But that account clashes with depositions from witnesses, including two nearby racers who said they saw him turn up the track toward Ward – behavior that jibes with a tempestuous and confrontational personality who responds to the nickname “Smoke.”</p> <p>“We said from day one it looked like he moved up the track and obviously hit the throttle,” Kevin Ward Sr tells Halsne. “I know them cars do what they do when you hit the throttle. Why did he hit the throttle?”</p> <p>Still: In the aftermath of the accident, no piece of evidence would prove quite as damning in the court of public opinion as the contention that Ward was “high on marijuana” at the time of his death. That, too, The Hit finds was overblown – interviewing a medical toxicologist who points out that THC levels often become substantially elevated or concentrated after death. The Ontario county coroner’s office, which cited Ward’s official cause of death as “massive blunt trauma,” drew Ward’s blood samples 39 hours after he died. “I knew we had to dig into his use of THC,” Halsne says. “Of course the family thinks it’s BS. But the truth is it was in his system. It’s just scientifically unlikely that he was as impaired as the district attorney so clearly said in his press conference.”</p> <p>Stewart wasn’t subject to a field sobriety test at all. In the end Stewart took three weeks off from work before returning to his Nascar Cup racing duties. And although he’d only grab the checkered flag once more before retiring from driving following the 2016 season (leaving him with 49 career wins), the bigger victory for Stewart was an Ontario county grand jury declining to indict him on charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.</p> <p>While Stewart has carried on as a Nascar team owner, TV analyst and motorsport entrepreneur, Ward’s survivors have struggled to turn the page. The Hit gives his close friends in the racing community time and space to reckon with their still-raw feelings. When Ward’s parents aren’t guiding cameras around their son’s untouched room for the documentary, they vent about how Stewart – despite his public acknowledgements of their family – never reached out on the night of the accident, never visited them when Ward was in hospital or otherwise made direct contact. Mind you, this is after their civil suit against Stewart was settled out of court in 2018 in confidence, just weeks before a trial was scheduled to begin.</p> <p>If there’s a knock against The Hit, it’s that the masses can’t watch it. Halsne had been in conversation with a few interested parties during The Hit’s film festival runs in DC and LA, but nothing has materialized as yet. That’s a shame.

According to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/uk-news/energy-bills-sunak-truss-conservatives-b2143179.html\">a ComRes poll</a> commissioned by the Independent, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/novaramedia/status/1558121570534817792\">29% of voters</a> believe violent disorder is appropriate given the circumstances. Among 18- to 24-year-olds, nearly half think rioting is justified; and even among 35- to 44-year-olds it’s over 40%. If such a large chunk of the electorate believes that it’s justifiable to smash stuff up in protest even before the projected hike in energy prices plunges millions of households below the waterline, what fury awaits this winter?</p> <p>Before I’m arrested for incitement under the Public Order Act, this is no clarion call for riots. It is to say that a democracy that is unable to satisfy the basic needs of its citizens brings mass unrest on itself. Martin Luther King aptly observed that “a riot is the language of the unheard”; how else can ordinary people force the powerful to listen? Waiting for a general election that may be two years away will not deal with the imminent humanitarian catastrophe we face.</p> <p>This – entirely legitimate – rage needs to be channelled in ways that can actually force the government to satisfy popular demands, without laying waste to major British cities. That means urgently reviving the tradition of mass peaceful civil disobedience and direct action – the tactics that helped secure many of our rights and freedoms: from women’s right to vote, to the mass movement that brought down Margaret Thatcher’s poll tax. If you’re wondering why governments in other countries have offered more to tackle looming social calamities, there’s a straightforward answer. They still expect mass protest if they fail.</p> <p>Recently, a seasoned political commentator remarked on findings showing that the poorest households in France were facing one of the smallest increases in cost of living in Europe. “Another one of those charts which makes you wonder why the French are always so angry with their government,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomMcTague/status/1554966110046494720\">he mused</a>. But those two facts are surely linked: France’s rulers have a rational fear that their citizens will express their rage with upheaval in the streets and town squares, and this inhibits attacks on their living standards.</p> <p>France is, of course, a self-consciously revolutionary society that sanctifies the sovereignty of the people. This provides legitimacy to explosions of popular unrest. The results over the decades speak for themselves. In May 1968, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/29/paris-students-meet-with-brutal-repression-archive-1968\">brutal police crackdown</a> on rebellious students acted as a trigger for a general strike and mass revolt. Fearing revolution, President Charles de Gaulle fled the country, and only the dissolution of the National Assembly prevented the overthrow of the government. With De Gaulle triumphing in fresh elections later that year, it is tempting to dismiss the rebellion as a failure, but France’s terrified establishment were compelled to make drastic concessions in the so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenelle_agreements\">Grenelle agreements</a>, above all accepting a massive hike in workers’ wages.</p> <p>A key negotiator at Grenelle was the ambitious rising Gaullist star Jacques Chirac. Nearly three decades later, as president, he would also become the target of popular wrath after his government sought to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_strikes_in_France\">slash social security</a>, freeze public sector wages and raise the retirement age of railway workers. While Chirac’s prime minister, Alain Juppé, was adamant that he would stand his ground, weeks of mass strikes, workplace occupations and popular protests forced the administration into a grinding retreat.</p> <p>Emmanuel Macron, too, believed his triumph in the 2017 French presidential elections offered a mandate to impose regressive economic policies. His attempt to introduce a carbon tax – a policy that violated the basic principle of a “just transition”, wherein attempts to address the climate emergency should not rest on the shoulders of the poorest – led to a social explosion in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/05/france-wealth-tax-changes-gilets-jaunes-protests-president-macron\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/05/france-wealth-tax-changes-gilets-jaunes-protests-president-macron\">gilets jaunes</a></em>, or yellow jackets. Once again, the people in the streets won. “No tax is worth jeopardising the unity of the nation,” Macron’s chastened prime minister, Édouard Philippe, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-protests-idUSKBN1O30MX\">eventually conceded</a>. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/may-day-marches-across-france-send-pensions-message-to-macron\">mass protests</a> played a key role in forcing Macron to water down plans to raise the pension age.</p> <p>Much attention has rightly focused on how public ownership of energy has allowed France to limit <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/edf-bills-france-less-half-27728887\">energy bill increases to 4%</a> for most households. But any French government without a political death wish would surely prefer to invest billions in protecting living standards than drive the masses to the barricades. Put simply, France’s rulers fear their people. In Britain, as things stand, they do not.</p> <p>The reasons for this are not culturally ingrained. Our own establishment prefers us to forget it, but the English had a revolution nearly a century and a half before the French, and from Chartists to sufragettes to trade unionists, rebellion is a tradition as English as queueing or afternoon tea. Our complicity in forgeting our own history – nurturing a myth that we are innately placid and will confine our unrest to angrily bellowing at our TV or mobile screens – allows our rulers to justifiably believe they can get away with almost anything.</p> <p>The launch of <a href=\"https://wesayenough.co.uk/\">Enough is Enough</a> – a new mass campaign to fight the cost of living emergency – offers real hope that popular resistance is coming back to these shores. That it has been launched by trade unions – not least the union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and its leader, Mick Lynch – is particularly important. This is a movement with an unapologetically working-class leadership. Its task is straightforward: a crash course French lesson for Liz Truss’s likely government. If our rulers are terrified of their own people, drastic measures to protect living standards will follow quicker than you can say “Maximilien Robespierre”. Temperatures may plunge, bills may rise, but a hot winter could be upon us.</p> <ul> <li><p>Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/23/ai-rap-technology-music","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Rapper’s delight or weapons-grade nonsense?

But will its algorithm be able to handle our novice writer’s rubbish rhymes?","byline":"Tom Faber","body":"<p>I may be many things, but I’m not a rapper. I discover this when I’m asked to freestyle a few verses on a visit to London’s Abbey Road recording studios. Immediately lines from famous rappers flood into my head – some classic Biggie, a few Young Thug yelps, the theme to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air – but I’ve got to think up something original.</p> <p>Out of desperation, I decide to rap about my morning routine. Adopting a slow pace and simple rhyme scheme that even the Sugarhill Gang would disdain, I begin: “I wake up at seven and I brush my teeth.” Already I am at a loss. What rhymes with “teeth”? Panicking, I look at the computer in front of me, which is running a demo of iRap, AI software built to assist lyric writing in real time. It has been transcribing my words and offers possible rhymes I might want to use: “heath, sheath, underneath”. Could that work? “Make a bacon sandwich, put some cheese underneath,” I sigh. I have fallen short of even my own low standards.</p> <p>iRap is the first product from the music startup <a href=\"https://www.abbeyroad.com/news/abbey-road-red-announces-brainrap-as-the-newest-start-up-to-join-its-incubation-programme-3066\" title=\"\">BrainRap</a>, which aims to combine music with neuroscience. The software uses language-processing algorithms to suggest words or phrases based on cadence, rhyme and meaning. Its creators are an unlikely pair: Micah Brown grew up embedded in south London’s grime scene and was signed to a Sony-affiliated label before moving into tech, while CJ Carr is a metalhead from Boston who has worked on projects that include an algorithmic death metal generator.</p> <p>The pair met at a tech event at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and spent their first few hours embroiled in a breakneck session of beatboxing. Later, inspired by Brown’s experiences seeing rappers struggle to write lyrics and drawing on Carr’s expertise in machine-learning algorithms, they began prototyping what would become iRap. A six-month stint at Abbey Road’s music-technology startup incubator Red helped bring the project to completion.</p> <p>Brown was the first Black founder to have a company in the programme. “There’s Abbey Road’s obvious connection to the Beatles, but I’ve also seen Kano perform there,” he says. “For me as a Black Brit, as a south Londoner who grew up with not very much, being included there was a huge deal.”</p> <p>The iRap software processes lyrical input through several layers of technology. The first, speech-to-text, is relatively simple, although the transcription quality is remarkably accurate. Words are then fed through natural language processing, which classifies parts of speech, sonics and stressed syllables. Then suggestions are created by algorithmic language models that can be trained to give a probability that one word will follow another, as used in the autocomplete feature on smartphones.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If tools like iRap are done well, they’re not crutches. They give you a skill and then you can uninstall the tool and you still have those abilities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Carr’s proprietary algorithms include something he calls Phonetilicious. “It will take a sentence and swap out the nouns, verbs and adjectives to maximise the potential alliteration while keeping the meaning intact,” he says. “So if I were to say ‘big red dog’, it might suggest ‘colossal crimson canine’, which sounds a lot more musical.”</p> <p>But would you really want to say “colossal crimson canine” in a rap? Later, I continue playing with the software at home. When I say “big red dog in the house”, it offers me rhymes such as “mouse”, “grouse” and “slaughterhouse”. Although I feel strangely pushed towards rapping about a farmyard massacre, the rhymes themselves are solid. The synonyms, though, are something else: I am offered “adult redhead goat in the accommodation”, “cosmic coco cow in the compound”, and “monolithic rouge man in the manor”. These alternatives may be pleasant in terms of alliteration and assonance, but they also sound very silly.</p> <p>I test out some lines from established rappers to see what the software makes of them: some Tupac, Future, a bit of a Grandmaster Flash. I rap the first line of the Nas classic NY State of Mind: “Rappers; I monkey flip ’em with the funky rhythm / I be kickin’, musician inflictin’ composition.” In come the rhymes: “suspicion”, “acquisition”, “abolition”. The algorithm offers synonym phrases: “pimps are stuffed pitches and with the coward pacing poussin musical punishment portfolio”; “Homeboys are stuffed hops and with the funke [sic] heartbeat honey jazz severity demographic.”</p> <p>Aside from the fact that these suggestions are weapons-grade nonsense, they also point to known issues of human biases creeping into algorithmic data sets. For one thing, the synonyms I’m offered for “rappers” include “thugs”, “pimps” and “gangbangers”, suggestions that likely reflect the racial biases of the data. It also indicates that the software struggles with colloquial language and, as Brown readily admits, is better at interpreting a standard North American English dialect. That doesn’t bode well for a genre such as hip-hop, which leans heavily into slang. Theoretically, the use of machine learning should mean that, as more people use the software, it will improve at understanding diverse language and accents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b68c2062d86a3896dcca5475f6d6afb6df95da84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68c2062d86a3896dcca5475f6d6afb6df95da84/0_0_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Micah Brown, the co-founder of BrainRap.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Byte your style … Micah Brown, the co-founder of BrainRap.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lesha Brown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Any announcement of new AI music technology comes with inevitable hand-wringing about the future of creativity and whether automated tools are a threat to human artistic expression. <a href=\"https://thebridgevalid.com/\" title=\"\">Br!dge</a>, a British-Jamaican musician who helped test the software, doesn’t see it that way. “A few years ago we might have been having this same conversation about making music on a computer or using a sampler,” he says. Instead, musicians used those tools to create exciting new sounds that had never existed before. Carr thinks AI composition tools will be commonplace in the future. “They’ll be a simple part of the music-production studio,” he says, “just like a synthesiser.”</p> <p>I still wonder, though, whether professional rappers, who pride themselves on their lyrical dexterity, will welcome this algorithmic intervention into their creative process. Br!dge is also unsure. “If the target market was rappers I think they’d be apprehensive, because the whole point of being a lyricist is to have your own independent thought and mind,” he says. “I probably wouldn’t use iRap for my own artistry because I consider myself independent, a purist, someone who takes pride in conceiving my own lyrics.”</p> <p>In that case, who is iRap actually for? As well as recording his own songs, Br!dge also writes lyrics for other musicians. He thinks that jobbing songwriters in the commercial music world could benefit greatly from the software. “There are times when you’re trying to just get something going, and quickly get your first few lines,” he says. “The song’s not necessarily personal to you, so it just helps you churn out as many high-quality songs as possible for delivery to different labels.” This may seem an unromantic approach, but we’re living at a time when it’s not unusual for a pop hit to have more than 10 credited songwriters. Carr and Brown also suggest another audience: people like me, newbies who want to learn the ropes of timing, rhyming and flow. “If you’re not an expert then you can lose momentum while rapping and get to a dead end,” says Carr. “But you can look at the screen and realise there are four directions you could go in right now. You could say things that sound phonetically similar, talk about related concepts, or just keep up the momentum so you don’t trip over yourself.”</p> <p>The more I test iRap, the more useful I find it to see my words transcribed and have rhymes offered, even if not every suggestion is a viable one. The software feels like stabiliser wheels, helping me to relax and improvise, letting me know I have support if I need it. Carr suggests amateurs could use the software when they’re starting out and then outgrow it. “If tools like iRap are done well, they’re not crutches,” he says. “They give you a skill and then you can uninstall the tool and you still have those abilities.”</p> <p>After spending a few days rapping into my computer, I still think I am unlikely to try performing in public anytime soon. But thanks to the algorithmic training, I am confident that next time I’m put on the spot, I will at least be able to make it to a second line.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2022/aug/23/battle-for-crickets-future-has-already-been-won-but-tests-can-still-retain-their-shine","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Battle for cricket’s future has already been won but Tests can still retain their shine | Jonathan Liew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/23/battle-for-crickets-future-has-already-been-won-but-tests-can-still-retain-their-shine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/23/battle-for-crickets-future-has-already-been-won-but-tests-can-still-retain-their-shine","fields":{"headline":"Battle for cricket’s future has already been won but Tests can still retain their shine","trailText":"The IPL’s £5.2bn deal shows where the game is headed but less international cricket might actually make it feel more special","byline":"Jonathan Liew","body":"<p>So what did you do during the great English Cricket Culture Wars?

English cricket is, after all, a much bigger and less tribal place than it occasionally appears from the cesspits and panic rooms of the internet, where two people with an existing grudge and a migraine can propel an issue to the top of the agenda simply by screaming at each other for a few hours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/99-94-cricket-blog/2022/aug/22/county-cricket-last-group-games-royal-london-cup\">County cricket: it’s all to play for in last group games of Royal London Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even so, you did not have to be online over the past couple of weeks to sense the angst and disquiet that appears to grip English cricket whenever it goes through a period of flux. The new 2023-27 men’s future tours programme has just been published, with virtually no international cricket scheduled between March and June in order to accommodate the Indian Premier League. Two new overseas Twenty20 tournaments have been announced in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/the-hundred\" title=\"\">The Hundred</a> is happening in front of bumper crowds.</p> <p>England’s men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/england-south-africa-first-test-day-three-match-report-cricket\" title=\"\">lost a Test match</a>. Andrew Strauss is about to take a knife to the County Championship. Jimmy Anderson is old.</p> <p>Naturally all this has to mean something and, because the prevailing mood of English cricket fans has always been a kind of pre-emptive nostalgia — a lament for things that still exist — the events of the past few weeks have neatly folded into a wider narrative of sullen resignation, perhaps even betrayal. The world of yesterday is gone. All that remains is bleakness, vulgarity, avarice and David Wiese hitting sixes in a Popchips shirt. Or — depending on your point of view — rebirth, new frontiers, new audiences and David Wiese hitting sixes in a Popchips shirt.</p> <p>At which point it has become fashionable to try to establish some fragile consensus, to point out that actually it is all cricket and we all love cricket and ultimately we all want the same thing. In truth there is an element of wish fulfilment to this. There are fundamentally insoluble visions of the game at odds here: one that demands cricket grow and make money, the other content — with various degrees of delusion — for it to remain the same size and lose money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2d64bc12b1489364b1b4f2295f0b437175d95959\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d64bc12b1489364b1b4f2295f0b437175d95959/0_0_2700_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Oval Invincibles' Sunil Narine celebrates after dismissing Northern Superchargers' David Wiese during a Hundred match at the Oval\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Oval Invincibles' Sunil Narine celebrates after dismissing Northern Superchargers' David Wiese during a Hundred match at the Oval.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Whitley/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What is the compromise? A 13-county franchise tournament over 110‑ball innings? Allowing England’s Test players to play Twenty20, but only on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays? In any case it is increasingly apparent that one vision is winning and one has already lost. In June the latest round of IPL broadcast rights sold for around £5.2bn, which at a generous estimate would be enough to pay the salaries of every county cricketer for roughly the next 200 years. This is game over, basically. There is no answer to that. Cricket is now essentially a satellite of the IPL and its audience. If they want a 12-month rolling global league, that is what they will get. If they want to move the Bob Willis Trophy to Hyderabad, that too is what they will get.</p> <p>And so perhaps it is natural to be fearful for the fate of the oldest format in this rapacious new landscape. Already Trent Boult has stepped back from the New Zealand team in order to prolong his white-ball career.</p> <p>South Africa will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/21/south-africa-england-test-series-lords-first-test\" title=\"\">not play a three-match Test series</a> between January 2023 and September 2026. There is talk of year-round IPL contracts that would force the best players to choose between their franchise and their country.</p> <p>The world of yesterday is gone. Lament, repent. But zoom out a little and the case for alarmism seems harder to make. After all, the FTP contains more international cricket than ever before.</p> <p>Five-match series between India and Australia: this is good. Perhaps some of the best players will end up playing a little less. This is also, in fact, good: a reversal of an exhausting three-decade trend for quantity over quality. Does it really matter if Jasprit Bumrah plays 50 Tests or 100? In a landscape governed by the headrush of the market, this is how international cricket can prosper: not through volume but through scarcity, a treasured prestige product in a world where everything else has begun to taste the same.</p> <p>For all the talk of “context” it is in fact the shortest format that feels largely inconsequential: an endless content stream in which it no longer really matters who wins or loses, where teams are essentially melted down and remade every couple of years. Quick quiz: name a T20 competition that Chris Gayle has won. You might remember him lifting the Bangladesh Premier League with Rangpur Riders in 2017. But it is more likely you are thinking of the two World Cups he won in West Indies maroon.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with feeling a certain wariness about the future, about the tyranny of money, about whether the thing you love might be dying. But this thing really is too good not to endure. Curiously, virtually everyone seems to agree on this point: in a sport where nothing seems to mean anything Test cricket means something; light and shade, system against system. Now, more than ever, is the time to give it a little faith.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/23/from-wakanda-forever-to-dont-worry-darling-the-best-films-to-see-in-autumn-2022","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"From Wakanda Forever to Don’t Worry Darling: the best films to see in autumn 2022","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/23/from-wakanda-forever-to-dont-worry-darling-the-best-films-to-see-in-autumn-2022","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/23/from-wakanda-forever-to-dont-worry-darling-the-best-films-to-see-in-autumn-2022","fields":{"headline":"From Wakanda Forever to Don’t Worry Darling: the best films to see in autumn 2022","trailText":"The Avatar sequel arrives, Michael Flatley’s secret agent struts in, Marvel returns to Black Panther territory – and Harry Styles teams up with Florence Pugh in a horror-thriller","byline":"Peter Bradshaw","body":"<h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/21/three-thousand-years-of-longing-review-tilda-swinton-and-idris-elba-in-mad-max-fairy-overload\">Three Thousand Years of Longing</a></h2> <p>This film’s director, George Miller, called it “the anti-Mad Max”, the precise opposite of his futurist gonzo action classics.

It was abolished in 1807, but the full abolition of slavery did not follow for another generation, until 1833, when the Slavery Abolition Act was introduced.</p> <p>Once slavery itself was abolished, at the expense of the British taxpayer, Britain used <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/680456/FOI2018-00186_-_Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833_-_pdf_for_disclosure_log__003_.pdf\">40% of its national budget</a>, which was £20m – roughly £1.3bn in today’s terms – to buy freedom for all slaves in the empire. Compensation was paid directly to slave owners, and not a penny was handed to the people who had been enslaved.</p> <p>Even then, according to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/eighty-years-late-groundbreaking-work-on-slave-economy-is-finally-published-in-uk\">recently republished</a> 1938 thesis on capitalism and slavery by Eric Williams – then an Oxford University scholar, who would later become the first prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago – the abolition of slavery was fuelled not by Britain’s newly discovered moral conscience but by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/29/slavery-abolition-compensation-when-will-britain-face-up-to-its-crimes-against-humanity\" title=\"\">its economic self-interest</a>.</p> <p>Andrews, who was the UK’s first professor of Black studies, drew parallels between the dehumanisation of Black lives in the slave trade, and the lack of national media coverage around missing Black women.</p> <p>“Slavery is absolutely abhorrent,” Andrews added. “It’s certainly one of the worst atrocities in human history, but because it’s Black people, we don’t want to remember it.</p> <p>“That is directly linked to the lack of care of Black women going missing,” he said, referring to the disappearance of nursing student, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/owami-davies-met-police-pours-huge-resources-into-search-for-missing-nurse\">Owami Davies</a>.</p> <p>The poorer economic and health outcomes of Black communities in Britain was also “directly because of slavery”, Andrews added.</p> <p>Poverty rates for Black Africans and Caribbeans in the UK has largely remained just over 40% for the last 25 years, according to the <a href=\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/data/poverty-rates-ethnicity#:~:text=Poverty%20rates%20for%20the%20Black,for%20the%20last%2025%20years.\">Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a>. A disproportionate number of Black people are in prisons, according to the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf\">Lammy review</a>, and there is evidence of <a href=\"https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/equality-and-diversity-guidance/race-equality-in-medicine/race-inequalities-and-ethnic-disparities-in-healthcare\">structural racism</a> leading to people from minority ethnic backgrounds having poorer health outcomes.</p> <p>“That isn’t an accident,” Andrews said. “That is the legacy of slavery: impoverishment where Black people are more likely to die, more likely to be poorer.</p> <p>“What’s important is repair, so that these inequalities don’t exist,” he said, although he added it was “highly unlikely” any government would ever successfully eradicate them.</p> <p>Slavery Remembrance Day was chosen by <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/days/slave-trade-remembrance-day\">Unesco</a> to annually commemorate the day on which enslaved people successfully revolted against French colonial rule on the island of Saint-Domingue, now Haiti, on 23 August 1791. Considered the most successful slave uprising in history, the revolt was instrumental in the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade.</p> <p>For the playwright and author Bonnie Greer, the UK’s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade was a matter of historical record that “paled” in comparison to a day of remembrance celebrating the agency of self-liberated enslaved people, who risked death and “decided to live” more than 300 years ago, she said.</p> <p>“I remember them as human beings taken to the abyss and doing what few have done: transcend it,” Greer said of the self-liberated enslaved people. “They have given their descendants a key, a complex one that we must keep studying and not be so enraged and so traumatised that we stop digging; stop uncovering; stop bringing to the light of day a very complex part of of the human story.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/23/yes-i-did-leave-the-pub-with-a-strangers-spectacles-no-drink-was-not-involved","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Yes, I did leave the pub with a stranger’s spectacles.

Once she had to phone me to tell me she had my keys.</p> <p>So I just grabbed a pair that looked familiar, went home, and now that I had some glasses, was able to find my original glasses, which I clearly hadn’t left in the pub after all.

This is actually a really good circular economy, I figured: anyone needing any glasses need only go to a pub and ask to see their wares.</p> <p>Having learned nothing, though, I went back a few days later, wearing the sequestered glasses, and it suddenly dawned on me that they must belong to <em>someone, </em>and there was no reason that someone wouldn’t also be back in the pub.

That’s how Chrisie Byrne describes the playground in Walton Hall park. The outlines of missing equipment scar its black rubber flooring. “It’s a huge footprint, with nothing in it, or at least very little in it,” says Byrne.</p> <p>There is a set of swings, a low climbing frame with a slide for small children, and a roundabout. A couple of rocking horse-type contraptions date back to the 1990s, well past their usual lifespan, but local people have begged the council not to remove them. Another climbing frame that was burned by vandals was removed and never replaced.</p> <p>Liverpool is blessed with an abundance of parks but not the money to maintain them. Over the past 10 years, amid plummeting budgets across the board, the council has had to cut its spending on parks by 72%. In 2010 the city had 17 Green Flag-accredited parks: now it has only two.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/02/poorer-children-warned-off-playing-in-shared-spaces-in-london-development\">Social housing tenants warned of ‘play ban’ for children in London site’s shared spaces</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Walton Hall opened to the public in 1934, it had a full-time staff of 25. Now it gets a gang of three men in the summer – two in the winter – two days a week. At least, when they can: they have 15 other parks and cemeteries in Liverpool to look after.</p> <p>That leaves Byrne, and the rest of the volunteers in Friends of Walton Park, the group she chairs, to pick up the slack. Which means picking up the litter, emptying the bins, gardening, cutting back bushes, repainting fences and playground equipment, and any other general maintenance the council can’t manage.</p> <p>And there is more. “The friends groups are becoming active in a different way to what they would have been five years ago,” says Byrne. To cut the cost of plants, they now grow their own from seed in their own community garden: leftovers are sold to other parks and local people at a low price.</p> <p>Two days a week they run a community cafe in the park, with all profits going back to the park’s upkeep. That, in particular, has changed the park from a mere green space to a community hub, bringing together Walton locals, including many who had grown isolated during the pandemic. “The government don’t get the vital work that these volunteers do,” Byrne says.</p> <p>Daniel Barrington, Liverpool city council’s cabinet member for environment and climate change, said the city took pride in its parks, but a 66% overall cut to the authority’s budget was having a serious impact on all its services.</p> <p>“Councils can only do so much with finite and dwindling resources but Liverpool is fortunate to have a long-established and active network of Friends of Parks groups who do brilliant work and we liaise very closely with them to support their activities,” Barrington said.</p> <p>“We’re also counteracting the cuts by being more creative with section 106 funding and have earmarked £5m in the past three years to invest in our green spaces and playgrounds. We’re also looking to secure our parks’ future by strengthening our partnerships with communities and volunteers, alongside new alliances with national stakeholders such as Fields in Trust and Keep Britain Tidy.”</p> <p>But Liverpool is not alone. It is not even the worst-affected area. A Guardian analysis of spending on parks by local authorities in England found that close to three-quarters had reduced their budgets, with deprived areas such as Liverpool the most likely to have cut funding. The result has been the slow decline of parks across the country, particularly in those areas most in need of green space.</p> <p>Twenty-five miles away in Bolton, another most-deprived area, Jane Wilcock, a local GP, began the Friends of Longsight Park in 2014 – the same year Byrne took over Walton Hall’s park in Liverpool. When Bolton council – which has cut its parks budget by 71% over the past 10 years – could not pay for new benches, bins and flower beds, they stumped up the cash themselves. “It varies a bit but we probably put in about £2,000 a year of our own earnings … obviously, we’ve been taxed on that as well,” Wilcock says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9834977638bee144905d3bf02d2562e0eb3a76ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9834977638bee144905d3bf02d2562e0eb3a76ac/0_233_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dog walker beside Bradshaw Brook in Longsight park, Bolton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradshaw Brook in Longsight park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apart from one big repair lobbied for by the friends group, the paths in the park have not been repaired since the 1980s, Wilcock says. They include public rights of way in need of a serious overhaul.</p> <p>Judged alongside the roster of local authorities’ responsibilities, it is easy to see why parks have suffered so badly from cuts. In deprived areas in particular, the needs of adult social care, child services, education and housing leave little spare for taking care of green space. And there is no statutory obligation on councils to even provide parks at all.</p> <p>It’s no surprise then that more than nine in 10 parks managers said they thought parks were disproportionately affected by the squeeze on public sector budgets, according to research by the Association for Public Sector Excellence.</p> <p>The consultancy, which undertakes research on behalf of public bodies, conducts an annual survey of parks staff. It found 72% expected cuts to budgets in the coming five years; 28% expected cuts of 15% or more. Almost half expected cuts to staffing.</p> <p>Cuts have had an inevitable impact on the kinds of services council parks departments can offer. Floral and horticultural displays and general maintenance are the worst-hit areas, with almost three-quarters of respondents expecting to cut these duties even more. Almost nine in 10 said volunteers were now relied on to pick up litter.</p> <p>“If it was not for the volunteers in the parks, we would struggle,” said one parks worker with more than two decades’ experience, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>“A lot of the grounds maintenance has stopped, basically, just because of budgets. You won’t see a lad in the park any more with a pair of secateurs, you will see him with a hedge cutter and they will just take the tops off.</p> <p>“There is no colour in the park, everything is just green, everything is cut with hedge cutters. I can only do one flowerbed a week.”</p> <p>Workforce morale is through the floor. Many parks workers have had to take second jobs as private gardeners to make ends meet. “We were speaking about it and the only reason we come to work now is to pay our bills. There is no passion in the job. Some mornings you wake up thinking ‘groundhog day again’.”</p> <p>Parks in a poor state can affect the mental health of users too. In recent years, studies have shown that being in nature can help manage anxiety and depression. But, says Paul Farmer, the chief executive of the mental health charity Mind: “We don’t all have equal access to green spaces, or to high-quality green spaces … For example, some parks or green spaces may feel unsafe and evoke worries about crime, harassment or abuse, especially if you’ve had bad experiences in the past.”</p> <p>Farmer points to research by <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/904439/Improving_access_to_greenspace_2020_review.pdf\">Public Health England</a> that highlights the importance of access to high-quality green spaces, but also suggests that lower-quality spaces – such as those with poor-quality footpaths, vandalism or litter – may have a negative effect on health. “It’s really important that we all feel safe and able to access [high quality] outdoor spaces, if and when we choose to,” he says.</p> <p>Byrne has a lot of complaints about Liverpool city council, but mostly she is just glad to have a park at all: she was part of a group that saw off plans by Liverpool council to build homes on Walton Park, and has since been instrumental in a campaign that persuaded Liverpool to become the first local authority in the country to guarantee all its green spaces for ever. More than 100 parks in the city – covering 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) – will be secured in perpetuity in collaboration with the charity Fields in Trust.</p> <p>Now it just has to find the money to maintain them. On this point, Byrne, Wilcock and parks volunteers across the country are united: parks must be made a mandatory service for councils. Until then, it will be up to the friends groups to fill the gap.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2022/aug/23/justice-should-be-colour-blind-so-why-is-it-served-for-ukraine-but-not-the-congolese","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Justice should be colour blind.

But Tory governments since 2010 have had devastating consequences and decimated communities that rely on them.</p> <p>“It is shameful that these community assets have been left to ruin by the government and local people should suffer their loss. The government cannot level up the country while it continues to strip these assets out of communities.”</p> <p>The Guardian’s analysis found that almost 25% less in real terms was spent on parks across in England last year than in 2010, with close to three-quarters of local authorities spending less on parks and open spaces. In total, adjusting for inflation, £327m was taken from parks budgets across the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/park_spending-zip/giv-6562GmLBmLVcrZPQ/\" data-alt=\"Graph showing spending on parks and open spaces in England since 2008-09\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/park_spending-zip/giv-6562GmLBmLVcrZPQ/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Areas that were already worse off suffered the most: 58% of councils in the most affluent fifth of the country cut their spending, compared with 87% of the country’s most deprived councils.</p> <p>The most dramatic cut to spending was in Sunderland, which is among the top 20% most deprived areas. Between 2010-11 and 2020-21, the most recent year for which figures were available, Sunderland appears to have cut its spending on parks by 92%, from £11.2m to just £895,000.</p> <p>Sunderland council disputed the figures, saying that public health and street cleaning departments were also helping with parks “to maintain high-quality services”, and that as a result expenditure was coded to different lines.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the council said: “Whilst there is a reduction over the period of 2010 to 2020, this is from £11.4m to £10.8m, so is a much lower proportionate reduction in cash terms than the figures you identified.”</p> <p>The scale of the cuts dwarfs the £39m promised as part of the government’s levelling up agenda to go towards the development of new green spaces in areas deemed to be most in need. This month 85 councils were chosen to “opt in” to a £9m fund, with potential payments of up to £85,000 – a drop in the ocean compared with the funding cuts over the past decade.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/23/parks-at-risk-if-it-was-not-for-the-volunteers-we-would-struggle\">Park staff representatives and volunteers</a> described a situation across the country of gradual decline, with cracked and broken paths left unrepaired, vandalised park benches removed and not replaced, dead trees and animals left to rot, gaps in playgrounds where swings once stood, and volunteers increasingly forced to take on work previously done by paid staff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/archive-zip/giv-6562FEATvBFwF8sh/\" data-alt=\"Percentage of councils that cut spending on parks between 2010-11 to 2020-21 by deprivation\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/archive-zip/giv-6562FEATvBFwF8sh/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“It looks like continual, gradual decrease in the quality of many of our parks and open spaces – and so many of our really important parks and open spaces,” said Paul Rabbitts, the chair of the Parks Management Association, a representative body for parks professionals. “You wander around most of your public parks: potholes in footpaths. When was the last time the fence was painted? When was the last time the play area was upgraded?”</p> <p>Parks in the north-east and the north-west were particularly struggling, said Rabbitts, who travels the country visiting parks as a Green Flag awards judge, as well as working as a local authority head of parks.</p> <p>This was reflected in the Guardian’s findings. In the north-east, beyond Sunderland, Newcastle and Middlesbrough had slashed nominal park budgets by 60%, South Tyneside’s parks budget was cut by 76% and Hartlepool’s by 43%. In the north-west, Liverpool had cut 72% of its park budgets, Bolton 71%, and Blackpool 68%.</p> <p>Allison Ogden-Newton, the chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy, which oversees the Green Flag Awards in England, said growth of the scheme was currently more marked in some regions, such as London and the south-east, than others.</p> <p>“In addition, over the last 10 years we have seen some local authorities reduce the number of sites they submit for the Green Flag award and we are concerned that this links directly to a reduction in budgets in those areas,” Ogden-Newton said. “In some cases, where local authorities that have suffered the highest reduction in council budgets, we have seen a corresponding fall in the number of parks they are able to submit for an award.”</p> <p>Clive Betts, the Labour MP for Sheffield South East, who chairs the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) select committee in the Commons, said the worst impact of the cuts would fall on the poorest, “because very often, if you’re more affluent, you’ll probably live near the countryside [and] you can get in your car and go there.”</p> <p>He said: “Parks have just been so important and if they aren’t there, or they’re in a state where they can’t be enjoyed, then it’s a major disadvantage talking to people in the inner-city areas in particular, who would previously have enjoyed them.”</p> <p>Last month MPs on the DLUHC committee heard there had been a resurgence of interest in local parks since the Covid-19 pandemic, when many other public amenities were closed.</p> <p>The session aimed to find out what developments there had been over the past five years, since a major inquiry by the committee found parks were at a “tipping point” and facing potentially severe decline. Experts appearing before the committee warned that funding – and specifically the £39m promised as part of levelling up – was “wholly inadequate” to maintain green spaces.</p> <p>Ellie Robinson, the head of urban green spaces at the National Trust, said a more realistic investment needed to “level up access to green space” was £5.5bn over 10 years. “That would have created physical health and mental wellbeing benefits of £200bn,” Robinson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/archive-zip/giv-6562QhKiMnvG0LCz/\" data-alt=\"Difference in spending on parks, 2010-11 to 2020-21\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2022/08/archive-zip/giv-6562QhKiMnvG0LCz/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The Guardian’s analysis was based on open spaces spending from local authority revenue outturn data published by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.</p> <p>It charted a decade’s spending by local authorities on parks and open spaces (also including, according to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/general-fund-revenue-account-outturn/general-fund-revenue-account-outturn-specific-guidance-notes#ro5-cultural-environmental-regulatory-and-planning-services\">DLUHC guidance</a>, play areas, nature corners and playing fields), assessed them on a rolling three-year average and cross-referenced the figures with indices of deprivation.</p> <p>Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the chair of the culture, tourism and sport board at the Local Government Association, the representative body for councils, said: “Parks and green spaces are vital for supporting our carbon reduction targets and enabling access to nature, but also play a key role in maintaining the physical and mental wellbeing of communities across the country.</p> <p>“Inflation, energy costs and projected increases to the national living wage will add £2.4bn in extra cost pressures on to council budgets this year alone, rising to £3.6bn in 2024-25.

This new book, she is at pains to point out, is in a different register. She is no longer suicidal. In the intervening years she has published novels, written screenplays and directed a movie; still readers who know her only through the first memoir treat her delicately. “Which feels confusing. Can you still be gentle with me if you know my struggles are merely domestic now?”</p> <p>On the surface, <em>Busy Being Free</em> is about the end of her marriage to actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ben-mendelsohn\">Ben Mendelsohn</a>, and the tectonic lifestyle shift involved in moving from their LA mansion to an attic flat in north London, then solo parenting her young daughter through a pandemic. But it’s about a great deal more than that. Forrest is examining, with an unflinching eye and a formidable cultural frame of reference (the title comes from Joni Mitchell’s song Cactus Tree), what it means for a woman to find herself alone in her 40s and to redefine herself outside a context of marriage, motherhood and men.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She does not attempt to extrapolate universal meanings or turn her hard-won insights into lessons for other women</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the aftermath of her break-up, Forrest embraces a voluntary period of celibacy, which she blames on the election of Trump. “Having to look at Donald Trump did not make me want to fuck,” she says, speaking for every woman alive (including, I suspect, Melania). But it becomes clear as the book progresses that Trump is a convenient peg on which to hang this retreat from intimacy. “I took a vow of celibacy for the term of Trump’s presidency. It seemed like a good idea for someone whose life had been guided, thus far, by romantic obsession.”</p> <p>Early in her new London life, another mother looks around her tiny flat and asks, “How did this happen to you?” Forrest’s patchwork approach to the narrative is a way of giving this question a fuller answer. Moving between past and present, from childhood memories to her honeymoon, from conversations with her daughter to the raging rows of a dying marriage and a newly forged sexual confidence, she gradually builds a picture of the ways in which her romantic impulses have shaped her trajectory. It’s a beguiling form of storytelling, because it’s unpredictable, and it allows her to circle around the catalyst for the ending of her marriage, which only comes into focus late in the book.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/13/young-man-rebooted-sex-life-dating-app\">‘Why did this young man have such a hold on me?’ How dating someone half my age rebooted my sex life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In one chapter she reflects on her worst sexual experiences, including several from her time as a precociously talented 16-year-old thrust into the adult world of newspaper journalism that would certainly qualify for #MeToo revision. “When I was a teenager, one man who – and I use my words very carefully here – <em>had sex with me</em> is now dead, and I know him to have been a very bad man, despite what the obituaries said.” But she goes on to say: “The interesting part is that I voluntarily kept seeing him for a few weeks.” One of Forrest’s greatest gifts as a writer – apart from her humour; like its predecessor, <em>Busy Being Free</em> is frequently hilarious – is her instinct for ambiguity. She writes so well about messy lives because she understands the contradictions we are all prone to, though I wonder if there is a generational aspect to this; it’s possible that younger women may not be as relaxed about, say, the blurring of professional and sexual relationships that Forrest regards as largely positive.</p> <p>To describe a memoir as solipsistic may seem redundant, but <em>Busy Being Free</em> is solipsistic in the best way: that is to say, Forrest is hyper-aware that she is telling her own story. She does not attempt to extrapolate universal meanings or turn her hard-won insights into lessons for other women in similar situations, as many such books often do. “Getting to middle age has been a process of learning, knowing, believing,” she writes. “Now what? Having finished that painstaking excavation, what do you use the next half of your life for?”</p> <p>She doesn’t offer easy answers; there are none. The choices she makes for herself will no doubt appal some women and inspire others. But the fact that she has written about this midlife excavation with such ferocity and frankness is cause for celebration.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Busy Being Free</em> by Emma Forrest is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (£18.99).

The passage I chose was from The Dare Game, the second Tracy Beaker book. I remember standing in front of my whole school, the purple book in my hands, pigtails bobbing in my peripheral vision. When I was done and I sat down, my body ringing with the applause, my dream was born. Clearly, I was destined for stardom on the stage. </p> <p>I nursed this dream for another 14 years. I acted in school plays. I was, for my sins, a prolific sketch comedian at university. I performed in the upstairs rooms of pubs and in student theatres all over the country. I remember being backstage in Durham and wondering whether I had time to throw up from nerves in a bucket I’d spotted in the wings, still thinking: this is the life. I am sorry to say that there are, somewhere, a handful of short films that I starred in during my early 20s: kissing people and crying and, God help me, pretending to smoke a joint.</p> <p>After university, I auditioned for master’s programmes at all the big drama schools. I committed myself to the idea of taking out an additional student loan to do so, I worked in a pub in the evenings and practised my monologues in front of the mirror during the day. I failed to get into any of them.</p> <p>Still, I was determined to pursue my dream. There’s some famous advice in acting circles: if you can imagine yourself doing anything else with your life, you won’t make it as an actor. I took it to heart: I had to persevere. So I did it all again the following year, and once again, I did not get in anywhere. I remember getting the last rejection email I was waiting for, standing in the musty cellar of the pub where I was working. I blushed right up to my hairline and burst into tears. The fact that a self-conscious, physically awkward, depressed girl didn’t nail her drama school auditions does not come as a surprise to me now, but at the time I was blindsided. A dream is supposed to come true.</p> <p>I kept going for a while. I got an agent, went to a few miserable auditions. But six months later, my self-esteem at rock bottom, I felt that I had reached a fork in the road. I could keep going, keep trying. Or I could admit to myself that this dream was over. What I ended up being more afraid of wasn’t the embarrassment (in front of whom?) of not achieving what I had wanted to achieve, but sinking more and more time and emotional energy into trudging down a path that was throwing obstacles in my way at every turn. And so, I gave up my dream. There was grief in it, but mostly I felt relieved.</p> <p>I learned a phrase recently from a book called When I Grow Up<em> </em>by Moya Sarner. Talking about her insecurity around the fact that many of her friends were getting married or having children in their early 30s, she came to realise that this envy was “not a real kind of wanting”. Giving up on a dream can also mean discovering that a want you had was not a real kind of wanting: in other words, that the desire came from an unexamined place.</p> <p>Why did I even want to be an actor? It was a question I hadn’t thought to ask myself; the dream had calcified in my bones too long ago. Childish reasons, in my case. Excitement, praise – hunger for fame, even. I know now that the life of an actor would suit me very badly. I would hate the enforced downtime, the unsociable hours, having to worry about my weight and appearance, the relentless rejection, the financial uncertainty. Some of these things are part of my life as a writer but, at the very least, when people read my work, I am somewhere else.</p> <p>I’m a big advocate of giving up on dreams. Taking away a fundamental lens through which you see yourself – in my case, embarrassingly, believing I was some kind of star waiting to be born – makes you have to reconsider who you actually are. And a dream is by its nature a static, stubborn thing that is ill-suited to the ruthless way things have of changing. Life forces us to give up on dreams all the time. People die, jobs are lost, relationships end, the things that brought you joy go on to bring you sorrow. Being able to let things go is a skill that not everybody is born with, and I certainly was not. But I think it’s a good muscle to train.</p> <p>There’s a fine line, obviously. To succeed in any career you need tenacity, self-belief and drive. But there is a point beyond which putting that energy in no longer serves you. Failure and its merits have been in vogue for a little while; Elizabeth Day’s hit podcast <a href=\"https://www.elizabethdayonline.co.uk/podcast\">How to Fail</a> has had hundreds of guests on it by now. I think even more important than failing, though, is the ability to start failing and say: I could continue to try this, but I could also not. And having the confidence to do the latter.</p> <p>Do I miss acting? Sometimes. The adrenaline was fun. But there are better ways to get that fix. I have new dreams now. I daresay many of them will also need to be laid to rest, or will die of natural causes. And when they do, I’ll grieve them, and then get on with other things.</p> <ul> <li><p>Imogen West-Knights is a writer and journalist based in London</p></li> <li><p>Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

He’s right: the car park is rammed and the entrance to the site is unusually crowded. Tourists with backpacks sit on picnic benches eating cake from the cafe, while a dad reads aloud the noticeboards to his small children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2022-08-22T15:50:28.html\" data-alt=\"Hadrians map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/aug/2022-08-22T15:50:28.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>This buzz is, in part, probably due to it being an exceptionally sunny day during the school holidays. But there’s another factor: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/28/hadrians-wall-fort-rebuilt-in-wild-colour\">Housesteads has a new, temporary art installation</a>, part of a year-long series of events celebrating 1,900 years since <a href=\"https://hadrianswallcountry.co.uk/\">building on Hadrian’s Wall began in AD122</a>, under the instruction of the emperor Hadrian.</p> <p>Designed by artist Morag Myerscough with help from the local community, the artwork – called The Future Belongs to What Was As Much As What Is – consists of a colourful, fortress-like structure made from scaffolding. At about 16 metres high and 9 metres wide, it’s large enough to be seen from the B-road running parallel to the wall, and reimagines the northern gatehouse of this fort, built directly on top of its remains.</p> <p>A trip to Housesteads was a family favourite throughout my childhood. Back then, mum and dad would pack my two brothers and me into the car – sometimes with a couple of other chaotic children in tow – and drive us out to one of the forts along the 73-mile wall, stretching from Wallsend to Bowness-on-Solway, once the north-west frontier of the Roman empire, in the hope of providing us with some entertainment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7c868330b4ea7355e80226d8cd786c174e50a4d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c868330b4ea7355e80226d8cd786c174e50a4d6/0_105_2400_1441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Flashy placards, carrying mostly optimistic phrases’ … Morag Myerscough’s fort.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Flashy placards, carrying mostly optimistic phrases’ … Morag Myerscough’s fort.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Ison/English Heritage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Housesteads is often cited as an example of the standard “playing card” plan of a Roman auxiliary fort, its rectangular shape served us with a different – and, in our eyes, far better – purpose. It acted as the perfect perimeter for playing hide and seek. Other forts worth visiting, where I’ve also collected memories to make me smile, include Birdoswald, Chesters and, just down the road, Vindolanda, home to the Vindolanda tablets, some of the oldest handwritten documents in Britain.</p> <p>Today, my parents and I take the familiar half-mile path to Housesteads, following the natural dip in the land, before a steep ascent to the ticket desk and museum. Just to the south of the fort, near the path leading to its entrance, there are the remains of the <em>vicus</em>, the town where the soldiers’ families lived and worked.</p> <p>Along the way, Myerscough’s structure bobs in and out of view. Her artwork is arresting, adding a welcome flamboyance to what is often a desolate, grey landscape. The construction also highlights – quite literally, as fluorescent paint coats the exterior – the Romans’ use of colour. For the buildings of ancient Rome were not finished as the gleaming white marble remains we see today, but were brightly painted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Among the site’s highlights are the latrines – some of the finest toilets in Roman Britain</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Housesteads is exposed to the elements, so many of my childhood memories consist of being lashed by the wind and rain. Mum would often harness this dire weather as a way of getting us to consider the harsh conditions faced by the Roman army who built the wall from stone and turf, while likely living in leather tents. This bitter climate is evident, too, in the lifespan of Myerscough’s installation: the plan is for it to stay up until the end of October, but only if the weather allows it.</p> <p>Inside the fort, the installation seems to have injected a garish energy that I’ve not encountered here before. Children play among the remains in the sunshine, tourists take photographs, and a National Trust volunteer carries out a guided tour. Among the site’s highlights are the latrines – some of the finest toilets in Roman Britain; the granary, where the still-visible stone pillars once supported a raised floor to help keep food dry; and the luxurious house of the commanding officer, complete with the remnants of a hypocaust – the Romans’ version of central heating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6874c4918ba4d8ef53cdeaa400f1473b55f254fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6874c4918ba4d8ef53cdeaa400f1473b55f254fb/777_0_3862_2318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sycamore Gap, a famous landmark not far from Housesteads Fort.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sycamore Gap, a famous landmark not far from Housesteads Fort.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hanging from Myerscough’s installation are flashy placards carrying mostly optimistic phrases – I’m drawn to “floodgates of love”, “family” and “everybody’s welcome” – many painted by communities living near the wall, including quotes from local poet Ellen Moran. From one of its two balconies I look across the sprawling wilderness: the installation reveals views possibly last seen by the soldiers on duty 1,600 years ago, when the fort was abandoned as the Roman empire began to crumble.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/oct/15/a-great-walk-to-a-great-pub-the-wallace-arms-rowfoot-north-pennines\">A great walk to a great pub: The Wallace Arms, Rowfoot, North Pennines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The scenery is bleak, but weirdly stunning: soothing swathes of woodland and dry-stone walls – many of them built using stones from Hadrian’s Wall – and the odd sheepfold among the fields. Those wanting to explore it more can also do <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hadrians-wall-and-housesteads-fort/trails/housesteads-to-steel-rigg-circular-walk\">an 8-mile loop</a> from Housesteads down to Sycamore Gap, a striking tree sitting in a dramatic dip of land, and an attraction in its own right since its appearance in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. From here, the path goes via the prominent remains of Milecastle 39 (or Castle Nick), before looping around to give views across Crag Lough and Whin Sill, an imposing, volcanic formation of layered rock, with Hadrian’s Wall running along the top.</p> <p>“I know it’s totally out of context, but it’s great isn’t it?” says volunteer guide Steve, as we stand beside the north gate after his tour, watching excited children run in and out of the installation. “Younger generations can go in there and have a look at things, muck about. I think the only sad thing from their point of view is that they’re not allowed to climb the scaffolding and go up to the top!”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The fort acted as the perfect perimeter for playing hide and seek</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Our day ends with an obligatory visit to the cafe near the entrance, where we join those on the picnic benches outside, chatting about what we’ve just seen. Indeed, Myerscough’s artwork has ignited the imaginations of visitors to this fort. While the installation is wonderfully joyous – much needed in these times and in this landscape – it’s also practical, giving a real sense of the scale of the original gatehouse. It’s a colourful reminder of this brutally exposed edge to Rome’s once-vast empire.</p> <h2>Five more events celebrating Hadrian’s Wall’s 1,900th anniversary</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04522b447548256ac66bbcdb6120372936fa483a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04522b447548256ac66bbcdb6120372936fa483a/0_199_5130_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milecastle 39 with Crag Lough Highshield Crags and Hotbanks Crags beyond.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milecastle 39 with Crag Lough Highshield Crags and Hotbanks Crags beyond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clearview/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/whats-on/chesters-roman-fort-night-attack-27---28-aug-2022/\">Night Attack at Chesters Roman Fort</a></strong><strong><br></strong>A night-time re-enactment of an attack from communities living north of the wall, with actors dressed in Roman army regalia. <br><em>27-28 August</em><em>,<a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/whats-on/chesters-roman-fort-night-attack-27---28-aug-2022/\"> english-heritage.org.uk</a></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/whats-on/birdoswald-roman-fort-capulta-27-29-aug-2022/\">Catapulta! at Birdoswald Roman Fort</a></strong><strong><br></strong>Another re-enactment, this time of Roman soldiers competing in an artillery competition, with the crowd encouraged to cheer on their favourite.<br><em>27-29 August</em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://1900.hadrianswallcountry.co.uk/events/wall-%e2%9d%a4%ef%b8%8f-the-wall/\">W’all Love </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://1900.hadrianswallcountry.co.uk/events/wall-%e2%9d%a4%ef%b8%8f-the-wall/\">the Wall</a>, Tyne Theatre &amp;

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committee she chaired proposed that there should be improved guidance on cutting energy usage, better access to existing education and incentive schemes, and clearer messaging on money-saving ideas such as turning off radiators in unused rooms, reducing pressure to hot water taps and reducing radiator settings on gas boilers to between 55C and 65C to optimise energy output.</p> <p>The committee also suggested stronger public messaging on the advantage of smart meters and pressure on energy companies to bring forward smart tariffs. Leadsom said on Monday there was a “really strong case” for these measures.</p> <p>However, politicians can be sensitive about public perceptions of asking people to use less energy. Some energy bosses have been pilloried for giving tips on keeping warm, such as putting on jumpers, doing star jumps, cuddling pets or eating porridge.</p> <p>In the EU, Brussels is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/how-does-the-eu-plan-to-cut-gas-usage-by-15-this-winter\">urging governments</a> to launch campaigns to encourage people to switch off lights and turn down thermostats and air conditioning.</p> <p>Industrial users may also be given targets to reduce heating and cooling. EU governments are being urged to speed up the switch to renewable energy, but are also asked to consider delaying their exit from nuclear power or coal – an effort to find any alternative to Russian gas.</p> <p>The government insists that power cuts and energy shortages are extremely unlikely. However, Adam Bell, a former policy senior official at BEIS, told the BBC’s PM programme he thought there was about a one-in-10 chance of seeing limited, planned blackouts in certain parts of the country over the winter.</p> <p>He also said: “The right thing to do now is to get used to lowering our demand so we can eliminate that chance as much as we can.”</p> <p>Bell said there were stages that could be gone through, including switching some industry off, then export pipelines and then homes. “But because we might be in that situation, there’s a lot households should be thinking about now, to help minimise the likelihood … like turning down your thermostat by one degree and optimising the flow temperature in your boiler as well as draught-proofing where you can.”</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “Households, businesses and industry can be confident that the UK’s secure and diverse energy supplies will provide the electricity and gas they need.</p> <p>“Decisions on energy consumption rightly remain a matter for individuals and we recognise households will have different energy usage needs.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Contact%20Guardian%20Politics&amp;description=%3Cli%3ECreate%20a%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fprotonmail.com%2F%22%3EProtonMail%3C%2Fa%3E%20account%20and%20email%20us%20at%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Aguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%22%3Eguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%3C%2Fa%3E%3B%20or%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3EUse%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.org%2Fen%2F%22%3ESignal%20Messenger%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447824537227%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207824%20537227.%3C%2Fli%3E%20%0A%3Cli%3EFor%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%3C%2Fli%3E&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Contact the team securely: create a Protonmail account and email us at guardian.politics.desk@protonmail.com;

It never came.”</p> <p>Priola commended “brave and honorable” Republicans who stood against Trump after the Capitol attack, including the Utah senator Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney, the Wyoming congresswoman who last week lost her primary after taking a leading role on the House January 6 committee.</p> <p>“Fear-mongering to raise money or motivate voters is nothing new,” Priola wrote, “but it has been taken to a dangerous and destabilising level.</p> <p>“I cannot continue to be part of a political party that is OK with a violent attempt to overturn a free and fair election and continues to peddle claims that the 2020 election was stolen.”</p> <p>Priola said he became a Republican thanks to the examples of Richard Nixon – the only president to resign in disgrace – and Ronald Reagan, but would now caucus with Democrats despite not sharing many of their positions.</p> <p>“Our affiliations have become too tribal,” he wrote. “I’ve always been an independent thinker and … I don’t plan to change that. I do not believe either party has a monopoly on the truth.</p> <p>“For instance, my pro-life position, school choice [support] and pro-second amendment stance often run counter to the Democratic party platform.”</p> <p>But, he said, looking towards November elections in which Republicans on the national stage will seek to take back Congress, “we are in the midst of an election that will determine which party controls the [Colorado] senate chamber.</p> <p>“Even if there continue to be issues that I disagree with the Democratic party on, there is too much at stake right now for Republicans to be in charge.”</p> <p>Saying he had decided to “align with truth over conspiracy”, Priola concluded: “We need Democrats in charge because our planet and our democracy depend on it.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/23/japan-pm-fumio-kishida-popularity-dives-unification-church","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T05:53:51Z","webTitle":"Japan PM’s popularity dives over party links to Unification church","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/23/japan-pm-fumio-kishida-popularity-dives-unification-church","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/23/japan-pm-fumio-kishida-popularity-dives-unification-church","fields":{"headline":"Japan PM’s popularity dives over party links to Unification church","trailText":"Church has been in the spotlight since the shooting of Abe Shinzo, but Fumio Kishida insists no relationship exists between the LDP and the group","byline":"Justin McCurry in Tokyo","body":"<p>Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has urged senior members of his party to sever their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/revelations-shinzo-abe-death-unification-church-moonies-political-influence-japan\">ties with a controversial religious group</a> after his approval ratings nosedived to their lowest level since he took office last year.</p> <p>Kishida and his Liberal Democratic party (LDP) have been rocked by revelations that dozens of party members have connections to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/12/shinzo-abe-shooting-suspects-motive-casts-spotlight-on-moonies-links-to-politicians\">Unification church</a>.

On Saturday, Darya Dugina, the daughter of the ultranationalist Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin, was killed by a car bomb in Moscow. Yesterday, Vladimir Putin called it a “vile, cruel crime”, and Moscow said that Ukraine was responsible. But that description tells only a small part of the story of an attack in the Russian capital that is unprecedented in the six months since the war began.</p> <p>There are many unresolved questions about the killing – and the military consequences that could flow from it. Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth, is about some of the possible answers. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Environment</strong></em> | The Tory leadership frontrunner, Liz Truss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/22/liz-truss-environment-agency-cuts-sewage-water-pollution\">was responsible for cutting millions of pounds in funding</a> earmarked for tackling water pollution during her time as environment secretary, the Guardian revealed.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Crime</strong></em> | A nine-year-old girl <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/23/girl-9-dies-and-two-adults-wounded-in-liverpool-shooting\">has been shot dead in Liverpool</a> and two other people taken to hospital with gunshot injuries.

He and his daughter Darya Dugina left, apparently in different vehicles. About five minutes after Dugina left, the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving was blown up by a car bomb. Footage circulated on social media appeared to show Dugin standing next to the wreckage in a state of distress.</p> <p>Reports in the Russian media on Monday claimed that an untraceable telephone may have been used to remotely detonate the device after it left a garage where CCTV had been switched off. They also claimed that the perpetrators may have been following the car when it blew up.</p> <p>It’s hard to assess some of these claims with any certainty, Andrew said. Russian authorities have given limited evidence to back up their version of events, “but that doesn’t discount it”. But we can say with confidence that Dugina died in an attack which may have been aimed at her father – and it appears to have been carefully planned.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Who was Darya Dugina, and who is her father, Alexander Dugin?</p> <p>“Most analysts who heard the news immediately thought it was Alexander who had been targeted,” Andrew said. Dugin exults in the nickname “Putin’s Brain”; but while some people in Putin’s circle have read Dugin’s work, it is less clear that he has the kind of sway on the Russian leader that would justify that title.</p> <p>“He’s the kind of person you see on these gladiatorial screamathons you get on pro-Kremlin TV,” Andrew said. “But it’s important to understand that people like Dugin don’t make the final decisions – they’re just one pressure group in a complicated country.” As a rough comparison, think of some of the talking heads with tenuous links to the Trump administration who turn up on Fox News.</p> <p>Dugin’s politics are extreme: he is an ultranationalist who advocates for a new Russian empire. At the same time, Andrew said, he is “a political opportunist – I remember him requesting €500 to give interviews”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1263e26d76a207dba2cb6e350e0cd5baed56cd36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1263e26d76a207dba2cb6e350e0cd5baed56cd36/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin at a ‘Battle for Donbas’ rally in Moscow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin at a ‘Battle for Donbas’ rally in Moscow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moscow City News Agency/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“This is not the same as an attack killing a member of a Kremlin official’s family,” he said. “In those terms, he’s small fry. But he has an outsize profile.” That profile suggests another important feature of the attack: “He doesn’t have the security detail you would associate with somebody at the Kremlin. He’s a softer target.”</p> <p>Dugina, meanwhile, was the editor of a disinformation website, United World International, and a TV pundit. Her politics were “close to a continuation of her father’s approach, but she was a little slicker,” Andrew said. She was also less prominent: “People in Moscow know who he is. You didn’t have to know who she was unless you were following this stuff closely.” Nonetheless, her pro-war rhetoric had earned her a place on UK and US sanctions lists, and it is not impossible she was targeted herself.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Who does Russia say was responsible?</p> <p>One of the key questions in the aftermath of the attack was whether Russia would “frame it as terrorism or sweep it under the rug”, Andrew said; on Monday, the Federal Security Service (FSB) provided an answer. It accused Ukrainian intelligence services of carrying out the killing, and said the suspect was a Ukrainian woman in Russia with her 12-year-old daughter since July. The suspect had attended the festival, and fled to Estonia in a Mini Cooper after the bomb went off.</p> <p>The FSB’s version of events appears to suggest that it was Dugina and not Dugin who was the target. Ukraine has denied responsibility for the attack, with one official noting: “Not many people here have heard of him, and nobody had heard of his daughter.”</p> <p>The FSB has provided little evidence for its claims beyond footage of the woman driving across the border in and out of Russia. As Shaun Walker argues in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/22/russian-security-service-fsb-claim-to-have-identified-killer-of-darya-dugina-lacks-credibility\">this excellent analysis</a> of the claimed chronology, there are plenty of reasons for scepticism. He noted how quickly the agency put its case together, and how remarkable it would be for a Ukrainian assassin with a child in tow to navigate Russia with impunity. “If true, it is a shocking FSB failure and, if false, it is a strangely self-incriminating tale to invent,” he wrote.</p> <p>At the same time, Shaun notes, it is possible to see a motive to carrying out the attack from Kyiv. If so, it marks a departure from Ukraine’s strategy of retaliation within Russia, which has been confined to military and logistical assets near the border, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/20/world/europe/ukraine-attacks-putin-war.html\">a string of attacks in Crimea</a>, the Black Sea territory annexed by Russia in 2014.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Is that the only possible explanation?</p> <p>No. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxseddon/status/1561405112295165957\">One claim</a> is that the attack was carried out by an underground opposition movement within Russia – “but I’m sceptical of that”, Andrew said. “From what we know the internal opposition haven’t done anything like this before. It would be a huge step up.”</p> <p>There’s also the theory of a false flag attack carried out by elements close to the Kremlin as a pretext for retaliation. “There is no reason to do that if you want to intensify attacks on Ukraine or crack down on the opposition,” Andrew said. ”The Kremlin doesn’t need a pretext to do that – it does whatever it wants.” If so, the significant downside of spreading panic among Kremlin outriders doesn’t seem worthwhile.</p> <p>Finally, some have floated the possibility that the killing was simply a crime tied to a business dispute involving Dugin or Dugina. But that doesn’t appear to align with the sophistication of the attack, even if the FSB’s claims should be taken with a grain of salt.</p> <p>***</p> <p>What are the likely consequences of the attack?</p> <p>“This is unprecedented here,” Andrew said. “And there are already people writing that this is not the last act of terror we’re going to see. It will have scared people in Dugin’s circles. Until now, they have been able to agitate for war without thinking it would come for them.”</p> <p>The larger question is whether claims of Ukrainian responsibility will lead to a Russian escalation. “It could set the stage for a new wave of political violence,” Andrew said, against so-called “decision making centres” and specific Ukrainian officials. But if more general attacks on Kyiv increase, it’s worth bearing in mind that such an escalation was already expected to coincide with Ukraine’s independence day on Wednesday.</p> <p>Regardless, for the most belligerent voices in Russia – voices aligned with Dugin’s – the death of his daughter will be viewed as evidence for the strategy they already espoused. “Many of those who’ve been agitating for a more aggressive approach are demanding a response now,” Andrew said. “They want total war.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p>Zoe Williams’s interview with Mick Lynch is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/23/mick-lynch-rmt-work-dignity-union-power\">great primer on the RMT leader</a> who has become something of a folk hero during Britain’s summer of strikes. <strong>Hannah J Davies, deputy editor, newsletters</strong></p></li> <li><p>With the <strong>Tory leadership contest</strong> apparently all but over, you might expect Rishi Sunak’s supporters to stop attacking Liz Truss.

The “Enough is Enough” rally saw thousands of uniformed Destiny Church members, almost entirely men, march through central Wellington protesting against civil unions, an arrangement granting same-sex couples the same rights as if they were married.</p> <p>The protest left a scar on Wellington’s collective consciousness. LGBTQI+ people were abused on the street. Georgina Beyer, an MP in the governing Labour party and the world’s first transgender MP, made her way to parliament’s forecourt to confront the protesters and “stare them in the eye”. Kiri Allan, now a minister in the Labour government but at the time a law student at the neighbouring Victoria University, went out to confront the protesters too (with a righteous assist in the form of a haka from the now Green party MP Teanau Tuiono).</p> <p>On 23 August 2022, as the now Bishop Brian Tamaki’s flock marched on the steps of parliament to hold mock trials, it’s striking to reflect on how comprehensively the Destiny Church leader lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b012bfcda15350576b7c5a331e31ace6276a39a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b012bfcda15350576b7c5a331e31ace6276a39a/0_0_5576_3718/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Tamaki (left) and Brian Tamaki (centre), lead an anti-government march in Wellington on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah Tamaki (left) and Brian Tamaki (centre), lead an anti-government march in Wellington on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynn Grieveson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2013 parliament made same-sex marriage legal, rendering civil unions a short-lived relic. As they did in 2004, women still occupy the three most senior positions of state – governor general (Dame Cindy Kiro), prime minister (Jacinda Ardern), and chief justice (Dame Helen Winkelmann). In 2000, when the bishop had a slot on Sunday morning television, he told his flock that women in power were part of the “<a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3414336/Is-Tamakis-empire-crumbling\">devil’s strategy</a>”. His slot was pulled. He lost. Today, as commentators struggled to pin down precisely what this protest was protesting, it seems reasonable to conclude that the prime minister’s gender animates a significant number of her haters. At least one protester was carrying a sign reading “ditch the bitch”.</p> <p>It’s this incoherence that marks the protest out as, well, a little pathetic. But this is also its danger. In 2004 the Enough is Enough marchers had a specific, albeit regressive, cause – opposing the then civil unions bill. At that point Destiny Church was at the height of its powers. Tamaki could credibly call on at least <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_Church_(New_Zealand)#:~:text=Locations,-Destiny%20Church%20is&amp;text=At%20its%20peak%20in%202003,with%20around%203000%20regular%20attendees.\">5,000 church members</a> and point to social programmes contributing to a genuine community good. But in the 18 years since then, the church has lost at least 2,000 members. Branches closed in places like Porirua and Dunedin. The church’s political party, Vision New Zealand, did dreadfully at the last election. That leaves the bishop desperately seeking a cause.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/feb/10/new-zealand-police-are-right-to-remove-freedom-protesters-who-have-cohered-around-violence\">New Zealand police are right to remove ‘freedom’ protesters who have cohered around violence | Morgan Godfery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To the country’s detriment, he found one in the regulations to contain Covid-19. As the country went into lockdown in March 2020, successfully eliminating the virus in a collective effort, Tamaki took an initial stand, refusing to comply with stay-at-home rules before eventually moving his services online. In March 2021 he refused to comply again, leaving Auckland for Rotorua during a level 3 lockdown (non-essential regional travel was banned).</p> <p>The world’s conspiracists and fake news merchants have found Covid-19 regulations to be fertile ground for radicalising people with grievances. Tamaki found this as well, teaming up with the so-called Freedom and Rights Coalition and turning out thousands of people to protest against Auckland’s Delta lockdown in October 2021. That taste of minor public success is perhaps partly behind Tamaki’s decision to amalgamate Vision New Zealand with two of New Zealand’s other fringe, conspiracist parties.</p> <p>Whether deliberately or not, Tamaki is placing his church at the centre of New Zealand’s disinformation networks. In his sermon to protesters in Wellington on Tuesday he suggested the government was responsible for cancelling ferry trips from Picton to prevent people attending the rally. This is obviously untrue. It’s also at the reserved end for his howlers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"559c138595487d6924d55269a01985fad803866a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/559c138595487d6924d55269a01985fad803866a/0_0_5590_3727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Counter-protesters wait for the marchers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Counter-protesters wait for the marchers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynn Grieveson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like evangelical churches in countries such as the US and Brazil, Tamaki is finding influence in proselytising the “end of days”. Not necessarily in the biblical sense, but in a political sense. If Tamaki and his followers oppose anything, it’s the pace of change. Marriage equality. Women in leadership positions. Regulations to eliminate and suppress a deadly virus. The world is, excuse the pun, going to hell.</p> <p>And that narrative – the world as frighteningly progressive – drives Tamaki’s imitators, hangers-on and competition. Online grifters unrelated to him one-up the bishop with vast conspiracies alleging (among many, many other things) paedophile dungeons below parliament. This is deranged. And easily disproven. But the conspiracies function more as ciphers for general grievances rather than specific, provable claims. This incoherence is what makes the protest – and the wider disinformation network – worth understanding and opposing. Conspiracist outlets like Counterspin Media use these inventions to give form to grievances, and justifications to the aggrieved. If your enemy is a paedophile incarcerating children, surely anything goes.</p> <p>This is where fascism begins. In the reaction against a supposedly corrupt elite, and in an alliance between fringe religious organisations, white nationalists, and eventually capital. In New Zealand, things are not yet so far gone. The scene of a fake judge conducting a fake trial outside parliament was, in the end, comical. The red velvet throne, the gavel, the bench, and Lady Justice’s scales only reinforced the absence of any majesty and justice in the day’s proceedings. It was akin to a child playing dress up.</p> <p>What was notable, though, was the counter-protest. As in 2004, when counter-protesters met the Enough is Enough march, it reinforced that Destiny Church was already halfway on the road to defeat. When Tuesday’s counter-protesters met the marchers, it reinforced the same. The conspiracists, and the fascists, are already losing.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/23/investment-nsw-chief-amy-brown-to-leave-agency-that-appointed-john-barilaro-to-a-new-york-trade-role","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia

We don’t have a sixth-form so an awful lot rests on it. In this area, lots of sixth-forms have entry requirements, so it will influence their choices.”</p> <p>Although her school set two mock exams, she didn’t feel that pupils had the opportunity to develop revision skills and maturity, and many struggled to maintain momentum over the lengthened exam timetable. “The thing they tended to say was ‘there’s just so much to know’,” she said.</p> <p>James Eldon, the principal of the Manchester Academy, noted that “there’s a nervousness in Manchester” over results because of how badly the city had been hit by the pandemic.

On the House side, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/21/florida-republicans-pass-map-limits-black-voter-power\">new congressional map drawn by DeSantis</a> is expected to give Republicans a hefty advantage in the November midterms.</p> <p>Although Florida has long been considered a swing state, Republicans have a considerable edge heading into this election season. Republicans last year overtook Democrats in Florida’s voter registration rolls. And Donald Trump carried the state by three points in the 2020 presidential race, although Joe Biden defeated him in the electoral college while also winning the national popular vote by four points.</p> <p>Since then, DeSantis has approved new voting restrictions to limit access to voting by mail and ballot drop boxes in Florida, sparking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/florida-republicans-black-voters-justice-department\">allegations from the justice department</a> of racial discrimination. Those methods were more likely to be used by Biden supporters in 2020 than voting at a polling place on election day, according to the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/11/20/the-voting-experience-in-2020/\">Pew Research Center</a>.</p> <p>With the new House map in place, Republicans are expected to win 20 of Florida’s 28 congressional seats, up from the party’s current control of 16 of the state’s 27 seats. The state’s additional House seat resulted from the latest round of redistricting.</p> <p>Republicans’ severe gerrymandering, which will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2022/apr/20/ron-desantis-florida-electoral-map-gerrymandering-republican-advantage\">severely curtail Black political power</a> in Florida, has made many of the state’s congressional races a foregone conclusion this fall. Not a single one of Florida’s House races is considered a toss-up for the general election, according to <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings\">the Cook Political Report</a>. That means that the winners of the Tuesday primaries are very likely to be elected to Congress this fall.</p> <p>The anticlimactic forecast for Florida’s House races has many election watchers turning their attention to statewide races. All eyes will be on Florida’s Democratic gubernatorial primary, with Charlie Crist, a Democratic congressman and former governor, running against Nikki Fried, the state’s agriculture commissioner.</p> <p>Crist and Fried have attacked DeSantis over his aggressive approach to culture war issues in Florida, which may preview the governor’s 2024 presidential campaign. Just this month, DeSantis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/ron-desantis-andrew-warren-lawsuit-florida-wokeness\">drew a lawsuit</a> from a state prosecutor whom the governor suspended after the attorney said he would not enforce a 15-week abortion ban.</p> <p>DeSantis last week also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/florida-arrests-illegal-voting-destanis\">announced charges</a> against 20 people for illegally voting, a move meant to highlight the work of a new office aimed at uncovering voter fraud. The governor provided few details about the charges, and voting rights advocates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/florida-arrests-illegal-voting-destanis\">have denounced</a> the arrests as voter intimidation.</p> <p>“Quite frankly, he is anti-democracy,” Crist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CharlieCrist/status/1561501008907440129\">told MSNBC</a> on Sunday. “I am a Democrat running to protect democracy, to protect a woman’s right to choose, and I’m running against an autocrat who wants to be dictator of America.”</p> <p>But DeSantis is not backing away from his far-right agenda, instead choosing to double down on the political strategy. DeSantis has issued endorsements in dozens of non-partisan school board races, and he has campaigned alongside candidates who have backed his calls for more “parents’ rights” in the classroom.</p> <p>DeSantis has made education a central part of his platform after signing multiple laws aimed at limiting what can be taught to Florida children. Earlier this year, DeSantis signed a bill restricting the discussion of race and racism in the classroom and the workplace. DeSantis in March <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/dont-say-gay-bill-florida-ron-desantis\">approved a bill</a> forbidding instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for students in kindergarten through third grade, a measure that has been attacked by critics as a “don’t say gay” law. More recently, DeSantis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/florida-ron-desantis-communism-bill-students\">put his signature</a> on a bill requiring students be taught about the “victims of communism” each November.</p> <p>Despite those controversial policies, DeSantis heads into the general election with a clear advantage over his Democratic challengers. DeSantis has amassed a campaign war chest of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/politics/ron-desantis-campaign-finance-2024-election/index.html\">more than $100m</a>, and he has consistently led his potential opponents <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/florida/\">in recent polls</a>.</p> <p>Florida’s Senate race has provided Democrats with more optimism, as Rubio – a former and potentially future Republican presidential candidate – seeks a third term in office. Congresswoman Val Demings has led the pack of Democratic candidates seeking to defeat Rubio, and polls indicate she may have an opportunity to do so.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.unf.edu/uploadedFiles/aa/coas/porl/UNF%20PORL%20August%20Survey.pdf\">University of North Florida poll</a> taken this month found that Demings had the support of 48% of likely general election voters, compared with 44% for Rubio.</p> <p>But Democrats know to take nothing for granted because they have previously been on the losing end of heartbreakingly close races in Florida. The state proved to be an exception to Democrats’ “wave” of victories in 2018, when the incumbent senator Bill Nelson and gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum were both narrowly defeated by their Republican opponents.</p> <p>Tuesday could provide some key clues as to whether Democrats will finally be able to break their Florida losing streak.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/22/us-south-west-storm-drought-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Flash floods wreak havoc in US south-west – but are no salve for drought","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/22/us-south-west-storm-drought-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/22/us-south-west-storm-drought-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Flash floods wreak havoc in US south-west – but are no salve for drought","trailText":"Climate experts warn temporary increases in water levels will not mitigate a crisis that has been years in the making","byline":"Gabrielle Canon in Oakland","body":"<p>Flash floods hitting the American south-west in recent days have shuttered parts of national parks including in Moab and Zion, closed highways in Colorado, submerged cars in Texas and trapped tourists in a New Mexico cave.

Not content with the models already on the market, San Francisco launched what is now a three-and-half-year (and counting), <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/bayarea/heatherknight/article/san-francisco-trashcan-17321320.php\">$550,000 project</a> to design bespoke bins for its streets.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://sfpublicworks.wixsite.com/trashcanpilot/design-criteria\">design criteria</a> for the trash cans stressed innovation (“Each can must be outfitted with an electronic sensor that sends alerts when nearing trash capacity so it can be emptied before overflowing”), aesthetics (“The design must be a visual asset on the sidewalk”), and above all, rummage-resistance.</p> <p>The existing bins were “easy targets of scavengers, who rummage through them and leave behind a mess”, <a href=\"https://sfpublicworks.org/trashcanredesign\">according to the public works department</a>. </p> <p>In July, the city finally rolled out custom-made prototypes of the three finalist designs.

(Also planted across the city are three “off-the-shelf” models, which would reportedly cost <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/san-francisco-pricey-trash-cans/\">$630 to $2,800 each</a>; the custom ones, when produced at scale, are expected to cost $2,000 to $3,000.)</p> <p>The Guardian took a tour around the city to investigate the options.</p> <h2><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5730c3e753314debdd24ab1eaa8051c7faa0c245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5730c3e753314debdd24ab1eaa8051c7faa0c245/309_272_2515_3144/800.jpg\" alt=\"A prototype of a Salt and Pepper design trash can \" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salt and Pepper trash can in San Francisco, August 2022</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Cantor/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This $11,000 trash can lives up to its name: it looks like a salt or pepper shaker. The public works department says its “unique and elegant profile stands out from afar”, and indeed, it was visible from across the street. But it doesn’t look particularly unique or elegant when stuffed with garbage: it looks like a trash can. And though its design may limit graffiti as intended, the steel fins seem likely to prove difficult to clean; they were encrusted with some unidentifiable gunk. </p> <p>The Salt and Pepper has a separate section on top that’s intended for recyclables, as indicated by an unintelligible symbol. It was packed with non-recyclable items, which seems inevitable when hurried passersby are faced with a stuffed bin.</p> <p>The opening for normal trash was small, which the city says makes it “difficult to rummage in the can”. It also makes it difficult to throw out a cup of coffee. A wide lip at the bottom of the opening means you really have to reach in there to ensure your trash lands in the bin, rather than next to it. Seeking a trash can people can’t take things out of, San Francisco has built one you can’t put things into.</p> <p>Appearance: 5/10</p> <p>Ease of use: 4/10</p> <p>Overall: 4.5/10</p> <h2><strong>Slim Silhouette</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a083c51797c597137d3b05daff1eacabf7b33e73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a083c51797c597137d3b05daff1eacabf7b33e73/0_0_2842_3553/800.jpg\" alt=\"A prototype of a Slim Silhouette trash can in San Francisco.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slim Silhouette trash can in San Francisco, August 2022</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Cantor/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For $18,800, you get a trash can with a circular mouth that makes it appear permanently alarmed.</p> <p>This bin’s appearance is unobjectionable; despite its name, it has an appealing heft to it. It would look at home on any street, but so do the current green trash cans. And like its slightly cheaper sibling, it’s a lot more appealing in the prototype images than it is when scuffed up and nearly overflowing. Also like its sibling, it was not drawing any interest from passersby despite the QR code on its side.</p> <p>The Slim Silhouette also has separate compartments for garbage and recycling; again, both were filled with trash. The trash hole was even smaller than the Salt and Pepper’s, and when a finicky Guardian reporter threw out an item, he was forced to touch other trash making a bid for escape.</p> <p>Appearance: 6/10</p> <p>Ease of use: 3/10</p> <p>Overall: 4.5/10</p> <h2><strong>Soft Square</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e1eec9aeceaa53ead345102e97148bf7a567e1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e1eec9aeceaa53ead345102e97148bf7a567e1c/0_0_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"A prototype of a Soft Square trash can in San Francisco.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soft Square trash can in San Francisco, August 2022</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Cantor/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And finally, the bin behind the headlines: the $20,900 Soft Square, which is neither soft nor a square. The city describes this one as having a “recognizable trash can silhouette”, which does seem like something you want in a trash can. No one wants San Franciscans dropping their mail in these things or mistaking them for long-lost friends.</p> <p>This is the only trash can that requires users to open it. There’s a pedal at the bottom so you don’t have to touch the handle; unfortunately, the pedal is so sleek and subtle that the Guardian reporter didn’t initially notice it and pulled the bin open by hand. Short on trash, the reporter placed a nearby leaf into the receptacle. Reopening it revealed that both the leaf and another piece of trash, placed earlier by someone else, remained stuck in the deposit slot, from which a fly lazily emerged.</p> <p>As if to prove the slot was too small, a bag of trash sat on the ground next to the Soft Square, creating the very mess the cans are intended to eliminate.</p> <p>Appearance: 5/10</p> <p>Ease of use: 2/10</p> <p>Overall: 3.5/10</p> <h2><strong>The verdict</strong></h2> <p>In a city obsessed with disruption, none of the models revolutionized the world of waste disposal.

On 23 August every year, Unesco’s <a href=\"https://www.unesco.org/en/days/slave-trade-remembrance-day\">day of remembrance</a> focuses on the Black men and women who started an uprising in Haiti in 1791. In Britain and former British territories, 25 March marks the 1807 legislation that would end the country’s involvement in the slave trade, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/01/hundreds-demand-reparations-for-windrush-generation\">Emancipation Day on 1 August</a> commemorates the 1834 act abolishing slavery coming into effect. Despite all of these dates, there has been little recognition of Britain’s historical role in the slave trade from our government or political leaders.</p> <p>When discussions about slavery do happen, they focus narrowly on the British empire<strong> </strong>and tend to be polarised. David Cameron declared his <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2281422/David-Cameron-talks-pride-British-Empire-stops-short-giving-apology-Amritsar-massacre.html\">“pride” in the empire</a> but rarely mentioned slavery or colonialism (on a visit to Jamaica in 2015, the then prime minister urged the country to “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/30/jamaica-should-move-on-from-painful-legacy-of-slavery-says-cameron\">move on</a>” from this history). Meanwhile, the current Conservative party displays a nostalgia for the glorious days of the British empire, when imperial subjects didn’t “disturb” Britain’s social and cultural landscapes.</p> <p>Discussions of slavery bring several, often opposing, viewpoints to the surface. Some would rather focus on abolition and erase the difficult history and legacies of subjugation at the core of enslavement; others keep telling us we need to focus on a multicultural present in a sort of post-racial Britain where, paradoxically, colour doesn’t matter. Both of these approaches have a tendency to deny the persistent reality of institutionalised racism and discrimination towards minorities today. They have led to controversies such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/16/government-race-report-evidence\">Sewell report</a>, which presented a “new story about the Caribbean experience” that recommended schoolchildren should be taught about the positive side of slavery – such as how enslaved people in the Caribbean supposedly culturally transformed themselves.</p> <p>The history of enslavement involved subjugation, power, trade and violence. It is complex, and has created <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/post-conflict-memorialization/olivette-otele/luisa-gandolfo/9783030548896\">intergenerational trauma</a> on all sides. So it is understandable that Britain might be reluctant to organise a high-profile commemoration each year. In France, the state’s national day commemorating the abolition of slavery takes place on 10 May (the televised ceremony is always attended by the president and the president of the senate). Britain has no national ceremony for the thousands of lives that were lost to slavery. Unesco’s International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition provides an opportunity for Britain to share responsibility with other European empires for slavery, and therefore exonerate itself by framing slavery as a common historical practice.</p> <p>Avoiding discussions of slavery for the rest of the year plays into the hands of culture warriors who are itching for a US-style standoff, and prefer to frame any reckoning with Britain’s colonial past as an attempt to destabilise the country. Take, for example, Kemi Badenoch’s distracting and ill-informed grandstanding over critical race theory, or <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/met-cressida-dick-sarah-everard-b1862060.html\">Cressida Dick’s portrayal</a> of institutional racism and police brutality as merely a few bad apples, or the repeated attempts to frame Black Lives Matter as a movement that is hostile to white people.</p> <p>This culture war has become a mechanism of distraction that prevents us from discussing the painful legacies of Britain’s colonial past, and examining how this history has entrenched social inequalities in the present day. Instead of intelligent and compassionate conversation about history, there has been a hardening of positions on all sides.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jun/19/british-history-should-not-be-treated-as-a-soft-play-area-says-david-olusoga\">British history should not be treated as a ‘soft play area’, says David Olusoga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The conversation shouldn’t be about deciding whether the British empire was “good” or “bad”. The purpose of slavery was to build wealth for Britain by any means necessary, through subjugation, division and coercion. And even in the midst of the exploitation and enslavement that defined plantation life, there were forms of collaboration that benefited some at the expense of others, and hierarchies and class systems among enslaved people that ultimately allowed slaveholders to retain control. On plantations, favouritism based on skin colour was even more complex. Yet we can’t teach these layers of history if we don’t even acknowledge how important that history was – and still is.</p> <p>This culture war is the symptom of a selective history about enslavement that has defined how we view this issue in Britain. Frequently we hear the paternalist account of Britain’s role in the slave trade, which focuses on the country’s contribution to ending slavery and the navy’s role in rescuing enslaved people after 1807. Britain would rather be remembered as a saviour and emancipator than a perpetrator. As a result, we hear far less about other parts of its history, such as how, in the scramble to colonise parts of Africa in the 19th century, abolitionist arguments helped to justify imperial expansion.</p> <p>The solution to this collective amnesia should be honest conversations about the past and its impact on 21st-century Britain. A national dialogue that doesn’t turn into a point-scoring shouting match could be the start of powerful momentum for restorative justice. The Bank of England, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/18/bank-of-england-apologises-for-role-of-former-directors-in-slave-trade\">publicly acknowledged its role in the slave trade</a> and recently hosted an exhibition about the links between slavery and the City of London, and the Church of England, which <a href=\"https://www.churchofengland.org/news-and-media/news-and-statements/church-and-legacy-slavery\">launched an investigation</a> into its links with slavery, have already started this conversation. Such initiatives could open the door to a greater understanding of our common history.</p> <p>Some may ask: why does a nation need to publicly commemorate slavery, when there are already local initiatives, such as <a href=\"https://gov.wales/black-history-cymru-365-will-build-momentum-towards-wales-free-discrimination-and-inequality\">Black History Cymru 365</a>, which commemorate and celebrate Black history all year long? The first answer is a “duty of memory”: Britain built unprecedented wealth by exploiting people of African descent as labour and commodities for 300 years and colonising parts of Asia. Parliament played a central role in that history and even paid compensation to owners of enslaved people. The least any government in its place could do would be remembering those who were enslaved, supporting the teaching of this history through curriculum change, and engaging in discussions about restorative justice.</p> <p>The second answer is related to the idea of collective memory. As memory studies scholars have demonstrated, collective commemoration can be a way to <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/post-conflict-memorialization/olivette-otele/luisa-gandolfo/9783030548896\">heal from traumatic pasts and bring societies together</a>. In fact, Liverpool’s museums are bringing together playwright Bonnie Greer and Laurella Rinçon, director general of Mémorial ACTe (MACTe), a memorial and museum dedicated to the memory of the transatlantic slave trade in Guadeloupe, for a public conversation and keynote address. In Greenwich, the National Maritime Museum is organising a series of talks and performances. On this day and during Black History Month, there is a flurry of activities around the history of slavery. Now we must ensure this question does not fall into oblivion for the rest of the year.</p> <ul> <li><p>Olivette Otele is distinguished professor of the legacies and memory of slavery at Soas University of London</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Kingfishers are common along this stretch of the Wharfe, but they are typically shy, wary birds. My sightings are often blink-and-miss-it affairs; a furtive glimpse of sci-fi cyan flashing through the trees, or knifing at prey in the brown water.</p> <p>Greedy to see more of those scintillating, laser-burst colours, I decide to try to get a closer look at this particular bird. When I locate it, on a low branch overhanging the water, and carefully slide forward, I am expecting the bird to get spooked. But instead, the otherworldly hunter allows me to get astoundingly close, almost within touching distance. I can easily make out the finest details of its plumage.</p> <p>The bird hops around on its perch, dips into the water below, and seems unthreatened by this strange floating head. Perhaps it doesn’t see enough of my body to register me as human. Only when a couple of people appear on the opposite bank with a dog does the bird finally take flight.</p> <p>The encounter feels like a rare privilege, but not all my recent visits to this stretch of the river – a local swimming spot that has boomed in popularity – have yielded wonderful up-close encounters with wildlife. Increasingly often, I find blackened ground, vandalised trees, litter and other things to trigger fits of misanthropic anger.</p> <p>Yet this is a nation where the public has a legal right of access to only 3% of inland waterways. Is it any great surprise that, when the mercury soars, particular riverside hotspots get quickly mobbed? Where else is there to go?</p> <p>In other European countries, rivers and lakes are far more likely to be treated as communal assets; recreational infrastructure is even built around them. In feudal old England, inland water is still treated as the dominion of landowners, fishermen and private interests. Done properly, more aquatic access benefits both people and wildlife. And in the hot years ahead, the demand for it will grow.</p> <p>• Country Diary is on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdncountrydiary?lang=en\" title=\"\">@gdncountrydiary</a></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/23/turkeys-rapprochement-with-syria-leaves-regional-refugees-fearful","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T04:00:51Z","webTitle":"Turkey’s rapprochement with Syria leaves regional refugees fearful","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/23/turkeys-rapprochement-with-syria-leaves-regional-refugees-fearful","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/23/turkeys-rapprochement-with-syria-leaves-regional-refugees-fearful","fields":{"headline":"Turkey’s rapprochement with Syria leaves regional refugees fearful","trailText":"Erdoğan is no longer seeking the ousting of Assad, alarming Syrians across the opposition and Kurdish exiles who fear being forcibly returned","byline":"Martin Chulov Middle East correspondent","body":"<p>Syrians across the opposition and in the Kurdish north of the country have reacted with alarm to Turkish moves to normalise relations with Damascus amid claims the overtures will lead to mass demographic swaps and the forced return of millions of refugees.</p> <p>The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, over the weekend added his voice to a growing chorus of officials who had markedly shifted rhetoric on Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, claiming: “Political dialogue or diplomacy cannot be cut off between states.”</p> <p>His remarks were the clearest signal yet that Turkey has embarked on a new policy that intends to stabilise Assad, after being a chief regional proponent of his ousting for more than a decade.</p> <p>It came on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the war’s greatest atrocity, the gassing of close to 1,300 civilians in an opposition area in the outer suburbs of Damascus with sarin shells on 21 August 2013.</p> <p>In the years since, Russia and Iran have ushered Assad into a pyrrhic victory on the country’s battlefields.</p> <p>The two states and Turkey now have a prominent stake in a fractured country described as postwar Syria, where large parts of the population remain outside the control of the central government.</p> <p>In the north-west, however, the guns of war continued to blaze on Monday, with Russian airstrikes targeting 13 different sites in Idlib province, where the bulk of the country’s anti-Assad opposition, or those forced out of their homes as part of so-called reconciliation deals, continue to shelter among hardline groups.</p> <p>The airstrikes were among the most intensive since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine diverted jets used to bomb Syria to a new conflict. Casualty numbers were unknown.</p> <p>Erdoğan has in recent years staunchly opposed Russian bombings in Idlib, where Turkey has established significant influence over the past two years. However, the new attacks met no reaction from Ankara, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/20/erdogan-russia-iran-syria-putin-khamenei\">which has drawn closer to Vladimir Putin’s view of a solution</a> for Syria in recent months.</p> <p>The Turkish leader is understood to have been dissuaded from launching a new incursion into the Kurdish north-east of Syria last month after speaking to Putin during a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/putin-erdogan-meet-secretive-talks-sochi-russia-turkey-ukraine\">summit in Sochi</a>. After failing to win Putin’s blessing, Erdoğan has appeared to resort to diplomacy, while launching drone strikes against what his intelligence officials said are Kurdish rebels.</p> <p>One such strike struck a volleyball game near the city of Hasakah last week, killing four girls and injuring seven others.</p> <p>Kurdish groups in the north-east, backed by the Kurdistan workers’ party (PKK), have been bracing for a fresh Turkish incursion, which they fear aims to carve out a new sphere of influence along the border with Turkey, into which Ankara will transfer Arab refugees who have been hosted in Turkey over the past decade.</p> <p>Erdoğan faces an election next year in which anti-refugee sentiment is running high as he struggles to deal with a flatlining economy and simmering social unrest. Turkey has already announced plans to send up to 1 million refugees back to Syria, and has funded the construction of homes in areas between Kurds in the north-west and north-east, effectively creating a wedge between them.</p> <p>Direct contact with Assad is unlikely to happen soon, but officials, including intelligence figures, are expected to resume cooperation. “This will be phased,” said a senior official based in Beirut. “The messaging from the Turks is very clear. They want to deal with the PKK, and Assad now has some leverage with them for the first time. But it’s all brokered through Putin though, so he shouldn’t push it too far.”</p> <p>More than half of Syria’s prewar population remains internally displaced, or outside Syria’s borders, where most remain unwilling to return, citing dangers posed at home by regime officials who they believe will shake them down financially and detain them arbitrarily.</p> <p>A senior Kurdish official in north-eastern Syria on Monday described Turkey’s rapprochement with Assad as a “trick”</p> <p>“Turkey has never supported the Syrian revolution,” said Ilham Ahmad, a member of the region’s executive council. “It used it to serve its expansionist agendas based on colonialism and demographic changes. Turkey used Syrian refugees.”</p> <p>The UN and NGOs have insisted that Syria remains unsafe to return to for many who fled persecution throughout the war. Lebanon too has shifted its rhetoric towards Syrians sheltering in the country, with community attitudes turning hostile in some areas and refugees being forced to hide to avoid arrest.</p> <p>“I’d rather try my chances in this broken place than go to Bashar’s prisons,” said Mustafa Hilani, a Syrian who has lived in Beirut for the past six years. “There is no life there.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/23/once-the-games-spotlight-fades-its-easy-for-elite-athletes-to-feel-lost","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T02:59:12Z","webTitle":"Once the Games spotlight fades it’s easy for elite athletes to feel lost | Jaryd Clifford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/23/once-the-games-spotlight-fades-its-easy-for-elite-athletes-to-feel-lost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/23/once-the-games-spotlight-fades-its-easy-for-elite-athletes-to-feel-lost","fields":{"headline":"Once the Games spotlight fades it’s easy for elite athletes to feel lost","trailText":"Since the Tokyo Paralympics, I’ve felt pretty broken and always searching for the moment that helps me turn the page","byline":"Jaryd Clifford","body":"<p>Nearly one year ago, I woke up filled with the kind of hope that you only feel on days where dreams might come true.

Time blurs in these moments, but I eventually found myself on a stretcher underneath the stadium. Later, I sat in an ice bath, my mind numb, my upper-body leaning outwards as I threw up into an empty shower cubicle. I felt nothing, but when you dream about a moment for so long and then it happens in the blink of an eye, what more can you feel?</p> <p>At some point, I found myself back out on the track talking to Australian reporter Matt Carmichael. I spoke about how hard it had been, my family and the people without whom I wouldn’t have been there, and then my Pa who had passed away before the Games. I’m really proud that I was vulnerable and that I cried – I was true to myself in that moment. I look back at that race with so much pride, but also so much disappointment. I can’t pretend otherwise, and I think that interview captures that feeling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/7Sport/status/1431432778722205696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JarydClifford?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JarydClifford</a>&#39;s race was for his Pa who passed away recently ♥️<br><br>Broadcast Partner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wisraustralia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@wisraustralia</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tokyo2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Tokyo2020</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wcq8gGkVv6\">pic.twitter.com/wcq8gGkVv6</a></p>&mdash; 7Sport (@7Sport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/7Sport/status/1431432778722205696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 28, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>I went on to win bronze in the 1500m and silver in the marathon, falling short two more times. I had so much fun in Tokyo, but after a year away from home and the people I loved, home was the only place I wanted to be after that week. This is the story I want to tell, or at least the feelings and learnings, because people often don’t get to see the aftermath of moments they witness on TV. People think athletes are always motivated, that they are hyper-determined individuals who can always keep on keeping on. Truthfully, that is sometimes far from how we feel. I think we need to be honest and vulnerable so that people don’t compare themselves to something that doesn’t exist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I’ve realised these last few weeks that slowly is often the fastest way to get where we want to go</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The day I got home was one of the best days of my life. It was all over, and now it was time to rest. I took almost a month away from running, but it’s taken me until now – one year later – to realise that one month wasn’t enough. I thought that rushing forward would help me move on from Tokyo, but I’ve realised these last few weeks that slowly is often the fastest way to get where we want to go. At times this year, I’ve felt pretty broken, definitely lost, and always searching for the moment that helps me turn the page. I’m getting there.</p> <p>I haven’t felt this way because I didn’t win, and I want to emphasise how proud I am of those medals. It’s simply the fact that I had this singular event in my future for so long – my entire teenage life – and suddenly it was gone. I’d reached the top of one mountain, but found myself at the bottom of the next.</p> <p>I promise I’m OK. People might watch me at the 2024 Paralympic Games and just not think about the years in between. Not only the hard years of training, but the hard years of finding that purpose to get up every morning to run thousands of kilometres in a year. We don’t just wake up the next day and it’s all OK – we are like everyone else. At the end of the day, it’s just sport, but we are like anyone who dedicates their life to anything. We feel the euphoria and heartbreak of living life to its fullest. If I’ve learnt something from life, it’s that everyone is going through something, everyone has a story that they are writing. Sport is at its most powerful when people can take hope, inspiration, or belief in themselves from what they witness.</p> <p>I read a quote the other day. It said that in times of darkness, sometimes we might think we are buried, but really, we’ve just been planted. That’s how I feel now. This is the start of something new.

On arrival, their passports are taken and they are often sold on to different groups and forced to work in offices running illegal phone or online scams.</p> <p>The largest cohorts of victims appears to be from Vietnam and Taiwan. Taiwan authorities say almost 5,000 citizens have been recorded travelling to Cambodia and not returning. Police said they had identified at least 370 of them as being held against their will, but victims have said the number is likely to be much higher.</p> <p>At least 46 people have returned to Taiwan in recent months, with some reporting they or others were forced to sign contracts, and were assaulted, raped, denied food and water, and frequently threatened. Rescues have been stymied or complicated by inadequate policing and corruption in Cambodia. Varying reports have said the perpetrators include Taiwanese, Chinese, Thai and Cambodian individuals.</p> <p>News of the trafficking ring has been widely reported in Asia over recent weeks. Last week a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ngahpham/status/1560508973006360576?s=20&amp;t=iw3XC3MvLCDvKm4yjk7FrQ\">viral video purported to show</a> dozens of Vietnamese people fleeing a casino just inside the Cambodian border. The crowd of people were chased by guards wielding sticks as they ran from a building and jumped in a river to swim over the border to Vietnam. One 16-year-old reportedly drowned in the escape.</p> <p>Yu Tang, a young Taiwanese woman who did not want to publish her surname, told the Guardian she was contacted via Facebook in April by a Taiwanese woman, who found her in a group for people seeking work. She was offered work overseas in call or assistance centres for online gaming and casino industries. When she expressed scepticism they offered to pay for a return flight and agreed to meet her in person.</p> <p>“I didn’t believe them but then we met in public,” she said. The man appeared “normal”, Yu Tang said. She agreed to take the job and was met at the airport by different individuals, as well as several others also seeking work.</p> <p>They were met again at Phnom Penh airport by others who “said they were travel agents but looked like gangsters”. The agents took the groups’ passports, claiming it was to organise sim cards, but did not return them.</p> <p>“I knew if I wanted to call for help, I needed a sim card,” Yu Tang said. “In that moment we were imagining we’d be sold.”</p> <p>All records of conversations with the traffickers were wiped off the victims’ phones, Yu Tang said, and they were taken to Sihanoukville and told they would be working in a phone scam operation. They were also told they would have to recruit others in order to pay US$17,000 if they wanted to be released. Yu Tang said when one man objected he was beaten unconscious and shocked with a stun gun. She said that man remains on Taiwan’s list of missing people.</p> <p>Yu Tang said she was able to obtain a sim and immediately began to research the trafficking operation, finding details for a local politician’s office, who she contacted through Facebook.</p> <p>The following day police and army officers arrived on site to collect her. She alleged the boss offered to pay them to “pretend nothing had happened”, but they refused. She has since returned to Taiwan.</p> <p>Yu Tang said she believes many more Taiwanese remain trapped in Cambodia than authorities have confirmed, noting she saw at least 50 others being held in the same office where she was taken, and that the area was full of similar buildings. She said many people were forced to sign contracts which would be shown to any authorities questioning an individual’s status, and that people grew more fearful of speaking up the longer they were held.</p> <p>“The longer they stayed the more horrible things they heard and saw, and got scared,” she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"589e8e15f1900319b13d0cd51c49b32b8abb3020\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/589e8e15f1900319b13d0cd51c49b32b8abb3020/0_320_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of Sihanoukville\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of Sihanoukville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now back in Taiwan, Yu Tang said she is frequently contacted by the families of victims and potential victims, seeking her assistance to help them escape, and by police seeking her inside knowledge. Yu said she has helped eight people return to Taiwan so far. </p> <p>Taiwanese police say they have arrested <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202208190024\">at least 67 people</a> in connection with the trafficking ring, including 16 on Monday with alleged connections to local gangs.</p> <p>Taiwan’s rescue efforts have been complicated by its lack of a diplomatic presence in Cambodia, as the country’s government recognises Beijing’s disputed claim over Taiwan as a province. On Friday the Chinese embassy issued a statement say it would assist “Taiwan compatriots”, who it claimed were Chinese citizens. Taiwan’s ministry of foreign affairs said it would “never outsource [consular assistance] to another country” but the mainland affairs council said it was in communication with China on this issue. Amid other efforts, Taiwanese police are patrolling the international airport with signs, questioning and warning travellers on their way to Cambodia.</p> <p>In Hong Kong police last week said five people had been arrested, as authorities set up a taskforce to help more than 30 identified victims. China said it was working with Cambodian authorities to rescue victims and 60 minors had recently been rescued, including some from sexual slavery. Cambodia’s deputy national police chief General Chhay Sinarith said Cambodian authorities had uncovered numerous illegal online schemes targeting foreign workers and had arrested hundreds of people from China and Taiwan.</p> <p>Cambodia’s interior minister, Sar Kheng, said on Friday his ministry would launch a nationwide check on the statuses of foreigners working or staying in hotels, rented properties and casinos. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2022/aug/23/margaret-urlich-aria-winner-and-popular-new-zealand-singer-dies-aged-57","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T02:40:01Z","webTitle":"Margaret Urlich, Aria winner and popular New Zealand singer, dies aged 57","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/23/margaret-urlich-aria-winner-and-popular-new-zealand-singer-dies-aged-57","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/aug/23/margaret-urlich-aria-winner-and-popular-new-zealand-singer-dies-aged-57","fields":{"headline":"Margaret Urlich, Aria winner and popular New Zealand singer, dies aged 57","trailText":"Auckland-born singer was first female solo artist to top New Zealand charts and provided backing vocals for Daryl Braithwaite hit The Horses","byline":"Michael Sun","body":"<p>Margaret Urlich, an Aria award-winning singer and one of New Zealand’s most successful musicians, has died aged 57.</p> <p>Born in Auckland, Urlich died on Monday of cancer at her home in New South Wales’ Southern Highlands.</p> <p>“It is with incredible sadness that we inform you that Margaret Urlich passed away peacefully … surrounded by her family after a courageous two and a half year battle with cancer,” said a statement from Urlich’s family.</p> <p>“Margaret is a much-loved multi award-winning member of the Australian and New Zealand music industry who captured hearts around the world as a gifted singer/songwriter with a unique voice and sense of style.”</p> <p>Urlich’s condition was known to her friends and colleagues, but was kept private from the public at the request of her family.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/sep/09/lorde-releases-mini-album-maori-language-solar-power-new-zealand\">‘Powerful experience’: Lorde releases mini-album in Māori language </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The singer began her career in 1985, fronting the new wave outfit Peking Man, before joining the all-female pop group When The Cat’s Away.

Stephen Donaghue, called on the government to fix “deficient” rules around disclosure of appointments that allowed Morrison to keep his five extra ministries secret.</p> \n<p>The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told reporters in Canberra the advice “goes to our very system of government” and the controversy can’t “just be dismissed”, urging Morrison to apologise to the Australian people.</p> \n<p>Albanese revealed he had asked his department to close the disclosure loophole, and that cabinet had approved an inquiry to consider the “implications” of Morrison’s actions.</p>

“problems” not dealt with by the advice, such as the fact Morrison was secretly the joint finance minister when the department investigated Christine Holgate, the former Australia Post chief executive.</p> \n<p>Albanese said Morrison was the “health minister and the industry minister at the time we were considering mRNA vaccine manufacture in Australia”, and was the final decision-maker for modern manufacturing grants made by the industry department.</p> \n<p>Albanese declined to say if the government would support a censure motion against Morrison, explaining it “will make those decisions when parliament sits”.</p> \n<p>In the advice, Donaghue concluded that Morrison was “validly appointed” to administer the department of industries, science, energy and resources on 15 April 2021, because disclosure of the appointment was not required for it to be effective.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a

with Mr Morrison were not informed of [his] appointment was inconsistent with the conventions and practices that form an essential part of the system of responsible government prescribed by … the constitution,” he said.</p> \n<p>Donaghue said it was “impossible for parliament and the public to hold ministers accountable for the proper administration of particular departments if the identity of the ministers who have been appointed to administer those departments is not publicised”.</p> \n<p>The solicitor general said this conclusion “does not depend” on whether and how many times Morrison exercised his powers.</p> \n<p>Donaghue said to the extent appointments were kept secret, “the principles of responsible government are fundamentally undermined,” and the appointments “fundamentally undermined” the relationship between the ministry and public service.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a

said the governor general “has no discretion to refuse to accept the prime minister’s advice in relation to such an appointment”.</p> \n<p>Albanese noted this, and downplayed suggestions David Hurley could be investigated by the future inquiry by noting Hurley’s statement that he had no reason to think the appointment would not be made public.</p> \n<p>Albanese confirmed that “clearly” some officials in his department were aware of the arrangements, but did not specify what, if any, consequences there should be for them.</p> \n<p>Donaghue suggested a range of fixes to the disclosure loophole, including “to entrench a requirement for the publication of [ministerial] appointments” in legislation.</p> \n<p>The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, said the opposition would work with Labor to “improve these processes and ensure transparency into the future”.</p> \n<p>Morrison has denied exercising powers in his extra portfolios, beyond one instance in which he <a

the function of an acting or co-minister”.</p> \n<p>“Ministers continued to exercise their full authorities without any interference, with my full trust and confidence.”</p> \n<p>Morrison again defended the arrangements as a “necessary” safeguard in “extraordinary circumstances” which were done with the “best of intentions”.</p> \n<p>But he conceded “in hindsight, some of these decisions will be reflected upon now and lessons learned”.</p> \n<p>Morrison said he would “assist any genuine process to learn the lessons from the pandemic” which should include “actions of the states and territories”, an inquiry broader than the one proposed by Albanese.</p> \n<p>The existence of Morrison’s secret ministries was first revealed in the book Plagued, which said he had been sworn in to

Sure, they’ve a finals record of late that will have many fans nervous, but Geelong simply looks more solid and durable than anyone else in the eight.</p> <h2><strong>Melbourne</strong></h2> <p>There’s a line in Denis Johnson’s Angels that sums up Melbourne’s season so far: “Things hummed, and things trembled. But things held.” Melbourne’s 10-goal win in Brisbane on Friday night was a reminder that the Demons have what it takes to go back-to-back. We were reminded that Max Gawn is sui generis among big men, and on their day Clayton Oliver, Christian Petracca and Angus Brayshaw have most midfield covered by a considerable margin.</p> <h2><strong>Sydney</strong></h2> <p>Sydney runs into September on a seven-game winning streak. While they didn’t smash the Saints to secure an SCG final, their record at the MCG stacks up. Sydney’s ability to unearth young talent is remarkable, and this season has been driven by the likes of Chad Warner and Callum Mills.</p> <p>Those who question the worth of the week’s bye before the finals should have a word with Tom Papley. Papley was concussed in the final game of the home-and-away season and entered a mandated 12-day concussion protocol. His season has really hit its strides over the past two weeks and has a game that is built for finals.</p> <h2><strong>Collingwood</strong></h2> <p>William James once observed that the art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook. With Collingwood it’s safe to say you can overlook all key statistics, bar wins and losses. The Magpies’ <em>joie de vivre</em> and “riding-with-our-hearts” hopefulness has brought about a team that is a win looking for different ways to happen.</p> <p>For some, Collingwood’s unlikely appearance in the finals will become a proxy war between proponents of their high-octane football that feels like its sustained on a diet of sunshine, and the game’s traditionalists who insist that such a game style inevitably falters this time of year. They tend to view the Pies as one of those Greek heroes who forgets he isn’t a god.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d12e35d6c892d029e1de3a153775879f834dc82e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d12e35d6c892d029e1de3a153775879f834dc82e/0_0_6062_4041/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Hayward of the Swans celebrates a goal against St Kilda at the weekend.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Hayward of the Swans celebrates a goal against St Kilda at the weekend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Morgan Hancock/AFL Photos/via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Fremantle</strong></h2> <p>Fremantle is one of the more difficult finals teams to get a read of.

If Friday night’s pedestrian showing couldn’t have been worse, their morally lethargic skipper ensured it was with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/20/brisbane-captain-dayne-zorko-apologises-for-sledge-that-left-demon-harrison-petty-in-tears\">vile insult made to Melbourne’s Harrison Petty</a>. On the surface, this is pathetic. When you dig deeper, it still is. If it is to be a distraction that upsets Brisbane’s September, then perhaps it’ll be in lieu of the penalty the AFL seems incapable of giving.</p> <h2><strong>Richmond</strong></h2> <p>The Tigers have endured losses that would end any other contender’s shot to be a genuine contender. And they have done it in style – dare we say with bursts of energy – with the form of Shai Bolton and Noah Cumberland emblematic of a month of winning football that has seen them exceed 100 points in each game. And then there’s Dustin Martin who looms on the horizon as his hamstring mends.</p> <h2><strong>Western Bulldogs</strong></h2> <p>A last-minute loss by Carlton – not once, but twice – gifted the Bulldogs eighth spot by 0.6%. Their last-minute entry into September may give them the freedom to play without fear – to play like, well… Collingwood.

England’s 1.5C budget means restricting total emissions to 2.5 gigatonnes of CO2 between 2022 and 2050 say the researchers, who did not look at how this compares in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, but they believe it is likely to be a similar picture.</p> <p>“In the long run, we argue that England can’t go on building new houses forever, and needs to start thinking about better and more systematic solutions as to how we are going to house everyone within our environmental limits,” said lead researcher Dr Sophus zu Ermgassen, from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology at the University of Kent.</p> <p>The paper, published in Ecological Economics, is the first to comprehensively analyse the impact of the government’s response to the housing crisis on national carbon and biodiversity goals. The researchers write: “Secure housing is a fundamental human right. However, potential conflicts between housing and sustainability objectives remain under-researched.”</p> <p>They looked at two existing models, one for evaluating the emissions needed to run UK houses, and the other, emissions from constructing new housing.

In the meantime, some of the world’s top performers are forging ahead.”</p> <p>James Scales, skills policy lead at the TBI, said: “While pupils elsewhere are learning how to think critically, communicate and solve problems as a group, our system remains anchored firmly in the past. This is holding back our young people and the country as a whole. Without the radical reform required to produce a new generation of forward thinkers, we won’t build the high-wage, high-skilled economy we need.”</p> <p>The report recommends establishing an expert commission to reform the national curriculum, one based on minimum proficiencies in numeracy, literacy and science, which will eventually incorporate more digital skills. It also cites transferring the responsibility for the design of the curriculum to a non-political body and changing the strategy and approach of Ofsted, the schools watchdog, to focus on safeguarding and quality of school management, as integral to the proposed changes.</p> <p>The focus on a small range of traditional academic subjects, which are referred to as the English baccalaureate, or Ebacc, is causing other subjects to be overlooked, meaning government reforms have damaged learning and “stifled efforts to improve social mobility”, the report added.</p> <p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the report adds to growing calls for “fresh thinking” on qualifications, the curriculum and inspection. Reform is needed because “at the current rate of progress the attainment gap between disadvantaged and other children will never close. We need a system which looks to the future rather than one which is rooted in the past,” he said. <br><br>A spokesperson from the Department for Education said: “GCSEs and A-levels are highly respected around the world and we have also introduced T-levels as the new gold standard technical qualification for young people

There were of course cheers for Casemiro as he held aloft a red shirt with his name but no number, although they were soon drowned out by chants of “We want Glazers out” from the Stretford End. The same chant echoed around the stadium moments after Jadon Sancho slotted the hosts into a thoroughly deserved lead against the old enemy. Liverpool fans responded with shouts of “Up the Glazers” while holding hundreds of pictures of Joel Glazer’s face aloft.</p> <p>The biggest game in English football and both sets of supporters were singing about an American family that has presided over one side’s decline, the other having been in the same boat just over a decade ago. United’s first win of the season at least dragged attention back to where it should always be.</p> <p>Their merited victory rounded off a hectic and head-spinning day for Casemiro who, having bid a tearful farewell to Real Madrid in the morning, arrived at Old Trafford several hours before kick off to take in his new environment. First impressions will have included a disenchanted fanbase, with thousands protesting against the Glazers outside the stadium ahead of the game, and a team in urgent need of direction with club captain, Harry Maguire, and Cristiano Ronaldo among those dropped to the bench following the humbling at Brentford. But also a team willing to fight against their fiercest rivals and to implement the new manager’s instructions.</p> <p>United have committed to spend an eye-watering total of £142.8m on the 30-year-old — a fee rising to £70m plus a four-year contract worth £350,000-a-week — and the sums involved in luring the midfielder from a glittering nine-year career at the Bernabeu signal the desperation at Old Trafford. Or the Brazil international’s pedigree, if that glass can now look half-full after a win over Liverpool. “If it was about money I would have left four or five years ago,” Casemiro said at his goodbye to Real. He cannot, in all honesty, claim sporting ambition is behind the decision to leave the reigning European and Spanish champions for United either.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f95bb3f27e3eee3ef2c2a2e677f413a511ce33e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f95bb3f27e3eee3ef2c2a2e677f413a511ce33e/0_173_4179_2507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bruno Fernandes (centre) was a thorn in Liverpool’s side throughout the game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruno Fernandes (centre) was a thorn in Liverpool’s side throughout the game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At least Casemiro will have been encouraged by the intensity and flashes of quality that underpinned his new club’s win over Jürgen Klopp’s side.

It was space that raised questions over Klopp’s decision to name Fabinho among his substitutes with Liverpool’s midfield resources stretched by injuries to Thiago Alcantara, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Curtis Jones. Naby Keita joined the injury list yet again before kick off having been in line to start. The Guinea international is reportedly unhappy with the contract extension currently on offer at Anfield. If correct, the £52.75m midfielder has some nerve having struggled with fitness problems throughout his Liverpool career. An inexperienced Liverpool bench featuring a second goalkeeper in Harvey Davies and three back-up central defenders in Nat Phillips, Sepp van den Berg and Stefan Bajcetic also showed the paucity of Klopp’s resources at present.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/22/manchester-united-fans-protest-against-glazer-family-before-liverpool-win\">Manchester United fans protest against Glazer family before Liverpool win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Liverpool could have over-ran United’s central midfield of Eriksen and Scott McTominay with an extra man and Roberto Firmino regularly dropping into the hole between them.

McTominay, one of those most under threat by Casemiro’s signing, was disciplined and effective while Anthony Elanga formed a promising left-wing partnership with the impressive Tyrell Malacia. Rashford worked tirelessly and United will hope his goal reignites the confidence that has been lacking from his game.

Regular moderate-intensity exercise may help to boost the body’s anti-inflammatory responses, as well as cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, all of which may explain its beneficial effects on Covid-19 severity, they suggest.</p> <p>“Our findings highlight the protective effects of engaging in sufficient physical activity as a public health strategy, with potential benefits to reduce the risk of severe Covid-19,” they wrote. “Given the heterogeneity and risk of publication bias, further studies with standardised methodology and outcome reporting are now needed.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/22/disability-abortion-the-hardest-choice-review-this-intelligent-documentary-deserved-two-episodes","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T22:05:44Z","webTitle":"Disability & Abortion: The Hardest Choice review – this intelligent documentary deserved two episodes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/22/disability-abortion-the-hardest-choice-review-this-intelligent-documentary-deserved-two-episodes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/22/disability-abortion-the-hardest-choice-review-this-intelligent-documentary-deserved-two-episodes","fields":{"headline":"Disability & Abortion: The Hardest Choice review – this intelligent documentary deserved two episodes","trailText":"It’s a moving and nuanced exploration of the law on terminating pregnancies involving foetal abnormalities. But this show needed another instalment to really do justice to its topic","byline":"Frances Ryan","body":"<p>In the opening scenes of Disability and Abortion: The Hardest Choice<em> </em>(Channel 4) we are getting to know our hosts, the actors Ruth Madeley and Ruben Reuter. Reuter, who has Down’s syndrome, is loved up with his girlfriend and enjoying his own flat. Madeley, who has spina bifida, goes for cocktails with the girls and has a Bafta nomination. The purpose is clear: any viewer who believes that the lives of disabled people are not worth living should re-evaluate their prejudice. It is an important, albeit simplified, point and in many ways sums up the challenge ahead for the film-makers: boiling a highly complex ethical debate into a one-hour mainstream vehicle.</p> <p>Madeley and Reuter start the documentary with an understandable but crude idea: that the UK’s abortion law, which permits termination of a pregnancy with foetal abnormalities after the standard term limit of 24 weeks, amounts to “discrimination” against disabled babies. The hosts plan to meet various people – parents, doctors, charity workers – to challenge their ideas.</p> <p>The most moving of these meetings are the interviews with women who have made the “hardest choice” the title speaks of. We meet Natasha, a young woman who has endured two pregnancies with fatal abnormalities. In the first case, Natasha chose an abortion – tellingly at 24 weeks and four days. In the second, she chose to go ahead with the pregnancy. After giving birth by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/14/i-was-told-they-didnt-offer-c-sections-the-dangerous-obsession-with-natural-births\">caesarean section</a> at 29 weeks, her little girl died three days later. Watching Natasha at the babies’ graves, small wooden hearts marking their names, the complexity and pain of this so-called “choice” is impossible to deny.</p> <p>Madeley and Reuter make engaged, compassionate hosts, and it is a testament to their intentions that they contemplate a choice that, rightly or wrongly, feels to them like a judgment on their own lives. To her credit, Madeley in particular gamely enters into – often highly difficult – discussions with experts who present her with new information and nuance. Her interview with a consultant who grants women permission for abortion based on diagnosing foetal abnormalities – “We don’t place value on life. It’s providing support for people so that they have the choice”, he implores – leaves her in tears. Left with the doctor’s words that it is “brutal” to remove a woman’s bodily autonomy, Madeley is visibly moved.</p> <p>I can’t help but think, though, the film would have been fairer, and ultimately better, if there had also been a host who was fully pro-choice. The format is designed to enable the two presenters to have a “revelation”, but both holding the same views creates a sense of imbalance, particularly at the start. For the first 15 minutes or so, the “anti” side is all the viewer hears, and black-and-white claims are left to go unchallenged. When Heidi Crowter, whose <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/23/woman-with-downs-syndrome-loses-uk-abortion-law-case\">ultimately unsuccessful high ocurt case against the UK’s abortion laws</a> acts as a hook for the film, frames the law as believing disabled babies aren’t “as valuable” as non-disabled children, she is never pressed on the fact that there may be other, much more credible reasons at play for the disparity (for example, that most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/nov/14/choosing-termination-baby-foetal-anomaly\">foetal abnormalities</a> are only detected after 20-plus weeks), because her interviewer agrees with her. This is only compounded by the fact that there is not a single disabled person interviewed who supports the right to an abortion after 24 weeks. In contrast, every fully pro-choice voice is a non-disabled person. It is a strange omission, not least when a YouGov survey commissioned for the programme finds that 55% of people born with a disability support the time limit.</p> <p>The film is on stronger ground when it highlights how healthcare workers often give couples a falsely bleak prognosis of the life their prospective disabled child could expect, and the general prejudice around disability. The scene of a happy little boy with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/12/my-brilliant-brother-has-downs-syndrome-is-it-wrong-to-fear-getting-pregnant-myself\">Down’s syndrome</a> playing in his beautiful home is contrasted effectively with his mum – an activist who challenged the law alongside Crowter – describing how she was appallingly asked three times by medics if she wanted to end her pregnancy. It would have served the issue better, however, if there had been some acknowledgment in this scene of the privilege at work: that middle-class women with family support and resources are not making the choice in the same context as women suffering domestic violence, poverty, or with four children already.</p> <p>This lack of analysis of wider inequality is perhaps the weak part of the film.<strong> </strong>“Why is disability seen as a bad thing?” Reuter asks. It is an important question but it is not the only one that the hosts could be asking. As well as prejudice, it is surely practical matters such as the UK’s high rates of disability and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/14/benefit-cuts-since-2010-increased-uk-child-poverty-in-run-up-to-pandemic-says-ifs\">child poverty</a>, lack of special needs nursery provision and inaccessible housing that contribute to parents’ choices to terminate a pregnancy. Upon closer inspection, you could conclude it is the way disabled people are treated outside the womb that is the real “discrimination”. The issues raised by this emotionally intelligent film are of such importance it would have benefited from being a two-parter. Madeley and Reuter – and all the brave women affected – deserve our attention.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/live/2022/aug/22/manchester-united-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T21:59:04Z","webTitle":"Manchester United 2-1 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/aug/22/manchester-united-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2022/aug/22/manchester-united-v-liverpool-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United 2-1 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened","trailText":"<strong>Minute-by-minute report: </strong>United flew out of the blocks to secure their first win of the season and leapfrog their old enemy in the Premier League table.

It was not perfect, we lost the game, and I think we were ready but not 100 percent. If we had this one situation, when we could have equalised, the game would change. But we had to keep changing the game. When you are in a rush, 2-0 down, you mishit crosses and passes, and against their counter-attacking threat it’s really difficult.

We need to come together and address this as a team. It’s easy to talk about it, but we have to go and do it. Fulham, United, they started better than us, and you even go back to last season, Wolves, Real Madrid, Southampton … it needs to change. We’re a close unit, but things need to be said.

And that’s why it’s important not to walk into [Russian president Vladimir] Putin’s trap.”</p> <p>The visit is taking place amid a heated debate in Germany triggered by growing concerns that Russia may completely close down its already considerably reduced gas flows to the country.</p> <p>The government faces pressure to prolong the life of Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations, which are due to go offline by the end of the year as part of a withdrawal strategy announced in 2011.</p> <p>In recent days there have even been calls for it to reinstate the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, which was mothballed by the German government as a reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Scholz said at the weekend a decision on the nuclear power plants would probably be made in the coming days. But Robert Habeck, Germany’s vice-chancellor and economy minister and the leading Green, stressed this would only help to decrease gas consumption by about 2% and said “for the little it would bring us, it’s the wrong decision”.</p> <p>The government has dismissed out of hand the idea of resurrecting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/nord-stream-2-how-putins-pipeline-paralysed-the-west\">defunct Nord Stream 2 project</a>, repeatedly referring to the idea as “morally reprehensible”. But the fact it has been brought up at all illustrates the extent to which the pressure is growing on Scholz to come up with workable strategies to cope with the unprecedented situation, which threatens to plunge the German economy into recession and leave millions facing soaring energy bills and freezing homes.</p> <p>The deals struck with Canada will do little to help Germany in the near future, with this winter and next expected to be beset by an energy shortage and record prices. The head of the intelligence service has warned of the dangers of unrest from a radicalised minority consisting of rightwing extremists and conspiracy theorists, which he said were planning to exploit the situation. Leading economists have warned that rising energy bills on top of other living cost hikes will push increasing numbers of Germans into poverty and could trigger social unrest.</p> <p>Against this backdrop the government is keen to stress that once the infrastructure is in place to support hydrogen and LNG Germany will be on a safer footing. The optics of Scholz and Habeck landing in Montreal with their delegation are seen as sending an important immediate message to German voters that the government is taking action. In recent months it has often come across as stunned into stasis as it reeled from the shock realisation that Europe’s largest economy had made itself dangerously dependent on a single energy source in its pursuit of a green transition.</p> <p>Ahead of the visit, Habeck said Germany was “staring in the face of a very critical winter”.</p> <p>Habeck told German TV that the rapid filling up of national gas storage facilities – which are currently at just under 80% capacity – was encouraging, but warned that Russia could yet further reduce the flow and there was therefore no room for complacency.</p> <p>At present only about 20% of the levels of gas due via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline are reaching Germany. </p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/22/uk-inflation-will-hit-18-per-cent-in-early-2023-says-leading-bank-citi-gas-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T21:32:48Z","webTitle":"UK inflation will hit 18% in early 2023, says leading bank Citi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/22/uk-inflation-will-hit-18-per-cent-in-early-2023-says-leading-bank-citi-gas-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/22/uk-inflation-will-hit-18-per-cent-in-early-2023-says-leading-bank-citi-gas-electricity","fields":{"headline":"UK inflation will hit 18% in early 2023, says leading bank Citi","trailText":"Forecasts updated after 25% and 7% rally in gas and electricity prices respectively last week","byline":"Alex Lawson and Rowena Mason","body":"<p>Inflation in the UK will hit 18% early next year as consumers count the cost of the deepening energy crisis, one of the world’s biggest banks has predicted.</p> <p>The US financial services group Citi said it expected the consumer prices index to breach 18% in the first quarter of 2023, while the retail prices index inflation rate would soar to 21%.</p> <p>Citi’s prediction is significantly higher than previous modelling of the impact of rising costs.

Liz Truss released a plan to “put the West Midlands at the heart of our economic revival” on Monday night, without mentioning inflation.

Mighty heroes doing battle! Megabucks cinematography! Our long-awaited Game of Thrones spin-off isn’t doing things by halves<br>","byline":"Tom Huddleston","body":"<p><em>Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching House of the Dragon. Do not read on unless you have </em><em>seen episode one.</em></p> <h2>‘The only thing that could tear down the House of the Dragon … was itself’</h2> <p>And so it begins. After at least seven series pitches (several of which are still officially in development), endless scripts, one failed pilot, countless millions of dollars and an interruptive pandemic, we finally have a Game of Thrones spin-off. It’s probably fair to say that never in the history of television has so much been riding on the shoulders of one show – at least until Amazon’s even pricier The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power makes its streaming debut in about a fortnight.</p> <p>So has it been worth it? Will this elaborate prequel – set roughly 200 years before the death of Ned Stark and all the bloodshed that ensued – manage to thrill the hardcore fans, entice new ones, restore the reputation of Westeros and reassure those who hated the way Game of Thrones ended, while in the process establishing its own place as a classic of fantasy television? On the strength of a single episode, let’s just say it’s looking complicated.</p> <p>But nearly everything about House of the Dragon is complicated – if you are not a GoT deep-diver, you may be flummoxed. We start with a brief prelude set in the year 101, during the reign of the Targaryen kings, those statuesque blonde outsiders who, some centuries before, had conquered Westeros thanks to their possession of the most powerful weapon known to man: dragons. But King Jaehaerys Targaryen is dying, with no sons to sit on the Iron Throne. Following a council of noble houses, the decision is made to skip over his most direct living heir, his granddaughter Rhaenys (Eve Best), in favour of her cousin, Viserys (Paddy Considine), thereby reaffirming a masculine lineage.</p> <p>But skip forward a few years, and that precedent is about to be tested. For Viserys himself has no sons, only a high-spirited teenage daughter, Rhaenyra (Milly Alcock). Which means that, by tradition, if he were to die unexpectedly, the throne would pass to his brother Daemon (Matt Smith) – who is, in noble parlance, something of a git. The only thing that can save the realm from a potentially destructive power struggle is the impending birth of Viserys’s second child. If it’s a healthy boy, everything will be fine. If not – let there be blood.</p> <p>Fittingly, the episode proper opens in the company of dragons: a cloudbusting flight over King’s Landing in the company of Rhaenyra and her great wyrm Syrax, so giddy and swooping that Limahl wouldn’t seem out of place on the soundtrack. It is to be our last glimpse of freedom for some time, as we move indoors to a lengthy, gloomy conclave of the King’s Small Council, entering midway through a debate between King Varys, Hand of the King Ser Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), Lord Corlys Valeryon (Steve Toussaint), a renowned seafarer and husband of the aforementioned Rhaenys Targaryen, and assorted Masters and Maesters.</p> <p>Small Council meetings were, of course, a highlight of the original Thrones, but they tended to be enlivened by the spiky sibling banter between Tyrion and Cersei, or the bickering schemes of Littlefinger and Varys. There is no such fun to be had here – from the browbeaten Viserys on down this is a terse and brooding bunch, dropping enticing hints of happenings elsewhere (pirates in the Stepstones! Power struggles in Essos!) but focusing most of their attention on how to solve a problem like Prince Daemon.</p> <h2>‘King’s Landing will learn to fear the colour gold!’</h2> <p>That is where things start to get a bit more lively, because Daemon is one of those characters that Game of Thrones thrives on: a preening, scheming, bloodthirsty shitbag with a lust for power and zero scruples. Matt Smith’s appearance is, at first, a little disconcerting: with his platinum tresses and prominent ears he looks like a rogue elf who has somehow magicked himself into the wrong universe. But his behaviour soon serves to dispel any such concerns: Daemon is the sort of full-blown psychopath who would send Elrond and Galadriel away screaming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"293b42af946946e5186cbd7eb917a75df3f31870\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/293b42af946946e5186cbd7eb917a75df3f31870/0_42_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Corlys Valeryon (Steve Toussaint) seafarer and husband of Rhaenys Targaryen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Corlys Valeryon (Steve Toussaint) seafarer and husband of Rhaenys Targaryen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following a brief glimpse of him squatting on the Iron Throne – a seat he would clearly love to occupy full time – we follow Daemon to his day job as Commander of the City Watch, a role that has allowed him to indulge his penchant for violence while also building up a private army of hooligan warriors loyal only to him. With a tournament looming to celebrate the birth of the royal babe, Daemon spots a chance to knock some heads, dispatching his ruffians to clear the scum off the streets and haul them back for a spot of extremely rough medieval justice. Thieves lose hands, and rapists lose … well, let’s just say the torture meted out to poor Theon Greyjoy turns out to have a precedent.</p> <p>The jousting itself forms the episode’s big set-piece, reminding us how far this franchise has come, at least in terms of scale. In the cash-strapped first series of GoT, the great festival attended by Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark consisted of approximately 20 overdressed actors perched on benches next to a field. Now we’re treated to the sight of hundreds of whooping digital extras, epic crane shots and smash-cut bouts of bloody violence, as the realm’s mightiest heroes come to waggle sticks at one another. It’s also an excuse to introduce some more new faces, notably Ser Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel), a pretty boy with a steady lance and a yearning for young Rhaenyra, and Lady Alicent Hightower (Emily Carey), daughter and, it would seem, pawn of the aforementioned Lord Otto.</p> <p>But there’s trouble back at the palace: the queen has gone into labour, and all is not well. Cue an operatic sequence of cross-cut brutality, as knights and their mounts fall screaming while a few hundred yards away doctors fight to save the lives of the queen and her son. The unplanned caesarean section that follows is by far the episode’s heaviest moment, a scene of medieval horror guaranteed to make any mother and/or midwife wince. And the outcome is – who guessed? – equally awful, as neither mother or baby prove strong enough to last the night.</p> <h2>‘Dracarys!’</h2> <p>One of the most notable things about this opening episode is how geographically claustrophobic it is: while the first instalment of GoT took us north of the wall and across the Narrow Sea, this takes place almost entirely within the walls of King’s Landing. Following the tournament there’s an enticing cut to a storm-tossed sea – are we finally going to find out what’s happening elsewhere in the Seven Kingdoms? But no: the camera pans, and there are all the same characters standing by the Queen’s pyre as the Red Keep looms on the horizon.</p> <p>And how will the pyre be ignited? By dragon fire, of course, summoned from the snout of Syrax when his mistress speaks a single word: dracarys, the memorable catchphrase of another plucky heroine (with, we should note, an extremely similar hairdo). So will Rhaenyra go down the same dark path as her descendant Daenerys, or will she manage to cling to the last scraps of her innocence? Well, this is Westeros …</p> <p>The episode draws to a close with another bout of furious scene-setting: Daemon shoots his mouth off in a brothel about his dead nephew, the “heir for a day”, and how that affects his own chances for promotion. Word gets back to King Viserys and he goes understandably ballistic, stripping his brother of his claim to the throne and handing it instead to Rhaenyra, shattering that aforementioned precedent. By the time the credits roll – soundtracked, inevitably, by Rahmin Diwadi’s beloved theme, with additional choral chanting – there’s a feeling that after a rather austere, chatty and backstory-laden intro, all the pieces are finally in place. Let the games commence!</p> <h2>Additional notes</h2> <ul> <li><p>It’s a source of both pride and regret to find myself writing these recaps: the Guardian’s original Game of Thrones expert was, of course, the great Sarah Hughes, who passed away in March of last year. I’ve decided to keep to the format she used (if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it), and will do my best to live up to her witty, insightful recaps. In the meantime, I urge you all to read Sarah’s essay collection, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/27/holding-tight-letting-go-by-sarah-hughes-review-lessons-from-a-life-well-lived\">Holding Tight, Letting Go</a>.</p></li> <li><p>While I have read Fire and Blood – George RR Martin’s densely detailed history of the Targaryen dynasty, from which House of the Dragon is more or less directly drawn – my memories of it are sketchy, and I decided not to revisit it for these recaps. I’d rather be surprised, along with everyone else, by the inevitable twists and turns.</p></li> <li><p>Speaking of which, who do we think is going to be this season’s sacrificial lamb – the character who seems central to everything until they suddenly get knocked off, thereby proving that absolutely no one is safe? King Viserys seems too obvious – he’s already got some kind of weeping, healer-proof sore on his back, and his death is surely necessary for the plot to really kick in. So who else is in the frame? Ser Otto? Daemon? Rhaenyra? Now that would put the cat among the dragons…</p></li> <li><p>While we’re on the subject of Rhaenyra, the scene in which the young princess had the entire plot of the original Game of Thrones (or “song of ice and fire”) recounted to her in capsule form by her dad was an odd one. Yes, it served to link the prequel more securely to its progenitor, but it did also have the slight drawback of making all this feel like the appetiser for a main course we have already eaten.</p></li> <li><p>Another memorable moment for all the right reasons was that queasy scene between Otto Hightower and his daughter, as the Lord sends Alicent to comfort the dying king – presumably trying to set them up, just hours after his wife’s death. Slyly played by Ifans, something tells me this Hightower is every bit as dangerous as his rival, Daemon – he is just less barefaced about it.</p></li> <li><p>As with The Rings of Power, the producers have clearly taken a determined stab at diversity: there were more faces of colour in the tourney crowd than there would have been in the original GoT, while Lord Corlys and his kids do seem set to play a fairly central role in the wars to come.</p></li> <li><p>Lastly, those flaming chandeliers have to be a health and safety nightmare. I would not be able to relax at work with half a ton of burning steel suspended directly above my head.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Nudity count:</strong></p> <p>Anyone who expected #MeToo to have altered the nudity landscape in Westeros will be sorely disappointed: once again it is just the ladies baring all, unless you count a sweaty shot of Matt Smith’s heaving chest and a pair of bloody bollocks on the chopping block. If they have to shoehorn gratuitous rumpo into every single episode – and let’s face it, they probably do – is it wrong to demand a smidge of equality?</p> <p><strong>Violence count:</strong></p> <p>The massacre of the miscreants proved a fine excuse for some good old limb-lopping: hands tumbled into baskets, several new eunuchs were created and absolutely no one got to speak to his lawyer. The tournament, too, was awash in gore, though nothing to rival the (original) Mountain chopping his own horse’s head off in the first series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60b836103034e6fd8b981f3f74d4912c642a5071\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60b836103034e6fd8b981f3f74d4912c642a5071/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Paterson, who plays Lord Lymon Beesbury, at the London premiere of House of the Dragon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Paterson, who plays Lord Lymon Beesbury, at the London premiere of House of the Dragon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maja Smiejkowska/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Random Brit of the week:</strong></p> <p>It was nice to spend a moment in the relaxing company of lugubrious Scot Bill Paterson, playing Viserys’s Master of Coin, Lord Lymon Beesbury.

As captivating as it is gruesome, it’s like a greatest hits playlist of Westeros at its meatiest","byline":"Rebecca Nicholson","body":"<p>The opening episode of House of the Dragon (Sky Atlantic) is simply spectacular. For an hour, it rattles through everything that made its predecessor, Game of Thrones, such a titan of the small screen, especially when it was in its prime. It is a greatest hits playlist of Westeros at its meatiest. Family members make promises they cannot keep as they connive and betray each other, in secret and in plain sight. There is jousting, romping and fighting. There are dragons, of course. There is a drunken orgy, an axe to the face, a caesarean without anaesthetic, seeping wounds, severed limbs and severed organs, too. George RR Martin’s world struts its way back on to our screens with utter confidence and brio.</p> <p>It is as captivating as it is gruesome. A prequel to Game of Thrones, it begins 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen, and it chronicles the fall of the Targaryen dynasty, though after watching the first six episodes of squabbling and scheming, the real question is how it can possibly take two centuries to collapse. It opens with the Lear-esque prospect of a failing king choosing his heir, and though the people shift slightly over the course of the series, succession is the thread that keeps it all together.</p> <p>Episodes one to five centre on young Princess Rhaenyra (played by Milly Alcock), the only child of King Viserys I (Paddy Considine). Rhaenyra is a strong, ambitious and courageous teenage girl, and would be an ideal heir, were it not for the fact that the Lords have already made it clear, in very recent history, that tradition demands a king, and not a queen, on the Iron Throne. In this world, royal women are breeding machines and bargaining chips. “I am glad I am not a woman,” says one male character, later in the series. It could be the tagline for the whole thing.</p> <p>Amid much grumbling about Rhaenyra, Viserys’s brother steps forward. Daemon is a hotheaded peacock who refuses to play by any rules he considers beneath him. The political wheel turns on a rumour, and as Viserys begins to appear frail, there is a growing sense of urgency about where the wheel will stop. I’d argue that Game of Thrones thrived on the strength of its villains, far more than the virtues of its heroes, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/26/matt-smith-on-the-crown-i-found-a-lot-to-celebrate-in-philip-season-two-interview\">Matt Smith </a>plays Daemon as a vain and bitter man who nevertheless cannot quite betray his family name. He is a nasty piece of work, for sure, a misogynist and a sadist, but until episode six, he is the only truly despicable main player in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/13/dragon-fire-and-fury-game-of-thrones-has-turned-on-its-bloodthirsty-fans\">King’s Landing.</a> House of the Dragon takes its time to drip-feed the down-in-the-dirt baddies that are so enjoyable to rail against.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb3e5728a006c52bf998801e00f852861614fce1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb3e5728a006c52bf998801e00f852861614fce1/0_393_5892_3535/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘It opens with the Lear-esque prospect of a failing king choosing his heir.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It opens with the Lear-esque prospect of a failing king choosing his heir.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/2022 Home Box Office, Inc.

To mangle the words of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/20/elvis-presley-willy-wonka-almost-made-west-side-story-godfather\">Elvis Presley</a>, it is a little more conversation, a little less action. There are sprawling fights and bloody beatings, and one particularly epic battle scene (for the uninitiated, the “Crab Feeder” might sound cute, though wait and see how that works out), but after the opener, much of this is about whispered conversations and heated discussions over loyalties, betrayals, allegiances and which children should be joined in matrimony in order to minimise the political fallout. There is a lot of dialogue.</p> <p>There is a specificity that both works in its favour and occasionally weakens its impact. It is incredibly rich, and it has a narrative focus that is necessary, considering the huge cast of characters. Obviously, it is about the Targaryen dynasty, and though other familiar names are mentioned – a Tully here, a Stark there, an arrogant Lannister dropping by – this is the Targaryens’ story. With such detail, if it had darted between Houses and their various seats of power, then I am not sure I would have been able to keep up. Even so, I did miss the breadth of Game of Thrones, and its ability to move between locations, each so vivid in their own different ways.</p> <p>Having skipped forward a few years here and there, it jumps forward another decade for episode six, during which time everyone has a lot of children. (There is as much childbirth in this as an episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/07/one-born-every-minute-review-childbirth-needs-no-added-drama\">One Born Every Minute</a>, though oddly enough, it lacks that warm fuzzy feeling.) A handful of the characters are recast as adults, and the action is reset, though not as definitively as it first seems. This leap might have been jarring, but this is so elegant and proper, so obviously well-made, that there was no real chance of a misstep like that. House of the Dragon is gorgeous, opulent television, cinematic and big, pushing at the edges of what TV can do. It is just that little bit less fun than its predecessor.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/22/nyc-real-estate-brokers-rent","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T21:02:54Z","webTitle":"‘I feel so guilty’: the highs, lows, and hustle of New York housing brokers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/22/nyc-real-estate-brokers-rent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/22/nyc-real-estate-brokers-rent","fields":{"headline":"‘I feel so guilty’: the highs, lows, and hustle of New York housing brokers","trailText":"As rental applications surge, jobseekers have flooded to the industry.

After a doctor’s visit, he found out he had mercury poisoning.</p> <p>His first few years as a broker were rough. Working at a “boiler room” brokerage, he got acquainted with what he calls the “dark underbelly” of the industry. “The script is basically to lie to people: ‘Put up [an ad] that says ‘no fee’, and once you get ’em in, say, ‘Oh, that’s rented, but I have something else,’” he recalls managers telling him. He says they insisted their employees “just get [the client] out to the appointment, then pump the fear and pressure them into making a decision”.</p> <p>“I was like, ‘Ahh, I can’t do that,’” Sanai says. After three years of scraping by as a broker, he personalized a more ethical approach to renting, switched agencies, and became Douglas Elliman’s top-ranked New York rental agent in 2019.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can work 80 hours a week and make zero dollars</p> <footer> <cite>Anna Klenkar</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But less than a year later, he watched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/ng-interactive/2022/feb/08/new-york-rent-housing-market-pandemic-trends\">pandemic drive a mass exodus</a> from the city. Brokers like Sanai, who are typically unsalaried and work on a 100% commission basis, saw their incomes evaporate. In August of 2020, he left a showing when his client didn’t show up. “She emailed me, ‘You should come back,’” he recalls. “I don’t need you at this time, you need me.’” It took him four weeks to rent the one-bedroom on West 37th Street, even with a “great deal”.</p> <p>Today, a one-bedroom in the same building rents sight unseen in days, and the power dynamic between brokers and renters has flipped. In contrast to 2020’s renter’s market, this is an owner’s market, which, in New York City, means it’s a landlord’s market, and, by extension, a broker’s market. Last month, the average rent for an apartment in Manhattan hit a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/14/average-rent-in-manhattan-was-a-record-5000-last-month.html\">record high of $5,000</a>, up 29% over last year with demand and prices expected to keep surging into the fall.

But for many rental agents, it’s been a boon for business. Bidding wars have become routine. Certain apartments rent sight unseen. In July,<a href=\"https://www.brownstoner.com/real-estate-market/broker-fee-brooklyn-rental/\"> 45%</a> of apartments citywide required broker fees, compared with just 25% in 2021.</p> <p>A hotter market often means some brokers and landlords can get away with more unethical behavior, from posting bait-and-switch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/09/real-estate-housing-rental-listings-tricks-new-york\">BS apartment listings</a> to starting “<a href=\"https://www.brickunderground.com/rent/bidding-war-broker-fee-rent-stabilized-apartments-nyc\">broker fee bidding wars</a>” even for rent-stabilized apartments. (There are <a href=\"https://www.brickunderground.com/rent/realty-bites-broker-fee-limits-laws-rent-stabilized-apartments-nyc\">no legal limits</a> on how much a broker can charge in fees, but it is typically 15% of annual rent, or one month’s rent.)</p> <p>“People are more desperate. There’s very little regulation,” Sanai says. “I’ve heard stories of people saying, ‘We really wanted this place, but we’re pretty sure the broker took cash on the side from someone’” – a practice that’s illegal, but difficult to regulate.</p> <p>Aside from struggling with guilt, possibly, this may seem entirely like a win for brokers, but Sanai now finds himself fielding hundreds of inquiries a day, presiding over packed open houses, and listening to “sob stories” from desperate apartment-hunters. “It was difficult to navigate when you were praying that someone would show up to your open house during Covid,” he says. “But it’s just as difficult to navigate when you have multiple people who want the same product.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/10/new-york-renting-criminal-record\">‘They’re shut out of the market’: the struggle to rent with a criminal record</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other brokers are indeed taking it all in stride. “The rental market is crazy right now in New York City, and so I have a treat for you guys,” Anthony Park announced to his 179,000 TikTok followers in a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@anthonyrichpark/video/7117387304716733742?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1\">video</a> last month. “We have a one-bedroom in the West Village that’s going to be coming on to the market very soon.

The bedroom can’t fit much more than a full bed, and the kitchen has an “eating counter” but no room for a table.</p> <p>“If you’re willing to take it sight unseen, [and] to put in more than $4,250 a month, which is what it’s going to be listed for, then shoot me an email,” says Park, 29, who started working at Brown Harris Stevens in March 2021 and now runs a popular <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/09/success/tiktok-real-estate-agents/index.html\">“Real Estate TikTok</a>” account, posting housing porn of $135m penthouses and river views from “<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@anthonyrichpark/video/7090950578951474474?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1\">Billionaire’s Row</a>”.</p> <p>Although his videos – and those of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/08/business/tiktok-real-estate-apartments/index.html\">other NYC brokers</a> who have <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/trending-on-tiktok-nyc-apartments/\">taken to posting </a><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@claudia_nycagent?\">listings on TikTok</a> – are sometimes met with hostile comments (“Looks like a torture chamber,” said one user of the West Village apartment; “Scammy af,” said another), Park is unfazed, knowing this place will fly off the market.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When you see people paying such large fees up front for these units, it does make you gulp.

While TikTok ultimately yielded no takers on Park’s proposal, the “torture chamber” did rent for $200 a month above asking price, to a tenant who beat out several other above-ask applications at an appointment-only open house.</p> <p>“People were like, ‘How are you demanding so much? That’s ridiculous,’” says Park. His response: “New York is expensive. You can easily go to some other city and find very affordable housing.

What are these people going to do?’”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"tiktok video of broker taking a selfie with applicants\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahloukiernan/video/7095110039886630187&quot; data-video-id=&quot;7095110039886630187&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@sarahloukiernan&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahloukiernan?refer=embed&quot;&gt;@sarahloukiernan&lt;/a&gt; the apartment market is insane in Brooklyn, maybe 50 people for 1 apartment &lt;a title=&quot;brooklyn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/brooklyn?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;nyc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nyc?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#nyc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;apartment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/apartment?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#apartment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;newyork&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/newyork?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#newyork&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;ny&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ny?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#ny&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;searchforwondermom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/searchforwondermom?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#SearchForWonderMom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;♬ Elevator Music - Bohoman&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/Elevator-Music-6781515050600368129?refer=embed&quot;&gt;♬ Elevator Music - Bohoman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>About 80% of brokers don’t renew their licenses after one year. “It’s really hard to be a rental agent long term,” says Klenkar, who worked in rentals for years before switching to sales full-time. “You can work 80 hours a week and make zero dollars. I worked so much my first two years and barely made ends meet. We’re 1099 [tax forms], we don’t have salaries. I have to pay like $800 a month out of pocket for health insurance. We expect that half the industry will leave in the next 18 months, because whenever there’s a recession, people want to go back to W-2 jobs.”</p> <p>Estimates of the average income – made entirely by broker’s fees either paid by the landlord, or, in an owner’s market, by the potential renter – of a broker in New York City range between<a href=\"https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Rental-Agent-Salary-in-New-York-City,NY\"> $36,000</a> and<a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/new-york-city-rental-agent-salary-SRCH_IL.0,13_IM615_KO14,26.htm\"> $47,000</a> a year, meaning the average agent can’t afford the average monthly rent of $5,000 themselves.</p> <p>Kai Dailey, 27, an agent with Compass since 2020, says that in the past month he reduced the number of rental clients he represents and shifted his focus to sales. He describes an atmosphere of stiff competition, burnout and strained relationships with clients in the rental market.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/10/new-york-apartments-photos-rent\">‘They’ll have to carry me out in a box’: inside the apartments of the luckiest renters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’m working from 7am until 9pm every day. The emails, texts, phone calls, they don’t stop. And to some people, you’re an incredible agent. [But] to a majority, you might not be able to get back in contact. The rental market moves faster than you can keep up.”</p> <p>Some agents describe feeling guilty watching renters pay staggering rates for tiny spaces. “When you see people paying such large fees up front for these units, it does make you gulp. Deep,” says Dailey.</p> <p>***</p> <p>On a recent Sunday afternoon, 25 people stood sweating in a narrow stairwell on West 11th Street, waiting to see a one-bedroom apartment Sanai was showing for $4,195 a month. He ushered them quickly through the small rooms, fielding questions like “Why is the lamp in the bathroom super hot?” (“It’s a heat lamp”) and “What happens if someone lies in their application?” (“Then we’ll get the documentation that shows they’re lying and move on to the next applicant”). He had been showing apartments since 10am.</p> <p>“In general, people hate brokers. And if you thought people hated us before, now it’s just another level of dislike,” says Sanai. “I wish my calling was being a surgeon or something that helped society, but this is it.”</p> <p>Visitors to the open house included a 32-year-old construction manager who said being a broker was a “cheap job” – “like, ‘Wham, bam, thank you ma’am.’”</p> <p>“It feels like we’re doing all the legwork and just giving them a fee,” said Lucy Malone, a 26-year-old fashion designer. “It feels like they don’t add that much value.”</p> <p>At one point during the showing, Sanai reminded the crowd that he would have zero say in whose application the landlord greenlit: “It’s not up to me,” he said. While he wields more leverage today than in 2020, he notes that many overestimate brokers’ power, conflating their position in the housing market with that of landlords and developers.</p> <p>“We’re middlemen. We’re basically puppets. If the owner says, ‘We want $4,000 for this apartment,’ I don’t have a say in pricing. I’ll say, ‘That number is a little high,’ and they’ll say, ‘If anyone can get this number, it’s you. Good luck.’ And then someone won’t get chosen and they’ll send a nasty email, like, ‘This is bullshit,’ but we really have no say. It’s tough, because I don’t want to disappoint someone.”</p> <p>He adds: “I really do sympathize with how difficult it is to get an apartment.”</p> <p>The perks of being a broker in New York City today are not lost on him, but he doesn’t forget where he started, or how quickly the market can reverse course. He says: “Every now and then I’ll have a can of tuna just to remember how it tastes.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/22/uk-athletics-christian-malcolm-defend-decision-summer","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T21:00:43Z","webTitle":"UK Athletics defends Christian Malcolm departure despite golden summer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/22/uk-athletics-christian-malcolm-defend-decision-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/22/uk-athletics-christian-malcolm-defend-decision-summer","fields":{"headline":"UK Athletics defends Christian Malcolm departure despite golden summer","trailText":"Dina Asher-Smith praised Christian Malcolm, whose position will be effectively scrapped in a restructuring process, for his role in Britain’s medal haul this summer","byline":"Sean Ingle in Munich","body":"<p>UK Athletics has defended its decision effectively to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/17/christian-malcolm-disappointed-after-olympic-head-coach-role-scrapped-uk-athletics\" title=\"\">remove</a> the Olympic head coach, Christian Malcolm, despite a summer of success with Britain winning seven world championship medals and 20 at the European championships.</p> <p>Malcolm, who will leave UKA after his role was scrapped this year, was praised by Dina Asher-Smith for creating a team spirit that allowed Britain to thrive during his two years in charge.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/21/contrasting-fortunes-for-britains-4x100m-relay-teams-in-munich-finals\">Ghosts of relays past return as Britain’s women suffer baton disaster in Munich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We’ve been so happy,” said Asher-Smith after Britain’s joint second-best medal tally at the European championships. “I was saying this to his face straight after I finished my 200m. Him being a former athlete and then coming into that leadership role, we’re a happy team and that’s reflected in performances.</p> <p>“The medal haul in Munich has been fantastic. And at the world champs we almost equalled our record, too. We are a happy squad, we are a happy team and I hope that you got that vibe as well from us being on track. I definitely know that to run fast, you’ve got to be happy.”</p> <p>Britain won six gold medals in Munich, while Keely Hodgkinson, Laura Muir, Matt Hudson-Smith and Jake Wightman won medals at each of the big three events: the world championships, the Commonwealth Games and the European championships. But it has also been noticeable how good the mood has been behind the scenes, which many have attributed to Malcolm and the team manager, Paula Dunn.</p> <p>However, the chair of UKA, Ian Beattie, said it was right to scrap Malcolm’s role as part of an internal restructuring and replace it with a technical director who will be responsible for Olympic and Paralympic performance. The new position will be taken up by the highly regarded Stephen Maguire next month.</p> <p>“With Christian we knew a few months ago that it was a restructuring,” Beattie said. “We always had confidence in Christian and his professionalism. We were happy to have him here with the team.</p> <p>“I’d like to pay credit to Christian, Paula, the team management and the rest of the team because they’ve done a fantastic job. He leaves with our best wishes.</p> <p>“Stephen will be starting at the beginning of September and will look at his requirements and structure with the performance team as he sees it.”</p> <p>Asked about the difference in the two roles, Beattie said: “Stephen’s role is wider in terms of the whole technical performance side. Christian had a specific remit and that didn’t cover the para side. Stephen will look after the whole performance area.”</p> <p>Beattie sidestepped whether it was odd to get rid of Malcolm after a successful summer. “I would rather that we’re in this position having had a really successful summer than I would that we hadn’t,” he said. “It’s credit to Christian and the rest of the team.”</p> <p>Malcolm was not made available by UKA. In a statement he said: “All I wanted to do as head coach was leave the sport in a strong position and lay the foundations for those who follow me. I wish everyone all the best over the next few years.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/22/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T20:59:14Z","webTitle":"Rashford caps Manchester United’s first win for Ten Hag as Liverpool woes go on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/22/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/22/manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Rashford caps Manchester United’s first win for Ten Hag as Liverpool woes go on","trailText":"Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford inspired Manchester United to a 2-1 defeat of their rivals Liverpool, giving the new manager Erik ten Hag his first win","byline":"Jamie Jackson at Old Trafford","body":"<p>Manchester United reduced Liverpool’s heavy metal play to pliant putty in their hands via a staggering transformation after the humiliation of two consecutive losses.</p> <p>How a team trounced 4-0 at Brentford last time out could outfight, out-skill and, most of all, outrun an opponent who defeated them 9-0 on aggregate last term is the definition of sport’s ability to invigorate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/22/casemiro-bewildering-glimpse-topsy-turvy-life-manchester-united-liverpool\">Casemiro has bewildering glimpse of topsy-turvy life at Manchester United | Andy Hunter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On a night where the latest anti-Glazer protests had up to 10,000 marching to Old Trafford, United were a picture of bravery and quality from David de Gea in goal to Marcus Rashford at centre-forward, his second-half strike bookending Jadon Sancho’s early opener.</p> <p>Liverpool were a ghost side; here, allowed zero leeway to impose themselves because Erik ten Hag’s team did exactly this in a victory which means United leapfrog their rivals, who are yet to enjoy a league win this season.</p> <p>Against a backdrop of “we want Glazers out” United threatened first. Slick interplay featuring Scott McTominay, Sancho and Bruno Fernandes had the ball zipping through the middle. Rashford motored on to it but when he unloaded Virgil van Dijk blocked.</p> <p>Next, Rashford barged aside Trent Alexander-Arnold, the defender impeded him, and Christian Eriksen’s free-kick, taken on the edge of the area, earned a corner. It yielded nothing but United were in the contest, Liverpool had no foothold. Next Anthony Elanga, one of Ten Hag’s changes, was slipped in by Fernandes and his shot struck Alisson’s left post, drawing oohs from the crowd.</p> <p>What followed was a sweet back-to-front sequence that finished with United scoring. Raphaël Varane made a superb intervention, taking the ball from Roberto Firmino’s toes in the area. Those in red moved upfield, before Elanga found Sancho, who feinted, left James Milner on his backside, and coolly beat Alisson.</p> <p>Exhilaration surged through the home side. For Liverpool, Milner gave Van Dijk a telling off about something, and Jürgen Klopp was a manager marooned in the technical area. So far so good for United, a pattern that continued when the effervescent Elanga turned Alexander-Arnold and drew a foul. This time Eriksen’s free-kick was tipped over by Alisson.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d83f945615710739c5022faf9e173fb1d206b31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d83f945615710739c5022faf9e173fb1d206b31/0_215_3146_1888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jadon Sancho evades James Milner’s challenge before firing home for Manchester United.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jadon Sancho evades James Milner’s challenge before firing home for Manchester United.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The intrigue had been around which United would show up – and which Liverpool. At kick-off the former had zero points, the latter two. Casemiro was paraded pre-game, with the transfer to be official once the Brazil international is granted a visa. Ten Hag’s headline selection call was dropping Harry Maguire and Cristiano Ronaldo. The removal of his captain and arguably his best player was proving a brave move as four of the XI who started at Brentford were gone, Tyrell Malacia and McTominay replacing Luke Shaw and Fred.</p> <p>Klopp had 10 players unavailable including several injured A-listers: Thiago Alcântara, Diogo Jota and Naby Keïta, plus the suspended Darwin Núñez. The manager’s preference for the functional 36-year-old Milner instead of Fabinho, a natural holding player whose legs were the best part of a decade younger, was a head-scratcher.</p> <p>Klopp was in moan mode when Luis Díaz was penalised for dropping Diogo Dalot. In his view the decision should have gone the other way. At play here was frustration at his side’s potency deficit, summed up by Liverpool’s first corner coming half an hour into the game.</p> <p>The visitors showed some resurgence when Alexander-Arnold’s cross was stabbed away by Varane and Harvey Elliott’s shot had to be stopped. Klopp’s charges rued their ill-luck, however, when Milner headed a corner and Fernandes crashed the ball towards his own goal only to be saved by Lisandro Martínez who blocked on the line and hacked away.</p> <p>For United to reestablish supremacy in the second half, they could do without McTominay ceding the ball by his area but Fernandes was there to help his teammate out and douse the danger. Liverpool, enjoyed this ascendancy but lacked quality, a wild Salah volley emblematic of their problems. So United, their support as loud as in recent memory, proceeded to show the Egypt international how to do it far better via a classic counter.</p> <p>Henderson miscontrolled and Anthony Martial, on for Elanga at the break, steered the ball to Rashford. Bursting in, the maligned forward beat Alisson with a sweet finish for a first league strike since January (and one that survived a marginal VAR check for offside).</p> <p>Ecstasy and delirium ensued and the question was what adjustment might Klopp make to halt United’s fever-pitch play? The answer was to hook Henderson for Fabinho, the leaden-footed Milner somehow surviving.</p> <p>Still, though, United were a juggernaut. From deep in their own territory Dalot headed to Sancho who relayed the ball to Martial. The striker skated forward and, when he tried again to find Sancho, the ball came back to him before Liverpool somehow survived.</p> <p>With nine minutes left Salah gave Liverpool a lifeline, forcing home after the ball broke at a corner. Ronaldo was introduced as United hoped to hang on for a rousing win. They did.</p> <p>Sancho said: “Last week hurt a lot – we had to bounce back. We have to produce in every single game. We move on.” Ten Hag’s tenure is finally up and running.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/23/morning-mail-support-for-power-bill-caps-parents-struggle-with-gp-costs-paine-plans-return","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T20:55:34Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: support for power bill caps, parents struggle with GP costs, Paine plans return","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/23/morning-mail-support-for-power-bill-caps-parents-struggle-with-gp-costs-paine-plans-return","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/23/morning-mail-support-for-power-bill-caps-parents-struggle-with-gp-costs-paine-plans-return","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: support for power bill caps, parents struggle with GP costs, Paine plans return","trailText":"<strong>Tuesday: </strong>Poll shows<strong> </strong>more than two thirds of Australians want help with power bills.

Football will be the breath of fresh air that reminds people what we are fighting and dying for.”</p> <p>Only last Wednesday did Pavelko feel certain the sport would return on the date, one day before the celebration of Ukrainian independence, he had earmarked. That was when the security protocols were finally signed off after exhaustive conversations that were not always plain sailing. Should fans be allowed in? That question was easy enough to answer during wartime. Ought the precise time and location of games be kept secret? That was up for discussion but ultimately rejected. What will happen if and when air raid sirens interrupt play? Nobody can be entirely sure how that will feel but games may be abandoned if they sound for longer than an hour. Referees will confer with military advisers to make that decision.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/ukraine-fc-kryvbas-ignore-nearby-shells-as-new-season-looms\">‘We’re not afraid’: Ukraine side FC Kryvbas ignore nearby shells as new season looms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The list of considerations is sprawling. This is new, barely precedented territory and tweaks are expected along the way. “It’s been a great challenge in my life,” says Pavelko, speaking animatedly at the FA’s headquarters. Work there never really stopped: as soon as Russia invaded there were round‑the‑clock efforts to evacuate teams, players, referees and coaches; efforts to help on the humanitarian front quickly followed and then came the issue of getting back under way.</p> <p>Top-flight clubs were unanimous in giving it a go but two meetings with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in late May were pivotal in garnering political will. “I raised the question and heard a firm ‘Yes’,” he says. “They were conversations about what our society needs right now. It needs a strong signal. The president was prepared to give us everything we needed to let the world know Ukraine is a strong country and that we are confident in our victory.”</p> <p>Pavelko spends the next half‑hour offering a whirlwind precis of the visits – he has travelled to every region of Ukraine at least twice since February – and personal stories that convinced him football was fundamental to the country’s resistance and recovery. He lands upon one in particular that made the job required of him crystal clear. At a hospital in Zaporizhzhia, the city that received thousands of evacuees from Mariupol, he met a boy who had sustained 18 bone fractures along with shrapnel wounds to the head and chest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every participant in this season will inscribe themselves into the history of world football</p> <footer> <cite>Andriy Pavelko</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The 12-year-old’s blood pressure had dropped to the extent he was barely alive on arrival and his survival is yet another tale of the local medics’ heroic work amid impossible conditions. Pavelko ascertained that he had been playing football shortly before his evacuation and that his favourite player was Oleksandr Zinchenko. He dialled Ukraine’s vice-captain immediately and the boy, unable to move and welling up with tears, took a video call with his idol. “He was a hair’s width from death, much like the rest of Ukraine,” Pavelko says. Happily, his treatment has continued in Germany and he is learning to walk again.</p> <p>These tales of kinship, bravery and, at times, tragedy could fill numerous books and Pavelko says he would willingly write one when Ukraine has eventually prevailed. People such as the boy in Mariupol unwittingly delivered the message he had been seeking to articulate: that, far from being mere frippery in times of unimaginable horror, football has its place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00eff93ea964c26b7ff9232590865c5397ae2630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00eff93ea964c26b7ff9232590865c5397ae2630/0_116_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andriy Pavelko, the Ukrainian FA president.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andriy Pavelko, the Ukrainian FA president.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Harris/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the opener that will be Kyiv’s Olympiyskiy stadium, which hosted the Euro 2012 final and 2018 Champions League final. On a week when Zelenskiy has been among those warning of potential Russian attacks around independence day, there will inevitably be breaths held. Those attending will have to guarantee that, if instructed, they will relocate to the ground’s air raid shelter. It will be surreal and perhaps discomfiting but Pavelko makes no apologies.</p> <p>“We are a brave nation,” he says. “This is an important step to raise morale of both the civilian and military personnel: to remind them they have a future. I met with our referees recently and gave them a simple message: that every participant in this will inscribe themselves into the history of world football. It’s a monumental achievement that they will be able to share with their grandchildren, and the grandkids will brag about it to their peers.”</p> <p>It is also a fair achievement that the 16-strong top flight has lost only FC Mariupol and Desna Chernihiv, both of whose operations are on hold. But the postponement of FC Lviv’s opener against Minaj, amid suggestions they will struggle to fulfil fixtures, indicates the quest to keep Ukrainian football on the rails is not yet won. Further down the leagues it is a bleaker story: at least two dozen teams have been forced to suspend their activities or dissolve. The second tier recommences on Saturday but, beneath those at the top, uncertainty still prevails.</p> <p>The hope is, though, that Tuesday will send a ripple of optimism through the entire country. Pavelko draws parallels with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/mar/11/europeanfootball.sport1\" title=\"\">famous “death match”</a> that was played when Ukraine was under occupation by Germany in 1942 – although it is believed in some quarters to have been mythologised – with one key difference. “Our tournament is a story not of death but of life.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/22/brazil-election-lula-da-silva-protect-amazon-president","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T20:33:03Z","webTitle":"Lula vows to take on Amazon crime if returned to power in Brazil elections","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/22/brazil-election-lula-da-silva-protect-amazon-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/22/brazil-election-lula-da-silva-protect-amazon-president","fields":{"headline":"Lula vows to take on Amazon crime if returned to power in Brazil elections","trailText":"Ex-president says he will clamp down on illegal miners and loggers after murders of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira","byline":"Tom Phillips in São Paulo","body":"<p>The leading candidate to become Brazil’s next president has vowed to launch a major crackdown on the illegal miners and loggers laying waste to the Amazon in the wake of the “barbaric” murders of the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and the British journalist Dom Phillips.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/jair-bolsonaro-covid-misinformation-charge-brazil-police\">Police call for Bolsonaro to be charged for spreading Covid misinformation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Speaking to foreign journalists in São Paulo, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva paid tribute to the two men, who were gunned down in June while documenting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/10/indigenous-warrior-women-brazil-ancestral-lands-protest\">the historic assault on Indigenous lands</a> that has unfolded under Brazil’s current leader, Jair Bolsonaro.</p> \n<p>“They were victims of a massacre, a barbarity, the kind of which should no longer occur in Brazil,” said the veteran leftist, who polls suggest will win a third term in power when 156 million Brazilians choose their next president in October.</p> \n<p>Asked by the Guardian what concrete steps he would take as president to address the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/20/brazil-amazon-deforestation-report-bolsonaro-climate\">explosion of Amazon devastation</a> and attacks on Indigenous communities, Lula vowed to create a ministry for native peoples and rebuild the environmental agency, Ibama, which critics claim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/18/bolsonaro-president-war-amazon-killing-brazil-dom-phillips-bruno-pereira\">Bolsonaro has deliberately dismantled</a> since taking office in 2019.</p> \n<p>Lula also pledged to clamp down on the thousands of illegal gold prospectors who have swarmed into Indigenous territories since Bolsonaro became president and whose unlawful activities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/like-a-bomb-going-off-why-brazils-largest-reserve-is-facing-destruction-aoe\">Phillips had covered extensively</a>.</p> \n<p>“We will put a complete end to any kind of illegal mining.

We don’t need to cut down one more tree to plant corn. We don’t need to cut down a single tree to plant sugarcane or raise cattle,” Lula said.</p> \n<p>The former president – whose government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/01/brazil-logging-deforestation\">won plaudits for slashing deforestation</a> but outraged Amazon advocates by building <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/16/belo-monte-brazil-tribes-living-in-shadow-megadam\">the Belo Monte mega-dam</a> – was speaking as the race for power intensified ahead of the 2 October first-round vote.</p> \n<p>Recent weeks have seen growing fears that Bolsonaro, a radical far-right former army captain who openly celebrates Brazil’s 1964-85 military dictatorship, might refuse to accept defeat.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month more than a million citizens from across the political spectrum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/brazilian-manifesto-democracy-imminent-danger-bolsonaro\">signed a high-profile manifesto</a> warning that the country’s young democracy faced a moment of “immense danger”.

They tried to storm the Capitol.

Her disappearance prompted a search effort that drew in multiple law enforcement agencies and volunteers, who spent thousands of hours looking for her.</p> <p>On Monday, law enforcement officials said avolunteer search and recovery group had found what was probably the teen’s body inside her Honda SUV, which was upside down under about 14ft of water.</p> <p>“We have located a decedent inside the vehicle. We believe it is our missing person,” said Shannan Moon, the Nevada county sheriff. Authorities were still working on positively identifying the remains, Moon said, and the investigation into what happened to Rodni remained “very active”.</p> <p>Family and friends feared Rodni had been kidnapped and authorities were investigating the case as a possible abduction.

At a court hearing last week, he sounded sympathetic towards at least partially releasing the document, but now seems to have changed his mind. Here’s more from HuffPost:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Having carefully reviewed the affidavit before signing the warrant, I was — and am — satisfied that the facts sworn by the affiant are reliable,” Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854/gov.uscourts.flsd.617854.80.0_3.pdf\">wrote</a> in a 13-page order based on a hearing in his courtroom last week.</p> <p>Reinhart said during the hearing that he was leaning toward publicly releasing a redacted version of the affidavit — with names of FBI agents, witnesses and investigative details blacked out. He ordered prosecutors to provide him such redactions by Thursday, and said he would then decide whether to release that version or propose his own.</p> <p>On Monday, Reinhart said he may decide prosecutors were correct when they argued that the necessary redactions would make what was left lacking in both content and context.</p> <p>“I cannot say at this point that partial redactions will be so extensive that they will result in a meaningless disclosure, but I may ultimately reach that conclusion after hearing further from the government,” Reinhart wrote.</p> <p>Releasing the entire affidavit, the judge said, would hurt the ongoing criminal investigation by revealing names of witnesses and investigative techniques, which could lead to “obstruction of justice and witness intimidation or retaliation” in the first instance and damage prosecutors’ ability to continue gathering information in the second.</p> <p>Both of those arguments were laid out by Department of Justice lawyers in their written filing and during last week’s hearing. Reinhart added one new argument of his own: that releasing the affidavit would make public details about the physical layout of Mar-a-Lago, which would make the Secret Service’s job of protecting the former president more difficult.</p> <p>“This factor weighs in favor of sealing,” he wrote.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/trump-redacted-affidavit-release-mar-a-lago-fbi-search\">Judge orders DoJ to prepare redacted Trump search affidavit for possible release</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-22T19:32:34.071Z\">at 8.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6303cead8f087a97c27208ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-22T18:51:31.675Z\">7.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Democratic-controlled Congress has in recent months managed to pass major legislation addressing health care costs, fighting climate change and boosting semiconductor production, on top of last year’s Covid-19 relief bill and overhaul of the nation’s infrastructure.</strong></p> <p>So what will Democrats do when they return from recess to start what could be their final months controlling both chambers of Congress? <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/22/senate-prepares-judicial-pick-pace-00052402\">According to Politico</a>, the Senate will likely be stepping up the process of confirming federal judges, giving <strong>Joe Biden</strong> the chance to leave his mark on the nation’s judiciary. </p> <p>While the confirmations wouldn’t undo the conservative majority on the supreme court, appointing Democratic-aligned judges to the lower ranks of the federal judiciary improves the chances that laws and policies from across the country survive court challenges. It’s also a tacit recognition that high inflation and Biden’s low approval ratings mean the party could lose control of the chamber in a few months time, and the new Republican majority may stop confirming judges altogether.</p> <p>Here’s more from Politico:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While President Joe Biden has seen more judges confirmed at this point in his presidency than his three White House predecessors, some Senate Democrats and progressive advocacy groups want the chamber to start picking up the pace. Judicial confirmations will come to a standstill if Republicans win back the Senate in the fall, they warn.</p> <p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) put it this way: “Democrats really need to step up on judges.”</p> <p>Warren added that she’s spoken to Majority Whip and Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), “who I know feels the urgency of this moment, and he was talking about how much we’re going to have to double down in September,” she said. “We need more days, more hearings, more everything but we need to get these judges through.”</p> <p>The prospect of a September dominated by judicial confirmations comes as the Senate continues to openly mull the rest of its fall legislative agenda. The chamber is expected to vote again on legislation to cap the cost of insulin and could take up a same-sex marriage bill. Government funding also runs out at the end of September. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Democratic leaders say they’ve reached an agreement to include permitting reform as part of a funding package to keep the government open.</p> <p>But the focus on judges, in addition to a boon for progressives who want to see a faster pace, is a clear sign that the legislative agenda is slowing down ahead of November. Nominees had to compete for summer floor time with Democrats’ other priorities, including their signature climate, prescription and tax package, legislation to increase semiconductor manufacturing and a veterans health care bill. With those bills now sent to Biden’s desk, the Senate can spend more floor time on confirmations.<strong><br></strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6303ca008f0865dc43db1927\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-22T18:28:28.985Z\">7.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The top Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Congress are pressing the Biden administration to allow them access to documents seized from Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago compound earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/22/gang-of-8-trump-mar-a-lago-search-00053118\">Politico reports</a>.</strong></p> <p>The request comes from the so-called “gang of eight”, which consists of the Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate, plus the heads of the chambers’ intelligence committees.</p> <p>Here’s more from the story:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Privately, Capitol Hill aides have expressed frustration about the fact that Congress has learned little about the investigation into the former president, especially since it reportedly involves matters of national security.

Justice needs to be brought.”</p> <p>Graham Morgan, the Knowsley metropolitan borough council leader, said everyone at the town hall was “extremely saddened” by Dale’s death, adding: “Ashley will be a big loss to her team and the wider council as well as those Knowsley residents who she supported.</p> <p>“She was extremely popular with everyone who she came into contact with.

Within three years, the animals had multiplied into the thousands.</p> <p>Scientists now say the continent-wide rabbit invasion resulted from this single importation, rather than previous multiple introductions. </p> <p>In addition to historical records, they analysed genetic material from 187 European rabbits caught across mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Great Britain and France between 1865 and 2018.</p> <p>The researchers found that mainland Australian rabbits were most genetically similar to populations found in the south-west of England, near Baltonsborough.</p> <p>The prevalence of rare gene variants in Australian rabbits also increased with distance from Barwon Park, a process known to occur in geographically expanding populations.</p> <p>The researchers traced DNA found in the mitochondria of cells – which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/06/mitochondrial-donation-how-an-ivf-procedure-could-help-australian-families-break-the-genetic-chain\">inherited from the mother</a> – and estimated that “the mainland Australian rabbits in our dataset trace their maternal ancestry back to five females that were introduced from Europe”.</p> <p>The analysis also found evidence of other rabbit introductions that led to surviving populations, but without wide geographical spread. Two groups of rabbits – one in Sydney, and one in Cattai national park, to the city’s north-west – had distinct ancestry, the study showed.</p> <p>The researchers hypothesise the Barwon Park rabbits were likely more successful in spreading because of their wild ancestry. Many previous introductions had involved rabbits with domestic origins, with reports of “tameness, fancy coat colours and floppy ears” as traits.</p> <p>Study co-author Prof Mike Letnic, of the University of New South Wales, said the wild rabbits introduced to Barwon Park may have had genetic traits that made them more likely to survive in the Australian wilderness.</p> <p>“If animals are bred for domestication, one of the things they lack is predators,” he said. “Anti-predator behaviour is both learned and also evolved … the genes that you carry that might make you nervous or jumpy end up being junk and they get lost in domestication.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/12/its-time-australia-recognised-cats-and-their-impact-as-a-major-environmental-issue\">It’s time Australia recognised cats and their impact as a major environmental issue | Trent Zimmerman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Barwon Park rabbits had “invaded many different environments across the country”, Letnic said. “There’s rabbits that live in relatively cool and comparatively moist areas of Australia, and then there’s rabbits that live in the middle of the desert.”</p> <p>The damage wreaked by rabbits to agricultural crops is an estimated <a href=\"https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/biosecurity/pest-animals/invasive-animal-management/integrated-rabbit-control\">$200m</a> yearly.</p> <p>An unappreciated impact of the pests is that they have amplified predation pressures across the continent, Letnic said. “The numbers of foxes and cats and dingoes tend to be much higher in areas where there’s lots of rabbits, and that means that it makes it harder for other animals to live because there’s more predators.”</p> <p>“It highlights that whatever we do, we need to avoid … bringing [wild animals] into this country and having them escape.”</p> <p>In Tasmania and New Zealand, rabbits also became a pest decades after their introduction.

This summer she started all six Euro 2022 games as the Lionesses won their first major trophy, scoring twice.</p> <p>Last November a forward who blended exceptional movement and positional sense with stellar link and hold-up play exceeded Kelly Smith’s previous Lionesses’ record of 46 goals during England’s record20-0 World Cup qualifying win against Latvia. Only Wayne Rooney, with 53, has scored more frequently in an England shirt.</p> <p>White bows out with a year remaining on her contract with Manchester City where she will be much missed. The same goes for Wiegman and England, whose preparations for next summer’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand are bound to feel slightly strange without the presence of the Lionesses’ “third captain”.</p> <p>Centre-forwards rarely wear the armband but England’s manager identified White’s leadership qualities as so strong that she asked her to assume the captaincy on those occasions when the captain, Leah Williamson, and her deputy, Millie Bright, were unavailable.</p> <p>“Ellen’s given so much for England, we are all so proud of her,” Wiegman said on Monday. “I have only had the pleasure of working with her for this past year but her professionalism, work rate and finishing ability is world class. We will miss her but I fully understand her decision to take a new direction.</p> <p>“This summer she did an amazing job for the team. She’s the perfect team player and helped the younger players find their way in international football. I already knew she was a great player but I found an even better person.”</p> <p>With customary elegance White handed the baton to, among others, the young England forward Alessia Russo. “This had been one of the hardest decisions of my life but one I know is right for me,” said White.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a72e93d28100c8bdfc5317191cf3defc52d1c42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a72e93d28100c8bdfc5317191cf3defc52d1c42/0_211_3765_2259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellen White of England scores their sixth goal during the Women’s Euro 2022 Group A match between England and Norway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ellen White scored a record 52 goals in 113 appearances for England, including two at Euro 2022.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“This decision has always been one I’ve wanted to make on my terms. And this is my time to say goodbye to football and watch the next generation shine. It has been my greatest honour and privilege to play this game. My dreams came true on 31 July, becoming a European champion.”</p> <p>Ever courteous, the former Chelsea, Leeds, Arsenal, Notts County and Birmingham forward signed off with a typically classy and assured touch, saying: “Let’s use the momentum from the Euros win to make sure that every young person in all communities has the opportunity to play and feel connected to all England football teams.” Those words were invested with added heft by White’s status as an individual who has long pushed for improved standards and opportunities across the domestic game.</p> <p>England fans will miss the sight of her hallmark goal celebration, namely the famous “goggles” pose she copied from her hero Anthony Modeste. Intended, originally, as a tribute to the French striker, it reflects the mutual love of Bundesliga football shared by White and her husband, Callum Convery, a football development officer at Nottinghamshire FA.</p> <p>The couple met as sports science students at Loughborough University, later falling for Modeste during one of their frequent trips to Germany. They also take a keen interest in Oldham Athletic women’s team, where they are kit sponsors, and West Ham, the club White supported as a child growing up in Buckinghamshire.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2022/aug/22/ellen-white-retires-from-football-her-career-in-pictures\">Ellen White retires from football – her career in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Ellen White will long be remembered as a model for others to follow,” said Lady Sue Campbell, the FA’s director of women’s football. “It is not just about her record-breaking 52 goals and performances but about the standards she set and the way she conducts herself. A true leader of women, it has never been about Ellen White for her – it was always the team first. She is a legend of the modern game.”</p> <p>Few internationals can look back on participation in six major tournaments but it was not always plain sailing for a striker who lost two years of her career to serious knee injuries. Those moments of adversity perhaps explain the unbridled joy with which a wonderfully uninhibited White – someone who had previously avoided the limelight – could be seen dancing in front of the television cameras after every England game this summer.</p> <p>“Ellen’s always had this great desire to be the best but she’s humble with it,” said the Brighton manager, Hope Powell, who as England coach gave White her debut in 2010. “That humility is Ellen’s key quality.”</p> <p>Steph Houghton, the former England captain and White’s best friend, expressed similar sentiments. “If you look back at all the big games for club and country, when we needed Ellen, she stepped up and scored the big goals,” she said. “Any challenge thrown at her, Ellen always comes out on top.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/22/uk-mortgage-rate-rise-outpaces-interest-rates-data-reveals","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T18:17:16Z","webTitle":"Key UK mortgage rate passes 4% for the first time since 2013","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/22/uk-mortgage-rate-rise-outpaces-interest-rates-data-reveals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/22/uk-mortgage-rate-rise-outpaces-interest-rates-data-reveals","fields":{"headline":"Key UK mortgage rate passes 4% for the first time since 2013","trailText":"The price of a new two-year fixed mortgage is now rising faster than base interest rates, Moneyfacts data reveals","byline":"Rupert Jones","body":"<p>A key mortgage rate has hit 4% for the first time in nine years.

That means the typical cost of these deals is rising at a faster rate than official borrowing costs.

They continue to carry out additional patrols in the area she was last seen in an effort to identify new leads.</p> <p>“We have engaged proactively with the media, issuing appeals and sharing CCTV footage and images of Owami as soon as we have confirmed sightings of her. From our first proactive appeal we made clear she was vulnerable and that we were concerned for her wellbeing. We also continue to support her family at what is a very difficult time.”</p> <p>Investigators are trawling through 117 reported sightings of Davies, who had experienced periods of depression in the past for which she needed medical treatment, and had also used alcohol to deal with the condition.</p> <p>During a briefing with journalists on Monday, DCI Nigel Penney said: “There is no evidence that she’s come to harm.

The Met only later established that the woman was Davies as a result of its missing person investigation.</p> <p>The force said its professional standards body had been consulted and it was not investigating the officers. But it said the IOPC had requested that the matter was referred to it.</p> <p>The Met has issued several appeals for information over Davies’s whereabouts and arrested five people – two on suspicion of murder and three on suspicion of kidnap – who were all later released on bail.</p> <p>The force issued a fresh appeal at the beginning of last week, saying Davies could be in Croydon and “in need of help”.</p> <p>On Thursday the British Transport Police (BTP) tweeted that the 24-year-old could still regularly be taking trains, may appear dazed or confused and may be seeking to engage with women travelling alone.</p> <p>The Met said: “Owami has been depressed and in the absence of her medication may use alcohol to relieve her depression.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2022/aug/22/priti-patel-urges-meta-to-give-up-on-end-to-end-encryption-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T18:04:26Z","webTitle":"Priti Patel urges Meta to give up on end-to-end encryption plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/22/priti-patel-urges-meta-to-give-up-on-end-to-end-encryption-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/aug/22/priti-patel-urges-meta-to-give-up-on-end-to-end-encryption-plans","fields":{"headline":"Priti Patel urges Meta to give up on end-to-end encryption plans","trailText":"UK home secretary hits out at Facebook’s owner over move that could hinder child abuse investigations","byline":"Alex Hern UK technology editor","body":"<p>Priti Patel has hit out at Facebook’s plans to encrypt direct messages, even as the company is facing criticism in the US for failing to protect the privacy of women seeking abortions.</p> <p>The UK home secretary has urged Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, as well as WhatsApp, to give up on its intentions to apply “end-to-end encryption” to direct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/11/facebook-encryption-default-messenger\">messages sent from Messenger and Instagram</a>.</p> <p>The technology, already enabled on WhatsApp, prevents anyone other than the sender and recipient of a message from accessing its contents – including Facebook itself, as well as law enforcement and state security agencies.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/08/21/meta-risks-grotesque-betrayal-children-introducing-encrypted/\">Writing in the Telegraph</a>, Patel warned that the feature could limit the ability of police to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/22/nca-says-end-to-end-encryption-challenge-law-enforcers\">investigate and prevent child abuse</a>. “Parents need to know that their kids will be safe online. The consequences of inadequate protections – especially for end-to-end encrypted social media platforms – would be catastrophic,” she wrote.</p> <p>“A great many child predators use social media platforms such as Facebook to discover, target and sexually abuse children. These protections need to be in place before end-to-end encryption is rolled out around the world. Child safety must never be an afterthought.”</p> <p>Patel’s comments were prompted by an announcement earlier this month that Facebook would be moving ahead with plans to test the change. Although the company said the plans for the test had been in place for a long time, it announced the decision shortly after it came under intense criticism for handing over to police the direct messages of a 17-year-old accused of having an illegal abortion in Nebraska.</p> <p>Facebook says it did not know that the police were investigating an abortion when it handed over the data, but US pro-choice groups lambasted the company’s cooperation with investigators.</p> <p>At Netroots Nation, an American gathering of leftwing groups, activists postered the company’s stand with signs saying “Facebook isn’t free” and “Fix Facebook now”, prompting the company to leave the booth unstaffed for the second day of the conference.</p> <p>With end-to-end encryption enabled, the company would have been unable to hand the data to the police, even if they were in possession of a legally binding search warrant. But it would also be unable to monitor communications between users for other reasons, such as to find and report child abuse imagery being shared in direct messages.</p> <p>In 2021, Facebook alone found and reported 22m pieces of child abuse imagery to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, a US nonprofit that coordinates responses to child abuse online. Instagram reported an additional 3.3m, and there are fears among activists that end-to-end encryption could bring those numbers plummeting down, representing many millions of instances of sharing of child abuse imagery disappearing from view.</p> <p>“Meta’s announcement that they are testing default end-to-end encryption before ensuring effective child safety mitigations are in place will pose an immediate risk to children,” Andy Burrows, NSPCC head of child safety online policy, said.</p> <p>“Private messaging is the frontline of child sexual abuse online and this will start to blindfold the company, meaning less child abuse will be detected.”</p> <p>Patel’s comments come as the fate of the online safety bill, which aims to create a new internet regulator with powers over sites such as Facebook, hangs in the balance.</p> <p>The bill, which failed to make it on to the legislative timetable before the summer recess, will probably be revived in some form by the next prime minister, but the tone of the Conservative leadership contest has been sharply dismissive of aspects of the bill that are seen as “legislating for offence”, including efforts to clean up older laws such as the Malicious Communications Act by replacing them with a new offence of “harmful communications”.</p> <p>In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: “Experts are clear that technologies like those proposed in this paper would undermine end-to-end encryption and threaten people’s privacy, security and human rights. We have no tolerance for child exploitation on our platforms and are focused on solutions that do not require the intrusive scanning of people’s private conversations. We want to prevent harm from happening in the first place, not just detect it after the fact.</p> <p>“We already do this by banning suspicious profiles, restricting adults from messaging children they’re not connected with and defaulting under-18s to private or “friends only” accounts. We’re also encouraging people to report harmful messages to us so we can see the reported contents, respond swiftly and make referrals to the authorities.

Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Matt Hancock – not to mention Sunak himself – have not held back in their aggressive criticism of Liz Truss.</p> <p>Traditionally, in the dying days of a leadership contest, some of the animosity dissipates as the likely losing candidate assesses their prospects of a job in a new administration. However, Sunak and his supporters have been vehement in their attacks on Truss’s economic policies, with the strength of their criticism increasing in recent days.</p> <p>Sunak has said the foreign secretary wants to “have her cake and eat it” and would plunge the country into an inflationary spiral; Gove has claimed Truss is on a “holiday from reality”; and Raab has suggested her plans for tax cuts are a “suicide note” with the wider electorate. Another of Sunak’s key supporters, Kevin Hollinrake, said Truss’s failure to deal with the energy crisis by instead pursuing tax cuts could lead some of the poorest Britons to end up “on the streets”.</p> <p>Some will have their own motives and little to lose. In Gove’s case, Truss and Boris Johnson have made clear they have little love lost for him.</p> <p>Raab – who was succeeded by Truss as foreign secretary – is thought to have a fractious relationship with her, despite them having previously co-authored a book.</p> <p>But Sunak himself could have been offered a job, and was mooted as a possible health secretary. On Monday, however, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/22/rishi-sunak-indicates-he-would-not-take-cabinet-post-under-liz-truss\">strongly signalled</a> he would turn down such a role, mindful of the difficulty of working in a cabinet for someone whose views were too different.</p> <p>Given the strength of some of the attacks and weak chance of success, many of the pronouncements coming from Sunak’s camp do appear to come from strong personal belief that her policy prescriptions are plain wrong.</p> <p>One former Tory leadership candidate said this level of vitriol was “unprecedented and will be extremely difficult to heal”. Other Conservative MPs are reserving their ire for Johnson for refusing to leave No 10 earlier, necessitating a long and drawn-out battle.</p> <p>For Truss, the strength of the internal opposition could also be significant if she wins power as expected. Her top team of fervent supporters is largely from the right of the party, apart from a few outliers such as Tom Tugendhat, a former contender, and Robert Buckland, who switched from supporting Sunak as Truss’s lead became larger.</p> <p>That leaves a fairly sizeable group of former cabinet ministers and potential critics on the backbenches observing her economic plans with a sceptical eye. They have been saying that unfunded tax cuts and insufficient help for the poorest will backfire, while team Truss has been keen to play down the need for “Gordon Brown-style handouts” and the likelihood of recession.</p> <p>If the UK’s financial and energy situation seriously worsens over the winter, some of the blue-on-blue political warfare may continue, with team Sunak having laid out an alternative plan, and Truss likely to blame her former rival for his economic stewardship during the past few years. The economic divisions in the Conservatives seem only likely to continue.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/22/rare-orchid-flourishes-in-charles-darwins-gardens-after-two-year-project","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T17:54:19Z","webTitle":" Rare orchid flourishes in Charles Darwin’s gardens after two-year project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/22/rare-orchid-flourishes-in-charles-darwins-gardens-after-two-year-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/22/rare-orchid-flourishes-in-charles-darwins-gardens-after-two-year-project","fields":{"headline":" Rare orchid flourishes in Charles Darwin’s gardens after two-year project","trailText":"Unusually the violet helleborine is only pollinated by wasps and is thriving thanks to nectar that is irresistible to the insects","byline":"Flo Cornall","body":"<p>A rare orchid that reproduces by getting wasps drunk is thriving in the gardens of Charles Darwin’s house after a two-year restoration programme.</p> <p>The violet helleborine is entirely pollinated by wasps, which are usually not perceived to be the best pollinators. They’re regimented and meticulously clean themselves, scientists say, which makes the process of pollination a fairly futile prospect – there’s nothing for the pollen to cling to.</p> <p>But the violet helleborine produces an intoxicating nectar cocktail to draw the wasps, which then end up buzzing all over the place and incapable of cleaning themselves. The pollen ends up anywhere the wasp may take it.</p> <p>Down House in Kent was the home to Charles Darwin and his family; his most famous book, On the Origin of Species, was written in the study there. The head gardener Antony O’Rourke said: “The gardens at Down House were Darwin’s ‘outdoor laboratory’ and are a living monument to some of the most important discoveries in the history of mankind.” The aim is to make the gardens look as if he had just stepped away.</p> <p>But in Darwin’s lifetime, the violet helleborine could not have grown on his land because the young woodlands around the house were not suitable for the species – the violet helleborine needs to be secreted in very dark places for it to thrive. The special orchids need an extremely specialist habitat consisting of mixed beech woodland in clay over chalk. As the woods have matured, the habitat has become ideal. </p> <p>A conservation project over the last two years means that the violet helleborine is now flourishing. Christopher Weddell, English Heritage’s senior gardens adviser for the south, said he and his colleagues were staggered by the number of the species. Their growth in the woodlands started off as fairly insignificant, but when in full bloom “once it catches your eye, it’s wonderful,” Weddell said. The orchids are expected to flower throughout August in a plentiful display.</p> <p>According to Weddell, “evolution is running its course, and it’s nice that it’s coming full circle”.</p> <p>The violet helleborine shares a close relation to the broadleaf helleborine, an orchid that Darwin studied when he identified that some orchids specialise in certain insects to ensure pollination.</p> <p>Down House is resolute in its continued aim of “protecting and restoring the unique ecosystem that informed Darwin’s work”, O’Rourke said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/22/liz-truss-environment-agency-cuts-sewage-water-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T17:52:23Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss ‘has sewage on her hands’ over Environment Agency cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/22/liz-truss-environment-agency-cuts-sewage-water-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/22/liz-truss-environment-agency-cuts-sewage-water-pollution","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss ‘has sewage on her hands’ over Environment Agency cuts","trailText":"Exclusive: Truss oversaw cut in funds to tackle water pollution, since when raw sewage discharge has risen","byline":"Pippa Crerar and Helena Horton","body":"<p>The Tory leadership frontrunner, Liz Truss, was responsible for cutting millions of pounds of funding earmarked for tackling water pollution during her time as environment secretary, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>Truss, who was in charge at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) between 2014 and 2016, oversaw “efficiency” plans set out in the 2015 spending review to reduce Environment Agency funding by £235m.</p> <p>This included a £24m cut from a government grant for environmental protection, including surveillance of water companies to prevent the dumping of raw sewage, between 2014-15 and 2016-17, according to the National Audit Office.</p> <p>It represents almost a quarter of the funding cut from this area between 2010, when the grant stood at £120m, and 2020, by which time it had fallen to £40m.</p> <p>Labour analysis of official figures shows that since 2016 raw sewage discharge in England and Wales has more than doubled, from 14.7 spill events an overflow to 29.3 in 2021. Greenpeace said the figures showed Truss had “sewage on her hands”.</p> <p>The Environment Agency has called for the government to reverse the cuts but campaigners want the next prime minister to go further and also give the body the power to properly monitor water companies over sewage, rather than allowing them to self-report discharges.</p> <p>It follows the finding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/22/seaside-sewage-monitors-england-environment-agency\">24% of sewage overflow pipes</a> at popular seaside resorts in England and Wales have monitors that are faulty or do not have monitors at all, meaning people could be swimming in human waste this summer without realising.</p> <p>Last year the head of the Environment Agency, James Bevan, called on the government to reinstate the funds, saying that given the length of the country’s river systems, having “only a few hundred people to oversee them is a pretty tall ask”.</p> <p>He told MPs: “It has had an effect on our capacity to monitor, to enforce the rules and to help improve the environment where we think it needs doing. Honestly, I would like to see that grant restored. I would like to get back to where we were 10 years ago, and I think it would make a massive difference.”</p> <p>In response to the findings, the shadow environment secretary, Jim McMahon, said: “The country is facing a crisis in our water supply. Our water infrastructure is at bursting point with billions of litres of water being wasted every day and raw sewage being dumped into our waters.</p> <p>“The fact that Liz Truss was the one to cut the EA so severely not only demonstrates her lack of foresight but also her lack of care for the detail, in recognising the need to adapt to the serious flooding that had just happened on her watch.”</p> <p>Environment Agency insiders said that after Truss’s cuts, staff were moved away from environmental monitoring towards flood protection, and the number of samples taken from rivers went down dramatically.</p> <p>Vaughan Lewis, a senior consultant for the agency, told the Guardian: “They plummeted to the point it was impossible for the Environment Agency to know what’s going on. They had no control or monitoring capability that was meaningful. They ceded the control of monitoring to water companies, which ended up being able to mark their own homework. They take their own samples and assess whether they are being compliant.</p> <p>“We saw that doesn’t work – look what happened with Southern Water, which didn’t declare its pollution incidents and ended up being fined by the EA when they were found out. There are suspicions this could be happening across the board. It has been left to citizen scientists who monitor and fill in the gaps.”</p> <p>Lewis added: “Lots of this would have happened under Liz Truss; she was there when some of those cuts were made. She was a poor minister and the Environment Agency has been cut to the bone and it can’t monitor or regulate effectively.”</p> <p>As environment secretary, Truss defended the cuts by saying “there are ways we can make savings as a department”, citing better use of technology and inter-agency working.</p> <p>She is already facing questions about why she was registered absent from a vote on a Labour amendment in the House of Commons that aimed to place legal obligations on water companies to stop polluting England’s waterways during heavy rainfall.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Truss said: “These spending reductions were part of a wider drive from central government to find efficiencies across department budgets and government agencies.</p> <p>“It’s vital we get a grip on pollution in our water and ensure it is clean and safe for all to enjoy. As prime minister, Liz will make sure the necessary action is taken to deliver this.”</p> <p>Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said: “A decade of budget cuts and government deregulation has left the Environment Agency, almost literally, up shit creek without a paddle. The growing tsunami of sewage unleashed on to Britain’s waterways is a shocking demonstration of how undermining our regulators leads to a disregard for nature and those meant to protect it.</p> <p>“That our likely future prime minister was an instigator of cuts to the money used to protect our rivers, and so helped cause this environmental catastrophe, doesn’t bode well for the UK’s protection of the natural world. Liz Truss has sewage on her hands.”</p> <p>Hugo Tagholm, the chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, said: “Self-monitoring has clearly failed for the water industry, the culture of self-reporting has clearly failed, millions of hours of sewage pollution going into our waterways every year, it’s a failed model.”</p> <p>Martin Salter, from the Angling Trust, said: “The consequences of these ill-advised cuts to the Environment Agency’s pollution monitoring capabilities are now present for all to see and smell, with raw sewage flowing down our rivers and dead fish and other wildlife washed up on the banks with depressing regularity.</p> <p>“The move away from tougher regulation in favour of allowing water companies to report on their own failures has created a polluter’s charter, as evidenced by the recent prosecution of Southern Water for deliberately falsifying their discharge data.”</p> <p>The Environment Agency has long bemoaned its lack of funding and power, underpinned by a lack of ambition from ministers on tackling waste. In 2020 it said it recognised that a “huge gap is opening up between the outcomes we want to achieve and our ability to achieve them”, and estimated that “at the current rate of progress” it would take more than 200 years to reach the government’s target of at least 75% of waters being close to their natural state.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/22/tory-peer-daniel-finkelstein-us-visa-cannabis-revelation-in-the-times","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T17:51:47Z","webTitle":"Tory peer could be refused entry to US after cannabis revelation in the Times","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/22/tory-peer-daniel-finkelstein-us-visa-cannabis-revelation-in-the-times","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/22/tory-peer-daniel-finkelstein-us-visa-cannabis-revelation-in-the-times","fields":{"headline":"Tory peer could be refused entry to US after cannabis revelation in the Times","trailText":"Daniel Finkelstein may fall foul of legal anomaly despite using drug in state where it was allowed, says lawyer","byline":"Robert Booth Social affairs correspondent","body":"<p>A Conservative peer may have damaged his chances of being allowed back into the US after legally smoking cannabis in Colorado, a leading immigration lawyer has said.</p> <p>Daniel Finkelstein wrote in the Times on Monday of how he smoked marijuana for the first time at a friend’s house in the state, where buying limited quantities of the drug for recreational use has been allowed for almost a decade.</p> <p>But such admissions could lead to US authorities refusing future visas, because while it is now legal in several states, possession and use of the drug remains a federal crime, according to Charlotte Slocombe, a partner at the law firm Fragomen and an expert in US immigration law.</p> <p>Lord Finkelstein, who does not drink, smoke or even drink coffee, described how he chose to try the drug only because he knew it was legal, “and I try never to do things that are illegal”. </p> <p>He is unlikely to be alone if he falls foul of the legal anomaly and US authorities choose to act. Tourists have been drawn to states from New York to Oregon where the drug has been legalised for limited recreational use and is sold in licensed shops, bringing in several billion dollars in tax revenue annually.</p> <p>Slocombe said the US embassy “having access to social media could ask questions around use of drugs, and any admission could lead to becoming inadmissible for a visa”. She added: “You do not need to be convicted to be deemed inadmissible under US immigration.”</p> <p>Finkelstein, who recently became a director of Chelsea football club, which is now under new US ownership, wrote in the article that his family had “researched the law quite carefully.

If so, the decision was a shocker. Nine months later, Bulb still sits on the state’s books and the price of running an unhedged operation increases with every spike in the gas price, up about 20% since last Friday.</p> <p>At the outset, the government advanced £1.7bn of public money to run Bulb for six months, with the hope of getting a large chunk back via a sale. Then, as wholesale energy prices continued to climb, the Office for Budget Responsibility said in March that the bailout would cost £2.2bn over two years. Now we’re talking properly serious sums.</p> <p>Take your pick from any number between £3bn and £4bn. Energy consultancy Auxilione forecasts plausibly that Bulb could lose a further £420m over this summer and potentially £1.6bn during the winter. The no-hedging policy has made a rotten financial position worse.</p> <p>As it happens, Kwarteng didn’t mention his “no longer than necessary” timetable when quizzed on the approach by a select committee in May. Instead he said this: “The issue with hedging is that it is very risky because, essentially, you are taking a bet or trying to insure yourself against price movements. That insurance … costs money. In terms of managing public money, the Treasury, rightly, does not think that that is what the taxpayer should be doing.”</p> <p>To put it mildly, that analysis does not read well in light of events. Hedging really isn’t like taking a bet; it’s about securing certainty over the price you have to pay. Bulb didn’t have sufficient hedges in place to cope with a rigid price cap and a spiralling wholesale price, so it was particularly perverse for the government to continue with a failed strategy. Whatever the Treasury orthodoxy says, sometimes you have to apply common sense.</p> <p>The business and energy select committee made the same point in its report last month: “The decision not to implement a hedging strategy may have led to the sale of Bulb being less desirable and significantly increased costs to taxpayers.” You bet: there’s no longer any doubt about it.</p> <p>It is probably pointless for the government or Bulb’s administrators to try to play catch-up at today’s much-higher prices. The moment to put hedges in place was at the outset. Instead, ministers hoped for the best. That could also roughly describe of the UK’s entire approach to energy security over the past 20 years.</p> <h2>Cineworld needs a new cast of characters</h2> <p>It’s “business as usual” for customers, said Cineworld <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/22/cineworld-may-file-for-bankruptcy-in-us-but-cinemas-will-stay-open\">as it confirmed it is considering filing for bankruptcy in the US</a>. The debt-laden cinema giant added that it hopes to emerge eventually from a financial restructuring “with no significant impact upon its employees”.</p> <p>By rights, though, there ought to be a significant impact on at least two personnel: chief executive Mooky Greidinger and his brother and deputy, Israel. The price of restructuring ought to be their departure at an early stage of the process.</p> <p>The duo’s debt-fuelled stewardship of Cineworld has been a calamity and is almost certainly about to deliver near wipe-out for shareholders, or “very significant dilution” in the coy corporate language.</p> <p>Greidinger interests speak for 20% of that equity, which presumably will also become near-worthless, but there may be a temptation to see the family as vital to a post-restructuring corporate sequel. The banks should resist such thoughts: this is an uncomplicated chain of cinemas that doesn’t need the old cast at the helm.</p> <h2>Bad timing</h2> <p>What a moment for the senior independent non-executive director (SID) at Made.com, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/19/made-com-job-cuts-cost-of-living-crisis-profit-warning-losses\">beleaguered</a> online furniture retailer, to depart with immediate effect: just as the company tries to assemble an emergency fund-raising that may require it to raise more than its current stock market value of £35m.</p> <p>Gwyn Burr cited a need to give more focus to her “other professional commitments”, which presumably means chairing Skipton building society, which she has done since February.

Business leaders fear the strike will have a damaging impact on supply chains at a time when companies are grappling with disruption caused by Brexit and the Covid pandemic.</p> <p>As much as $800m (£680m) in trade could be affected, according to ALPS Marine analysis by Russell Group, a data and analytics company. That includes more than $80m of trade in clothing and more than $30m in electronics.</p> <h2>What is the impact so far?</h2> <p>Josh Brazil, a global supply chain analyst at project44, a research provider, said container capacity on the first day of the strike fell by more than a third compared with last week. Some vessels are being redirected to nearby London Gateway, with a 45% increase in capacity volumes calling there in the last week. “[It] could have massive implications for the nation’s supply chains,” Brazil said.</p> <p>Industry sources said shipments had been timed to arrive to avoid the strikes, with orders rushed to beat the start and others delayed to arrive afterwards. Trade is also expected to be diverted to smaller UK ports and EU ports, including Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Wilhelmshaven in Germany.</p> <h2>Are we going to see shortages?</h2> <p>Consumers are unlikely to see an immediate impact on shop shelves, although experts say any further strike action would lead to delivery delays and shortages of some goods.</p> <p>This is because Felixstowe typically handles bulkier items shipped from Asia, such as furniture, clothing and white goods, unlike Dover, which handles food and perishable goods that require a faster delivery time.</p> <p>UK ports have gradually been recovering from Covid, Brexit disruption and national lorry driver shortages, while warehouses have been restocked with goods. Consumer demand for big-ticket purchases such as sofas and fridges is also fading amid concerns over the rising cost of living, reducing the pressure on supply lines.</p> <h2>Will it push up prices?</h2> <p>The disruption is likely to add to logistics costs, which could lead to higher prices in shops. “It will add an inflationary impulse,” said John Glen, the chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. “We still haven’t got back to just in time supply chains and stocks being held in warehouses. So you will see some impact in the shops. It won’t be a lack of availability of particular products, but you might see a lack of choice.”</p> <h2>What about Christmas?</h2> <p>Experts said any further strikes could affect the festive period, when retailers typically ramp up supplies. Sophie Lund-Yates, a lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “This is the latest unwanted twist in our weekly food shops, with high prices already making the experience more difficult for many shoppers.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-social-care-recruitment-crisis-pay-staff-what-they-are-worth","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T17:47:28Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the social care recruitment crisis: pay staff what they are worth | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-social-care-recruitment-crisis-pay-staff-what-they-are-worth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-social-care-recruitment-crisis-pay-staff-what-they-are-worth","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the social care recruitment crisis: pay staff what they are worth","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> If society offers poverty wages for demanding and skilled work, a staffing shortage should not be a surprise","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>The impact of the dire staffing shortages in care homes, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/21/staffing-crisis-leaves-many-english-care-home-residents-basic-needs-unmet\" title=\"\">revealed</a> in a Guardian analysis published at the weekend, makes for distressing reading. According to inspection reports by the Care Quality Commission, the industry regulator, some residents are being left to languish in their rooms 24 hours a day. Some have gone without showers and basic hygiene requirements, or been exposed to bullying by other residents because of a lack of carers to supervise group situations. Many staff are simply unable to offer the level of emotional care and attention they would wish to – there is no time in what can sometimes be a 14- or 16-hour working day. Last year, vacancies in the sector reached 165,000 – a 52% rise, meaning that one in 10 social care posts in England are unfilled.</p> <p>The main cause of this recruitment crisis, which also applies to care workers supporting people in their homes, is shamefully low pay. This is work that is demanding, skilled and vital to the wellbeing of hundreds of thousands of residents and their relatives. But the latest available figures indicate that the average wage in independent care homes was an indefensible £9.01 an hour in 2020/21. The sharp rise in vacancies (from a level that was already dangerously high) has coincided with the reopening of other areas of the economy post-Covid. Care workers are quitting to earn slightly more money and suffer less stress at jobs in supermarkets, hospitality and Amazon warehouses. Who can blame them? Many, with very good reason, will have felt undervalued, overworked and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-care-home-staff-in-the-uk-are-at-breaking-point-185234\" title=\"\">exhausted</a> after the pandemic, when care homes were forced to adapt to becoming essentially closed institutions. Meanwhile, in a desperate attempt to fill gaps in rotas, providers are paying <a href=\"https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/social-care-charities-facing-unsustainable-reliance-agency-staff/management/article/1795696\" title=\"\">agencies</a> well over the odds to source temporary staff while unpaid carers are burning themselves out looking after loved ones at home.</p> <p>A tipping point has been reached, which will have severe knock-on consequences for the NHS as it tries to free up beds in hospitals. Realising this, the government has pledged to embark on a mass recruitment drive <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/overseas-hiring-spree-to-bail-out-care-homes-rl2wbb2s9\" title=\"\">overseas</a>. In the short term that may plug some gaps, but it should not be a substitute for a system that finally pays people a fair wage for the important work they do. The situation, status and remuneration of social care workers in this country is a disgrace for reasons that are well known. Local authorities, chronically <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/about/news/councils-could-face-budget-blackhole-amid-growing-concerns-about-underfunded-adult\" title=\"\">underfunded</a> for years, are not in a position to drive up rates of pay for the care they commission. The debt-leveraged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/christine-corlet-walker\" title=\"\">penetration</a> of the sector by private equity has driven cost-cutting and exploitative practices, such as zero-hours contracts.</p> <p>Boris Johnson’s health and social care levy does nothing to address the issue. Of the £5.4bn to be allocated to social care over the next three years, a mere £500m has been allocated to workforce reform, <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2022/08/04/adult-care-bereft-of-cash-for-current-pressures-and-long-term-reforms-warn-mps/\" title=\"\">amounting</a> to 5.7p an hour for each employee. Even this wholly insufficient sum will be allocated to training and qualifications rather than pay uplift.</p> <p>This month the levelling up, housing and communities select committee <a href=\"https://www.communitycare.co.uk/2022/08/04/adult-care-bereft-of-cash-for-current-pressures-and-long-term-reforms-warn-mps/\" title=\"\">concluded</a> that adult social care required an additional £7bn a year in funding and called on the government to produce a long-term plan for its workforce. As our investigation makes clear, this desperately needs to happen. Sadly, the lesson of the last 12 years of Conservative government is that it almost certainly won’t.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/22/russian-tv-news-head-hints-at-countrys-role-in-skripal-poisoning","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T17:46:30Z","webTitle":"Russian TV news head hints at country’s role in Skripal poisoning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/22/russian-tv-news-head-hints-at-countrys-role-in-skripal-poisoning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/22/russian-tv-news-head-hints-at-countrys-role-in-skripal-poisoning","fields":{"headline":"Russian TV news head hints at country’s role in Skripal poisoning","trailText":"Editor of state-owned RT network Margarita Simonyan appears to contradict Kremlin position in post about Darya Dugina killing","byline":"Pjotr Sauer","body":"<p>The influential head of Russia’s RT news network has hinted at Russia’s role in the poisoning of the former spy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/sergei-skripal\">Sergei Skripal</a>, in a remarkable post that contradicts the Kremlin’s official position on the incident.</p> <p>In a post on her Telegram channel on Monday, Margarita Simonyan appeared to acknowledge Russia’s part in the Skripal poisoning when she wrote that Russian “professionals who want to admire spires” should travel to Estonia to go after the alleged killer of Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/daughter-of-putin-ally-alexander-dugin-killed-in-car-bomb-in-moscow-reports\">killed in a car bomb on Saturday night.</a></p> <p>Russia has accused Ukraine’s intelligence services of carrying out the murder of Dugina, and said the allegedly perpetrator fled across the Russian border into Estonia shortly after committing the murder.</p> <p>“Dasha’s killers are already in Estonia.

The betting is that she has built an unassailable lead in the Tory party leadership race. Her maverick boosterism seems to play better with party members than Rishi Sunak’s wonkery. However damaging her economic policies turn out to be, it may be her Little England politics that do the most harm. A poll this <a href=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/liz-truss-pm-scottish-independence-27794449\" title=\"\">weekend</a> showed Scotland is more likely to become independent if Ms Truss becomes prime minister.

A majority of English people are untroubled by the prospect of a united Ireland. This is down to the rightwing politics of Brexit, which was a revolt pitting England against itself. Ms Truss has played on this theme during the contest: by inveighing against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/08/plan-axe-91000-civil-servants-only-possible-cuts-services-\" title=\"\">civil service</a>; by opposing political <a href=\"https://conservativehome.com/2022/07/25/john-redwood-truss-is-offering-the-break-from-orthodoxy-that-britain-needs/\" title=\"\">unanimity</a>; by reversing England’s historical tendency to look outwards rather than inwards. Ms Truss is playing with fire. She risks burning down the whole house. A Little Englander running a Little England is where her rhetoric leads.</p> <p>The foreign secretary’s aggressive stance against the Scottish National party is unpopular north of the border. Most Scots understand that a Tory government in London will not have much in common with an SNP-run Holyrood. But they reasonably expect their democratic decisions to be respected. Boris Johnson was unpopular in Scotland, but he learned that Britain did not gain by squabbling with the SNP. The best way of preserving the union is to emphasise its benefits. Unfortunately, Ms Truss has gone out of her way to pick a fight with the SNP. She called the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, an “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/02/liz-truss-dismissal-of-attention-seeker-sturgeon-will-horrify-scots-says-snp\" title=\"\">attention-seeker</a>”, branded nationalists as <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/20668287.scottish-independence-rebranded-separatism-liz-trusss-leadership/\" title=\"\">separatists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/755e9b09-3696-468c-bf21-546ed47fa5bc\" title=\"\">unequivocally</a> ruled out an independence vote.</p> <p>Whoever becomes prime minister will be waiting for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-62481041\" title=\"\">supreme court</a> to decide whether Ms Sturgeon can hold an independence referendum without Westminster’s consent. Most expect judges to rule against her. However, the SNP would then fight the next UK general election as a de facto referendum on Scottish independence. The polls are not looking good for rightwing unionism. The Tories risk a wipeout in Scotland. When it comes to Northern Ireland, Ms Truss told a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/liz-truss-bill-northern-ireland-protocol-belfast-northern-ireland-b2147056.html\" title=\"\">Belfast hustings</a> that she would not accept any compromises on a renegotiated protocol if it meant key demands were not met. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/07/truss-sunak-contest-leaves-brussels-pessimistic-about-relations-with-uk-brexit-eu\" title=\"\">A trade war</a> with the EU would be bad for the UK, but it would be especially disruptive for Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Ms Truss’s strategy is to win by appealing to the hearts of the Tory members rather than their heads. However, words once said cannot easily be swallowed. They can have a radicalising effect on activists and MPs. Things could fall apart rapidly. Divides are widening between London and the rest of England, between England and the other nations of the union, and between the young and the old. The foreign secretary, like Mr Johnson before her, gives the impression that English politicians can get away with ignoring or being <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/liz-truss-insults-keir-starmer-mark-drakeford-nicola-sturgeon_uk_62eb7a96e4b09fecea4b25fc\" title=\"\">insulting</a> towards the other nations of the United Kingdom.

They feel police were trying to hide things from them and also criticised wrong information put out in the aftermath.</p> \n<p>The family are being supported by Inquest, a charity that provides support regarding state-related deaths. Deborah Coles, the charity’s director, said: “It is in both the family and public interest that police officers are subject to robust investigation of the highest standard.”</p> \n<p>An inquiry by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) will investigate why statements were being put out the following day that Omishore had carried a screwdriver when it may well have been clear it was not. The family are angry that it took almost two weeks to correct that statement.</p> \n<p>They believe the police watchdog is wrong to still be treating the officers involved as witnesses, instead of placing them under investigation. Omishore’s father said: “It’s like a nightmare to me, up till now … devastating for my family.”</p> \n<p>Aisha said: “It has been a really tragic few months. As a family this has come as a huge shock and just a devastating blow.”</p> \n<p>The Met said: “This was a tragic incident and our sympathies are with Mr Omishore’s family as they continue to come to terms with the loss of their loved one. This matter is subject to an investigation by the IOPC.</p> \n<p>We are co-operating fully with the IOPC’s investigation and their findings will be released in due course.”</p> \n<p>An IOPC spokesperson said: “At this early stage we have no indication that any of the officers involved may have breached police professional standards or committed a criminal offence, although we keep conduct matters constantly under review.</p> \n<p>“We can confirm that a police-issued Taser was discharged multiple times. The data from the Taser has been sent off for external analysis and we are awaiting the Taser report.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/23/anti-aircraft-noise-campaigners-to-target-shareholders-in-bid-for-brisbane-airport-curfew","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T17:30:41Z","webTitle":"Anti-aircraft noise campaigners to target shareholders in bid for Brisbane airport curfew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/23/anti-aircraft-noise-campaigners-to-target-shareholders-in-bid-for-brisbane-airport-curfew","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/23/anti-aircraft-noise-campaigners-to-target-shareholders-in-bid-for-brisbane-airport-curfew","fields":{"headline":"Anti-aircraft noise campaigners to target shareholders in bid for Brisbane airport curfew","trailText":"Independent review recommends moving flight paths to alleviate noise concerns but disgruntled residents want solutions sooner","byline":"Joe Hinchliffe","body":"<p>Anti-aircraft noise campaigners say they will target investors in Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) as they threaten to ramp up efforts to force a curfew and cap on flights over the city.</p> <p>Aircraft noise was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/anger-over-aircraft-noise-expected-to-boost-greens-election-chances-in-brisbane\">the defining local issue at the federal election for many</a> who live under flight paths that emerged when the Brisbane airport opened its second runway in mid-2020, playing a role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/22/australian-greens-hails-best-result-ever-with-dramatic-gains-in-lower-house-and-senate\">the election of Greens MPs in three inner-city seats</a>.</p> <p>A sustained community campaign to address the noise led Air Services Australia to commission an independent review into the problem, whose report and recommendations were <a href=\"https://www.airservicesaustralia.com/wp-content/uploads/BNE-NPR-PIR-Independent-Review_Final-Report-v1.0_final.pdf\">made public on Monday</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/24/queenslanders-embraced-greens-because-they-saw-politics-was-broken-says-adam-bandt\">Queenslanders embraced Greens because they saw politics was broken, says Adam Bandt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Trax report said its recommendations would see more flights descend over Moreton Bay to lessen the impact on residents, reduce the frequency and concentration of flights over communities and “optimise the performance of the wider Brisbane airspace system”.</p> <p>Brisbane Flight Path Community Alliance’s acting chair, Marcus Foth, described the report as “vindication” that “something can be done” to reduce aircraft noise impacts despite original claims from government regulators and the Brisbane Airport Corporation to the contrary.</p> <p>“When communities have been complaining to Air Services [Australia], usually they get these kinds of boilerplate responses with technical language that suggests that nothing can be done,” Foth said. “And here the Trax report is actually saying the opposite – there is a list of recommendations that are feasible.”</p> <p>But he said the recommendations would not come soon rnough nor go far enough and that campaigners were now exploring legal options, public protests and shareholder activism to deliver solutions sooner and more comprehensively.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul> <p>“We’ll be targeting the owners of the Brisbane Airport Corporation,” he said, pointing out some Trax recommendations wouldn’t be operational until 2025.</p> <p>“If the aviation stakeholders think that another three years of noise pollution torture is palatable, they are sadly mistaken.”</p> <p>BAC shareholders included the publicly-owned Queensland Investment Corporation, which has a 25% stake in the airport.

Most of the time it has to be done every morning, usually again before bed and sometimes we do it multiple times in a day.</p> <p>Sometimes it requires a second opinion. Sometimes, even when you think you’ve nailed an outfit, someone else will tell you your fly is undone, your tag is out or that you have spilled something on the front of your shirt. And sometimes, you end up uncomfortable all day.</p> <p>Getting dressed can also be a collaborative project – like when we’re children, if we’ve fallen ill, or when something is particularly tricky to zip up alone. The nature of being human is that we move in and out of being dependent on other people.</p> <p>Here, we ask four people about their not-so-straightforward approaches to getting dressed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4fa0e81582ca5bbf69f68fec93fcfe9c1eee2a9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fa0e81582ca5bbf69f68fec93fcfe9c1eee2a9f/0_0_1767_2482/712.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion designer Nikki Hind favours reversible dresses, because you can never put them on inside out.\" width=\"712\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fashion designer Nikki Hind favours reversible dresses, because you can never put them on inside out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The backup packer</h2> <p>Nikki Hind, Australia’s first blind fashion designer says, “I remember a time when I was wearing a new dress and thigh-high boots and felt like the ant’s pants.” Infuriatingly, she’d been at an event for an hour or two before someone told her that her dress was inside out. “You think, oh, you idiot,” she says. “I love to design things that are reversible for that reason.”</p> <p> Because Hind does not drive, she has to be very organised. Before she leaves the house, she has to consider how many hours she’ll be away from home and whether she is going to get sweaty or dirty while walking or on public transport, in which case she needs to carry a separate outfit with her.</p> <p>This also comes in handy if she spills something. “I bump into things and knock things over, not because I’m drunk, just because I can’t see where things are,” she says. “There is nothing worse than trying to look professional when you’ve spilled coffee down your top.” (A universal sentiment).</p> <p>Since she does so much walking, her footwear choice is often dictated by comfort, so when necessary for fashion reasons, she will carry a second pair of shoes “to appropriately match my outfit”. She also always wears a backpack: “I need to be hands-free so I can feel where some things are – stairway rails, doors etc.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&amp;description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&amp;link=true&amp;link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&amp;link-label=Learn%20more\" data-alt=\"Get the weekend app\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Discover%20the%20Australia%20Weekend%20app&description=Everything%20you%20need%20to%20make%20sense%20of%20the%20week%20in%20one%20simple%2C%20elegant%20app&link=true&link-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Finfo%2Fng-interactive%2F2021%2Fmar%2F17%2Fmake-sense-of-the-week-with-australia-weekend%3FINTCMP%3Dheader_au_weekend&link-label=Learn%20more\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Hind does look in the mirror when she is getting dressed, but tends to style her outfit based on how it feels. Whether it is “too tight or baggy in certain areas, or long or short,” she says. “I’ve possibly gotten used to how things feel when I like the way I look.”</p> <h2>The comfortably fun</h2> <p>When Aleasha McCallion is helping her eight-year-old son Arden get dressed there are a lot of things to consider. She says, “like most folks” the weather is the first consideration but because Arden has complex disabilities “it is incredibly important to strike the right balance of layers, sensory comfort, practicality and temperature for what the day is bringing”.</p> <p>Since layering is key, along with the need for regular washing, it is also important his clothes are durable, soft and stretchy. For this reason, she avoids non-stretch woven fabrics and zip or button flies, and instead opts for stretch waist bands and drop-crotch or skater-themed pants. “I tend to select a lot of trackies and knit jumpers and of course with kids clothing that isn’t hard to find.”</p> <p>Secondhand clothing is ideal, she says, “because it’s often softened up and no longer has high levels of chemicals used in processing and manufacturing of clothing”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e2945f275e8b99db774893329d4a8b76caeb5fe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2945f275e8b99db774893329d4a8b76caeb5fe8/0_0_1170_1538/761.jpg\" alt=\"When helping her son Arden get dressed, Aleasha McCallion looks for a balance of practicality and fun.\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When helping her son Arden get dressed, Aleasha McCallion looks for a balance of practicality and fun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since Arden has limited social interactions with other kids, partly due to the health risks of Covid and partly due to the visible and invisible disabilities related to his rare, severe epilepsy, McCallion makes it a priority to find him outfits that are not only “really practical” but cool. “He has a banana-print jumper at the moment which is a lot of fun and certainly spices up the mood when we need it.”</p> <h2>The mind’s eye planner</h2> <p>Blogger, writer and speaker Elin Williams has committed her wardrobe to memory. Once she has checked the weather, assessed what she has on for the day and decided on a direction for her outfit, she says, “I flick through my inner-mind’s outfit catalogue, pick the items that I think will fit my vibe … and find them.”</p> <p>Her wardrobe is very organised to make this easier. “Organisation is key in a vision-impaired fashion lover’s life,” she says, “I can’t spot what I’m looking for when I open the doors so I keep different styles of clothes together to make them easier to find.”</p> <p>She describes putting an outfit together as her favourite part about fashion but since “mirrors are a no-go” it can make “fashion and dressing somewhat of a guessing game … but it’s one I love to play”.</p> <p>Having confidence in the clothes she owns is crucial. “If I know one item looks good, I’m confident in pairing that with other things I own, and can usually tell if it pairs well depending on the contrast in fabric, texture and colour.” To be sure her outfit is working, she often secures a second opinion from her mother or brother before leaving the house.</p> <p>When she is choosing shoes, she keeps things simple by opting for versatile styles that work with different outfits. “I don’t stray too far from white trainers or ballet flats in the summer, since I know I can trust them to complement any outfit, and you’ll rarely see me out of ankle boots in the autumn/winter.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"694d927fb1212d85b7388fe90749a88862d1854b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/694d927fb1212d85b7388fe90749a88862d1854b/0_0_4774_3182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blogger and writer Elin Williams. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elin Williams says “organisation is key in a vision-impaired fashion lover’s life”.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The expressive selector</h2> <p>Emma Albert helps her six-year-old son get dressed each day by asking “Mikey, what do you want to wear?” Once he replies with a specific item or colour, she lays out a number of things for him to choose from.</p> <p>“We do this with each item: socks, T-shirt, pants … Sometimes we end with quite an interesting combo but so long as he’s happy and comfortable that’s what matters!”</p> <p>This process lets her son “feel more in control” and lets him express his personality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/26/comfort-style-or-function-dressing-four-different-bodies\">Comfort, style, or function?

Also having a bit of stretch makes dressing a little easier.”</p> <p>Another thing she looks for in Mikey’s clothes is accessibility. “When your muscles are tight and your limbs don’t always cooperate, standard clothes are tricky to put on,” she says. She opts for zip up jumpers over sweatshirts and anything with wide or adjustable openings. “I look for pants with more room in the bottom so he doesn’t show too much and they don’t slip down while he’s seated in his wheelchair.”</p> <p>Clothing that features his interests, like his favourite bands, and pieces that start a conversation around disability inclusion are particular favourites. “When Mikey is really happy in his outfit, he will proudly tell people ‘I wear this one’ or ‘I like this one’, pointing to his top.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/23/tanya-plibersek-backs-contentious-fertiliser-plant-on-burrup-peninsula","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T17:30:40Z","webTitle":"Tanya Plibersek backs contentious fertiliser plant on Burrup peninsula","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/23/tanya-plibersek-backs-contentious-fertiliser-plant-on-burrup-peninsula","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/23/tanya-plibersek-backs-contentious-fertiliser-plant-on-burrup-peninsula","fields":{"headline":"Tanya Plibersek backs contentious fertiliser plant on Burrup peninsula","trailText":"Federal environment minister says Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation supports development despite concerns over impact on culturally important sites","byline":"Adam Morton Climate and environment editor","body":"<p>The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has ruled a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/24/federal-government-accused-of-railroading-traditional-custodians-over-burrup-peninsula-rock-art-site\">controversial $4.5bn fertiliser plant</a> near ancient rock art on Western Australia’s Burrup peninsula can go ahead after being told it had the support of a local Aboriginal corporation.</p> <p>Work on the development had stopped after Save Our Songlines, a separate traditional owners organisation opposed to the project, asked the minister to protect five culturally important sites, including petroglyphs.

Yet 12% of young Australians report having self-harmed on at least one occasion, most commonly via cutting. While we might associate such acts only with pain, cutting can release stress- and pain-reducing hormones and thus can have an addictive quality. Though the person cutting may experience emotional relief it is easy for parents and even mental health workers to view it as an act of aggression aimed at gaining attention and inducing distress. Indeed, cutting can serve as a impactful form of communication.</p> <p>But communication is usually a secondary aim, even if this communication is powerfully felt by others. First and foremost, cutting is an attempt to deal with overwhelming feelings. Physical pain is preferred to psychic pain and, for some, seeing the blood and the scars allows the pain and anger felt inside to appear on the outside. This proved to be the case with my 14-year-old client, Tina*.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/13/how-finding-balance-helped-a-father-support-his-troubled-daughter\">How finding balance helped a father support his troubled daughter | Gaynor Parkin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tina arrived early for her first session, looking remarkably self-possessed given that her referral said she was chronically depressed and engaging in self-harm. She was quick to tell me that she was only there because her family and doctor wanted her to come. While she often felt sad, she didn’t think she needed my help as she could always relieve bad feelings by cutting herself on her thighs or arms. “Anyway, what do they know,” she added, pulling her long sleeves further down to cover multiple crisscrossing scars.</p> <p>Tina’s “what do they know” was to the point. In our experience, often those who self-harm come from families who, while loving and caring, struggle with discipline and setting boundaries. Boundaries are vital for children to feel safe and, when they are not in place, children often feel alone. </p> <p>These children can find themselves at the mercy of their emotions, consumed by rage, sadness and a raft of difficult feelings that they cannot regulate or manage. They struggle to identify what they feel, or what triggered their distress, and the need to rid themselves of the feelings is paramount, regardless of the consequences for themselves, their body or anyone else.</p> <p>Not being able to think about others as real people with thoughts and feelings of their own characterises us all when we are in the grip of strong feelings. Witness the phenomenon of road rage, when the other motorist becomes an obstacle and not a person. This state assails those who self-cut more often as they have developed few resources to modulate strong feelings and are thus more often in their grip. They struggle to reflect and are quick to act.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When she seemed calmer, I encouraged her to use words to express her feelings to her mother</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As Tina sat sullenly staring out the window of my consulting room, I contemplated how we could move forward. How could I help her to take a moment of pause between her overwhelming feelings and the urge to cut? How could I help her to accept limits without needing all the time to test a physical limit? How could I help Tina to trust that others could help her?</p> <p>First I would need to establish a trusting relationship by listening carefully to Tina so that in time she would be prepared to take a chance on my suggestions. I had an approach in mind – dialectical behaviour therapy – but I would need Tina’s buy-in for this to work.</p> <p>DBT often takes place in groups and fosters five major skills: mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation and walking the middle path. But there was no group available, and I was doubtful that Tina would immediately agree to join one. So I concentrated instead on how to use our relationship to begin to build these DBT skills in the interpersonal space between us. My focus was on allowing Tina to have a moment of pause between her feelings and actions, and to help her observe and reflect on what was happening for her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/23/cleos-world-was-darkened-by-depression-reconnecting-brought-back-some-colour\">Cleo’s world was darkened by depression. Reconnecting brought back some colour | Gill Straker and Jacqui Winship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An opportunity for this presented itself in our third session. Tina’s mother accompanied her as she was concerned that Tina had been to the emergency room after a significant cutting episode at the weekend. As her mother related the story, including her understandable distress and anger, I could see Tina becoming increasingly emotionally dysregulated. My sense was that she was on the verge of leaving the room. I asked her mother to pause, and I reflected on what I intuited Tina might be feeling – blamed, misunderstood, shamed – and how difficult it must be to sit with these intense feelings. I encouraged her to breathe deeply and to relax more fully into her chair. When she seemed calmer, I encouraged her to use words to express her feelings to her mother. I also encouraged her to consider her mother’s experience of what had happened and to connect with the concern and worry. In this way, I tried to help them both to reflect on what had played out between them, as I had no doubt this was a common pattern.</p> <p>Moving forward, I knew the task in therapy would be to continue to work on allowing Tina’s feelings to be represented on the outside by using words and thoughts rather than scars. This is no mean feat but it is possible if the therapist is highly attuned to feelings, doesn’t avoid conflict and sets compassionate limits. </p> <p>There is no quick fix but there is hope for a more bearable way to be in the world for those whose trust is broken.</p> <ul> <li><p>Prof Gill Straker and Dr Jacqui Winship are co-authors of <a href=\"https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781760781163/\">The Talking Cure</a>.

the sort of place a Hollywood A-lister would gravitate towards.</p> <p>But the restaurant and takeaway is enjoying a moment in the spotlight after the actor Ryan Reynolds, the star of the Deadpool films, extolled its virtues to his 44 million followers on Instagram, declaring it to serve the “best Indian food in Europe”.</p> <p>Reynolds has been spending time in the UK having taken over

Maidstone United 5-0, and apparently he celebrated with a curry from the Light of India.</p> <p>It is not clear if Reynolds sat inside or tucked into a takeaway from the restaurant, which is about 20 miles (32km) north of Wrexham – a 30-minute car journey. But he posted a flyer from the curry house (est. 1980) on his social media feed with his very positive review.</p> <p>The family restaurant was delighted – and a little bemused – by Reynolds’ praise. On duty at the weekend were Rajia Rahaman, 49, and her husband, Rahamann Batan, 51. Unfortunately they did not know who Reynolds was.</p> <p>Their son Shaa Rahaman, 28, said: “The first we knew anything about it was when Ryan posted his review. We asked my parents if he had been in but they didn’t even know who he was. We showed them a picture and they couldn’t remember seeing him. So it may be that he or a member of his team ordered and collected a takeaway.</p> <p>“It’s crazy. To think he says we’re the best in Europe – Europe is a pretty big place. We’re glad he enjoyed his meal. We’re pretty well known in the area. It may be that some of the Wrexham fans told him about us.</p> <p>“We’ve been so busy since. The phone has been ringing off the hook. It’s amazing publicity for us. I want to try to get in touch with Ryan now to see if we can name a dish in honour of him – the Deadpool masala, perhaps.”</p> <p>The curry house is certainly cheaper than Reynolds is probably used to. Its bestsellers include chicken tikka masala at £7.50, and its chef’s special is a curry topped with an omelette – just £7.90.</p> <p>Reviews on TripAdvisor are a little mixed. One fan said: “A nice family-run restaurant, food is always fresh, they don’t buy frozen meat or veg.” But a disappointed visitor said: “Each of the three main dishes were bland-looking, watery, and lacking in taste. The chicken and lamb was cooked well, but the king prawns were small, and very chewy.”</p> <p>The story of how Reynolds and McElhenny came to be at the helm of an unglitzy club is being told in Welcome to Wrexham, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/19/welcome-to-wrexham-to-selling-the-oc-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week\">a documentary</a> being screened from Thursday 25 August on Disney+.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/22/vanessa-feltz-to-join-talktv-to-take-over-jeremy-kyles-drivetime-show","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T17:24:50Z","webTitle":"Vanessa Feltz to join TalkTV to take over Jeremy Kyle’s drivetime show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/22/vanessa-feltz-to-join-talktv-to-take-over-jeremy-kyles-drivetime-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/22/vanessa-feltz-to-join-talktv-to-take-over-jeremy-kyles-drivetime-show","fields":{"headline":"Vanessa Feltz to join TalkTV to take over Jeremy Kyle’s drivetime show","trailText":"Presenter had earlier announced exit from BBC after nearly 20 years and will take on three-hour slot from September","byline":"Jamie Grierson","body":"<p>Vanessa Feltz has announced she is joining TalkTV after leaving the BBC after nearly 20 years on its radio stations.</p> <p>Feltz, 60, will replace Jeremy Kyle as presenter of the fledgling network’s three-hour drivetime show from 5 September.

It has also hired Burges Salmon, another law firm, on a £9.8m legal services deal.</p> <p>The early outlays of public funds suggest the UK-wide inquiry into the response to and impact of the pandemic will be one of the most expensive ever statutory public inquiries. The costs were totted up by Tussell, a company that monitors government contracts, and first reported by Politico.</p> <p>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said: “If [the inquiry chair] Baroness Hallett allows powerful institutions to run up the costs with eye-wateringly expensive lawyers just to protect their reputations then the inquiry would be a shocking waste of time and money.”</p> <p>The Home Office has agreed a £500,000 “strategic communications” deal with Crest Advisory, an agency founded by a former Downing Street adviser, and the government is spending £64,000 on monitoring media coverage of the inquiry, beyond what its own press offices already do.</p> <p>The inquiry’s own costs appear likely to exceed £100m, while further costs will be borne by the taxpayer through the government legal department and the funding of representation for core participants, which are likely to include bereaved groups, the NHS, representatives of disproportionately affected minorities, and town halls that had a key role in the public health response.</p> <p>The narrower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-inquiry\">Grenfell Tower inquiry</a> has been running for more than four years and has so far spent £88m on core costs of the chair, secretariat, legal team and experts, as well as the venue.

They added: “All appointments represent value for money and ensure that the inquiry can fulfil its remit.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the inquiry said: “Annual accounts for the UK Covid-19 inquiry will be published on the inquiry website.”</p> <p>The Covid inquiry’s chair, Heather Hallett, formally opened proceedings in July and said the sprawling investigation would be broken down into at least nine modules, which will run one after another. She said it would examine the “performance and effectiveness” of central government decision-making and its messaging – topics likely to expose current and former ministers.</p> <p>Lady Hallett faces a trade-off between speed and covering every angle of the pandemic. She said in her opening remarks in July that she wanted to move as “speedily as possible so lessons are learned before another pandemic strikes” and that inequalities would be “at the forefront” of the investigation.</p> <p>But in a sign of the potential for mission creep, NGOs including Oxfam GB and the People’s Vaccine Alliance have urged her to widen the scope to examine how the UK’s policy on buying up vaccines affected poorer parts of the world and how the UK government “shut out expertise from the global south and allowed great disparity in access to health tools worldwide, allowing the threat of new variants to remain”.</p> <p>The terms of reference were set earlier in the summer after a public consultation and appear unlikely to change. The first preliminary hearing establishing how the module examining the UK’s preparedness will take place on 20 September, but substantive evidence hearings will not happen before next summer.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/22/freeports-will-drive-growth-not-criminality","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T17:07:24Z","webTitle":"Freeports will drive growth, not criminality | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/22/freeports-will-drive-growth-not-criminality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/22/freeports-will-drive-growth-not-criminality","fields":{"headline":"Freeports will drive growth, not criminality","trailText":"<strong>Letters: Richard Ballantyne</strong> celebrates the potential of freeports, but <strong>Neil Davidson </strong>warns of the risk that they will simply take business from other locations","byline":"Letters","body":"<p>George Monbiot (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/freeport-turbocapitalism-tramples-over-british-democracy-teesside-plymouth\" title=\"\">Welcome to the freeport, where turbocapitalism tramples over British democracy, 17 August</a>) seems to have completely misunderstood the latest iteration of freeports.

However, there is a justifiable criticism of the freeports policy in that, by only selecting a limited number of sites, there is the threat of distortion as policymakers are picking winners and therefore leaving some regions out of this flagship levelling-up initiative.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Richard Ballantyne</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Chief executive, British Ports Association</em></p> <p>• George Monbiot highlights the numerous issues and inconsistencies raised by current UK policy on freeports. There is another key risk associated with the development of UK freeports: displacement. The danger is that “new” business at the freeports will simply be existing jobs and economic activity relocating from now disadvantaged locations in the rest of the UK, as the playing field is no longer level. Tellingly, two-thirds of respondents to the freeport policy consultation process said they felt there was a significant risk of such displacement taking place. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Neil Davidson</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Freeport manager, Port of Tilbury, 1992-95</em></p> <p><strong>• <em>Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As a 20-year-old student, I find Zoe Williams’ article patronising (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/19/why-generation-z-should-give-up-striving-to-be-their-best-self\" title=\"\">Why generation Z should give up striving to be their best selves, 19 August</a>). She’s applying her own experience of youth to our situation, implying we’re doing youthhood “wrong”. The reality is that we’re doing our best. I know plenty of people who let their hair down by taking drugs, drinking and smoking, but a lot of the time they’re doing it to stave off the anxiety of external and internal pressures.</p> <p>As someone who has experienced sexual assault and tumultuous mental health, I find the idea that I should just get pissed and go make some mistakes “so regrettable that you’re still laughing in shame 30 years later” insulting. I’m sure there were people of Williams’ age who were self-aware and also scared of the future, but this is the case for most of my peers now. We’re scared of what generation X and the baby boomers have done to our planet and society, and we’re the ones who have to fix it.</p> <p>And we do try to relax. We socialise in ways that are foreign to older people, taking on crafts and side projects, and some of us do spend an evening a week at the pub. But we can’t “just relax” – it’s never been that simple.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• Zoe Williams rightly accuses generation Z of being “risk averse”. However, she neglects the crucial question: why? As a result, she conflates the symptoms with the cause; the erosion of risk-taking, creeping isolation and the individualism of self-help lifestyles are not isolated phenomena that will be solved by articles promoting a “just loosen up” message.</p> <p>Social historians of the distant future will surely recognise that generation Z grew up riding the most substantial wave of technological change in recorded history. Our epitaph will surely mention that we were the subjects of an experiment – a project wherein the sleepless machine of social media consumed and filled every aspect of our lives. And all this change amid a climate of economic precariousness, austerity and intense globalisation. But hey, just loosen up!<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Jude Wilkinson</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>University of Warwick</em></p> <p>• Zoe Williams’ article keeps veering on to booze, as though drunkenness equates to fun and freedom. I don’t drink; I never have because I don’t like the taste. It never stopped me doing some crazy things in my youth, skinny dipping at unexpected moments, and making some appalling and embarrassing errors. Yes, try to encourage generation Z to “get out there”, but do they need alcohol to do it? Or is that just the perception of baby boomers and generation X (of which I am a member – just)?<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Alison Carter</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Lindfield, West Sussex</em></p> <p>• From my baby boomer perspective, Zoe Williams gets it wrong with her critique of generation Z, saying they should give up striving to be their best selves. A defining characteristic of boomers was our belief that we could make the world a better place.</p> <p>The good things in life don’t have to start in a pub. They often started in a boring room with a bunch of women making one another roar with laughter as they told tales of life in a sexist society. Or with a group of fell walkers, energetically disagreeing across the political spectrum. Or on an international work camp. Or on a CND march.</p> <p>My message to generation Z is: do it your way – you can’t make a bigger mess than your elders have.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Daphne Sanders</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Preston </em></p> <p><strong>• <em>Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, the vote will pile further pressure on the government, which faces escalating industrial action <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/20/further-disruption-on-rail-and-bus-services-as-transport-strikes-continue\">in the rail industry</a> and threats of strikes from teachers and health workers.</p> <p>Reacting to the decision, the victims’ commissioner, Dame Vera Baird, said the strike was the “latest symptom of a criminal justice system that is severely and recklessly underfunded. And it is victims who are ultimately paying the price and will continue to suffer the longer this goes on.”</p> <p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, accused the government of doing “absolutely nothing” to resolve industrial disputes, including the row with criminal barristers.</p> <p>The ballot of barristers closed at midnight on Sunday and the result was announced on Monday morning. The association said 79.5% of barristers who voted (1,808) supported the move to a full-time strike over legal aid rates, which they said had in effect been cut by 28% over the past decade.</p> <p>It will result in the vast majority of crown court trials in England and Wales being adjourned, while others could collapse entirely.</p> <p>The CBA vice-chair, Kirsty Brimelow QC, said this was “last-resort action” over a demand for less money than it costs the government for the courts to sit empty.</p> <p>She told BBC Breakfast: “The effect of the strike will be that the courts continue to sit empty with trials and cases not being heard. It is a last-resort action.</p> <p>“The remedy is for an injection of money into the backlog of cases, which currently stands at 60,000 cases, that barristers are working on that will cost the government only £1.1m per month. Currently, it’s costing much more for the courts to sit empty.”</p> <p>The CBA says incomes have fallen nearly 30% over the past two decades and specialist criminal barristers make an average annual income after expenses of £12,200 in the first three years of practice, driving 22% of junior criminal barristers to leave since 2016.</p> <p>Barristers say they are being paid less than the minimum wage for court hearings when travel and hours spent preparing are factored in – and not at all when hearings are cancelled.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice has offered a 15% uplift in fees, which was the minimum increase recommended by the criminal legal aid review (Clar). The CBA said this was insufficient after swingeing cuts and would not apply to the backlog of 58,000 cases in crown courts.</p> <p>The intermittent strikes began in June and were the first since 2014, which was the first time barristers had gone on strike, over legal aid fees.</p> <p>According to MoJ figures, more than 6,000 court hearings have been disrupted as a result of the dispute over conditions and government-set fees for legal aid advocacy work.</p> <p>Data released under freedom of information laws shows that during the first 19 days of industrial action, between 27 June and 5 August, there were 6,235 court cases disrupted, including 1,415 trials, across England and Wales.</p> <p>Responding to the vote, the justice minister Sarah Dines said: “This is an irresponsible decision that will only see more victims face further delays and distress.</p> <p>“The escalation of strike action is wholly unjustified considering we are increasing criminal barristers’ fees by 15%, which will see the typical barrister earn around £7,000 more a year.”</p> <p>Speaking to reporters in east London, Starmer said: “I quite understand, whether it’s barristers or others, why people and how people are struggling to make ends meet.”</p> <p>He added: “I want to see the government step in and actually help resolve these issues, instead of that we’ve got – a government doing absolutely nothing.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/aug/22/liz-truss-economic-plan-cost-of-living-rishi-sunak-conservative-leadership-uk-politics-latest","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T16:22:28Z","webTitle":"Sunak effectively rules out serving in a Truss cabinet, suggesting they don’t agree on ‘big things’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/aug/22/liz-truss-economic-plan-cost-of-living-rishi-sunak-conservative-leadership-uk-politics-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/aug/22/liz-truss-economic-plan-cost-of-living-rishi-sunak-conservative-leadership-uk-politics-latest","fields":{"headline":"Sunak effectively rules out serving in a Truss cabinet, suggesting they don’t agree on ‘big things’ – as it happened","trailText":"Tory leadership candidate says he is focused on race for No 10;

But the UK government had to “get its head out of the sand”, she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Scottish government is also working through an emergency budget review and assessment of other levers at our disposal to try to make sure we are doing everything possible.</p> <p>But the scale of this, and the reality in terms of where the levers of power lie and where the access to resources lie, means that we need to see the UK government really get its head out of the sand and start to take real action here.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5193e921e01b39ca00fdbd351ce3abe13d03f461\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5193e921e01b39ca00fdbd351ce3abe13d03f461/1095_563_1323_794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon being interviewed earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon being interviewed earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Mitchell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-63039c4a8f0865dc43db1742\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-22T15:12:33.968Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Conservative voters have “sellers’ remorse” over the ousting of Boris Johnson and would prefer him as prime minister over the two rivals vying to be his successor, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bring-back-boris-why-swing-voters-dont-trust-truss-or-sunak-0dqxlhdmb\">the Times reports today</a>.

Starmer argues that, as a prospective government, Labour should be committed to resolving disputes, not just siding with workers who go on strike, and when the current round of train strikes started he told shadow ministers and ministerial aides not to join picket lines.

On Friday<a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/consumer/energy-price-cap-when-announced-ofgem-announcement-date-how-much-prices-rise-october-1803963\"> Ofgem will announce what the energy price cap will be from October</a>, and on the Today programme this morning an interview with three energy company bosses illustrated quite how dire the outlook is.</p> <p><strong>Greg Jackson</strong>, the founder and chief executive of Octopus Energy, said the government had to help consumers because it was impossible for householders to meet rising costs on their own. He told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The big thing here is we need more help for customers from the government. The reality is customers are being asked to pay the price of gas, which is weaponised by Putin, and they shouldn’t be expected to do that alone.</p> <p>Let’s put it in perspective. The UK’s energy bill is going from maybe £15bn in a normal year to £75bn pounds this year. And that’s the equivalent of maybe 9p or more on the base rate of income tax. No government would announce that, and in the same way, no government should let this go to customers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Referring to the rise in wholesale gas prices, he went on: “Look, to put that in perspective, if this was beer, we’re talking about the wholesale price being £25 a pint.”</p> <p><strong>Dale Vince</strong>, founder of Ecotricity, also said the government had to step in. He told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This problem predates the Ukrainian war. We have a systemic failure in the energy market. The government does need to intervene. We shouldn’t expect customers to pay the cost of this failure and the Ukraine war …</p> <p>The government simply needs to step in and pick up this cost like they did in the pandemic. We need £40bn to get through this winter. That’s 10% of what was spent during the pandemic and that’s the only thing that will really sort this problem out.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jackson</strong> said one option for the government would be to freeze the energy price cap, and use a tariff deficit fund to help energy companies cover their costs. <strong>Vince</strong> also expressed support for the idea, and <strong>Bill Bullen</strong>, chief executive of Utilita, said the Conservative party should bring forward the end date for the leadership contest so that the new leader could cancel the rise in the energy price cap being announced on Friday. He told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All through the summer, we’ve been hearing about customers in distress, customers who are worried that they’re not able to heat their homes over this coming winter. That’s why we’re saying to the government, you’ve got to take this decision to freeze prices at their current level right now.</p> <p>This cannot wait until the 5th or 6th of September. The Conservative party needs to sort themselves out, decide who the leader is going to be this week, so that the Ofgem announcement on the 26th [the rise in the price cap for October] doesn’t have to happen. That is such an imperative.</p> <p>Frankly, for the sake of the nation, I think the Conservative party need to sort their leadership contest out quicker than they’re currently planning to do it. Then at least we will take away the stress of this winter coming up for tens of millions of households.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-08-22T09:56:41.097Z\">at 10.56am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6303408c8f08f8ea5d3a1dd4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-22T08:50:59.124Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the chart in the press release from the Rishi Sunak campaign released overnight explaining why it is saying Liz Truss is promising unfunded tax cuts and spending commitments worth £61.5bn.

Referring to <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11130535/Kwasi-Kwarteng-tipped-new-chancellor-reveals-measures-families-tackling-rising-bills.html\">an article by Kwasi Kwarteng in the Mail on Sunday</a> yesterday, in which Kwarteng (a Truss ally who is expected to be the next chancellor) said Truss would provide more help for people with the cost of living, a Sunak spokesperson said Truss wanted to avoid OBR scrutiny because she knew it would be impossible to deliver tax cuts and help with energy bills on the scale promised without “increasing borrowing to historic and dangerous levels, putting the public finances in serious jeopardy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/22/truss-poised-to-plunge-uk-economy-into-inflation-spiral-says-sunak\">plunging the economy into an inflation spiral</a>”.</p> <p>In response a Truss spokesperson said her plans were “sensible” and that: “We need a new approach to the economy, we need to challenge the failing economic orthodoxy and we need to deliver the necessary reform to tackle inflation and achieve sustainable growth.”</p> <p>I will post more on this row shortly.

The gun-lovin’ crowd shifted awkwardly in their seats.</p> <p>Here was a prank for the ages. But also one to make you wonder: whither the great British prank, as practised with distinction by the Mark Thomases and Chris Morrises of yore? Or by Sacha Baron Cohen, who recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/07/sacha-baron-cohen-defeats-roy-moore-lawsuit\">successfully defended a $95m lawsuit </a>against a Republican ex-senator identified by a “paedophile detector” on Baron Cohen’s 2018 show Who Is America?

But “we need more of them,” says Simon Brodkin, one of the art form’s celebrated exponents. “We need them when anyone starts taking themselves too seriously. Who the hell wants pomposity ruling the world?”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We got flung against walls. Our picture was circulated by naval intelligence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brodkin has now hung up his pranking boots, and refocused on standup with his new show Screwed Up at the Edinburgh fringe. But in his practical joking pomp, he once made life very uncomfortable for Theresa May, whom he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/04/the-cough-the-p45-the-falling-f-theresa-mays-speech-calamity\">served with a P45</a> at Tory conference; Donald Trump, on whose behalf he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/01/why-i-threw-swastika-golfballs-at-donald-trump-prankster-simon-brodkin-lee-nelson\">distributed Nazi golf balls</a> at the then-presidential nominee’s Turnberry course in 2016; and Fifa president Sepp Blatter, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pqO6tK8_Wg\">showered in dollars by Brodkin</a> at a 2015 news conference. They were heady times, says Brodkin. “For a while, I was one of the few people on the planet who, when they got arrested, was thinking, ‘That’s gone exactly as I planned!’</p> <p>“The best stunts or pranks are where you are inserting your comedy into a very serious area,” he says now. “And what is more serious than politics? What is more serious than a prime minister?” It’s an extraordinary form of comedy that can fast-track you to front pages – or a prison cell. “You don’t want to be wired up normally to do these things,” says Brodkin. “You need absolute single-minded determination. There are so many challenges and so many ups and downs. You have to think: ‘Am I going to get shot here?’ So you can’t go in half-hearted.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"efdf87e318d3c6770ed913b45c2f328e2d030da4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efdf87e318d3c6770ed913b45c2f328e2d030da4/0_0_5165_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fore! … Donald Trump’s aides clear away the swastika golfballs spread by Brodkin at Turnberry golf course in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fore! … Donald Trump’s aides clear away the swastika golfballs spread by Brodkin at Turnberry golf course in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By way of example, Brodkin cites the elaborate preparation required for his stunt at a Geneva motor show in 2016. Volkswagen had recently been exposed as cheating emissions regulations; Brodkin, dressed as a mechanic, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAtsmcxlMRs\">interrupted the company’s CEO</a> as he addressed the world’s press to attach a “cheat box” device to the display vehicle on stage. “There followed 10 or 15 minutes of security roughing me up. The police were convinced I was an Islamic fundamentalist trying to blow up Volkswagen’s latest car.”</p> <p>Jolyon Rubinstein can match that: “We had frequent run-ins with the secret service attaches to the PM and deputy PM,” he says. Rubinstein, with Heydon Prowse, played practical jokes on politicians, corporations and other deserving targets on the BBC’s Bafta-winning <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03gl290\">The Revolution Will Be Televised</a>, from 2012 to 2015. “We got flung against a number of walls,” he recalls. “Our picture was circulated by naval intelligence, which was quite a thing. It was a huge rush. The adrenaline was unreal.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5sJAHqbb8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YR5sJAHqbb8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Rubinstein and Prowse were Britain’s Good Liars for a while: a double-act who were one part comics to two parts activists. Brodkin defines his pranks as comical first and foremost: “It’s about the real world and the comedy moment colliding.” Whereas for Rubinstein and Prowse, who gatecrashed arms fairs and EDL marches, and asked David Cameron to autograph their Bullingdon Club photo album, it was about: “meting out comic justice to people who seem untouchable. But they’re not beyond reproach, and there needs to be a levelling of the playing field. It was always motivated by a sense of right and wrong. And the sense that people are getting away with it who shouldn’t be.”</p> <p>Most of the great pranks we remember fall into this category. I’m thinking of the “culture jamming” social activism of celebrated US duo <a href=\"https://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/the-yes-men/\">the Yes Men</a>. Or the “made-up drug” cake, touted by Chris Morris on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/30/brass-eye-at-20-still-chris-morris-at-his-hysterical-gobsmacking-best\">Brass Eye</a>. Or Borat inveigling Rudy Giuliani into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/21/rudy-giuliani-faces-questions-after-compromising-scene-in-new-borat-film\">compromising positions</a>. Or Mark Thomas (AKA “Thomas the prank engine”) getting an Indonesian general to admit that his country practised torture. “If journalism can’t hold power to account,” says Rubinstein, “then comedy must. I feel that very, very strongly. For the health of a democracy, that is profoundly important.”</p> <p>There exists another genus of prank, of course, which eschews politics entirely. For every Revolution Will Be Televised, there’s a <a href=\"https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/beadles_about/\">Beadle’s About</a>. For every Chris Morris, a Noel Edmonds – news of whose supposed death Morris broadcast in another Brass Eye stunt, but whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-T81SDKLE4\">Gotcha awards</a> on Noel’s House Party featured a brand of pranking (hijacking a quiz on Dave Lee Travis’s radio show; funny business with Richard Branson and a hot-air balloon) that was more popular than Morris’s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2fdd9453423a84c9394886d45ef59733630efec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fdd9453423a84c9394886d45ef59733630efec8/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘A bit of fun’ … Max Fosh’s Welcome to Luton sign, near Gatwick Airport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A bit of fun’ … Max Fosh’s Welcome to Luton sign, near Gatwick Airport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Nicholson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Into this lineage – “being silly, having fun, and putting a smile on people’s faces,” as he describes it – fits <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/MaxFosh?app=desktop\">Max Fosh</a>, a new prankster on the block brought to us by YouTube, and currently performing a fringe show too. But with Fosh’s work, there’s a twist. “I try to stay away from the word prank,” he tells me. “It has a negative connotation around there needing to be a victim. I don’t think people resonate with that any more.”</p> <p>Fosh is speaking to me while journeying to remove the giant “Welcome to Luton” sign he constructed in May next to Gatwick airport. “The idea being,” he says, “to have a bit of fun with passengers thinking, very momentarily, they’ve landed at the wrong airport.” (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-61541224\">Extensive media coverage</a> followed, and 8m views on YouTube.) “Does that have a larger importance to the cultural conversation?” he asks. “No. It’s more of a timeline thing. You’re scrolling through, you see that someone’s written in massive letters ‘Welcome to Luton’ outside Gatwick, you get your two seconds of ‘that’s quite fun’, then you keep going.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"76eba1286d5242626d344b09bfaedb761318dbea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76eba1286d5242626d344b09bfaedb761318dbea/211_723_1165_1659/702.jpg\" alt=\"‘I’m always thinking: might this be considered punching down?’ … Max Fosh.\" width=\"702\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’m always thinking: might this be considered punching down?’ … Max Fosh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You might think it sacrilegious to bracket such comedy with the work of Sacha Baron Cohen. But there are affinities between these opposing species of prank-work. In both cases, the comedy exists only retrospectively. In the moment, the perpetrator experiences high anxiety and “the person having the stunt done to them,” says Brodkin, “generally isn’t seeing the funny side.” Fosh adds: “While I was setting up a massive tarpaulin in a field, I wasn’t sure it was going to be particularly funny.”</p> <p>Both brands of pranking are largely male, too – not that anyone I speak to wishes to discuss the fact. (Brodkin: “Stop trying to get me cancelled, Brian!”) A reason for that gender bias may lie in the language its exponents use to describe the art form. “It’s like being a boxer,” says Brodkin, and later: “You probably need some good cojones on you.” Rubinstein, meanwhile, relates how he and Prowse racially profiled themselves: “We were two nice white middle-class boys who, once we put on a suit, could blend in with the status quo, pop out for comic effect, then vanish.” Blending in, and therefore pranking more generally, may be less easy when you don’t look like the powers-that-be. Fosh, incidentally, is an Old Harrovian.</p> <p>At both ends of the pranking scale, too, there are ethical considerations. “I’m always thinking: might this be considered punching down?” frets Fosh. For The Revolution Will Be Televised, a code of ethics known as “the Revolution protocols” were drawn up with the BBC, recalls Rubinstein. “We always needed to present a framework to prove public interest. And we focused tightly on institutions, public figures or corporations we could demonstrate had done something [wrong]. It’s about choosing your targets,” he says.</p> <p>No one in pranking needs to be reminded of what can happen when stunts go sour. In 2012, for example, two Australian DJs made a call to the Duchess of Cambridge’s hospital ward, pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles. Their prank was followed three days later by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/jacintha-saldanha-took-blame-prank-call-duchess-cambridge-australian-djs-inquest\">the suicide of nurse Jacintha Saldanha</a>, who took the call.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20bcbf94987ea2a453bcc6046c8730a3caa8f1e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20bcbf94987ea2a453bcc6046c8730a3caa8f1e8/7_0_907_544/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler, AKA the Good Liars, are held back by police as they attempt to ‘exorcise’ Senator Ted Cruz.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler, AKA the Good Liars, are held back by police as they attempt to ‘exorcise’ Senator Ted Cruz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Good Liars</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of that diminishes, in Rubinstein’s eyes, the importance of pranking – in its political variety, at least – to the health of the nation. “We have a huge tradition going back to Swift of poking fun at public figures to make sure no one gets too big for their boots. The BBC and Channel 4 need to be braver right now in enabling those who have the gumption to put themselves in harm’s way.” Brodkin concurs: “How better to say what you think about someone than right to their face?” he asks. “Bring it to them. Let them know.”</p> <p>“Mind you,” he adds, “most of the people who’re worth pranking couldn’t care less about what the world thinks of them. That’s the flipside. If you were pranking people who cared what other people thought of them, they probably wouldn’t be worth pranking in the first place.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/simon-brodkin-screwed-up\">Simon Brodkin: Screwed Up</a> is at Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 27 August. <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/max-fosh-zocial-butterfly\">Max Fosh: Zocial Butterfly</a> is at Underbelly, Edinburgh, until 29 August</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/22/russian-security-service-fsb-claim-to-have-identified-killer-of-darya-dugina-lacks-credibility","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T16:04:44Z","webTitle":"Russian security service claim to have identified killer of Darya Dugina lacks credibility","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/22/russian-security-service-fsb-claim-to-have-identified-killer-of-darya-dugina-lacks-credibility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/22/russian-security-service-fsb-claim-to-have-identified-killer-of-darya-dugina-lacks-credibility","fields":{"headline":"Russian security service claim to have identified killer of Darya Dugina lacks credibility","trailText":"Analysis: rapid detection of supposed culprit by the FSB raises question of why no arrest was made","byline":"Shaun Walker","body":"<p>Each new claim over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/daughter-of-putin-ally-alexander-dugin-killed-in-car-bomb-in-moscow-reports\">attack that killed Darya Dugina</a> seems to raise more questions than it answers.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Russia’s FSB security service <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/22/russian-security-service-accuses-ukraine-over-darya-dugina-killing\">claimed to have cracked the case</a>, publishing information and a video it said showed a Ukrainian woman from the country’s Azov regiment was responsible for the murder of Dugina, whose father is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/alexander-dugin-who-putin-ally-apparent-car-bombing-target\">the far-right ideologue Alexander Dugin</a>.</p> \n<p>According to the FSB, the assassin managed to enter Russia with her 12-year-old daughter in tow, move around undetected while frequently changing the plates on her Mini Cooper, plant and detonate a professional explosive device, and leave the country.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f913f92e-746e-4d2d-aa5a-8d3a43667b50\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dsWYFVvDcQY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Supposedly, she managed to do all this without being spotted by Russia’s security services until after she had fled, presumably by posing as one of the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have either sought refuge in Russia or been forcibly deported from occupied areas of Ukraine.</p> \n<p>The FSB’s claims will be met with extreme scepticism, and Ukraine has strongly denied any involvement in the attack, pointing out that Dugin was a marginal figure and insisting it does not carry out this kind of mission.</p> \n<p>But it is not impossible to imagine a motive for Kyiv: Dugina’s death came as Ukrainians are increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/ukraine-strikes-psychological-blows-game-of-drones-crimea\">taking the fight to Russia in occupied Crimea</a> for the first time since the invasion in February. Operations such as an<a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/11/17/inside-wagnergate-ukraines-brazen-sting-operation-to-snare-russian-mercenaries/\"> audacious plan</a> to lure a group of Russian mercenaries to Ukraine two years ago show that there are those in the Ukrainian services who like to think big.</p> \n<p>Additionally, while it is true that Dugin is hardly the Putin-whisperer that some make him out to be, there is no doubt that he does have high name recognition both in Russia and the west, and he has made frequent, odious calls for violence against Ukraine and Ukrainians. If the calculation was for a high-profile target who was nonetheless reasonably vulnerable and had minimal security, Dugin would not be an illogical choice, assuming that he and not his daughter was the original intended target.</p> \n<p>However, the speed with which the FSB has come up with video “evidence”, as well as several rather puzzling aspects of its story, certainly raise red flags. For an agency that has failed to solve numerous high-profile murders in Russia, including of Putin critics, the speed of the FSB’s work on this case is as suspicious as its lack of progress elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Other versions of events floated also seem far from watertight. On Sunday, the former Russian MP Ilya Ponomarev, now living in exile in Kyiv, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/ex-russian-mp-claims-russian-partisans-responsible-for-moscow-car-bomb\">claimed</a> that partisans from a hitherto-unknown group called the National Republican Army were behind the attack, adding an unexpected and intriguing dimension to the case. But Ponomarev did not provide any evidence, and many observers have dismissed the claim as a publicity stunt.</p> \n<p>Officials in Ukraine have suggested the killing was more likely to be a “false flag” operation, organised by the Russian state in order to frame Ukraine and provide a justification for further violence. Certainly, it has done that: propagandists such as Margarita Simonyan of the television network RT have called for increased targeting of Ukraine and Ukrainians in the aftermath.</p> \n<p>However, it is not clear that Russia needed any pretext to continue its aggression, and if the whole case was a set-up, it is one that makes the FSB and Russian state look curiously vulnerable and incompetent.</p> \n<p>In the FSB’s version of events, a Ukrainian assassin was able to enter Russia, carry out a high-profile killing near the capital and then flee, all without being apprehended.

The fork in the road</strong></p> <p>You are travelling to a Take That concert when you arrive at a fork in the road. Only one of the paths leads to the concert. Two people are standing there who know the way. One is a knight and the other a knave. As is well-known in logic puzzles, a knight will always tell the truth and a knave will always lie. What single question can you ask one of these people that guarantees you will know the correct path to the concert, A or B?</p> <p><em>a) Which is the correct path?</em></p> <p><em>b) Shall I choose path A?</em></p> <p><em>c) What path would the other person tell me to choose?</em></p> <p><em>d) Shall I choose path B?</em></p> <p><strong>Solution</strong>: c)</p> <p>The point of this question is that you must ask a question that guarantees the correct answer whether you ask a knight <em>or </em>a knave. For questions a), b) and d), a knave and a knight will give opposite answers. Thus, if you ask these questions you cannot guarantee that you will know the correct path. But if you ask c) both a knight and a knave will recommend the same path. If they say B, the correct path is A, and vice versa.</p> <p><strong>2. The sharpest nibs in the box</strong></p> <p>Robbie, Gary,and Jason work at a shop that sells pens, erasers, and pencils.</p> <p>Robbie says: “Seven pens and five erasers cost the same as six pencils.”</p> <p>Gary says: “Four pens and nine pencils cost the same as five erasers.”</p> <p>Jason says: “Six pencils and three erasers cost the same as four pens.”</p> <p><em>Only one is lying. Can you tell us who?</em></p> <p>a) Robbie</p> <p>b) Gary</p> <p>c) Jason</p> <p><strong>Solution</strong> Robbie.</p> <p><em>Let A equal the price of pens, B equal the price of erasers, and C equal the price of pencils.</em></p> <p><em>Robbie is saying that 7A+5B=6C.</em></p> <p><em>Gary is saying that 4A+9C=5B.</em></p> <p><em>Jason is saying that 6C+3B=4A.</em></p> <p><em>Combining Robbie and Gary’s statements, we get 11A=−3C.

But since no one can see their own hats, there must be more people.</em></p> <p><em>If there are 7+ people with an orange hat and 7+ people with an indigo hat, then there are 14+ people who would raise their glasses - more than the actual 12. Therefore there must be 6 people with a hat of one colour (say, orange), and more than 6 with a hat of the other colour (indigo).</em></p> <p><em>The people with an orange hat can see only 5 other orange hats, so they don’t raise their glasses. But all people with an indigo hat will raise their glasses. Therefore there are 12 people with indigo hats.

Figures showed that executives received £100,000 on average in one-off payments on top of their salaries, during a period in which foul water was being pumped for 2.7m hours into England’s rivers and swimming spots.</p> <p>In total, the 22 water bosses paid themselves £24.8m, including £14.7m in bonuses, benefits and incentives, in 2021-22.</p> <p>Leaking pipes have also come back into the spotlight. After a drought in 1995, strict leakage targets were enforced, and levels of leaking fell significantly. But in 2002 Ofwat put in place new criteria for leakage targets, called economic leakage level (ELL). This meant that companies only had to fix a leak if the value of the water lost was greater than the cost of fixing it. </p> <p>As the Angling Trust puts it: “In other words, the environmental consequences of wasting water were discarded as irrelevant in favour of screwing down water bills.” Figures uncovered by the trust show that under the ELLs regime, leakage first rose and then failed to fall appreciably until a new target-setting regime was reintroduced as part of the 2019 price review for the industry.</p> <p>Martin Salter, the policy chief at the Angling Trust, said: “The way water in this country is managed and regulated is a complete and utter shambles and Ofwat have been a major part of the problem. For years they gave water companies a licence to leak while ministers failed to demand the levels of infrastructure investment needed to enable us to store water in times of surplus in order to protect consumers, the environment and the economy in times like these.”</p> <h2>The blocked reservoir</h2> <p>Meanwhile there are concerns about the need for new reservoirs, such as the one that campaigners have been asking for in the Thames Water catchment area.</p> <p> In 2011 Ofwat refused to back plans for building to proceed, and the Planning Inspectorate determined that there was “no immediate need for a reservoir of this scale”. When plans were revived in 2019 and debated in parliament, Charles Walker, the Conservative MP for Broxbourne, said: “The role of Ofwat has not been mentioned yet. It has no duty to have any environmental regard. Its only interest is in driving down bills, but it should take a great deal more interest in the environment. I think we have all had enough of Ofwat in this place. I hope the minister will take that onboard.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a37776e41bc4ad593489f773168761301ef3a11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a37776e41bc4ad593489f773168761301ef3a11/995_740_3763_2258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonson Cox, Chair of Water Services Regulation Authority @Ofwat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonson Cox, the chair of Ofwat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Stockill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>NGOs have also raised the alarm over the appearance at times of a revolving-door relationship between Ofwat and the water companies. There was <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/water-bosss-pound10m-goodbye-r90368pvpq8\">media attention</a> when Jonson Cox, a previous executive at Anglian Water who left with a £9.5m “golden goodbye”, went to work as chair of Ofwat. And last year Thames Water hired Cathryn Ross as director of strategy and external affairs. Her previous job was CEO of Ofwat.</p> <p>Dunne believes that for decades water companies and the regulator operated in an environment where water and sewage were low political priorities. “I think everybody would suggest that there’s not enough being done, but that’s because water has not had the political priority,” he said. “It’s only now that we’re seeing the consequences of the lack of political priority and investment over the last few decades.” </p> <p>Dunne argued that the system needs overhauling because two separate agencies, Ofwat and the Environment Agency, regulate water companies, so there is not a holistic approach and the toughest sanctions possible are not taken.</p> <p>“We’ve got a regulatory system which, by dividing between the financial regulator and the environment regulator, means that, I think, there are there are questions to ask about whether this is the optimal means of regulating any industry because there’s a division of responsibilities.</p> <p>“The Office for Environmental Protection is now in place and has decided as one of its first sort of overarching inquiries to look at whether the regulatory system is working or not. And that’s something that I very much welcomed.”</p> <p>An Ofwat spokesperson said: “Over the last 20 years we’ve imposed fines, penalties and secured spending commitments totalling over £339m specifically for failure on leakage. This money has been used to improve performance, and where appropriate, money has been returned to customers at the expense of shareholders. Companies’ performance on leakage has been improving in recent years with leakage now at the lowest level since privatisation, and we will keep pushing them on this issue. Where they fail, we will act to hold them to account.</p> <p> “We’ve made our expectations explicitly clear that performance related pay for CEOs should be clearly linked to their performance for customers, the environment and society. We are carrying out our own analysis and plan to report on whether we feel companies have clearly made this link. Performance related pay can’t be a one-way street; if companies are not performing that should be reflected in executive pay.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/22/mild-electric-shocks-to-the-brain-may-protect-older-people-from-memory-loss","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T15:56:57Z","webTitle":"Mild electric shocks to the brain may protect older people from memory loss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/22/mild-electric-shocks-to-the-brain-may-protect-older-people-from-memory-loss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/22/mild-electric-shocks-to-the-brain-may-protect-older-people-from-memory-loss","fields":{"headline":"Mild electric shocks to the brain may protect older people from memory loss","trailText":"Researchers suggest this treatment could help Alzheimer’s patients but critics are unsure","byline":"Sascha Pare","body":"<p>Giving mild electric shocks to the brain could protect older people from short-term and long-term memory loss, research suggests. </p> <p>It remains unclear as to whether the approach could help people with dementia. Robert Reinhart, an assistant professor at Boston University and a co-author of the study, said memory loss was a normal symptom of cognitive decline experienced as we age, and that forgetfulness could affect decision-making, planning and learning, for example.</p> <p>Reinhart and his team found that targeting specific areas of the brain with a noninvasive weak electrical current in repeated 20-minute sessions over four days could help prevent memory decline for at least a month.</p> <p>“Based on the spatial location and the frequency of the electrical stimulation, we could improve either short-term memory or long-term memory separately,” Reinhart said.</p> <p>However, others said the study was limited to healthy participants and word recall, meaning the results would not necessarily apply to those living with dementia.</p> <p>The team recruited 150 people aged 65 to 88. On four consecutive days, the researchers asked participants to recall five lists of 20 words while electrical signals were delivered to parts of the brain involved in short-term and long-term memory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/17/stop-drinking-keep-reading-look-after-your-hearing-a-neurologists-tips-for-fighting-memory-loss-and-alzheimers\">Stop drinking, keep reading, look after your hearing: a neurologist’s tips for fighting memory loss and Alzheimer’s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The researchers tracked the participants’ performance over the four days, as well as one month after the experiment. “We watched the memory improvements accumulate over time with each passing day, so that the memory enhancement in short-term memory and long-term memory were observable at the one-month timepoint,” Reinhart said.</p> <p>The participants who were the most forgetful at the beginning of the study displayed the greatest gains a month after the treatment, said the researchers.</p> <p>“Older people with poor general cognitive functioning at baseline – coming into the experiment – showed the largest improvements during the intervention and the one-month timepoint,” said Reinhart. This meant that electrical brain stimulation could help patients with more severe memory impairment, such as those with Alzheimer’s disease, he said.</p> <p>“The effects on memory were of the order of remembering three to four more words out of a list of 20, but this improvement in memory ability was detectable one month after stimulation which is quite remarkable,” said Prof Masud Husain from the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study. </p> <p>Dr Susan Kohlhaas, the director of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, who was not involved in the study, said: “This is a small early-stage study that showed some memory benefits for older people who received a type of noninvasive brain stimulation involving specialised equipment and very specific procedures.</p> <p>“It is important to note that these participants did not have memory problems, and this research doesn’t tell us anything about the potential to slow cognitive decline caused by diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Many people experience changes in their memory skills as they get older and it’s not necessarily a sign of dementia. Anyone with concerns about their memory should speak to their GP.”</p> <p>Prof Tara Spires-Jones, from the UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh, who was also not involved in the study, said: “This is promising work, and it shows how amazingly flexible and adaptable the brain is. However, the participants were given really specific word-list tasks, which might not be so representative of everyday activities.”</p> <p>Regular exercise and lifelong learning are effective ways to slow memory decline, Spires-Jones said. “Keeping fit and healthy is very protective against cognitive decline and dementia. Taking good care of your body and mind is taking good care of your brain.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2022/aug/22/forbidden-fruit-why-vegans-are-up-in-arms-over-tescos-oranges-and-lemons","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T15:53:30Z","webTitle":"Forbidden fruit: why vegans are up in arms over Tesco’s oranges and lemons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/aug/22/forbidden-fruit-why-vegans-are-up-in-arms-over-tescos-oranges-and-lemons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/aug/22/forbidden-fruit-why-vegans-are-up-in-arms-over-tescos-oranges-and-lemons","fields":{"headline":"Forbidden fruit: why vegans are up in arms over Tesco’s oranges and lemons","trailText":"What happens when you treat citrus fruit with animal products like shellac and beeswax?

That they’re idiots.</p> <p>This isn’t to say that there is no point talking politics to regular people. You can learn really useful things when you actually listen, especially when multiple voices spontaneously make the same point. But the process generally lacks the trust and patience. Why wait for people to have their own ideas, when you could get to your weird destination much faster by asking which candidate’s nose looks more leaderly?</p> <p>Anyway, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/from-bunny-rabbit-to-traitor-what-red-wall-voters-think-of-liz-truss-and-rishi-sunak-cqxvbzd9l\">the most recent adventure in temperature-taking </a>was with 10 swing voters who all voted Conservative in 2019. According to the Times, Rishi Sunak reminds people of a ferret; Liz Truss is a budgie, but also a bunny rabbit and Jemima Puddle-Duck. Some of it just sounds like free association (lame duck to puddle-duck). Some comparisons sound a bit panicked, as you would be if someone asked for a quick answer to a dumb question: Sunak, what does he remind you of, with his funny pointy teeth? Er … What else has teeth? Other times, it’s just blatantly sexist: budgies, rabbits, these are no more than classic cartoon chatterers, silly aunts. All people are really saying with these comparisons is: “I prefer women when they’re not talking.”</p> <p>Besides, what is a politician supposed to do with this information? So the public comes back and says you remind them of an otter; what next? Do you lean in and be more otter? Do you try to create subliminal associations with a sea lion?</p> <p>The “Who would you go for a drink with?” question, known in the US as “the beer question” (here, the beer is implied) is meant to be definitive: it’s a test of likability, and whoever is most liked always wins. It is often criticised for being culturally skewed towards a drinking culture, and (in the US, at least), implicitly sexist because you’re more likely to find men in bars. A way bigger problem is, what can this possibly tell us, when you would rather die of thirst than go for a drink with any of them? Sunak edged it on this particular occasion, even though he is teetotal and more likely to buy himself a swimming pool than buy you so much as a scampi-flavoured fry, and, judging from their other, less structured answers, the panel was aware of this.</p> <p>So, the interesting thing was Sunak not in one-word answers, but in people’s own words. If you go to a building site in £490 suede<em> </em>shoes, it makes you look so rich that you’ve “no respect for money”, said one. Another participant – different age, different income bracket, different gender – said: “If you are going to an area where … people are on the minimum wage, don’t wear £500 shoes.” Commentators have been pounding these streets since the contest began, telling everyone that there’s no such thing as “too rich to be PM”, that wealth is just another strand of identity and as such has to be approached neutrally, like race or sexuality. Turns out you can lead the “red wall” to the Kool-Aid but you cannot make it drink. They’re trying to tell you something, pollsters. But, will you listen, or will you just add a new formula for next time: “What shoes can you imagine this person wearing to a building site?”</p> <p>The Conservative party has been delivered to this fix by groupthink and overconfidence. They are pretending to present to the membership: a Boris-continuity candidate, Liz Truss; and a clean skin, Rishi Sunak. But, Truss is nothing like Boris Johnson. She is nothing like him politically, because he had no politics and hers are batshit, and she’s nothing like him personally, which is more or less the only thing you can say to her credit. Sunak, meanwhile, has been chancellor for three years; ain’t nobody need a vampire to tell them that’s not fresh blood.

At a time when we are helping settle many Afghans who supported western authorities, they must have particular confidence that our institutions – private and public – will treat them with the utmost dignity and respect they deserve.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for St George’s said: “We agree that the matter should be investigated without fear or favour, and trust that politicians and others will keep an open mind about it until a determination has been made. The school has submitted a detailed rebuttal of the allegations to the registrar and we are content to let the process now run its course.”</p> <p>Tugendhat, a former British army intelligence officer who knows Dean, said the former al-Qaida bombmaker turned spy had saved thousands of lives.

However, supplies of the jab, initially developed to tackle the more serious but eradicated disease smallpox, are limited.</p> <p>In July the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/19/uk-orders-more-doses-of-monkeypox-vaccine-as-cases-pass-2000\">ordered an additional 100,000 doses</a> of the Imvanex smallpox vaccine, also known as Jynneos, which is manufactured by Bavarian Nordic. These are expected to arrive next month. In the meantime, concerns have been raised that the UK is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/10/uk-will-run-out-of-monkeypox-vaccine-in-10-to-20-days\">close to exhausting its current supplies</a>.</p> <p>Now the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has announced that it will trial offering eligible patients smaller doses of the vaccine, a move it says could allow five times as many people to be protected.</p> <p>The agency noted that studies suggest smaller doses generate “a near-identical” immune response compared with full doses, and the approach has been used in other viral outbreaks around the world when vaccine supplies are tight.</p> <p>“Global supplies of the smallpox vaccine used to combat monkeypox are limited but we acted early to ensure the UK obtained the maximum number of doses available,” said Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at the UKHSA.</p> <p>“Adopting this tried and tested technique will help to maximise the reach of our remaining stock, including the 100,000 doses due to arrive in the country next month, potentially enabling us to offer protection for many more thousands of people. We will continue to remain agile in our response to the monkeypox outbreak and will adapt our approach as new science and advice becomes available.”</p> <p>The approach, in which recipients aged 18 and over are given 0.1ml of the vaccine rather than the full 0.5ml dose, is being trialled in a sexual health clinic in Manchester from Monday, with two clinics in London set to follow suit.</p> <p>UKHSA said eligibility for vaccination before exposure remained unchanged – encompassing gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men who meet criteria such as having a recent history of multiple partners or participating in group sex.</p> <p>However, it was limiting the offer of vaccination after exposure to monkeypox to those most at risk of severe illness, such as people with immunosuppression, children under the age of five and pregnant women. These groups will, at present, continue to receive the full dose of the vaccine.</p> <p>Dr Will Nutland, an honorary assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and a co-founder of PrEPster, said the use of smaller doses was pragmatic and welcome.</p> <p>“Communities we are engaging with are keen to receive vaccination as soon as possible, and the pilots provide the opportunity to understand the acceptability and feasibility of providing vaccination this way,” he said.</p> <p>“Evidence shows that fractional dosing, when correctly administered, is as effective as the vaccination method currently in use. We must now collectively move to ensure that those who are given the opportunity to receive vaccination are fully informed and are confident to come forward when invited.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/22/experts-question-security-online-vote-pick-tory-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T15:15:34Z","webTitle":"Experts question security of online vote to pick Tory leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/22/experts-question-security-online-vote-pick-tory-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/22/experts-question-security-online-vote-pick-tory-leader","fields":{"headline":"Experts question security of online vote to pick Tory leader","trailText":"Technology should not be used as it is unproven for such high-stakes elections, one security specialist says","byline":"Alex Hern","body":"<p>The Conservative party should not use online voting to pick its leader and next prime minister, cybersecurity experts have warned, as the technology is not proven for such a “high stakes” use.</p> <p>For the first time, the next UK prime minister will be selected by online voters, as well as those sending paper ballots.

Such proposals, or claims to be “net zero”, suppose that businesses operate in a way that doesn’t increase the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.</p> <p>But there’s an asterisk in the form of so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/04/what-is-carbon-offsetting-and-how-does-it-work\">carbon offsets</a>, or plans which supposedly balance out emissions by reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by, for example, planting trees or building wind turbines.</p> <p>Carbon offsets are a popular route for reaching “net zero” – Oliver cited one <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/blog/two-thirds-of-the-worlds-heaviest-emitters-have-set-a-net-zero-target/\">study</a> which found that two-thirds of companies in heavily polluting industries relied on offsets instead of emissions reductions to reach carbon neutrality. And if the idea that you can invest money and make your carbon footprint disappear sounds too good to be true, “that’s because it is”, he said.</p> <p>“Study after study has indicated that most offsets available on the market don’t reliably reduce emissions, and yet offsets are now the backbone of the environmental policies of many of the biggest polluters on the planet.”</p> <p>The idea of a carbon offset is that, in theory, a company emitting fossil fuels can build mechanisms to absorb the same amount of emissions in the future that you release now. “Offsets allow businesses that can’t immediately reduce their emissions to balance things out by buying emissions reductions somewhere else,” Oliver explained. But “on some level, you probably know that carbon offsets are bullshit, both because you’re a reasonably intelligent person and because you know exactly what show you are watching right now. I don’t open my beak to squawk out good news.”</p> <p>“But exactly how offsets are bullshit is really interesting,” he continued, “because it’s easy to say that you are reducing carbon emissions but it is much harder to prove it. And the truth is, there aren’t many checks and balances in place to prevent abuse.”</p> <p>Oliver turned to the qualifying concept of additionality – the idea that an offset should provide an extra reduction of carbon that wouldn’t have happened any other way, like planting a tree that wouldn’t otherwise have been planted. A lot of cases for additionality are what Oliver called “shaky at best”, such as JP Morgan’s claim that it reached carbon neutrality in 2020. Doing so included buying $1m worth of offsets claiming to protect an area in Pennsylvania called Hawk Mountain preserve that wasn’t actually under threat of deforestation. “That probably should’ve been obvious from the fact that it was a preserve and not called the Hawk Mountain Chop Zone and Tree Murder Playground,” Oliver explained.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p8zAbFKpW0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6p8zAbFKpW0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Experts have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/04/carbon-offsets-used-by-major-airlines-based-on-flawed-system-warn-experts\">warned</a> that the system used to certify carbon offsets to major airlines – you can now spend $2 at the airport in Austin, Texas, to “offset” 1,000 miles of air travel – is not “fit for use”.</p> <p>“The problem with carbon offsets is everyone wants to believe in them,” said Oliver. “Buyers want a cheap way to make a big claim, and sellers want money for doing as little as possible. And ideally, there’d be an entity in the middle charged with keeping both sides honest.” Those entities are called carbon offset registries, which are supposed to be neutral third parties who sign off on the efficacy of potential offsets.</p> <p>“But those registries aren’t really accountable to anyone,” Oliver said. “Technically, you or I could start a carbon registry. And given that they are paid by the companies selling the offsets, it will not surprise you to learn that many experts say their standards are far too low.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/08/john-oliver-monkeypox-us\">John Oliver on US handling of monkeypox: ‘On a scale of 1 to 100, we scored a no’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Basically, getting a sign-off from a carbon registry is like winning a Kids Choice Award,” he added. “It doesn’t really mean much, but it will help you temporarily look a little bit cleaner.”</p> <p>It’s theoretically possible to truly offset carbon emissions – say, if a wind turbine farm that had no chance of construction replaces a fossil fuel plant. “But real world examples of that are incredibly hard to find,” said Oliver, and moreover “when you buy an offset so you can pollute more and that offset is bullshit, you’re now actively making things worse.</p> <p>“It seems at best the benefits of carbon offsets are wildly overstated, while the harm that they can do is very real,” he added. “And while there are ongoing efforts to at least improve the standards of registries, the truth is, the offsets aren’t the answer here. Fundamentally, we cannot offset our way out of climate change.”</p> <p>On a practical level, there literally isn’t enough space to plant the trees for companies to meet their net-zero pitches. One estimate found that there’s only 500m hectares of land left to be dedicated to new forests for carbon capture; Shell alone has proposed planting a tenth of that amount. “The bottom line is: we have an offset system that places profits over science, and the rules regulating it are just far too lax,” Oliver concluded. To prove the point, as one might predict, Oliver established his own carbon registry, <a href=\"https://www.oliversoffsets.org/\">Oliver’s Offsets</a>, an organization that’s “making big claims while doing very little, which honestly is entirely reflective of the system that we currently have”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2022/aug/22/sony-could-face-5bn-in-legal-claims-over-playstation-game-charges","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T15:10:29Z","webTitle":"Sony could face £5bn in legal claims over PlayStation game charges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/22/sony-could-face-5bn-in-legal-claims-over-playstation-game-charges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/aug/22/sony-could-face-5bn-in-legal-claims-over-playstation-game-charges","fields":{"headline":"Sony could face £5bn in legal claims over PlayStation game charges","trailText":"UK consumer champion files collective redress case alleging the company has been abusing its market dominance","byline":"Alex Hern","body":"<p>Sony has been overcharging PlayStation gamers for six years, a new legal claim alleges, and could be forced to pay almost £5bn in damages if the claim succeeds.</p> <p>According to Alex Neill, the consumer champion who has filed the case with the UK’s competition appeal tribunal, Sony has been abusing its dominance in the British market to impose unfair terms and conditions on the PlayStation Store, where it sells digital games, downloadable content and subscriptions.</p> <p>The company charges a flat 30% fee to developers who want to sell games on the store, which often results in the prices of digital content being higher than a physical copy of the same title – despite the associated costs of making and shipping hardware.</p> <p>Neill has <a href=\"https://playstationyouoweus.co.uk/\">filed the claim</a>, which uses a British right to collective redress for consumer harms, on behalf of anyone in the UK who purchased digital games or add-on content on the store since 19 August 2016. It seeks damages of between £67 and £562 per individual member, which could take the total sum paid out up to £5bn if successful.</p> <p>“The game is up for Sony PlayStation,” said Neill. “With this legal action I am standing up for the millions of UK people who have been unwittingly overcharged. We believe Sony has abused its position and ripped off its customers.</p> <p>“Gaming is now the biggest entertainment industry in the UK, ahead of TV, video and music and many vulnerable people rely on gaming for community and connection. The actions of Sony are costing millions of people who can’t afford it, particularly when we’re in the midst of a cost of living crisis and the consumer purse is being squeezed like never before.”</p> <p>Natasha Pearman, who is leading the case for lawyers Milberg London, said: “Sony dominates the digital distribution of PlayStation games and in-game content. It has deployed an anti-competitive strategy which has resulted in excessive prices to customers that are out of all proportion to the costs of Sony providing its services.</p> <p>“This claim is only possible because of the opt-out collective action regime that was introduced by the Consumer Rights Act 2015; a regime which Alex fought to introduce. We are looking forward to working with Alex and making sure that the regime achieves its aims of protecting and compensating consumers.”</p> <p>The case is being backed by Woodsford, an investment business that provides funding for legal cases in exchange for a cut of the proceeds.

Sure, it’s been won by the same team four times in the last five seasons. But that team drew yesterday, letting slip two of the 10 points they’re going to drop this season. True, Manchester City still managed to score three away from home, and could easily have had another three, or four, or five, but then the Toon had a couple of other chances themselves, so it’s swings and money-go-roundabouts. Either way, bottom line, City haven’t run away with the league just yet, and we’ll grasp at any straw going. The Fiver has no horse in this race, we’re simply going to need some excitement to keep the blood pumping warm this coming winter, that’s all.</p> <p>For now, it is <em>*checks notes*</em> Arsenal setting the pace. These are exciting times for the Gunners, whose fans will be further energised by links to the Wolves winger Pedro Neto. The Fiver must counsel caution, however – it’s early days, and they’ll need to beat far better sides than Bournemouth and Brendan Rodgers’ Leicester (we’re saying that while we still can). Look what happened in 2013-14, when Arsène Wenger’s side won eight of their first 10 games and went on to finish fourth in a three-horse race. And who won the title that season? Manchester City, of course.</p> <p>Those among you who fancy a helter-skelter title chase can draw their own conclusions here, or choose to remain in blissful denial. Up to you. But next spring, you can thank the Fiver for tempting fate when Schalke win the Bundesliga, Reims are popping the champagne in France, and Arsenal and City are pipped to the Premier League title on the final day by Brighton.</p> <h2><strong>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Fancy some red-hot Monday night Premier League action?

A few years back I took my then-seven-year-old son to his first ever match: Bristol Rovers v Hartlepool. The pitch was clearly frozen but the game kicked off anyway, with the ref calling the players off after just 20 minutes. Hartlepool’s away contingent of around 100, plus our mascot, H’Angus, responded with a barrage of furious hand gestures. My bewildered son asked: ‘Dad, why is that monkey waving at the referee?’. Not <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-tees-22375328\">the future mayor of Hartlepool</a>’s finest hour, but very funny” – Phil Boult.</p> <p>“My late best friend and I attended Vojvodina v Pristina in the Yugoslavian first division in November 1987. With most of the 3,000 fans in attendance sheltering under the West Stand roof, we opted for the open East Stand instead. The rain poured all day; my friend and I were shivering for the whole match. Afterwards, we had to go to the nearest shopping mall to warm up a little. Still, it was a great day. Vojvodina won 3-0, playing like Brazil’s 1982 side, and their winger Zoran ‘Jimmy’ Maric scored a hat-trick. I don’t know why but I still remember that day with affection like one of my best days at a football ground” – Bogdan Kotarlic.</p> <p>“Re: Friday’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/the-fiver-casemiro-manchester-united-crisis-baton-rubbernecking\">quote of the day</a>.

But rarely was muck filthier or money more brass-necked than in the case of the brown effluent pouring into the Channel off Seaford, or the green algae spreading over Windermere.

Southern Water has reportedly made <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/i-saw-britains-beaches-get-cleaner-now-were-the-dirty-man-again-8vvw8qtmn\">four such dumps</a> into the Channel in a week.

Under the Victorians, water was the noble face of municipal socialism. Now it is the unacceptable face of capitalism. The success of privatised industry depends on the effectiveness with which the state regulates its natural monopolies. Under Whitehall’s Ofwat, water regulation has failed. Its most <a href=\"https://www.ofwat.gov.uk/households/conservingwater/watersavingtips/\">radical suggestion</a> to meet the current crisis appears to be for people to turn off their taps while cleaning their teeth.</p> <p>Since privatisation in 1989, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/15/uk-water-boss-bonuses-reservoirs-built-leaks-fixed\">an estimated £72bn</a> has been allowed to leak from the industry into dividends, money that should clearly have gone into investment, stemming leaks and building overflow tanks. As it is, roughly a quarter of England’s fresh water never reaches the consumer but <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/water-firms-leaking-2-4bn-litres-a-day-hjh7db5l5#:~:text=England%27s%20water%20companies%20are%20leaking,their%20chief%20executives%20large%20bonuses.\">escapes from unrepaired pipes</a>. Meanwhile contamination means the UK’s swimming sites are so filthy they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/01/uk-ranked-last-in-europe-for-bathing-water-quality-in-2020\">ranked last in Europe</a> for water quality in 2020. Even the government’s own Environment Agency has called for water company <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-62163182\">directors to be imprisoned</a> for the appalling decline in performance, after a rise to 62 of what it classed as “serious incidents” of pollution last year. Campaigners are also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/09/activists-take-water-regulator-ofwat-to-court-over-sewage-in-english-and-welsh-rivers\">taking Ofwat to court</a> for regulatory failure. The industry, in every sense, stinks.</p> <p>The talk now is of renationalisation, though the sight of the water companies walking away with yet more money in compensation would be hard to stomach. The real trouble lies less with privatisation as such than with its regulators. As with another crisis, that of the private care home sector, lax oversight has been aggravated by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/dec/06/funding-care-homes-exciting-or-labyrinthine-private-capital\">slither of these industries</a> into private equity or the murky world of offshore finance. </p> <p>Here public utility falls by the wayside. Short-term profit is what matters, dividends are all and scandalous salaries generate a revolving door between companies, regulators and Whitehall. The result is that blatant polluters<strong> </strong>such as the poultry industry are allowed by planners to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/07/tesco-suppliers-river-wye-phosphate-pollution-chicken-farming\">drain effluent into the River Wye</a> and make it an open sewer. Our water utilities vent our own waste into the sea. And<strong> </strong>meanwhile a proposal for a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cross-country-pipelines-would-solve-water-crises-tkddlf6jj\">national network for transferring water</a> from the plentiful west to the parched east lies dormant. Its cost of £10bn is about a tenth that of Boris Johnson’s vanity project, HS2.

What’s more, the blubbing appears to be linked to levels of the “bonding hormone” oxytocin.</p> <p>“This is the first report demonstrating that positive emotion stimulates tear secretion in a non-human animal, and that oxytocin functions in tear secretion,” the team said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01132-0\">Writing in the journal Current Biology</a>, they describe how eye contact between humans and dogs encourages the former to care for the latter, while the gaze of a dog can cause a release of oxytocin in its owner. Dogs have also evolved the ability to raise their inner eyebrows, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/17/how-dogs-capture-your-heart-evolution-puppy-dog-eyes\">a trait that scientists say</a> induces humans to nurture them.</p> <p>Now researchers in Japan have found tears might have a similar effect.</p> <p>“I have two standard poodles and I had one female pregnant six years ago,” Prof Takefumi Kikusui, a co-author of the research at Azabu University, told the Guardian. Noticing her face was more tender than usual when nursing her puppies, Kikusui realised her eyes were teary. </p> <p>“That gave me the idea that oxytocin might increase tears,” he said. “We previously observed that oxytocin is released both in dogs and owners when interacting. So we conducted a reunion experiment.”</p> <p>In the first step, the team measured the volume of tears produced by 18 dogs when in their normal home environment with their owner, using Schirmer’s test. This involves placing a special strip of paper inside the lower eyelid and measuring how far along the strip the moisture travels.</p> <p>The team compared this volume against that produced within the first five minutes of the dogs being reunited with their owners after a separation of more than five hours.</p> <p>The researchers say the dogs produced a significantly greater volume of tears when reunited with their owners than when wandering the home alone. This increase was not seen, however, when 20 dogs were similarly reunited with a familiar human that was not their owner.</p> <p>An additional experiment involving 22 dogs showed that dropping oxytocin into their eyes increased the volume of tears they produced – a result not seen when another, oxytocin-free solution was used.</p> <p>The team then presented 74 participants with 10 photos of five dogs, depicting each animal either with or without moist eyes, and asked them to rate on a five-point scale how much they wanted to avoid or care for the animal. Kikusui said the results reveal the teary-eyed dogs gained 10 to 15% more people wanting to care for them. That, the team say, suggests teary canine eyes trigger such emotions in humans.</p> <p>The researchers add that unlike other animals, dogs have gained high-level communication abilities with humans using eye contact.</p> <p>“Through this process, their tears might play a role in eliciting protective behaviour or nurturing behaviour from their owners,” they write, noting that it may deepen mutual relationships and bonding between humans and their canine companions.</p> <p>But Kikusui said that while the team had found that dogs show an increase of tears during reunions with their owners, questions remained.</p> <p>“We do not yet know if dogs show an increase of tears during a dog-dog reunion. We also do not know how dogs use tears to communicate with each other,” he said. “We need to clarify the social function of dog tears.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/22/will-smiths-popularity-saw-very-significant-and-precipitous-decline-after-oscars-slap","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T14:58:40Z","webTitle":"Will Smith’s popularity saw ‘very significant and precipitous decline’ after Oscars slap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/22/will-smiths-popularity-saw-very-significant-and-precipitous-decline-after-oscars-slap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/22/will-smiths-popularity-saw-very-significant-and-precipitous-decline-after-oscars-slap","fields":{"headline":"Will Smith’s popularity saw ‘very significant and precipitous decline’ after Oscars slap","trailText":"According to Q Score, which measures the consumer appeal of celebrities in the US, the actor lost significant support after the incident","byline":"Catherine Shoard","body":"<p>The popularity of the actor Will Smith saw a dramatic decline following his assault on Chris Rock earlier this year, a new survey suggests.</p> <p>According to data provided to industry magazine Variety by <a href=\"https://www.qscores.com/\">Q Scores</a> – a widely recognised quantifier of star power and appeal – Smith’s ratings were significantly impacted by his slapping Rock live on TV during the Oscars ceremony earlier this year.</p> <p>About an hour before he won the best actor award for his role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/15/king-richard-review-will-smith-serves-up-tennis-stardom-for-venus-and-serena\">King Richard</a>, Smith, 53, took offence to a joke made by presenter Rock, 57, about Smith’s wife’s short hair. It is still unknown whether Rock was unaware of Jada Pinkett Smith’s alopecia.</p> <p>Q Scores compile their data by polling some 1,800 US consumers about their feelings about celebrities, twice a year. Smith had long enjoyed high rankings, consistently placing in the Top 10 positively rated actors, alongside the likes of Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington.</p> <p>But between the January and July 2022 polls, Smith’s score went from a 39 to a 24 – the number indicates the percentage of those surveyed who had both heard of Smith and counted him as one of their favourite personalities. Such a fall was described by Henry Schafer, executive vice president of Q Score as “a very significant and precipitous decline”.</p> <p>Smith’s negative rating went up from less than 10 to 26 (the average score is about 16 or 17). Pinkett Smith’s ratings were also significantly affected: her positive rating fell from 13 to six, and her negative score jumped from 29 to 44.</p> <p>Rock’s scores remained consistent, with positive at 20 and negative at 14, but his awareness rating grew from 66 to 84.

It is also worth a second look and a natural subject for <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/missing-pages/id1635627694\">Missing Pages</a>, a new podcast series that sets about “reopening literary cold cases” and looking back at “some of the most iconic, jaw-dropping and just truly bizarre book scandals to shape the publishing world”.</p> <p>The podcast is hosted by Bethanne Patrick, who has reviewed books for<em> </em>the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and Boston Globe newspapers as well as National Public Radio (NPR). Her Twitter account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheBookMaven?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@TheBookMaven</a>, has more than 200,000 followers. But she does not claim to be either a publishing insider or an investigative journalist.</p> <p><strong>“</strong>Everyone gossips and we all have different ways of gossiping,” Patrick says via Zoom from home, naturally with stacks of books visible, in McLean, Virginia. “I’m not against gossip or for gossip but, if I’m going to tell these stories, and if I’m going to get into these stories that people think ‘ooh! ah! what?’, then I want to go as deep as possible.</p> <p>“I am neither Andrew Wylie [a leading literary agent] nor am I the amazing Ian Parker [whose <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions\">2019 profile</a> exposed Mallory’s falsehoods] at the New Yorker. I’m somewhat in between with this podcast but I wanted to do the best that I could do and talk to many people about these stories<em>. </em>We are trying very hard to give a 360 look at these scams and scandals in the publishing industry<em>.”</em></p> <p>The first episode of eight in season one tells the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/26/books.usa\">Kaavya Viswanathan</a>, a 19-year-old wunderkind who landed a six-figure book deal only to be accused of plagiarism and end up on a national TV apology tour. Missing Pages re-examines the case with interviewees including Abraham Riesman, author of The Believer: The Rise and Fall of Stan Lee, and Viswanathan herself.</p> <p>In the Mallory episode, Patrick speaks to Camila Osorio, who had the unenviable task of fact-checking the seminal 10,000-word New Yorker<em> </em>profile, critic and memoirist Jessa Crispin, author Luis Alberto Urrea (who, unlike Mallory, had to work his way up the hard way) and two psychiatrists, Jose Apud and Gerald Perman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2983f2e1bde2ebeadfe5bea320371d4425d6b61a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2983f2e1bde2ebeadfe5bea320371d4425d6b61a/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bethanne Patrick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bethanne Patrick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michelle Lindsay Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among their observations is that, while Mallory was genuinely diagnosed with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/14/bipolar-disorder-facts-symptoms\" title=\"\"> bipolar II disorder</a>, what riled people the most was his willingness to scapegoat the condition as an explanation for his self-serving behaviour.</p> <p>Patrick, 58, explains: “We wanted to talk to psychiatrists because being bipolar does not equal being a pathological liar. Camila [the New Yorker factchecker] was genuinely distressed by Mallory’s claims that, ‘I can’t help lying because I’m bipolar.’<em> </em>I thought, this does affect people, even in their professional capacities<em>.”</em></p> <p>The host was also taken aback by Mallory’s baseless claim that his brother suffered cystic fibrosis. “I thought the people who are affected by cystic fibrosis, the families, the victims of the people who suffer through this illness are very tight. They do a lot of things as a community. They raise funds for research. And to have someone lie specifically about a disease is just really awful.”</p> <p>She asks: “Is Dan Mallory a sociopath? I don’t know. I do know he must have felt some need to keep himself on the glory path.”</p> <p>Mallory’s uncompleted postgraduate research focused on Highsmith and he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/14/crime-fiction-daniel-mallory-woman-in-the-window-debut-interview\">has spoken of his fascination</a> with her charming fantasist Tom Ripley. Unlike Ripley, the podcast notes, Mallory was no class warrior. But his web of deceit did spin a novelistic origins story about triumph over adversity.</p> <p>It was perhaps a warning that, in the 21st century, writing well is no longer enough. Authors must also play the celebrity game and have a story of their own to tell interviewers, profilers and audiences. And the more traumatic the better.</p> <p>Crispin. founder of BookSlut.com, tells the podcast: “I would like to place the blame for trauma entertainment on Oprah’s [Winfrey] feet. I think that kind of material definitely just trained us to expect these tales of woe, to expect these tales of trauma, and told us how to formulate them.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2015/10/19/oprah-effect-does-everything-she-touches-turn-gold/74211636/\">The “Oprah effect”</a> is long said to have changed publishing. But is it for good or ill? Patrick comments: “Oprah Winfrey has done some amazing things for books, especially for books by authors who have been underrepresented – women, Black, Bipoc, trans, LGBTQ.</p> <p>“But like anyone with a lot of power, I don’t think Oprah always realises the effect that she’s going to have. How can she? You can’t predict that and so I do think for a while that Oprah was really into books about pain and suffering. Maybe that was part of the zeitgeist, maybe that was something that was helping her then. We can’t count that out.<em>”</em></p> <p>Patrick has had a chance to look past celebrity and get to know authors in person during interviews or backstage at literary festivals. She holds up to the Zoom camera a customised “<a href=\"https://www.idealbookshelf.com/\">ideal bookshelf</a>” print with the theme of authors she has had a drink with. It includes Margaret Atwood, Umberto Eco and David Mitchell<em>.</em></p> <p>She recalls fondly: “David Mitchell: absolutely my favourite. Someone who really is a person in full, a family life, an amazing artist, interested in everything and everyone. He seemed to me to be someone who truly sits in his place in the world and it’s lovely to be with someone like that.</p> <p>“I will also say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2022/feb/19/margaret-atwood-on-feminism-culture-wars\">Margaret Atwood</a>, whom I’ve known for almost 20 years now. She’s so sly and smart and unexpected. People might be like, ‘Well, of course, she wrote this and she wrote that.’ Yeah, but sometimes they’re amazing writers but they don’t bring that to their personal conversation. She is wit and charm and intellectual fireworks all the time and I love that.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2c7c84dc3e2c89e2a565b5ab7567bdb2627fc51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2c7c84dc3e2c89e2a565b5ab7567bdb2627fc51/0_74_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salman Rushdie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salman Rushdie, one of Bethanne Patrick’s drinking companions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another drinking companion was Salman Rushdie, now recovering in hospital from a multiple stabbing attack at a recent literary event at the normally tranquil Chautauqua Institution in New York state. Hadi Matar, 24, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/18/salman-rushdie-stabbing-suspect-court-appearance\">has pleaded not guilty</a> to second-degree attempted murder and assault charges.</p> <p>Patrick, who has moderated many such events, was as aghast and appalled as anyone. “Salman Rushdie is someone who’s contributed timeless books to our culture and has been incredibly generous to other writers and artists and people supporting our culture. So this is just heinous; it’s not what should be happening.</p> <p>“One of the things we’re talking maybe for a future podcast episode is about what happens to these live events that we all love so much and attend so frequently? We live in a country where guns are out of control and certainly now we know knives are out of control as well. It’s going to change and I hate the fact that we might have to have a national book festival where everyone’s bags are rifled through<em>.”</em></p> <p>The attack on Rushdie came 33 years after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran’s supreme leader, issued a fatwa, or religious edict, calling on Muslims to assassinate him a few months after the publication of his novel The Satanic Verses. Some Muslims regarded passages about the Prophet Muhammad as blasphemous.</p> <p>Married to a retired army officer, Patrick lived in Berlin before the wall fell so appreciates the fragility and preciousness of writers’ freedom of expression. She comments: “We know what it’s like to live in a place where you’re being controlled and watched. In America, one of the things that’s both beautiful and surprising about the way we look at writers and authors is that our writers and authors have been free for so long in so many aspects of their lives.</p> <p>“We forget that, for instance, Pen International and other groups are still working to allow writers to write freely, to get out of prisons, to come out from under the thumb of oppressors. The fact that I can’t remember anything like this in recent history in the United States just speaks to our incredible privileges that, unfortunately, we take for granted.”</p> <p>She adds: “I don’t think we need to be taught a lesson; I don’t want any knives on stage at Chautauqua. But I do think we need to be very mindful and intentional about what happens next for artists, especially because it’s so important for us to bring artists from other countries. It’s not just Covid: it’s restrictions, it’s visas, it’s conflicts, it’s all kind of stuff.”</p> <p>What impact has Patrick seen on American publishing from the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements? “There is such a long way to go. I’m glad to say that there has been some change. I’m glad to see some of the women of colour who are taking over higher positions in publishing, like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/magazine/inside-the-push-to-diversify-the-book-business.html?referringSource=articleShare\">Lisa Lucas at Pantheon</a>.</p> <p>“But we have so far to go not only in reading and accepting and acquiring and publishing books by people of colour – men, women, people of different gender and sexual orientations – but we also need to learn how to talk about them. I’m writing a review this morning of an African British writer and I was saying something about colonialism and I thought I need to check my language here. I need to be really careful.</p> <p>“We need to stop using words that allow us to hide, that allow us to silo ourselves, and this is really hard for the wordsmiths of the world, right? I was brought up to learn all of the words, use them, and I’m thinking, now, which words separate me from other people. That’s one of the things that publishing’s going to have to deal with<em>.”</em></p> <p>Whereas Mallory was a white male with the “right credentials”, proof that the east coast elites and patriarchy hold sway, Patrick is witnessing a new generation of diverse writers in the ascent.</p> <p>“I’m seeing different communities – Black, Latinx, transgender – rise up to support writers in their ranks and help them get attention. I have made a real effort, and I’ve actually gotten into some tiny kerfuffles with white male colleagues on Twitter about the fact that, when I’m choosing what I’m going to write reviews of, I’m choosing more books by authors of colour and authors who are queer and trans.”</p> <p>She adds: “I don’t think that means I’m ignoring white males at all. I’ve spent most of my life reading white males’ works and some of them are fantastic. I am never going to get over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/28/100-best-novels-tristram-shandy-sterne\">Tristram Shandy</a> – what an experimental novel, that is the best! But that doesn’t mean that now, in the 21st century, I can’t decide to take a turn<em>. </em>We need to look a little further intellectually when it comes to different kinds of writers.”</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/missing-pages/id1635627694\">Missing Pages</a> is available now</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/22/bond-films-future-secured-after-mgm-and-wb-agree-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T14:52:00Z","webTitle":"Bond films’ future secured after MGM and WB agree deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/22/bond-films-future-secured-after-mgm-and-wb-agree-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/22/bond-films-future-secured-after-mgm-and-wb-agree-deal","fields":{"headline":"Bond films’ future secured after MGM and WB agree deal","trailText":"Starting with Bones and All later this year, the two studios will jointly release MGM films in the US, while Warners will handle international releases","byline":"Andrew Pulver","body":"<p>The future of the Bond movie series has been secured for at least the next five years <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/08/warner-bros-mgm-international-distribution-deal-james-bond-007-1235091889/\">after a major agreement</a> between Hollywood studios MGM and Warner Bros.</p> <p>The deal, which will take effect later this year with the cannibal romance Bones and All, means that Warner Bros will handle the international release of MGM’s films. MGM’s arrangement with Warner Bros is thought to run for three years, with an option for a further two.</p> <p>The Bond series has been a key asset for MGM since 1981, when it purchased United Artists, the films’ first backers. The series as a whole, which currently comprises 25 films, <a href=\"https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/James-Bond#tab=summary\">is estimated to have taken $7.8bn at the global box office</a>. The next Bond production, currently known as Bond 26, will not be included in the deal, as MGM already has an agreement for overseas distribution in place with Universal, another Hollywood studio (which also handled the most recent Bond release, No Time to Die) as well as Till, a film about lynching victim Emmett Till on which Broccoli is a credited producer. However, distribution rights to further Bond films come with its scope.</p> <p>The agreement comes after a series of deals that MGM made to distribute its Bond films after it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010. MGM agreed a distribution deal with Sony to release Skyfall and Spectre, while No Time to Die was released in the US via United Artists, a joint venture it had established with indie studio Annapurna. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/26/amazon-buys-hollywood-studio-mgm-james-bond\">MGM was then acquired by Amazon for $8.45bn</a> in 2021. Warner Bros’ parent company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/17/att-combine-warnermedia-discovery-warner-bros-hbo\">Warner Media merged with Discovery in 2021</a>, and has since been undergoing considerable upheaval, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/08/hbo-max-end-streaming-warner-discovery-merger\">high profile cancellation of its Batgirl movie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/18/discovery-sells-gb-news-stake-as-directors-resign-in-shake-up?amp;amp;amp\">selling its stake in UK TV channel GB News</a>.</p> <p>The deal arrives at a key moment as the Bond series seeks to maintain momentum after the difficulties that beset the most recent entry, No Time to Die. It was Craig’s fifth and final Bond film, with the production experiencing a number of delays after work began in 2016. Original director Danny Boyle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/21/danny-boyle-says-script-dispute-made-him-quit-bond-25\">left the project in 2018 after a dispute over the script</a>, and after filming was completed under new director Cary Joji Fukunaga, its release was repeatedly delayed by the Covid pandemic. It eventually came out in September 2021, becoming the series’ third most successful film at the global box office (after Skyfall and Spectre).</p> <p>Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson are currently deliberating over the replacement for Daniel Craig in the lead role. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/29/next-bond-film-will-be-complete-reinvention-but-wont-shoot-for-at-least-two-years\">At an event in June</a> to honour her and Wilson’s joint receipt of the BFI Fellowship, Broccoli said they were “working out where to go” and that a “reinvention of Bond” was being planned.

He lived and breathed music throughout his life.</p> <p>We had known each other since our student days at the Royal College of Music, where Ben won the top prize for violinists at the age of 19. Born in London, he was the son of Kiki (nee McCormick) and John Cruft, a respected oboist who went on to be director of music and drama at the Arts Council.</p> <p>From Westminster school, Ben went to study at the Royal College of Music in 1966, and after graduating performed in the LSO and other orchestras. He also joined the London String Quartet, led by his friend Tony Pini. In 1980 he and Katia Ross, a librarian, moved to Hong Kong. They got married there the following year, Ben having been appointed associate concertmaster of the Hong Kong Philharmonic and a teacher at the Hong Kong Conservatory.</p> <p>When they returned to London in 1984, he became a freelance violinist, giving recitals and taking part in recordings. Occasionally he composed music for commercials and stock library music for use by television, radio and film companies, some of which accompanied the TV series Friends.</p> <p>JS Bach’s six Sonatas and Partitas for unaccompanied violin were his lifelong passion and obsession. He believed that although they were well known, they were neglected as a set in live performances. In 1987 he performed them complete across two concerts for the first time, and went on to do so more than 100 times in the UK and abroad. He also arranged several of Bach’s 48 Preludes and Fugues for string trio.</p> <p>In 2003 Ben and Katia returned to Hong Kong so that he could take up the post of dean of music at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, and he worked there for ten years. He transformed many of the management systems at the academy and was much admired for his musical expertise, teaching and generosity as a mentor and adviser to students. More widely, he was respected for his equanimity and wisdom. In 2012 he became the fourth member of the Cruft family to be awarded a fellowship of the Royal College of Music.</p> <p>Among his many interests, Ben became fascinated by Chinese art, and he loved trees and plants – styling himself as a guerrilla gardener, for he went around planting shrubs and perennials on verges and roadsides.

he’s not on trial for being a compulsive womaniser; he’s not on trial for being an adulterer when he was married; he’s not on trial for being a liar or cheat – none of those things.”</p> <p>In order to find Giggs guilty, Daw said, jurors had to be sure he had definitely committed the acts alleged. “Probably guilty isn’t enough, in our system – it’s nowhere near it.”</p> <p>He added: “Even if you are of the view he is probably guilty, you must find him not guilty.”</p> <p>Daw told jurors that watching Giggs being cross-examined by Wright may have seemed almost “like a form of blood sport” and that the defendant was like “a rabbit in the headlights”.</p> <p>He said the former Wales manager was unable to answer some questions due to “anxiety on his part, a lack of understanding, and a desire to avoid being humiliated.”</p> <p>The cross-examination, Daw said, was “no more equal a match-up of putting Mr Wright in goal against Mr Giggs at the time of his peak football prowess.”</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/22/green-man-festival-review-the-absurd-the-wonderful-and-the-otherworldly","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T14:28:30Z","webTitle":"Green Man festival review – the absurd, the wonderful and the otherworldly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/22/green-man-festival-review-the-absurd-the-wonderful-and-the-otherworldly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/22/green-man-festival-review-the-absurd-the-wonderful-and-the-otherworldly","fields":{"headline":"Green Man festival review – the absurd, the wonderful and the otherworldly","trailText":"From the magisterial glam rock of Yves Tumor to the comedy surf-pop of Melin Melyn, Green Man froths with positivity and subversion","byline":"Sophie Walker","body":"<p>The tapestry of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/green-man\">Green Man</a> is woven from a reverence for the past and the promise of a future that, for one August weekend, feels thrillingly attainable. Nestled in the natural amphitheatre of a Welsh mountain valley, for two decades the festival has offered a suspension of reality that its annually returning devotees can only describe as “magic”. Where else can you find refuge from a festival’s never-ending spectacles to hold a chicken?</p> <p>In these intervening years, Green Man has fostered a certain intimacy with its audience, meaning the 25,000 tickets for its 20th-anniversary weekender sold out within three days despite the only confirmed headliner being Mercury-prize winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/michael-kiwanuka\">Michael Kiwanuka</a>. But Green Man dares to roll the dice while remaining deserving of this blind faith. Though it remains loosely anchored to its folk-indebted beginnings, it also welcomes the absurd, the wonderful and the otherworldly.</p> <p>The festival remains free from aggressive sponsorship, and phones, usually masted in the air during sets, are strikingly absent. The sense of escapism is quite clearly one of the main draws, and it bleeds into Green Man’s most mesmeric performers. The panoramic Mountain stage is opened on its first night by the warped, magisterial glam rock of Yves Tumor and Its Band. Sleaze and seduction coalesce into unholy extremes as Tumor cuts an otherworldly figure with their peroxide mane and bejewelled hot pants. They writhe on stage as if possessed, injecting their microphone into the speakers like a needle to a vein just for the thrill of the shocking feedback.</p> <p>But Green Man also honours its musical inverse, welcoming the finely spun, transportive folk of Jessie Buckley and Bernard Butler to the Walled Garden stage at sunset. Their recent collaborative debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/19/jessie-buckley-and-bernard-butler-for-all-our-days-that-tear-the-heart-review-a-mesmerising-debut\">For All Our Days That Tear the Heart</a>, transcended expectations of an actor-musician project, and their gently nuanced sound turns out to thrive in front of a crowd. Black Country, New Road put their latest iteration to the test after the departure of vocalist Isaac Wood, after which they drew a definitive line beneath their previous material. Each band member takes a turn at vocal duties, adding new textures to their knotty post-rock, and they’re greeted by something close to rapture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"251b98fd27b8c32add85eb5dd2ca64bfd16250d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/251b98fd27b8c32add85eb5dd2ca64bfd16250d3/0_100_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessie Buckley and Bernard Butler performing on the Walled Garden stage at Green Man on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessie Buckley and Bernard Butler performing on the Walled Garden stage at Green Man on Friday. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Wala/Avalon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Green Man tempers its flashes of musical radicalism with all-too-familiar headliners.

But it’s in the festival’s taste-making small print where you will find its most thrilling prospects.</p> <p>Inspiring cult-like devotion and a sea of daft grins are Welsh-speaking surf-pop heroes, Melin Melyn. Shrugging off the weight of the world through their topsy-turvy outlook, they spin hilarious yarns inspired by life’s mundanity: an all-too-rare masterclass in the intersection of comedy and music. In an unexpected twist, a jet swoops incredibly low over the Walled Garden stage, but their charismatic frontman Gruff Glyn remains unruffled: “That cost us an absolute fortune – I hope you enjoyed it.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/03/karl-bartos-kraftwerk-turned-into-the-dehumanisation-of-music\">Karl Bartos: ‘Kraftwerk turned into the dehumanisation of music’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Far Out stage’s reputation precedes it, showcasing an array of acts on their way to hurtling out of the underground. Producer and songwriter Jessica Winter, collaborator with pop disruptor Jazmin Bean, unveils a set of gothic, pop-centric cabaret. She runs her gloved hands over her keyboard with operatic flair, before slamming the audience into a world of bleeding 808s and unsettling, hall-of-mirrors distortion.</p> <p>Green Man’s spirit of subversion is shifted into top gear with the warped club-centric cuts of Bristol producer Grove, who sets dancefloor conventions ablaze with delight. A declaration of war is made to landlords, “energy vampires” and the systems that have failed us, indicative of the political discontent which colours much of the festival’s offerings. But more than anything, Green Man froths with positivity, which is captured best by Manchester band Porij, who kick off Saturday night with their infectious collage of vibrant dance sounds.</p> <p>The Green Man itself is a symbol of rebirth which is common to a spectrum of ancient cultures. As it is set alight, the embers from paper wishes for the future attached to the effigy are surrendered to the sky, and there is the sense that no matter what lies beyond, while you are at Green Man festival, everything is briefly wonderful.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"culture/2022/aug/22/how-we-made-fame-tv-series-bruno-savid-life","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T14:23:05Z","webTitle":"‘People come up to me and say: You saved my life’ – how we made the Fame TV series","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/aug/22/how-we-made-fame-tv-series-bruno-savid-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/aug/22/how-we-made-fame-tv-series-bruno-savid-life","fields":{"headline":"‘People come up to me and say: You saved my life’ – how we made the Fame TV series","trailText":"‘We were worked hard and not paid very much – most of us were young kids who needed better representation’","byline":"Interviews by Stuart Jeffries","body":"<h2><strong>Lee Curreri (Bruno Martelli)</strong></h2> <p>I didn’t really want the fame. It was never about the ego for me, just the music. I wanted to be Lalo Schifrin, who wrote the Mission: Impossible theme. I was this misfit little Italian kid who went to a Catholic school in the Bronx and had peculiar interests. When I watched the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carol_Burnett_Show\">Carol Burnett Show</a> on TV, for example, I was watching because I loved the way the bandleader <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=876_HQr4ePE\">Peter Matz</a> orchestrated the music.</p> <p>When Alan Parker was casting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsnQ8p-BVmQ\">the movie</a> Fame, he was looking for real people rather than actors for most of the roles. He wanted a shy but sensitive real-life keyboard prodigy. I auditioned six times. They’d say: “Say these lines. Now play the piano. Now play the piano and say the lines”. I was playing tarantellas for Italian vacationers in the Catskills when I found out I’d got the part of Bruno. I quit that gig. I was 19.</p> <p>I loved going on set when I wasn’t filming. I remember one scene in an abandoned old high school in New York, late-afternoon sun streaming through the windows, and the ballerina Hilary, who was played by the ballerina Antonia Franceschi, dancing with Leroy. It was the most beautiful thing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYfRUhinvAo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MYfRUhinvAo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When the spin-off TV series was being cast, TV then wasn’t highly regarded, so quite a few who had been in the film didn’t come on to the show. I did, because I had a plan. I would write songs and develop my musical skills. Being on camera was never the thing for me. We were worked hard but paid not very much. It wasn’t Dickensian, but most of us were young kids who needed better representation. I know I needed someone in my corner and I didn’t really have anyone, especially when we moved the production to LA from New York.</p> <p>We’d start each day at 7am and finish at 7pm. A lot of it was waiting for shots to be set up. I was writing songs at 2am in the morning. Around that time, drum machines, sampling and synths were really taking off so I had this idea of learning as much as I could about all that, and I became a one-man band, writing drums, bass, timpani, brass, the whole orchestra. As well as writing songs for Fame, I was asked to write music for NBC’s Saturday morning cartoon shows. I sent them a demo, and who should show up to orchestrate it but Peter Matz? He took my crummy little demo and orchestrated it for a live orchestra at the NBC studios. I was in heaven.</p> <p>I was 23 when I left the show. At the time, the network decided not to syndicate it any more in the US, but it was doing so well in the UK and Italy, they continued making it for export. I got a gig writing music for a TV movie with Mickey Rooney. That was the start and I really took off from there – working in music for TV shows and films just like I wanted to do.</p> <h2><strong>Valerie Landsburg (Doris Schwartz)</strong></h2> <p>I was understudying on Broadway when the movie came out in 1980 and I went to a midnight screening. I remember seeing Lee on screen and thinking: “I’m gonna be friends with that guy some day.” Two years later I get a call – they’re doing the TV series. I ended up getting the role of Doris Schwartz. I was 23 and had been in movies, and I was the oldest in the show. Sure enough, Lee and I became friends. We even shared an apartment and drove to work together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e616b6efc9304c07b47b4ba377907efe90b666d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e616b6efc9304c07b47b4ba377907efe90b666d/0_93_1920_1754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Valerie Landsburg as Doris in 1983.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"914\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Valerie Landsburg as Doris in 1983.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beverley Goodway/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Doris was essentially the girl who did the exposition. She wasn’t the star. I was like the friend of the lead. I was the person who’d say “I feel so bad for you” or “Is there any more pizza?” A lot of guys my age who knew they were gay but felt they couldn’t tell anybody identified with Doris because she didn’t have a boyfriend. There were Doris girls too. I’ve cried with people who’ve come up to me and said “You’ve saved my life. Because you were doing what you were doing, I didn’t jump off a bridge.” One day, I was the last person to get on a plane and the woman stamping the tickets put her hand on top of mine and said: “I love you.”</p> <p>We worked really hard. If you weren’t acting you were rehearsing the dance numbers and if you weren’t doing that you were doing a demo recording of the big number that you were going to sing at the end of the series.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/19/we-were-dancing-on-cars-in-the-epicentre-of-porn-and-filth-an-oral-history-of-fame-40-years-on\">An oral history of Fame: ‘We were dancing on cars in the epicentre of porn and filth!’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you read the old reviews of the series, nobody talks about race.

French media reported it had been sponsored by a halal fast food chain, Big M, and an online sports app, Omada.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2022/aug/22/why-criminal-barristers-striking-legal-aid-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T14:06:19Z","webTitle":"Why criminal barristers are striking over legal aid funding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/aug/22/why-criminal-barristers-striking-legal-aid-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2022/aug/22/why-criminal-barristers-striking-legal-aid-funding","fields":{"headline":"Why criminal barristers are striking over legal aid funding","trailText":"Those working on cases in England and Wales say they have been left worse off by changes to the system","byline":"Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor","body":"<p>Criminal barristers in England and Wales have voted overwhelmingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/aug/22/barristers-england-wales-vote-indefinite-strike\">to strike indefinitely</a> from 5 September, the same date the new Conservative leader and prime minister will be announced.</p> <h2>Why are criminal barristers striking?</h2> <p>Barristers working on criminal cases say they have seen deep cuts to their income after government changes to the legal aid system.</p> <p>Many have quit publicly funded legal aid work, leading to “legal aid deserts”. Barristers who remain say they can no longer survive on the fees and that the criminal justice system is almost at a standstill.</p> <p>The Criminal Bar Association (CBA) said a government offer of a 15% uplift in fees, which was the minimum increase recommended by the criminal legal aid review, was insufficient and would not apply to the backlog of 58,000 cases in crown courts.</p> <h2>What is legal aid?</h2> <p>Introduced by Clement Attlee’s government in 1949, it is a budget used to pay for legal advice for anyone arrested and charged who does not have the means to pay for it themselves. It is also used to help some claimants fight civil cases.</p> <h2>When were the changes made?</h2> <p>Many criminal barristers have blamed changes introduced under the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government with the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/contents/enacted\">Act 2012</a>.</p> <h2>How has the government responded to the strike threat?</h2> <p>Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, who is on leave until Thursday with his family in Surrey, has not met the CBA since members embarked on industrial action in April, but junior ministers have met the group regularly.</p> <p>On Monday the justice minister Sarah Dines said the strike would be “irresponsible”.</p> <h2>Who will be affected by the strike?</h2> <p>If hearings or trials cannot take place because there are no barristers to represent defendants, there will not be any trials in which criminals are sent to prison or those who are innocent are acquitted.</p> <p>Victims, like defendants, will be left in limbo, unsure when they will see justice.</p> <h2>Aren’t lawyers supposed to be well paid?</h2> <p>Lawyers who work in areas such as private corporate law can expect to make £100,000 a year from very early on in their careers.</p> <p>But criminal barristers are not paid as well as many people assume. The median salary for a criminal barrister in the year 2019-20 was £79,800, according to an independent review conducted by Sir Christopher Bellamy QC.</p> <p>New criminal barristers can take home as little as £9,000 once costs, including transport, are factored in, while some barristers say the time they spend preparing cases means their hourly earnings are below the minimum wage.</p> <p>Barristers with zero, one or two years of practice were paid a median of £25,100 before expenses and a net figure of £18,800 after expenses.</p> <p>Bellamy, a former judge, concluded last December that the criminal justice system needed an extra £135m a year immediately to halt the exodus of younger legal aid barristers, who receive as little as £12,200 per annum.</p> <p>On 30 June, the government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/criminal-barristers-to-receive-15-percent-fee-rise-in-september\">announced</a> an initial increase to criminal legal aid fees, coming into force in September 2022.</p> <h2>What will be the political consequences of the strike?</h2> <p>The first day of the strike, 5 September, is also the day the new prime minister is expected to take office after the resignation of Boris Johnson.</p> <p>The action follows rail and tube strikes in July and August by members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association, Aslef and Unite.</p> <p>The Communication Workers Union has announced industrial action by post office workers on 26, 27 and 30 August. BT and Openreach workers will stage further <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/01/bt-and-openreach-workers-stage-second-strike-over-pay\">strikes</a> in a dispute over pay.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
