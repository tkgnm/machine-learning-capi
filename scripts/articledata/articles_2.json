She describes the screams, the stench and the sight of a dead body on the street that made her contemplate her own mortality at too young an age. She takes a pause during the interview to fight back to tears when the director, Edward Buckles Jr, asks whether she ever spoke about these experiences. The answer is no. “Nobody really asked me,” Williams explains.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/brad-pitt-foundation-settlement-owners-faulty-post-katrina-houses\">Brad Pitt foundation agrees on $20.5m settlement to owners of faulty post-Katrina houses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That heartbreaking moment, recorded around 2015, was a turning point for Buckles, who at the time was a teacher trained in acting and fiddling with a camera on the side. He realized he was working on something bigger than what he imagined to be a YouTube video series. “I just wanted to hear the stories of my community and my peers and bring some type of change or impact,” says Buckles. “But at that time, I didn’t know what it was. When I went into this documentary, I didn’t know that the children had never spoken about it.”</p> <p>Buckles is on a Zoom call with the Guardian from a New Orleans hotel room. He currently lives in Jersey City but is back in his home town for a Katrina Babies screening and reception. Buckles himself was a “Katrina baby”, a 13-year-old displaced from New Orleans when the levees broke. He says that he too never spoke about Katrina, nor confronted how it may have weighed on him. He figured his silence was isolated but listening to Williams opened his eyes to the common themes in their experience: the shared trauma and systemic neglect. It wasn’t just them. So Buckles spent the next seven years making a documentary about that trauma and its connection to the problems plaguing New Orleans today, like the noticeable spike in violence. The city reportedly had the <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/article_30197d8a-f95d-11ec-bafa-3f7db4d5f198.html\">highest murder rate</a> in the US for the first half of 2022.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjteP4qBqn4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NjteP4qBqn4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In Katrina Babies, people who were as young as three at the time recollect losing their homes, communities and way of life to the hurricane. Their voices are complemented by harrowing footage of children being airlifted from rooftops in baskets or lost and confused amid the devastation at the Superdome, where the people caught in the eye of the storm were stranded for days.</p> <p>Buckles also relies on animation inspired by the art of Jacob Lawrence and Deborah Roberts to illustrate scenes where footage doesn’t exist. These are collages of families gathered during the storms and strangers finding refuge on boats without a set destination. These drawings are almost comfortingly cartoonish though they splice in real photographs and shards of traumatic memories.</p> <p>The dehumanizing experiences in Katrina Babies don’t end with the long wait for rescue – as George Bush’s government dragged its heels to respond to the disaster. The film also covers the subsequent displacement of New Orleans residents and gentrification of the city, which created a whole other set of problems for the youth. You have young people who experienced a lifetime of trauma within a short period, the stressors triggering flight-or-fight responses and developing into behavioural issues. And they are moved into different neighbourhoods with other marginalised youth. The territorial conflict, and subsequent violence, was inevitable.</p> <p>Buckles takes an intimate and personal approach to this material. He began noticing these issues when he worked as a high school teacher, which is partly what drove him to make the documentary. “Having that responsibility made me pay close attention to what was happening with our youth,” he says. “Most of them are dealing with anxiety, trust issues and PTSD from not just Hurricane Katrina, but all of the other inhumane things that are happening down here in New Orleans, and to Black and brown people in this country.”</p> <p>Throughout the film, Buckles reflects on the conversations with people from his community while unpacking his own story of displacement and repressed emotion, using language he learns through this process. “I didn’t understand my trauma,” he says. “I think that’s a common thing within our community. We’re trying to navigate so much other stuff just living in America. Who has time to think about how they feel? Who has time to address trauma when you’re dealing with so many other traumas?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8b3d06fb311255ab30f7299195d5c5e5be97707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8b3d06fb311255ab30f7299195d5c5e5be97707/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Orleans, Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Orleans, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Katrina Babies gathers momentum, it makes the case that the entire ordeal for the people of New Orleans brought on by Hurricane Katrina – the neglect, poverty and violence — is just a concentrated version of what Black Americans confront always.</p> <p>The film feels especially potent following the pandemic – which had a greater impact on the Black community – and the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. If unchecked, how are today’s youth going to absorb these traumas?</p> <p>These tragedies also inspired sustained and introspective conversations about trauma, and how even witnessing violence and harm through social media can have detrimental effects on our mental health. Buckles absorbed that kind of awareness into his film-making process. A school counsellor pointed out to him that the interviews he was conducting with students about their experiences should include a follow-up wellness process. These conversations were a pathway towards healing, but they also have the potential to retraumatise, the counsellor explained.</p> <p>Buckles adds that watching the film as someone who experienced Hurricane Katrina can be retraumatising. “No matter if the project is healing, no matter if the project is inspiring to them, I am retraumatising them. That’s just the truth.”</p> <p>Buckles then considers how more artists and film-makers should be cautious about the harm their well-meaning content may cause. That is a whole conversation, especially with the litany of films and television shows (like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/16/them-two-distant-strangers-black-tv-film\">Two Distant Strangers and Them</a>, for instance) that treat Black trauma like a trope for consumption.</p> <p>Another trope Buckles warns against is the celebration of resilience. Katrina Babies could have easily slinked into applauding the people of New Orleans for their resilience. Too often documentaries or fiction films about Black suffering search for emotional satisfaction in resilience because there’s no other hopeful payoff when it comes to such cyclical trauma. But the thing about celebrating resilience is that it reinforces a reward system for suffering instead of dismantling the system that makes resilience necessary.</p> <p>“Resilience is the reason that slaves would get treated harsher and harsher based on how big they were,” says Buckles, reiterating an eye-opening argument someone made to him. “It’s not for you to call me resilient. It is for you to make sure that I don’t have to continue to be resilient under inhumane circumstances.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Katrina Babies is available 24 August 24 on HBO Max in the US with a UK date to be announced</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/aug/22/fictional-chefs-take-over-tv-the-bear-james-corden","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T14:00:35Z","webTitle":"Sexy, stressful, thrilling: how fictional chefs are about to take over TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/22/fictional-chefs-take-over-tv-the-bear-james-corden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/aug/22/fictional-chefs-take-over-tv-the-bear-james-corden","fields":{"headline":"Sexy, stressful, thrilling: how fictional chefs are about to take over TV","trailText":"From US smash-hit kitchen drama The Bear to James Corden starring as a chef in Jez Butterworth’s forthcoming “relationship whodunnit”, you’re going to be watching a lot of ovens","byline":"Stuart Heritage","body":"<p>J<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/06/fx-television-john-grandraf-damages-nip-tuck\">ohn Landgraf</a>, the FX head who for years has been able to predict the fortunes of the TV industry with uncanny ability, recently said that this year will see “peak TV” finally peak. By his accounts, 357 scripted shows were launched in the first six months of 2022 alone, up 16% from a year ago. This, obviously, is more television than any one person can possibly watch. The good news is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/11/how-disney-overtook-netflix-in-streaming-wars\">with Netflix faltering</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/08/hbo-max-end-streaming-warner-discovery-merger\">HBO Max intent on cratering</a> before our very eyes, a contraction is due any minute now.</p> <p>The bad news is that there are now more TV shows than ideas. It has become easier than ever to find premises and plots that have been unknowingly shared between different series, as you will see if you’re diligent enough at following the thread along one of this year’s hottest trends: the stressed-out chef show.</p> <p>The biggest of these, and the one that looks destined to hog the headlines, is FX’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jun/28/the-bear-review-fx-restaurant-drama\">The Bear</a>, soon to drop on Disney+ in the UK. The Bear has already made enough of a splash in the US to be simultaneously dubbed “the sexiest show of the year” and “the most stressful show of the year”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15a1db512675b22fefe9f724bf1188240bfc8793\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15a1db512675b22fefe9f724bf1188240bfc8793/660_0_2859_1716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Much-anticipated … James Corden plays a chef in Mammals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Much-anticipated … James Corden plays a chef in Mammals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dignity Productions/Amazon Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>UK viewers won’t have to watch for long to see how the latter tag came about. The Bear follows a down-at-heel fine-dining chef who, after his brother’s suicide, finds himself trying to shore up his family’s sandwich shop. Its big trick is finding the urgency in the mundane; despite the fact that, in the show’s signature kitchen scenes, we are just watching people make sandwiches to order, there’s a chest-bursting panic to it all. We constantly feel the stress of the job bearing down on its lead, played by Jeremy Allen White. Invariably, everything comes to a head later in the run, during a single-shot episode so frantic and stressful that it feels like a half-hour heart attack.</p> <p>As for the sexiness? That’s a harder call. On paper – unless you have a shameful bread kink – The Bear isn’t a very sexy show at all. There are no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jan/06/pomp-and-romps-how-bridgerton-became-the-most-talked-about-show-on-tv\">Bridgerton</a>-style romps, no will-they-won’t-they plots. But what it does have is hunger. The internet has already done a bang-up job of objectifying White who, with his floppy hair, sleepy eyes and brooding obsession, comes across as half <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/07/how-marco-pierre-whites-white-heat-launched-a-culinary-revolution\">Marco Pierre White</a> and half <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/anthony-bourdain\">Anthony Bourdain</a>. But more than that, the whole show is wonderfully tangible. It’s unglamorous and unpretentious. You can feel the sweat prickle on the characters’ backs as they toil in the kitchen and the ache in their legs once they’ve finished a service. It’s raw and earthy, the kind of show that gets all the way under your fingernails. It’s really very good.</p> <p>But just because The Bear seems destined to be the awards darling of next year, it doesn’t mean that it’s the only new scripted chef show around. Jez Butterworth’s much-anticipated Amazon show Mammals might bill itself as a “relationship whodunnit” – with Butterworth promising that everything that happens after the opening six minutes is a series-destroying spoiler – but it’s no secret that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/james-corden\">James Corden</a> plays, you guessed it, a grumpy chef called Jamie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d73e7ebad9270562eb952cfd8dbada113fc3a4bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d73e7ebad9270562eb952cfd8dbada113fc3a4bb/139_384_3672_2203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Lancashire in Julia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quiet, careful obsession … Sarah Lancashire in Julia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seacia Pavao/Seacia Pavao/WarnerMedia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These two shows come hot on the heels of Julia, Sky Atlantic’s drama series about Julia Child. Admittedly Julia tweaked the formula a little – Child was a cook rather than a chef, and one who made her fame by projecting undimmed outward warmth – but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/12/julia-review-sarah-lancashires-wonderful-performance-is-straight-out-of-classic-cinema\">Sarah Lancashire’s performance</a> is nonetheless one of quiet, careful obsession and ambition.</p> <p>It isn’t hard to see why TV writers turn to chefs whenever they want to depict raised stakes. Professional cookery thrives on speed and precision, heat and ego. As depicted in The Bear, it requires you to keep your foot firmly planted on the job’s throat at all times, otherwise it will rise up and devour you. Done right, it’s absolutely thrilling. Then again, if stressed-out chefs aren’t your thing, something else is bound to come along before too long. This is the peak of “peak TV”, after all.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"games/2022/aug/22/saints-row-review-a-vast-ridiculous-b-movie-caper-deep-silver","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T14:00:35Z","webTitle":"Saints Row review – a vast, ridiculous B-movie caper","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/aug/22/saints-row-review-a-vast-ridiculous-b-movie-caper-deep-silver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2022/aug/22/saints-row-review-a-vast-ridiculous-b-movie-caper-deep-silver","fields":{"headline":"Saints Row review – a vast, ridiculous B-movie caper","trailText":"With its wonky sets, dodgy cameras and bizarre plotlines, this reboot of the gangster adventure series is haphazard but joyful","byline":"Keith Stuart","body":"<p>When the trailer to this reboot of the long-running gangster adventure series arrived last year, gaming’s gutter world of gatekeeping nerd misanthropes swung straight into action – and by that I mean a lot of angry boys whined online about Saints Row going “woke”. The game’s archetypal white male protagonist had been sacked and replaced by a diverse gang of twentysomethings seeking to build an underworld empire while sharing a flat, cruising social media and getting into polyamorous relationships. If you wanted to know what would happen if Grand Theft Auto was handed to the writers of Riverdale, here you are. You’re welcome.</p> <p>And that’s the thing. You <em>are</em> welcome. Because Saints Row has dropped the dudebro “anything goes as long as it celebrates the patriarchy” shtick of the previous title, with its giant dildo baseball bats and sex pest humour. Now, <em>everyone</em> is in on the joke – and the joke is about trying to exist as a young person in the post-capitalist hellzone of the 21st century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00ad91458bac8b48824b52e8a3ce53a431ea222f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00ad91458bac8b48824b52e8a3ce53a431ea222f/159_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saints Row\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Every face-off is daft and unpredictable … Saints Row.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deep Silver</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As ever, your job is to expand the Saints gang’s territory across the city, destroying rival cartels and setting up businesses as fronts for your underworld activities. You play a wisecracking ex-private military employee named The Boss, and you’re abetted by brainiac businessman Eli, petrolhead Neenah and pansexual playboy Kevin, who all trade smart quips and pop culture references whenever they can catch a break from murdering armies of SMG-toting criminals. The game gently parodies as well as celebrates the TikTok culture it has embraced. When the Saints want to find out what a rival group is planning, they don’t send in a spy, they check the gang’s official social media feed. When preparing for a major robbery, they don’t lay down their plans in a smoky war room, they go on a team-building day in a DayGlo motorhome.</p> <p>The structure of the game is deadeningly familiar. Set in the county of Santo Ileso, a homogenised take on the American south-west, the map is separated into territories, each one filled with side quests and discovery tasks. You earn cash by taking on missions and use it to open new bases, buy guns and customise the vehicles you steal, and everything is managed through a smartphone interface. If you’ve played Grand Theft Auto, Spider-Man or the Assassin’s Creed games you will have so many flashes of deja vu you’ll think you’re trapped in a new Christopher Nolan movie.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3QcEQ2G2AA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3QcEQ2G2AA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The game also has myriad technical issues. The menu system, especially when it comes to managing your Skills and Perks options, is horrible. The HUD map display has icons that obscure a lot of the detail (which is especially frustrating in a firefight), while many of the mission and quest objectives are ambiguous or downright bewildering. The visuals are also distinctly last-gen a lot of the time, with stuttering animation and blocky landscape detail. There are bugs <em>everywhere</em>. I witnessed characters getting stuck in the scenery, cars getting stuck in the scenery, even scenery getting stuck in the scenery … there were missions I had a nightmare finishing because an enemy character got trapped somewhere inaccessible and I couldn’t trigger the end point, or they just suddenly became bullet-proof.</p> <p>But … but … somehow it works.</p> <p>It works because Volition has thrown everything at the game – meaty guns, crazed muscle cars, ridiculous characters and some imaginative locations – and just begs you to get out there and mess about. And even though you know you’ve done these train robberies, prison breakouts and revenge assassinations many times before in other games, you do them again here because every face-off is so daft and unpredictable. Gunplay is erratic but also varied and intense, with an array of rifles, rocket launchers and melee weapons to buy and customise. You can just wander the map, getting into fights, testing the technical boundaries and knowing that you’re not going to run into any of the foghorn satire or braying misogyny of the GTA series. It’s essentially a vast interactive B-movie, with wonky sets, dodgy cameras and bizarre plotlines. There are going to be a <em>lot</em> of Saints Row clips on TikTok and YouTube. In its fun-to-glitch ratio, it’s basically Skate 3 for Gen Z.</p> <p>Indeed, while Saints Row is messy, buggy, silly and often derivative, it also recalls a time in the early 2000s when the open world genre was a haphazard, joyful space with none of the codified, dopamine-fracking precision of modern titles. There are, in this frisky reboot, the ghosts of titles such as True Crime: Streets of LA, State of Emergency, The Getaway and Runabout – patchy, imperfect but gripping experiments in player agency that didn’t quite understand the conventions, but had a bash anyway. To me that is a far more interesting set of stablemates than the last couple of Saints Row titles. To me, this is a preposterously fun video game, despite its many faults, or more accurately, because of them.</p> <p>• Saints Row is available now; £55.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/22/black-mail-review-nollywood-heads-for-london-with-cybercrime-thriller","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T14:00:34Z","webTitle":"Black Mail review – Nollywood’s finest head for London with cybercrime thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/22/black-mail-review-nollywood-heads-for-london-with-cybercrime-thriller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/22/black-mail-review-nollywood-heads-for-london-with-cybercrime-thriller","fields":{"headline":"Black Mail review – Nollywood’s finest head for London with cybercrime thriller","trailText":"A film star faces financial and family ruin as sleazy Russian mobsters blackmail him after malware films him watching porn","byline":"Leslie Felperin","body":"<p>Nigerian film-maker Obi Emelonye has written, produced and directed more than a dozen films, but his work is barely known beyond the Nollywood distribution circuit that serves viewers in west Africa and immigrant communities elsewhere. However, Black Mail, his London-set latest, is getting a reasonably wide release in the UK at least. The lowish-budget production values, gestural performances and blunt moralism of the scriptwriting puts this very much in the heightened dramatic tradition of mainstream Nigerian cinema, but Emelonye has an accessible style and has picked the topical subject of cybercrime, an approach which might broaden the film’s appeal.</p> <p>The plot weaves together the story of hapless London-based film actor Ray Chinda (OC Ukeje) and the Russian mobsters who are blackmailing him.

Having filmed Ray masturbating while watching porn, sleazy middle-management mafioso Igor (Nikolay Shulik) starts sending Ray blackmail demands. Deeply ashamed, convinced that Nikki will leave him and afraid his career will be ruined if it all comes out, Ray pays him some money, but then turns to his manager-friend Reuben (Alessandro Babalola from Top Boy) for support and advice. Meanwhile, we learn that Igor is also running a prostitution ring exploiting a number of trafficked Belorussian women.

When the player’s transfer to Napoli was announced in April, Aurelio De Laurentiis was asked for guidance. “I’ll make something up,” replied the club president. “We’ll call him something. He can be ‘Zizì’, that’s not bad.”</p> \n<p>A more obvious abbreviation was adopted elsewhere, ‘Kvara’ becoming accepted shorthand. Two Serie A appearances later, however, a new nickname has taken hold. From the alleys of Naples’s Spanish Quarter to the headlines of national newspapers, the Georgian was being hailed on Monday as ‘Kvaradona’.</p> \n<p>Perhaps one or two optimists embraced that soubriquet before he arrived, placing their trust in scouting reports that promised an audacious young dribbler. Kvaratskhelia had been hailed by his international teammate Zuriko Davitashvili as the “Georgian Messi”. <a href=\"https://www.ultimouomo.com/kvaratskhelia-napoli-come-gioca-chi-e/\">Stats from his time with Rubin Kazan</a> in Russia showed him taking on his man as regularly as Neymar at Paris Saint-Germain.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/22/bundesliga-borussia-dortmund-werder-bremen-bundesliga\">Dortmund’s historic capitulation brings Terzic honeymoon to an end</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Most, though, were hesitant to place a 21-year-old in the same breath as Napoli’s greatest player. They wanted to see the evidence with their own eyes. A group of about 1,000 of them got the chance at the Stadio Bentegodi on the season’s opening weekend, travelling to watch their team win 5-2 at Verona.</p> \n<p>Kvaratskhelia scored Napoli’s opening goal, his header drawing them level in the first half. After the interval, he set up Piotr Zielinski for the strike that made it 3-2, releasing his teammate with a first-time through-ball from just inside the opposition half. It was an astonishingly confident pass from a player who already looked like a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuJ243dbxIg&amp;ab_channel=SerieA\">fully integrated component of a smooth-running machine</a>.</p> \n<p>How could that be? Were Napoli not supposed to endure a season of transition after bidding farewell to Lorenzo Insigne, Kalidou Koulibaly and Dries Mertens – their captain, vice-captain and all-time leading goalscorer respectively?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"554312789ac81688f1b2bf99d9cdc99b97c40e3b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/554312789ac81688f1b2bf99d9cdc99b97c40e3b/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans wave the Georgian flag in support of Napoli’s Khvicha Kvaratskhelia Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans wave the Georgian flag in support of Napoli’s Khvicha Kvaratskhelia at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Sunday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franco Romano/NurPhoto/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Throughout the summer, Ultra groups had protested over what they perceived as insufficient activity to replace them. The Napoli manager, Luciano Spalletti, was interrupted during an event introducing the team at their training camp in Dimaro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkzRSjlz5k8&amp;ab_channel=CalcioNapoli24\">by a man screaming at him to “Wake up!”</a></p> \n<p>The relationship between De Laurentiis and the fans has long been fraught. He has upset different groups at different times with outlandish statements – he once suggested Neapolitans don’t know how to cook pizza – and high ticket prices, but the greatest hostility has come from those who believe he is more interested in enriching his family than winning trophies or improving club infrastructure.</p> \n<p>From another perspective, such criticisms might seem absurd. De Laurentiis restored Napoli from bankruptcy in 2004. Under his presidency, they returned to the top-flight within three years and have since won the Coppa Italia three times, as well as finishing among Serie A’s top three in eight of the past 12 seasons.</p> \n<p>But the picture is complicated by his family’s investment in a second Italian club. De Laurentiis’s media company, Filmauro, completed the takeover of another fallen giant, Bari, in 2018. With his son, Luigi De Laurentiis, as president, they have already climbed two divisions to Serie B.</p> \n<p>New regulations have sought to prohibit the simultaneous ownership of two clubs. The chaos caused by the promotion of Salernitana, co-owned by the Lazio president, Claudio Lotito, to Serie A last season provided a vivid illustration of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/23/salernitanas-ghost-game-could-be-a-farcical-end-to-their-serie-a-journey\">problems such arrangements can cause</a>. Yet Filmauro appealed successfully for an exemption that allows them to own Napoli and Bari until 2028 – as long as they don’t wind up in the same division.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/22/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As Insigne, Koulibaly and Mertens packed their bags, it was easy for fans to believe their club was being neglected. On social media sites, the hashtag #A16 was launched – a reference to the motorway that links Naples and Bari. De Laurentiis’s doubters wanted to see him drive off down it and not return.</p> \n<p>But then the season began. Kvaratskhelia was not the only player to impress in the win over Verona, Victor Osimhen grabbing a goal and an assist and Stanislav Lobotka dominating the midfield. Another new signing, Kim Min-jae, made a confident debut at centre-back.</p> \n<p>Napoli followed that result with more signings: the 22-year-old Italy forward Giacomo Raspadori from Sassuolo, Tanguy Ndombele from Tottenham and Giovanni Simeone, who racked up 17 goals and five assists last season, from Verona. Suddenly, Spalletti had a wealth of options up front.</p> \n<p>Against promoted Monza on Sunday, he chose to stick with the group who had been working together throughout preseason. That meant another start for Kvaratskhelia, who marked his first appearance at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona with two goals in an emphatic 4-0 win.</p> \n<p>His first could almost have been a homage to the man he has replaced on the left of Napoli’s attack. Cutting in from that flank, Kvaratskhelia unleashed a bending shot – ‘<em>u tiraggir</em>’, in the local dialect – towards the top-right corner, Insigne’s trademark move. Not even the Italian struck many this sweetly though, the ball sailing on an unstoppable trajectory off the woodwork and into the net.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"205c3b5b57cdc6b7bc9c99c87f37072d6035819a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/205c3b5b57cdc6b7bc9c99c87f37072d6035819a/0_0_3543_2363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Italy international Giacomo Raspadori was a high-profile arrival in Naples in the off-season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Italy international Giacomo Raspadori was a high-profile arrival in Naples in the off-season.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincenzo Izzo/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That was the first goal of the game. Osimhen added the second before Kvaratskhelia struck again. This time he showed off his ambidexterity, opening up as if to shoot across goal with his right foot but instead hooking the ball back, unbalancing the defender in front of him and taking a touch to go past before burying it with his left.</p> \n<p>In two games, Kvaratskhelia has completed a perfect hat-trick – one goal with his head and one with either foot. Not bad for a player who arrived for a modest €10m fee.</p> \n<p>That is a testament to the work of Napoli’s sporting director, Cristiano Giuntoli, who moved decisively to agree the deal to sign him from Dinamo Batumi in April. Kvaratskhelia had joined the Georgian club one month before, quitting Rubin Kazan after Fifa ruled that foreign players in Russia should be free to break their contracts after the invasion of Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Spalletti believes Kvaratskhelia has much more to show us. “He still has too much pressure on him,” said the manager. “As soon as he frees himself from that pressure, he will show people what a player he is. Today there were a few more times when he held up the ball and doubted himself in the one-on-one.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"821bcc1a-46bf-4119-9567-52a298565d56\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Serie A results</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Saturday: </b>Inter 3-0 Spezia, Sassuolo 1-0 Lecce, Torino 0-0 Lazio, Udinese 0-0 Salernitana. <b>Sunday: </b>Atalanta 1-1 Milan, Bologna 1-1 Verona, Empoli 0-0 Fiorentina, Napoli 4-0 Monza.&nbsp;<b>Monday fixtures: </b>Roma v Cremonese (5.30pm), Sampdoria v Juventus (7.45pm).</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A scary thought for opposing defences. Napoli have scored nine times in two games and Spalletti suggested Raspadori and Simeone will have to earn their right to play for the first team.</p> \n<p>Now is not the moment for getting ahead of oneself. Neither Verona nor Monza offered much defensive resistance and tougher tests lie ahead. Napoli began last season with eight consecutive wins before a defeat by Internazionale, and Osimhen’s fractured cheekbone, took the wind out of their sails.</p> \n<p>The buzz and excitement to see more of this team, though, is real. ‘Kvaradona’ has announced himself to the league and even Kim got in on the act, scoring Napoli’s fourth goal on the day the player he replaced, Kalidou Koulibaly, was picking up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/leeds-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">a red card for Chelsea</a>. “We are on a good path,” said Spalletti. “Now

But, I recently learned, we millennials may find ourselves uniquely screwed as we approach that low point in the curve.</p> <p>My place on this “smile curve” took on new urgency when I came across the data from this year’s <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/tus/\">American Time Use Survey</a>. The study by the US Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics measures how people spend their days – working, exercising, housekeeping, eating and the like. The latest report, using data from 2021, reports all sorts of depressing statistics. To pluck just one of many: Americans across all ages spend vastly more time watching television than doing literally any other leisure activity, including socializing, playing sports, reading, or “relaxing and thinking”, that Shangri-La of all time-use buckets, and one last successfully engaged in by Cicero.</p> <p>But the worrying one for me pertained to those of us between 35 and 44 years old, the so-called “elder millennials” (a phrase I cannot read without flashing back to the moment when my obstetrician labeled my pregnancy “geriatric”, instantaneously evoking the image of my husband holding my walker as I nursed): apparently, we spend the least amount of leisure time of any other age cohort, and the least ever reported for our cohort since the survey was first released in 2003. When I read <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-26/elder-millennials-have-less-time-for-fun\">an article</a> by a Bloomberg columnist, who crunched the ATUS numbers to pull that stat to the forefront, I thought, <em>If no one else in my life ever really sees me, at least the Bureau of Labor Statistics does.</em></p> <p>Ask any geriatric elder like myself, and it’s no real shocker why this is the case. Instead of leisuring, since 2003 we’re working more and caring for small children more. (Duh.) Sure, according to the study we’re also investing more time in “personal care activities”, a bucket which largely includes sleeping but also “grooming”, though I’ll be the first to admit that I no longer have to expend any time filing my nails because they are basically nubbins (thank you, anxiety!). But probably some of this increase is due to self-help that we have been forced to administer, post-pandemic, and, regardless, can the Census Bureau accurately capture the nuances of what “sleeping” looks like with three children under the age of six and a half?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I’m not sure I need a national survey to illuminate my diminishing leisure time, and the depressing ways I choose to spend it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Had I partaken in the survey last year, I would have wanted to clarify that with a newborn in the house, my husband’s Apple watch sleep tracker looked like a seismograph at the base of Vesuvius in AD79. Had I taken it last weekend, I would have piped up that the hours of 3.30 to 5am were spent driving my three-year-old languidly up and down back streets with the soothing sounds of Raffi lullabies playing, as I narrowly dodged small woodland creatures and willfully pretended she was drifting off (she wasn’t, and we were the first in line at the bagel store).</p> <p>Suffice it to say, I’m not sure I need a national survey to illuminate my diminishing leisure time, and the depressing ways I choose to spend it. What interested me was how these two sets of data interacted. Here we are, not only marching grimly towards our most unhappy phase of life, but paring away at the pockets of time that might give us some reprieve, and paring away at them at a rate not seen in two decades. Would I really have to wait until my mid-50s to relax and think?</p> <p>“Millennials got hit hard in so many different ways,” Carol Graham, an expert in the field of economics and happiness, told me. “The financial crisis, little kids at home during Covid – they’ve had a rough decade or two, and it’s coming at a critical point.”</p> <p>Graham is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a professor at the University of Maryland. She’s the author of several books including Happiness around the World: the Paradox of Happy Peasants and Miserable Millionaires.</p> <p>In a paper entitled “<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-021-02773-w\">The Mid-Life Dip in Well-Being: A Critique</a>”, she, along with the Dartmouth economics professor Danny Blanchflower, resoundingly disputes skeptics of the U-shaped curve, pointing to more than 420 studies, mostly published in peer reviewed journals, that support the phenomenon. “The U-Shape pattern in mid-life even extends beyond humans to apes,” the researchers write, conjuring King Kong on a chaise longue.</p> <p>In addition to big economic forces specific to millennials, such as the Great Recession, Graham mentioned the cultural ramifications of living in a country that not only doesn’t offer basic support, but also devalues leisure time and vacations in general.</p> <p>“My guess is that the next generations may have it a little easier,” she surmised, citing a more forgiving labor market and the Great Resignation, which has empowered employees to say no, or demand more – at least those who are privileged enough to be able to do so in the first place.</p> <p>There are data-backed ways to amplify one’s happiness, including being more altruistic, and that nebulous concept of “being active in your own destiny”, both of which Graham believes got a boost from the Covid years, with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08748-2\">charitable giving rising</a>, and recalibrated life priorities. And there’s at least one millennial-specific silver lining.</p> <p>“Going through more difficult times in the long run has a payoff, because if you get through them, you’re more resilient,” Graham said. “You’re just able to weather the shocks better, even if it isn’t a perfect landing.”</p> <p>So, fellow elder millennials, heads down.

He graduated five years later, completing his training following national service as an aerial photographer with the RAF’s 656 squadron in Malaya<strong> </strong>(Malaysia).</p> <p>He gained repertory theatre experience in Birmingham (1959-60) and Colchester (1961-62), then joined the Old Vic theatre company in London for a world tour (1961-62). He particularly enjoyed acting alongside Vivien Leigh in Duel of Angels, Twelfth Night and other plays. “She was a perfectionist,” he said. “A woman to give you standards.”</p> <p>Montague made his first impression on television as Inspector Larbi throughout the first series of Crane (1963), starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/aug/09/guardianobituaries.film\" title=\"\">Patrick Allen</a> as a cafe owner and smuggler on the coast of Morocco.</p> <p>Then, between 1967 and 1971, he directed and acted in stage productions in New Zealand, where he was co-founder of the Mercury theatre in Auckland (1968), and Australia, where he wrote the festive musical Skippy Saves Christmas (1970-71).</p> <p>While there, he also landed two starring television roles, as Stanton, the English professor among a group of Mensa members, in the thriller series The Alpha Plan (1969) and Detective Sergeant Harry Sutton in the crime drama The Link Men (1970).<strong> </strong>Back in Britain, Montague was prolific on stage during the 1970s, his roles including the assistant hotel manager in A Touch of Spring at the Comedy (now Harold Pinter) theatre in 1975 and 1976.</p> <p>Television viewers then began to see more of him. He played the doctor, Michael Pearson, tending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/apr/12/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Nyree Dawn Porter</a>’s terminally ill character in the afternoon serial For Maddie With Love (1980).</p> <p>Making his mark in screen comedy for the first time, in the doomsday satire Whoops Apocalypse (1982), written by Andrew Marshall and David Renwick, Montague acted the deposed Shah of Iran, Mashiq Rassim, shunted around the world looking for refuge.</p> <p>After Butterflies, he had a regular supporting role in another popular sitcom, Sharon and Elsie (1984-85), as Roland Beecroft, husband of Brigit Forsyth’s snobbish middle-aged, middle-class office administrator who surprises herself by befriending Janette Beverley’s young, working-class secretary.</p> <p>Montague kept popping up in comedies and dramas, and, later, in 2015, had a run in the teen soap Hollyoaks as Derek Clough, a character far removed from his Butterflies persona. Derek was the abusive former boyfriend of Marlena “Nana” McQueen (Diane Langton), who allowed him to spend his final days in her home when he was dying. But she was shocked when her daughter Reenie (Zöe Lucker) came round to reveal that he had raped her and was the father of her daughter Porsche (Twinnie-Lee Moore) – telling her just as Derek was having a heart attack. They left him to die.</p> <p>In 2019, he was reunited with his fellow Butterflies star Craig in an episode of the daytime serial Doctors when they were cast as married pensioners, Connie and Clyde, suspected of stealing the GP surgery’s charity tin.</p> <p>On stage, Montague had a starring role as Barney Cashman, the middle-aged fish restaurateur making a belated attempt to join the sexual revolution, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/26/neil-simon-obituary\" title=\"\">Neil Simon</a>’s comedy Last of the Red Hot Lovers at the Strand (now Novello) theatre in 1989.</p> <p>But the second half of his West End career was dominated by roles in musicals: the constable in Fiddler on the Roof (London Palladium, 1993-94); Mr Brownlow in Oliver! (London Palladium, 1997-98); Monsieur Firmin in The Phantom of the Opera (Her Majesty’s theatre, 2001-02); and Florenz Ziegfeld in Funny Girl (Savoy theatre, 2016-17).</p> <p>His last major musical role was a beautiful comic turn as the Broadway musical financier Abner Dillon in 42nd Street (Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, 2017-19), alongside Sheena Easton’s fading star, Dorothy Brock.</p> <p>In 1962, Montague married the novelist Barbara Latham; she died in April this year.

Garlic, and lots of it, is poached very gently in oil with thyme and a hint of smoked chipotle chilli for flavour and warmth; after about half an hour, the garlic turns soft, sweet and irresistibly good. The sauce is versatile, too, making a beautiful marinade for grilled meats and also wonderful on roast vegetables or blanched green leaves.</p> <h2>Pasta with charred aubergine, ricotta and mojo de ajo</h2> <p>Try this with a chilli oil made from habanero chillies and Mexican oregano, or with Sichuan peppercorns and coriander seeds.</p> <p>Prep <strong>20 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>45 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>3 large aubergines</strong>, stems removed and quartered lengthways<br><strong>1 onion</strong>, peeled and quartered<br><strong>6 large tomatoes</strong> (or 650g tomatoes of any size)<br><strong>Olive oil<br>Salt and black pepper<br>250g ricotta</strong><br><strong>1 lemon</strong>, zested, plus juice of ½ lemon<strong><br>300g </strong><strong>rigatoni<br>1 big handful basil leaves</strong>, roughly shredded</p> <p>For the mojo<br><strong>2 whole garlic heads<br>2 tsp chipotle en adobo</strong>, finely chopped<br><strong>200ml olive</strong><strong> or vegetable oil<br>1 small handful </strong><strong>thyme sprigs</strong>, picked<strong><br>1 t</strong><strong>sp flaky sea salt</strong></p> <p>First make the mojo. Break up the garlic heads, then smash each clove once or twice with a rolling pin, so you can peel them easily. Finely mince the peeled garlic in a small food processor, then transfer to a small, heavy-based pan with the rest of the mojo ingredients. Heat gently until the oil starts to bubble, then turn down the heat to its lowest setting and simmer very gently for half an hour (if you cook it too quickly, the garlic will burn and you will lose the flavour of the olive oil). </p> <p>Meanwhile, char the vegetables either under a hot grill or on a griddle or dry frying pan. If using the grill, arrange them in a single layer on foil-lined trays, brush with two to three tablespoons of olive oil and season, then grill for 20-30 minutes, until blackened. If you are dry-roasting, you do not need to add oil, just fry them over a hot flame.</p> <p>While the vegetables are charring, drain the ricotta, mix it with the lemon zest and a tablespoon of olive oil, then season to taste. Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a cup of the cooking water to loosen the sauce later.</p> <p>Once the vegetables are tender to the tip of a knife and nicely charred, chop them into bite-sized pieces (discard the aubergine stems) and tip into a large bowl. Stir through the basil and warm pasta, season, and dress with two to three tablespoons of olive oil and the lemon juice. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary, then serve in warm bowls topped with the ricotta mix and with the mojo on the side for people to help themselves.</p> <h2>The simple flex</h2> <p>To make this vegan, omit the ricotta and instead toss the aubergine pasta with large chunks of golden ciabatta croutons and chopped toasted almonds.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"film/2022/aug/22/bubble-bath-review-hallucinogenic-animated-musical-is-a-work-of-70s-genius","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T12:00:32Z","webTitle":"Bubble Bath review – hallucinogenic animated musical is a work of 70s genius","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/aug/22/bubble-bath-review-hallucinogenic-animated-musical-is-a-work-of-70s-genius","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/aug/22/bubble-bath-review-hallucinogenic-animated-musical-is-a-work-of-70s-genius","fields":{"headline":"Bubble Bath review – hallucinogenic animated musical is a work of 70s genius","trailText":"This psychedelic Hungarian film from 1979 pulsates with crazed anxieties about modernity","byline":"Phil Hoad","body":"<p>Directed by György Kovásznai, who died of leukaemia in 1983, Hungary’s third ever full-length animated feature is a true curio and a work of minor genius: a gallopingly neurotic modernist-psychedelic musical from 1979 that bubbles and pulsates with anxieties about modernity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/21/why-is-adult-animation-bigger-than-ever\">Life drawing: why is adult animation bigger than ever?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It mostly takes place inside a single Budapest apartment, where medical student Anikó (voiced by Vera Venzcel, with Kati Bontovits singing) is suddenly visited by the walrus-moustached Zsolt (Kornél Gelley, with Albert Antalffy singing). He’s having a major wobbly – palpitations, handkerchief-dabbing, manic hoedown music and everything – about his impending marriage to Klári (Lenke Lorán, with Katalin Dobos singing), a society girl and Anikó’s best friend. Klári just wants babies, but would-be artist Zsolt and aspiring doctor Anikó start to bond over a more liberated idea of life.</p> <p>With characters and settings constantly warping, tilting and transmogrifying, Bubble Bath is visually something special; like Van Gogh, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleischer_Studios\">Fleischer Studios</a>, Robert Crumb, Yellow Submarine and the abstract-thought section of Pixar’s Inside Out smooshed into a great lysergic battenberg cake. Kovásznai also works in collaged photographic elements and rays of filtered light cast over the animation cells. Beginning with Anikó’s lounge-jazz effort about biological processes, all the characters – including her wheelchair-user aunt – get musical numbers. Most rock hard, especially an avant-funk crooner from Zsolt on the subject of interior design that would do 70s Eno proud.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J60e4JX-D2s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J60e4JX-D2s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This is not only an emotionally lucid film, but one that takes the pulse of 1970s Hungary with a sense of fun and clarifying abstraction. Anikó and Zsolt embody the individualist aspirations of a new consumerist society, and Klári – singing the praises of mod cons – is not immune. But, according to Kovásznai, biological imperatives are the opposing force: he inserts <em>verité</em> extracts of Hungarians discussing demographics and their family plans. It’s never too serious though: Zsolt, for some reason, winds up disguised as a frogman fending off Klári’s muscleman pal. The crazed energy is irresistible.</p> <p>• Bubble Bath is available on 24 August on Mubi.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/22/woman-killed-in-london-after-range-rover-crashed-and-landed-on-tube-track-park-royal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T11:54:23Z","webTitle":"Woman killed in London after Range Rover crashes and lands on tube track","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/22/woman-killed-in-london-after-range-rover-crashed-and-landed-on-tube-track-park-royal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/22/woman-killed-in-london-after-range-rover-crashed-and-landed-on-tube-track-park-royal","fields":{"headline":"Woman killed in London after Range Rover crashes and lands on tube track","trailText":"Car carrying three people crashed into stationary Tesla and ended up on track by Park Royal tube stop","byline":"Tom Ambrose","body":"<p>A woman died and three people were injured after a Range Rover crashed and ended up on a railway track in west London.</p> <p>The Piccadilly line was partly suspended on Monday morning after the incident on the A40 westbound near Park Royal tube station.</p> <p>Emergency services were called to the scene at 3.48am and a woman, 33, who was a passenger in the Range Rover, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p> <p>Metropolitan police officers are still waiting for formal identification and confirmation that the woman’s next of kin have been informed.</p> <p>Two other people – a man, 24, and a woman, 27 – were also in the car and were taken to hospital.</p> <p>The man, who was driving, is in a critical condition, while the woman’s injuries were assessed to be not life-threatening.</p> <p>A man in his 50s who was sitting in a stationary Tesla, also involved in the crash, received treatment from paramedics for his injuries.</p> <p>A Met spokesperson said: “It was reported that two cars, a Range Rover and a Tesla, had been involved in a collision and the Range Rover had left the road and gone on to the railway line.

However, in a statement last week it apologised for its global branding strategy, launched in 2015 when it was led by a Japanese designer, which appeared to present the firm as a “Japanese designer brand”.

Here is the anecdote about his first teenage crush. Now, the one about his string of dead-end jobs. Next comes his friendship with a junkie poet, his three days behind bars and his life-or-death encounter with a jealous husband.</p> <p>But How I Learned What I Learned, making its European debut 17 years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/04/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Wilson’s death</a>, is an altogether weightier piece of work. On the surface, it is a breezy compendium of reminiscences, a ragtag collection of stories from the 1960s and 70s, long before the debut production of Jitney in 1982, followed by Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and Fences, put him on the theatrical map. Back then, as these anecdotes attest, he was variously a high school dropout, an autodidact, a grass cutter, a dish washer and a poet.</p> <p>But although the tone might be easygoing and nostalgic, the play has a steely sense of purpose. It is to demonstrate the pervasiveness of racist thinking, a thinking so insidious it even found its way into dictionary definitions of black and white. “I don’t see colour,” a well-meaning white man tells Wilson, who naturally asks why he made this observation to the only black man in the room.</p> <p>The stories from Pittsburgh’s Hill District have a similarly everyday quality. There is the toy shop owner who suspects him of stealing before he has even begun work; the woman who refuses to let him mow her lawn (and the boss who acquiesces); and the bank teller who claims she cannot give him an envelope for his money. “It’s not a little thing,” he says, as the evidence mounts of a society polluted by an inhumane ideology. “It’s about respect.”</p> <p>If it seems an odd idea for an actor to perform someone else’s memoir, Lester Purry never makes it seem so. It was watching Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom at Minnesota’s <a href=\"https://penumbratheatre.org/\">Penumbra</a>, the theatre that championed Wilson’s work, that made Purry want to join the company. He brings to his rich and resonant performance an easy authority that makes the storytelling as compelling as it is polemical. </p> <ul> <li><p>August Wilson’s How I Learned What I Learned is at <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/august-wilson-s-how-i-learned-what-i-learned\">Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh</a>, until 28 August.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2022\">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a>.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/22/the-people-making-a-difference-the-man-who-set-up-a-mental-health-walking-group-for-blokes","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T11:00:31Z","webTitle":"The people making a difference: the man who set up a mental health walking group for ‘blokes’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/22/the-people-making-a-difference-the-man-who-set-up-a-mental-health-walking-group-for-blokes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/aug/22/the-people-making-a-difference-the-man-who-set-up-a-mental-health-walking-group-for-blokes","fields":{"headline":"The people making a difference: the man who set up a mental health walking group for ‘blokes’","trailText":"After bottling up his own anxieties for a decade, Scott Oughton-Johnson created a group for other men who’ve felt the same. Now it’s his turn to be treated","byline":"Sirin Kale","body":"<p>Scott Oughton-Johnson simply did not talk about his feelings. Not when he separated from the mother of his children a decade ago, and not during their subsequent custody battle.</p> <p>“I was in and out of court for the best part of 10 years,” says the 35-year-old community sports coach from south London. “It was a nightmare. I bottled it all up. People would say, ‘I don’t know how you do it.’ But inside, it was terrible. The stress and anxiety were killing me.”</p> <p>In 2017, it all got to be too much. Oughton-Johnson went to his GP and received cognitive behaviour therapy on the NHS. “But they can only offer a limited amount of sessions,” he says, “and then you’re back in the wild. I needed to find something to maintain that feeling I had after a counselling session. And one thing I enjoyed was walking.”</p> <p>Three years later, in September 2020, Oughton-Johnson thought about trying to “set something up to reach other lads who might feel how I feel”. He created a public <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theproperblokesclub/\" title=\"\">Facebook page</a> and uploaded a video of himself talking about his mental health.<strong> </strong>He announced plans for a walk and asked men who’d like some companionship to join him. “I hoped it would help other people out,” he says. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Each day we do a check-in on the group and say, ‘Good morning. Hope everyone is all right. Have a good day’ </p> <footer> <cite>Scott Oughton Johnson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Just one lad – Oughton-Johnson always calls them lads, not boys or men – turned up. “I was disheartened at first,” he says. “I thought hundreds might turn up. But we were together for eight hours that night. We had so much to chat about.” The next week, two more lads turned up. “It kept growing and growing,” he says. He thought it would be selfish to restrict the initiative to his immediate area, so he recruited “walk leaders” to arrange walks in neighbouring boroughs. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theproperblokesclub/groups/?ref=page_internal\" title=\"\">Proper Blokes Club</a> was born.</p> <p>Walks take place every day Monday to Thursday. Anywhere from five to 35 men might turn up. “As long as two lads turn up,” he says, “the walk still happens.” They try to journey through parkland or down a canal. “So that people can be in the moment,” he says, “and practise mindfulness.” The walks last between an hour and two hours. “People can peel off when they want,” he says. “They don’t have to stay until the end.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ce2662c18dece6f4fa7fae8851d5090e182cf6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ce2662c18dece6f4fa7fae8851d5090e182cf6d/0_0_1600_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott during his trip to Paris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott on his trip to Paris</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All walkers are added to a WhatsApp group. “Each day we do a check-in,” says Oughton-Johnson, “and say, ‘Good morning. Hope everyone is all right. Have a good day.’ We’ve had incidents where people say, ‘I’m not in a great place; is anyone about?’ And people have gone and met them, or called them up.”</p> <p>The club is a space for men to “have a safe environment to talk about things”, he says, “without the potential judgment you might get from friends and family”. It’s much needed: the male suicide rate in the UK is <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/research-policy/suicide-facts-and-figures/latest-suicide-data/\" title=\"\">more than triple</a> the rate for women. “How many of those might have been stopped through a conversation?” says Oughton-Johnson.</p> <p>“He’s helped so many people in such a short space of time,” says his nominator, Nikki Spencer, who came across the <a href=\"https://theproperblokesclub.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Proper Blokes Club</a> after seeing a poster in her GP surgery. “It’s not just the men themselves: having this outlet makes a difference to their families, too.”</p> <p>The youngest member of The Proper Blokes Club is 19; the oldest is 75. Inevitably, friendships are formed. “People have gone to each other’s weddings and birthdays,” says Oughton-Johnson. “Sometimes I take a step back, and think, this group of lads never knew each other a few months ago, and they’ve found lifelong friends out of it. It’s amazing.” </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/01/claire-moruzzi-adult-adoptees-community-how-to-be-adopted\">The people making a difference: the woman who created a community for fellow adoptees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oughton-Johnson’s ultimate goal is to register the Proper Blokes Club as a community interest company, and roll it out across all London boroughs, then nationally. “I get lots of messages from people saying they want one in their area,” he says, “but logistically, I can’t do that at the moment. So I encourage them to start their own groups. Some women’s groups, and groups around the country, have started walking groups<strong> </strong>off the back of it.”</p> <p>When asked about his treat, Oughton-Johnson suggests a perambulation a little further afield: to Paris. He’s been there once before, and fell in love with the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.\">  <iframe id=\"inside-saturday\" name=\"inside-saturday\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--inside-saturday\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind the scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features, as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en\" title=\"\">Eurostar</a> offers a day trip, and Oughton-Johnson and his girlfriend Sophie set out in early August to experience the city of love. “Getting into the centre of Paris on a train was amazing,” he says. They went on an open-bus tour, and a riverboat cruise before having a few drinks. “The weather was beautiful,” he says. “It’s such a lovely city. It was an amazing experience.” They took a train back to London that evening, but not before a quick detour to try some of France’s famous cuisine – at Burger King. “I’m funny with food,” Oughton-Johnson says. <em>Zut alors!</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/ng-interactive/2022/aug/22/little-warrior-the-boxer-breaking-away-from-venezuelan-poverty-documentary","type":"interactive","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T11:00:31Z","webTitle":"Little Warrior: the boxer breaking away from Venezuelan poverty – documentary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2022/aug/22/little-warrior-the-boxer-breaking-away-from-venezuelan-poverty-documentary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/ng-interactive/2022/aug/22/little-warrior-the-boxer-breaking-away-from-venezuelan-poverty-documentary","fields":{"headline":"Little Warrior: the boxer breaking away from Venezuelan poverty – documentary","trailText":"Johana Gómez, a 10-time and reigning amateur featherweight boxing champion, is determined to pull herself and her family out of extreme poverty in Venezuela.

The 34-year-old Werder Bremen manager is the Bundesliga’s youngest head coach but anyone would have celebrated as wildly on the pitch after this tumultuous ending at Signal Iduna Park, which left Borussia Dortmund stunned.</p> \n<p>“I have no idea what happened there,” said their shocked captain, Marco Reus, who has seen a lot of improbable twists in his decade at the club.</p> \n<p>This was without precedent in the Bundesliga’s history. Dortmund led 2-0 in the 89th minute and heading for a third win out of three in the nascent league season – albeit with efficiency rather than any particular style. Then came the drama, with such an east Midlands hue it could have been directed by Shane Meadows – Once Upon a Time in Westfalen, if you will. First, Lee Buchanan (born in Mansfield and who left Derby for Werder in the summer) smacked a delicious left-foot volley into the top corner, which looked like a pretty but scant consolation for considerable Bremen efforts.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/20/european-roundup-werder-bremen-late-show-leaves-dortmund-rocked\">European roundup: Werder Bremen’s late show leaves Dortmund rocked</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Werner’s relentlessly positive promoted side had different ideas. In the third minute of stoppage time, Niklas Schmidt stooped to head an equaliser, feverishly received by the travelling staff and fans.</p> \n<p>There was more. Oliver Burke – born in Kirkcaldy but brought up in Melton Mowbray, a former Nottingham Forest prodigy who also arrived this summer – was played into the inside-right channel by Mitchell Weiser and rifled in an angled shot in front of the Yellow Wall to bring the house down.</p> \n<p>After last week’s late, late goal via the same combination to salvage a point against Stuttgart, Burke’s second in two games went one better. Werder had completed a comeback later than any managed before in the Bundesliga from that position. After all the discussion of a move to five substitutes favouring the big boys, three replacements had scored to make history and create a shock that will be difficult to surpass this season.</p> \n<p>It was delirium for Werner’s team. Outside the away end after full-time a group of travelling fans celebrated with a bagpiper, fittingly after the decisive contribution by the Scotland international Burke. For Dortmund? Desolation. If this was a mugging in terms of timing, Werder hadn’t stolen their win.</p> \n<p>“We’re talking about a deserved defeat,” said Edin Terzic, while calling the manner of conceding three late goals “completely stupid,” with visible irritation. “We can’t lose a game like this,” the sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, told Bild TV. “The team know they’re responsible.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2adcad2dac92381a0f5e34ab8619e6c62ac349bd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2adcad2dac92381a0f5e34ab8619e6c62ac349bd/0_32_4215_2668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oliver Burke celebrates his late winner in front of the Yellow Wall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oliver Burke celebrates his late winner in front of the Yellow Wall.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christof Köpsel/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And they did. “We didn’t play well throughout the game,” said Reus, complaining that his side “can’t keep the ball for 20 seconds”. Werner said he would have considered the game as a missed opportunity had Werder fallen to defeat.</p> \n<p>Dortmund’s results this season had thinly masked a certain malleability, but this was a step backwards. “The results and commitment [had been] right,” wrote Ruhr Nachrichten’s Jürgen Koers, “even if the team was far from exhausting its footballing potential.”</p> \n<p>This was like pulling teeth. A 2-0 lead had flattered BVB. Gregor Kobel (again) saved them more than once in goal and they didn’t get a shot on target from inside the penalty area until the 90th minute, when the substitute Youssoufa Moukoko called Jiri Pavlenka into action shortly after Buchanan’s strike.</p> \n<p>The defensive side of things will bear greater analysis. Marius Wolf and Raphaël Guerreiro are good footballers but few people’s idea of secure full-backs – Wolf is really a winger, while Thomas Tuchel and Lucien Favre saw Guerreiro as a midfielder. The Portuguese’s value going forward was underlined by the second goal on Saturday, which should have clinched it, a skidding shot under Pavlenka.</p> \n<p>Werder’s late goals underlined BVB’s vulnerability in wide areas so acutely that they could have been part of a health and safety video provided for the returning Terzic. Dortmund are pleased to have him back, but the honeymoon is over. He has a job on his hands to break flaky old habits and he “needs to weigh up who he can trust,” as Koers put it.</p> \n<p>Frank Baumann, the Werder sporting director who has had to repel his share of criticism over the past six years, cut an unusually happy figure on Sport 1’s Doppelpass on Sunday morning and didn’t spare Werner any of the credit, saying the coach “fits us like a glove.”</p> \n<p>They are still a long way off challenging at the top, as they did in Baumann’s days as a player, but on this evidence, so are Dortmund.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a41aaf0-b80e-4a9a-8032-332a3e2f62e5\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Friday: </b>Mönchengladbach 1-0 Hertha Berlin.&nbsp;<b>Saturday: </b>Augsburg 1-2 Mainz, Dortmund 2-3 Werder Bremen, Leverkusen 0-3 Hoffenheim, Stuttgart 0-1 Freiburg, Wolfsburg 0-0 Schalke.&nbsp;<b>Sunday:</b> Bochum 0-7 Bayern Munich, Eintracht Frankfurt 1-1 Cologne.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>• Bayern were back at Bochum, the scene of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/14/bundesliga-bochum-down-bayern-munich-in-game-of-century-contender\">last season’s greatest humbling</a>. There were few hints of that this time, though you could argue the home side being less scared of the champions than the rest of the league meant they kept pushing even when behind, leaving themselves fatally open. Julian Nagelsmann’s side cruised to a 4-0 half-time lead and an eventual 7-0 win. Leroy Sané made a first start of the season and struck an excellent opener in an impressive display. “If he’s 100% up for it, then he’s one of the best players in Europe,” his coach said. Cristian Gamboa, scorer of an absolute screamer in February’s 4-2 win for Bochum, had a nightmare here. He was implicated in two of Bayern’s first-half goals and poked the sixth past his own goalkeeper, Manuel Riemann, who also had a day to forget.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c625f42989e9cb08bcfdeefc04e25b620310dac\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c625f42989e9cb08bcfdeefc04e25b620310dac/0_42_2486_1492/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leroy Sané and Sadio Mané celebrate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leroy Sané and Sadio Mané were on the scoresheet in Bochum.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thilo Schmülgen/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>• Leipzig stumbled again and are still searching for a maiden win of the campaign after defeat at Union Berlin. Timo Werner complained (with some justification) that he should have got an early penalty from an errant Christopher Trimmel challenge. That said, Union were more bright and decisive afterwards, with the perfectly matched Jordan Siebatcheu and Sheraldo Becker again hitting it off and both scoring. So Union extended a) their hex over RB and b) their club record Bundesliga unbeaten run to 10 games, stretching from last season. Werner warned that Leipzig “urgently need to win a game or it could get pretty dark,” while the atmosphere at the fan open day on Sunday was subdued to say the least.</p> \n<p>• Then we get to Leverkusen. Flagged by many as a possible Bayern <em>dauphin</em> before the start of the season, they are pointless with a single goal to their name after their third defeat, a comprehensive 3-0 home loss to Hoffenheim. Gerardo Seoane’s side could claim a degree of bad luck in the previous reverses and even here Sardar Azmoun managed to inadvertently clear teammate Patrik Schick’s goalbound shot off the line. They were well beaten by André Breitenreiter’s stylish side, with Christoph Baumgartner backheeling an opener, Ozan Kabak going on a barnstorming run to set up Andrej Kramarić and youngster Georginio Rutter applying the <em>coup de grâce</em> with a rocket from range. “The squad [from last season] more or less stayed together,” said the Bayer managing director, Simon Rolfes, “so we have to remember what made us so strong.” It makes the current level of disarray even more concerning for Seoane.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

legal threat over article","byline":"Ben Doherty","body":"<p>A small independent news website in Australia is taking on the Murdoch empire, buying a full-page ad in the New York Times inviting Lachlan Murdoch to sue them over an alleged defamation.</p> <p>In dispute is an apparent opinion piece, and associated social media posts, published by Crikey.com.au in June headlined: “Trump is a confirmed unhinged traitor. And Murdoch is his unindicted co-conspirator” – analysing the 6 January insurrection by supporters of defeated presidential candidate Donald Trump. In legal letters published by Crikey, lawyers for Lachlan Murdoch argue the publications contain “scandalous allegations of criminal conduct and conspiracy” and carry a number of “highly defamatory and false imputations about him”.</p> <p>Written by Crikey’s politics editor, Bernard Keane, the 29 June piece mentions the Murdoch name twice: in the headline and in the closing paragraphs.</p> <p>The article is largely concerned with the evidence of former White House staffer Cassidy Hutchinson to the US House select committee on the January 6 attack. Hutchinson did not mention Murdoch in her testimony.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/19/australians-buried-lede-on-morrison-begs-the-question-who-knew-what-when\">The Australian’s buried scoop on Morrison raises the question: who knew what, when? | Weekly Beast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having discussed Trump’s continued peddling of the “big lie” that he won the 2020 US presidential election – he lost 306 electoral college votes to 232, and the popular ballot by 7m votes – Keane argues “the world’s most powerful media company” continues “to peddle the lie of the stolen election and play down the insurrection Trump created”.</p> <p>Keane argued former US president Richard Nixon was infamously the “unindicted co-conspirator” in the Watergate scandal and drew an analogy that “the Murdochs and their slew of poisonous Fox News commentators are the unindicted co-conspirators” in the events of 6 January.</p> <p>The piece does not name Lachlan Murdoch individually.</p> <p>In the letters sent to Crikey, and published by the independent news site Monday afternoon, lawyers for Lachlan Murdoch, patriarch Rupert’s eldest son and chief executive of Fox Corporation, argued he was personally identifiable by the article and he was defamed. They allege the publication of the article was “malicious” and “manifestly indefensible”.</p> <p>“The imputations are false and are calculated to harm Mr Murdoch, both personally and professionally, and should not have been published,” an initial notice of concern said.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul> <p>Among 14 imputations the article is alleged to carry are: “Mr Murdoch: illegally conspired with Donald Trump to overturn the 2020 presidential election result; … illegally conspired with Donald Trump to incite a mob with murderous intent to march on the Capitol; … was a co-conspirator in a plot with Donald Trump to overturn the 2020 election result which costs people their lives; has conspired with Donald Trump to commit the offence of treason against the United States of America to overturn the 2020 election outcome; … should be indicted with the offence of being a traitor to the United States …”</p> <p>A further nine imputations are alleged to have been made through a Facebook post and a tweet.</p> <p>Through its lawyers, Crikey responded that the article does not mention Lachlan Murdoch at all and that the threatened defamation action “is bound to fail”.</p> <p>“There can be no credible argument that the article conveys … for example, that your client was engaged in a conspiracy to incite a mob with murderous intent, or that he was aware of how heavily armed the attendees would be at the insurrection,” Crikey said. “Any such imputation relies on a thoroughly strained and contorted interpretation of the words of the article.”</p> <p>In response to the initial complaint, Crikey initially agreed to remove the piece from its website and deleted a related tweet and Facebook post – but after failing to reach agreement has since reinstated the piece live.</p> <p>In extensive legal correspondence, published by Crikey, the news website refused to apologise but offered to not republish the original article, pay Murdoch’s reasonable legal fees and publish an “editorial statement” clarifying its position and arguing the article did not convey the imputations alleged by Murdoch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/13/judith-neilson-institute-dismisses-remaining-members-of-advisory-board-after-earlier-director-walkout\">Judith Neilson Institute dismisses remaining members of advisory board after earlier director walkout</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The proposed statement repeated the contested paragraphs regarding the Murdoch family and detailed the full list of defamatory imputations claimed by Murdoch. The proposed statement said that Crikey does not agree that the original article makes the imputations alleged: “There is no evidence that Mr Murdoch did any of the things described above. Crikey does not say that [Murdoch] did any of them.”</p> <p>“Crikey does believe that Mr Murdoch bears some responsibility for the events of January 6 because of the actions of Fox News, the network he leads. However, Crikey does not believe that he was actively involved in the events of that day as the things described above would suggest.”</p> <p>The offer to publish the editorial statement was rejected by lawyers for Murdoch.</p> <p>“It must be obvious … that the reference to Mr Murdoch in the article was unfair and should not have occurred. An available inference is that Crikey persists in seeking to increase its readership by making unfounded ‘headline’ allegations about my client,” the lawyers said. “This inference is open given the previous false articles that have appeared on the Crikey website about Mr Murdoch and the senselessness of the inclusion of his name in the article.”</p> <p>Crikey’s open letter, published as an ad in the New York Times and the Canberra Times, said “we at Crikey strongly support freedom of opinion and public interest journalism”.</p> <p>“We want to defend those allegations in court. You have made it clear in your lawyer’s letters you intend to take court action to resolve this alleged defamation.</p> <p>“We await your writ so that we can test this important issue of freedom of public interest journalism in a courtroom.”</p> <p>One of Crikey’s legal letters cited Murdoch’s own words in his 2014 Keith Murdoch Oration (Keith Murdoch was his grandfather), when he argued “a free media must be dependent on no one for favours” and that censorship in any form “erodes our freedom to know, to be informed, and to make reasoned decisions in our society and in our democracy”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/22/australian-made-childrens-tv-all-but-gone-on-commercial-free-to-air-networks\">Australian-made children’s TV all but gone from commercial free-to-air networks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Crikey’s editor-in-chief, Peter Fray, told the Guardian his organisation stood by Keane’s reporting and that defamation laws were being used in Australia to silence the media and stifle legitimate and vital debate.</p> <p>“We need to ask: what is going on here?” Fray said. “What’s going on is these laws are being used to stop a legitimate piece of news analysis linking the actions of Fox with what happened in Washington DC on January 6, that’s what’s going on.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Murdoch declined to comment.</p> <p>In letters published by Crikey, lawyers for Murdoch rejected Crikey’s claims that the piece was in the public interest saying “the article was not ‘a legitimate exercise of press freedom and freedom of speech’ about a matter of ‘critical public importance’. Given it was removed within about 40 minutes of the provision of the concerns notice, we infer that Crikey fully comprehends this. In fact, it was an example of Crikey reporting on a topic (the evidence about Trump in the house select committee) and seeking to draw Mr Murdoch into the quagmire of allegations about the former President and impugn him by association”.</p> <p>They go on to say that Murdoch “is not seeking to dictate stories” and “has only raised complaints when the falsities are egregious. Nor has he been unreasonable or intimidatory”.</p> <p>The letter said Murdoch “does wish to resolve the matter with Crikey as he has successfully done so in the past … the only issue between the parties is the provision of a genuine apology”.</p> <p>Crikey and the Murdochs have form.</p> <p>In April last year, Crikey withdrew an article written by the site’s founder, Stephen Mayne, which made a series of claims about Lachlan Murdoch’s time on the board of Channel Ten.

Plumes of smoke were seen rising after the incident on Saturday morning, which the Russian-appointed governor of the city, Mikhail Razvozhaev, said came after a drone flew over the sensitive military site.</p> \n<p>In narrow military terms the attack is not significant. Razvozhaev said it involved a single drone. <a href=\"https://t.me/s/chp_sevastopol/5781\">Footage from a local Telegram channel</a> appears to back that up. But a key question is how a drone was able to evade Russian electronic warfare defences and fly right over the naval base.</p> \n<p>What sounds like small arms fire, not air defence systems, can be heard on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1560891121080885248?s=20&amp;t=8OCNF_W4dELfpFWOkSefFw\">some of the videos</a> and the drone may have been shot down before delivering a payload. Razvozhaev said initially the drone had not been hit, before saying it was. At the very least, though, it is embarrassing for Russia, which is struggling to show it can defend what it considers its own back yard.</p> \n<p>Experts such as Justin Bronk from the Royal United Services Institute thinktank suggest the drone in the film could have been a commercially available Chinese-made model, <a href=\"https://www.muginuav.com/product/mugin-5-pro-5000mm-carbon-fiber-uav-platform/\">the $9,500 (£8,030) Mugin-5</a>, or a copy of it. It has a flying time of up to seven hours, the manufacturers say, and a top speed of 150 km/h (95mph) and could have been adapted to carry an improvised warhead. The payload, the manufacturers say, is 15 to 20 kilograms.</p> \n<p>The drone may also have been simply engaged in reconnaissance, although the growing evidence of a pattern of drone strikes deep behind the frontline in Crimea and elsewhere suggests something different. Russia said the same naval base was hit by a drone strike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/31/russia-claims-ukraine-drone-attack-black-sea-fleet-headquarters\">at the end of July</a>, wounding five people, making the fact that defences were not tightened all the more remarkable.</p> \n<p>A video, originally <a href=\"https://t.me/s/milinfolive/85566\">from a Russian military blogger</a>, showed a similar-looking aircraft being used in a kamikaze strike on an oil refinery at Novoshakhtinsk, inside Russian territory near Rostov, just across the border from occupied Donetsk. The similarity is unlikely to be a coincidence.</p> \n<p>Ukraine continues to decline to take formal responsibility for such attacks, though it does do so sometimes in private. In public the country’s leaders prefer to make knowing comments that are not always subtle. Take Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s statement overnight: “This year, one can literally feel in the air of Crimea that the occupation there is temporary, and Ukraine is returning.”</p> \n<p>The suggestion is that Ukraine has evolved a new method of attack, aimed at sowing “chaos within Russian forces”, as the key Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/16/creating-chaos-zelenskiys-adviser-outlines-ukraines-military-strategy\">told the Guardian</a> last week. Some experts believe drones operated by special forces were responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/russian-warplanes-destroyed-in-crimea-saky-airbase-attack-satellite-images-show\">dramatic attack on the Saky airbase</a>, where about nine combat planes that supported Russia’s Black Sea fleet were destroyed.</p> \n<p>In any event, such drone strikes will have a practical effect. The Institute for the Study of War said “Russian occupation officials in Crimea are likely considering strengthening security on the peninsula” and that “such measures may draw Russian security forces away from the frontlines”.</p> \n<p>But the critical point is the psychological impact. Repeatedly captured on video, they demonstrate that Crimea and similar behind-the-lines locations are not safe, bringing the conflict closer to Russia and the occupied territories, while at the same time being focused (at least so far) on military and industrial targets.</p> \n<p>A string of social media videos show traffic jams on roads out of the Crimean peninsula, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cyx_5/status/1560983789546995712\">at least one released on Saturday</a>, suggesting Russians who moved into the territory after it was occupied and annexed in 2014 no longer consider it safe. Others <a href=\"https://t.me/s/uniannet/69064\">show traffic jams</a> out of Sevastopol to Yalta.</p> \n<p>If that is the effect of a handful of drone strikes, Ukraine will consider the effort justified. No wonder Razvozhaev told Russians in Sevastopol that it was time to fight the propaganda war better as he appealed for everyone to remain calm because the local air defence system was now working. “Upload videos with the work of our air defence systems,” he said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/22/first-thing-cheney-turns-on-pro-trump-republicans-after-defeat","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T10:07:25Z","webTitle":"First Thing: Cheney turns on pro-Trump Republicans after defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/22/first-thing-cheney-turns-on-pro-trump-republicans-after-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/22/first-thing-cheney-turns-on-pro-trump-republicans-after-defeat","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Cheney turns on pro-Trump Republicans after defeat","trailText":"Outgoing congresswoman Liz Cheney takes aim at election result deniers within GOP.

days a week from September, including Tuesdays, Thursdays and a third day to be determined by individual teams.</p> <p>The plan is looser than previous proposals that would have forced staff to return every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, with Cook saying it would “enhance” the company’s ability to work flexibly, “while preserving the in-person collaboration that is so essential to our culture”.</p> <p><strong>Would remote work improve greater flexibility and thus promote diversity?</strong> That is the contention of the group of workers, Apple Together, who have circulated the petition pushing back against Cook’s orders: “We believe that Apple should encourage, not prohibit, flexible work to build a more diverse and successful company where we can feel comfortable to ‘think different’

Platforms such as TikTok and Twitter have also served as digital spaces to educate and empower young people.

Throughout his 20s he had been the main carer for his father, who also had bipolar, and seen the challenges first-hand. “The treatment at the time was primitive and his illness destroyed my parents’ marriage. I grew up with the idea that people with bipolar couldn’t live with anyone else,” he says. So he channelled his energy into work, becoming a freelance writer and a founding trustee of the charity Bipolar UK.</p> <p>In October 2005, he was helping out at one of its conferences when he spotted Suzy, a speaker he had invited. “I’d been diagnosed with bipolar when I was 20 and spent a decade in and out of psychiatric hospitals,” she says. “Unlike many other people I knew, I’d received very good care, so I’d decided to write a book about my experiences to show how much the care and kindness from nurses had helped me.”</p> <p>Suzy had expected there to be an audience of 30 people at the conference. “When I saw 300, I nearly ran out,” she says. “From nowhere, Michel appeared and asked if I was OK. My hands were shaking so much he took the mic and offered to hold it for me while I spoke.” </p> <p>Michel stayed with her and offered quiet encouragement. “He kept telling me how well I was doing. It was a friend from nowhere when I really needed someone,” says Suzy. Afterwards, they chatted before going their separate ways. Michel was living near London at the time, while Suzy lived in Helensburgh, Scotland.</p> <p>A few months later, she saw an editorial Michel had written in Bipolar UK’s quarterly magazine about learning to live a comfortable single life. “Reading between the lines, I sensed he wasn’t in a good place,” she says. Remembering his act of kindness at the conference, she emailed him to check in. Michel, who was struggling with depression, wrote straight back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1174425242bb1291fc13cb996379ec6466a5cee1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1174425242bb1291fc13cb996379ec6466a5cee1/0_68_1620_2025/800.jpg\" alt=\"Michel and Suzy’s wedding in St Andrews in 2009.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michel and Suzy’s wedding in St Andrews in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before long they were chatting constantly, sharing more than 20 emails a day. “It got to the point where we were having these 2am email picnics,” he says. They discovered they had shared values, as well as the same sense of humour and interests. “We enjoyed talking about philosophy as much as we liked silly jokes,” says Suzy.</p> <p>In July 2006, they arranged to meet. “I knew I could see myself being with Suzy,” says Michel. “We just needed to see if there was chemistry.” They met at Glasgow Central station – sparks flew the second they saw each other. “He planted this huge snog on me,” says Suzy. “It blew my mind. We just stood there like idiots holding hands for a few minutes thinking, ‘This is it.’”</p> <p>During dinner that night, Michel proposed and Suzy immediately said yes. “It was the best and easiest decision of both of our lives,” she says.</p> <p>For a few months, they had a long-distance relationship. Then Michel took the plunge and moved to Helensburgh. “I was caring for my mother at the time and she came with me,” he says. Sadly, she was diagnosed with terminal oesophageal cancer soon after the move.</p> <p>Despite their newfound love, 2008 was a “difficult year” for both of them. “I got Hepatitis A, which had a knock-on effect on my illness and I was back in psychiatric hospital for six months,” says Suzy. Meanwhile, Michel suffered depression. “I don’t think we would have made it through without each other,” says Suzy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/15/how-we-met-ben-told-me-he-now-identified-as-a-trans-man-i-had-been-waiting-for-it-to-happen\">How we met: ‘Ben told me he now identified as a trans man.

It’s silly and fun.”</p> <p>The pandemic brought them closer, as they were able to spend every day together. “We don’t even go on holidays because we just enjoy each other’s company anywhere,” says Michel. “When we married, I was already at a point where I’d proven myself in my career.

I became really emotional,” he says. Like many men, he found it difficult to speak about what he was going through. In the years since, he has come to understand the “societal and cultural norms which contribute to dads feeling pressure to deal with everything by themselves and not talk about the challenges they are going through”.</p> <p>“I think part of it was imagining an older child, rather than a baby,” another dad, Tom Spencer, tells me, reflecting on his experience of postnatal depression (his daughter is now four). “There were struggles around breastfeeding. It was really hot that summer. The lack of sleep. Maybe something about the permanence of being a parent? I just felt sad a lot. I remember my partner and me commenting on a day that neither of us cried. I remember putting her in a sling for the first time and being terrified that she had stopped breathing and I’d killed her.”</p> <p>Dark thoughts began to enter Spencer’s mind, followed by guilt. “I never thought about harming our daughter, but I remember thinking that I might be better able to deal with the grief of her death than the responsibility of keeping her alive and trying to support my partner,” he says.</p> <p>One in 10 men experience anxiety and depression symptoms in the first six months after the birth of a baby, and one in five will experience a mental health problem during pregnancy and the first year after birth. The biggest killer of men under 50 in the UK is suicide – studies have shown that fathers with mental health problems during the perinatal period are up to 47 times more likely to be classed as a suicide risk than at any other time in their lives. Yet we hear so little about the impact that pregnancy and birth can have on dads, particularly when they have a history of mental health problems. I’ve heard women say privately they are concerned about how their partners are coping in the postnatal period, but that the possibility of paternal mental health problems was never mentioned in NCT classes or during engagement with maternity services.</p> <p>The idea of the strong and silent paternal figure who provides for his family still holds a lot of sway. “Firstly there was just the shock of responsibility, something I’ve successfully steered clear of for most of my life,” says Tom Huddleston, a journalist and author who struggled with depression after the birth of his son. “Secondly, it was just really hard – no one tells you that, or if they do, you don’t listen. But as you know, it’s just utterly relentless, and the emotional toll is huge. You think – well, this is it now, for 18 years, and however much friends tell you it gets easier, you again don’t listen.”</p> <p>The pressure on<strong> </strong>men “to provide unyielding, unidirectional, rock-like support for their partner” is compounded by the feeling that the emotions men are experiencing are not legitimate, according to the sociologists Paul Hodkinson and Ranjana Das, whose book New Fathers, Mental Health and Digital Communication is based on interviews with new dads who have experienced mental health problems. These feelings – that their emotions are invalid – mean that they often don’t reach out for help until things have reached crisis point. Throughout the pregnancy and birth process they are framed as being peripheral.</p> <p>According to Adrienne Burgess, the head of research and joint CEO at the Fatherhood Institute, their recent evidence review, <a href=\"http://www.fatherhoodinstitute.org/2022/bringing-baby-home/\">Bringing Baby Home</a>, revealed a “dad-shaped hole” in perinatal NHS services. “They’re not being engaged, let alone assessed or referred for support at this crucial time – even though their impacts on mothers’ and babies’ health and wellbeing are well-evidenced, significant and wide-ranging, as well as being important in their own right as the child’s other parent,” she says. “We need a paradigm shift in how the NHS thinks about fathers and other non-birthing parents; services should be redesigned to ensure routine, systematic engagement from the first antenatal appointment onwards.”</p> <p>Peer support is also important. “I tried talking to a friend about it once, while on a car journey, and he asked me to talk to someone else,” says Tom Spencer, who didn’t feel able to confide in his partner or parents. “I never really asked for help … I like to think I’m not too caught up in trying to be masculine and strong, but once I was in that mind space I didn’t feel able to talk about it.”</p> <p>“Often, male friendships can be surface level, or ‘shoulder to shoulder’,” Rae points out. Men, he says, need face to face relationships, especially when their social circles get smaller as they age. “More social and community groups where men can talk about fatherhood and mental health are really important.”</p> <p>Huddleston was lucky that his sister is a GP and was able to advise him about postnatal depression in men; his own doctor prescribed him antidepressants, and he gained confidence as a father by taking responsibility for bedtime, which had become a source of anxiety. Spencer shifted his work-life balance and went freelance to spend more time with his daughter.</p> <p>Rae, meanwhile, set up the platform <a href=\"https://musicfootballfatherhood.com/\">Music Football Fatherhood</a> for new dads, has edited a book, DAD: Untold stories of Fatherhood, Love, Mental Health and Masculinity, and works with NHS trusts to better support fathers during pregnancy and postnatally, as well as running a number of support events.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/09/single-parents-pressures-stigma-children\">I see you, single parents.

But is it down to long Covid? The months of isolation during lockdown? Or just poor public hygiene?","byline":"Lizzie Cernik","body":"<p>It might be one of the hottest summers on record, but the warm weather hasn’t stopped Lorraine Davies, 35, and her family from catching every virus going. “Since spring it feels like our whole family has been constantly unwell,” she says. “I have had at least four viruses in the past few months. As a busy mum, I’ve just had to try to carry on. There have been days where I’ve put the children to bed and then just fallen asleep because I’m so knackered.”</p> <p>It’s not the first time they have been hit with a wave of summer viruses since the pandemic began. Last year, her youngest child ended up in A&amp;E with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a cold-like bug that can cause severe illness in babies. “This summer we’ve all had colds, coughs, stomach bugs, as well as Covid. I don’t think we’ve ever been to the doctor this much.”</p> <p>The illnesses began when the older children returned to school after the Easter holidays and her youngest went back to her childminder. Davies runs a freelance coaching business part-time and the disruption has had a major impact on her work. The constant illnesses have also stopped the family enjoying hobbies and socialising. “I have friends and family who have gone through cancer treatment or are immunocompromised. You just don’t want to take any germs to people who might be vulnerable, so that’s a constant worry.”</p> <p>Davies isn’t the only one facing these challenges. Across the UK, GP surgeries and hospitals are seeing an influx of patients with typical winter ailments, including coughs, colds, croup, stomach bugs and chickenpox. <a href=\"https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/hana-patel\">Dr Hana Patel</a>, a London-based GP and mental health coach who works in the NHS and private practice, says younger children are particularly affected. “During lockdown we came into contact with fewer germs and, as a result, immune systems have not had a chance to develop in some children,” she says. “This is the first summer where people are reverting to normal routines and really mixing again. Children who go to nursery tend to pick up a lot of bugs in their first year, especially in winter. Due to the lockdowns, we are seeing that at a different time of year.”</p> <p>Dr Patel is also continuing to see large numbers of Covid cases, which can be hard to distinguish from other respiratory viruses. New variants, she says, are “causing slightly different symptoms and people are getting it over and over again”.</p> <p>Zeinab Ardeshir, the founder of the online pharmacy home delivery service PillSorted, has noticed that people are getting more colds and taking longer to recover. “I’m seeing far more acute prescriptions coming through than we normally do at this time of year,” she says. The majority are for steroid inhalers, which can help people to manage symptoms such as coughs and breathing issues, and antibiotics for those who develop a secondary infection. “We’ve had more than 20 families over the past few weeks with complaints about headaches, sore throats, coughs and fevers that are not clearing up as quickly as a virus would usually clear. They are testing negative for Covid yet continue to be unwell.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d75fe6a83afbb4e36cb4f5eee1404813070de83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d75fe6a83afbb4e36cb4f5eee1404813070de83/0_0_7380_5231/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Hand-washing is important for the prevention of norovirus,’ says Cheshire GP Chris Ritchieson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Hand-washing is important for the prevention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/16/norovirus-warning-bug-spreads-england-lockdown-eased\">norovirus</a>,’ says Cheshire GP Chris Ritchieson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Images By Tang Ming Tung/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>George Icke, 19, a student in Salford, has had a summer cold for the past month. “It got debilitating because everything was so exhausting. I was struggling to work and do normal day-to-day activities – even cleaning became impossible.” When he lost his voice, he had to call in sick to his freelance job as a radio presenter, which meant lost income. “The amount of sickness has definitely been affecting the businesses I’ve been working for. Lots of people are taking time off.” He worries that the problem will worsen when he returns to university and everyone gets “freshers’ flu”. “It’s always bad, but this time people are going to arrive sick.”</p> <p>According to Dr Maroof Harghandiwal, a functional medical specialist and Covid expert with Zen Healthcare, human immune systems are at their best when they have constant exposure to stimuli. “Most of us went a year without coming into contact with any common bacteria and viruses.” Now when we encounter these bugs, he says, “it may take a little longer” for our immune systems to kick in. “Therefore infection is lasting longer. People’s immune systems have also been affected by anxiety and stress.”</p> <p>For Suzanne Samaka, 34, “never-ending” bugs have affected her family for months. “I’ve been getting everything, including heavy colds. It feels like the second I get rid of something, I get something else,” she says. Despite being on maternity leave from her banking job and avoiding her usual public transport route, she has experienced a considerable rise in viral infections compared with previous summers. She attributes it partly to not having had a chance to recover. “It’s been a really exhausting time,” she says. “When I am poorly I still have to look after the children. Because of Covid, a lot of plans and events were put off and now we’ve had a lot of things going on, so it feels like there’s never time to stop.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We used to see people with chronic fatigue syndrome getting repeated infections. Now the same symptoms are caused by Covid</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Samaka has also noticed that she is ill more often since she had Covid in January, and wonders about the impact of that first infection on her immune system. It’s a theory yet to be proven, but according to Harghandiwal, scientists are exploring the possibility. Early <a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/news-and-events/tackling-the-impact-of-covid-19/understanding-coronavirus-covid-19-and-epidemics/the-immune-system-and-long-covid/\">research has found that</a> abnormalities in immune cells may be contributing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/long-covid\">long Covid</a>, which is estimated to affect more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/two-million-people-in-uk-living-with-long-covid-say-studies\">2 million people</a> in the UK. “Even in mild cases of the disease, changes to immune function can happen. We used to see people with chronic fatigue syndrome getting repeated infections. Now the same symptoms are caused by Covid, which is a lot more prevalent,” says Harghandiwal.</p> <p>Dr Chris Ritchieson, a Cheshire GP, has also noticed a pattern of increased “winter” ailments in the north of England. While these illnesses can make healthy adults and older children very unwell for a few days, they usually get better on their own. For babies, older people and anyone who is immunocompromised, the risks are greater.</p> <p>Social mixing is important for people kept apart in lockdown, but there are small steps everyone can take to reduce the risk of contracting and passing these viruses on. “Wearing masks on public transport and in crowds really helped to reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses,” he says. “Meanwhile, hand-washing is important for the prevention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/16/norovirus-warning-bug-spreads-england-lockdown-eased\">norovirus</a> [winter vomiting bug]. Some stomach bugs are resistant to hand sanitiser but a thorough wash with soap and warm water is very effective at getting rid of these germs. A lot of people don’t wash their hands properly before they eat or handle food.”</p> <p>Increasingly relaxed attitudes towards hygiene and common viruses are not just due to pandemic fatigue – they have been developing for decades. “Before routine vaccination there were higher rates of scarier illness and fewer treatments, so the public were more aware and perhaps took public health more seriously. However, we do still see a small but significant number of children and vulnerable people hospitalised with respiratory and vomiting viruses. They are definitely still a concern.”</p> <p>People may unknowingly transmit serious illness when they are unwell. “Whooping cough and RSV, both of which can be very dangerous for babies, have been on the rise across the population for some time,” he says. “Because people aren’t looking for these and they often start with mild symptoms, they assume it’s a cold and continue to mix. If people have the option to work at home when they feel mildly unwell, or take time off, it could help to reduce the spread of illness and the risk for young and vulnerable people.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/22/cineworld-may-file-for-bankruptcy-in-us-but-cinemas-will-stay-open","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T09:11:32Z","webTitle":"Cineworld confirms it is looking at filing for bankruptcy in US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/22/cineworld-may-file-for-bankruptcy-in-us-but-cinemas-will-stay-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/22/cineworld-may-file-for-bankruptcy-in-us-but-cinemas-will-stay-open","fields":{"headline":"Cineworld confirms it is looking at filing for bankruptcy in US","trailText":"Chain, which accumulated £4bn debt in pandemic, says cinemas would stay open and staff be unaffected","byline":"Kalyeena Makortoff","body":"<p>Cineworld has confirmed it is considering filing for bankruptcy in the US after accumulating £4bn in debt during the coronavirus pandemic but assured moviegoers and staff that its cinemas would continue operating even as it tries to restructure its balance sheet.</p> <p>The world’s second-largest cinema chain has struggled after failing to experience a quick enough recovery in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, which forced most of its sites to close during lockdowns.

He reassured me that he was used to it and, like an old-fashioned deck chair, folded himself up before extending his legs almost to the other side, which nobody minded, because it was so comical. My son Luca was young at the time, five or six, and found the scene hilarious. Also because, at around that time, we were reading the BFG a lot – a favourite scene is when the queen’s servants balance tables upon tables to make one high enough for the giant, on which they serve him 20 fried eggs and 40 slices of bacon.</p> <p>Our Big Friendly Stefano played the trumpet with his long fingers. He had come round to catch up, as well as to show me how he makes pasta all’ amatriciana (no onion, guanciale, wine, tinned tomatoes, pecorino, rigatoni). Lesson over and pasta eaten, I brought out peaches for pudding. Stefano took one, peeled it, then chopped chunks of the thick, orange flesh directly into the end of his red wine. It wasn’t the first time I had seen someone do this, but it was the best time; neat and satisfying. So we all joined in, peeling peaches, plopping away, then drinking the morselsfrom our glasses. It is such a clear memory: long limbs and wine-soaked peaches on a hot day in our old kitchen, which I have now started to romanticise, even though in reality it was a bit of a nightmare with its blocked drains and falling-off door.</p> <p>It was also Stefano who suggested making the peaches in wine in advance. Because, according to him, the world is divided in two: those who peel fruit and those who have fruit peeled for them. At the time, I tried to disagree with him, but as the years rush by, I suspect more and more that he is right. If you peel, you are probably happy to do so for the whole table, and no-peelers depend on this generosity. Which is why, when it comes to wine and peaches, this relies only on a cook who likes to peel, and it is a really lovely, summer pudding, basil and peaches making a brilliant couple.</p> <p>You can use white, rosé or light red wine. Something you enjoy, keeping in mind that it is going to be slightly sweetened, that it will have fruit and basil soaking in it, and that it will be served ice-cold. The last time I made this, I used Sicilian grillo, the time before that, a rosé from Puglia, while the time before that it was a bottle of gamay. Whatever wine you choose, chill it well.</p> <p>If there’s any left, return the peaches and their soaking liquor to the fridge overnight.

But he refused to rule out increasing gas production as “a last resort”.</p> <p>“If we have to shut down industries which would mean a threat to the safety or health of people, then you get a very fine balance with opening up Groningen,” he said.</p> <p>Hague-watchers believe that while Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, will publicly stick to a “safety first” script in Groningen this summer, he may allow pressure to build for a plot twist in the autumn.</p> <p>“I have no doubt that if the situation in Germany worsens, pressure will be mounted on the Dutch government – not only from Germany, but from inside the Netherlands – to do whatever is possible in the context of Groningen gas production,” said Hans Grünfeld, the managing director of the VEMW business lobby.</p> <p>The VEMW was in “constant dialogue” with the government about the gas crisis and had “actually started to educate” it about the safety risks posed by a shutdown of industry due to gas shortages, he said.</p> <p>Another senior industry source said: “They will let this go right down to the wire, say ‘now we have to shut down a particular type of industry’. And before there is even a threat of that happening I think they will increase [gas] production in Groningen, and rightfully so.”</p> <p>Much will depend on the Netherlands’ liquefied natural gas capacity, gas storage levels, ability to reduce demand and the winter’s severity.</p> <p>The Groningen field contains <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/energy-minister-says-dutch-braced-russian-gas-cutoff-groningen-is-last-resort-2022-07-07/\">about 450bn cubic metres of gas</a> – enough to cover Europe’s imports from Russia for three years – buried beneath a soft clay soil, which has the unfortunate quality of <a href=\"https://publications.deltares.nl/EP3585.pdf\">amplifying seismic activity</a>.</p> <p>During tremors, the earth “bounces up like pudding”, one local resident said. In Huizinge, a magnitude 3.6 quake devastated local properties in 2012 and fears of “the big one” – a tremor reaching magnitude 5 or more – are rife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f38affbba9fd3ce5fffd1b7be9e82b3624ea1ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f38affbba9fd3ce5fffd1b7be9e82b3624ea1ca/0_215_8640_5184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The prime minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It is thought the prime minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, will publicly stick to a ‘safety first’ script in Groningen this summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Nijhuis/ANP/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM), which runs the field, was founded by Shell and ExxonMobil. It historically dealt with many of the complaints, but in 2017 the Dutch government took over. “This is informally called ‘NAM at a distance’,” said a NAM spokesperson. “This was not only the wish of the Dutch government and citizens in Groningen, but also of NAM.”</p> <p> The company would not comment on individual cases, some of which are handled by different agencies, but accepted that mistakes had been made. Initially, “claims handling was too slow and due to the high number of claims, attention was no longer focused on the people who needed it most,” the official said.</p> <p>They said that “since 1993 NAM recognised that gas production can lead to seismicity which can cause damages to houses”. But they also pointed out that “the level of production from Groningen is set by the minister of economic affairs and climate, not by NAM as the field operator. The minister is solely accountable for the security of supply.”</p> <p>Vijlbrief said Groningen residents who complained about the pace of repairs and compensation payments were “perfectly right”.</p> <p>“Dealing with their damage has gone fairly well but we’re totally delayed with the reconstruction of houses,” he said.</p> <p>The current waiting time to receive a first compensation offer from the authorities for damage repair is 238 working days, says Nienke Busscher, of the government-funded Groningen Knowledge Platform. The compensation scheme was “a disaster in slow motion” for locals, she said.</p> <p>Nettie Klompsma, a former journalist, said she lost her compensation claim for dozens of cracks in her house’s wall and leaky double glazing when she became unable to continue the application after her husband died.</p> <p>“They denied the leakage from the double glazing was due to earthquakes and at that time I was still in mourning,” she said.</p> <p>Klompsma finally received a €10,000 (£8,584) goodwill payment but has a €23,000 bill for the double-glazing repairs alone. “Look at that and cry for me,” she said, holding up the chit.</p> <p>“I’m a prisoner in my own house. I can’t move somewhere else because my mortgage is higher than the house’s worth. I’m alone here. I’m not very rich and I’m worried about what might happen if ‘the big one’ occurs,” she said. “I’ll have to run for my life if I’ve still got time.”</p> <p>Klompsma expects the Dutch government to ramp up gas production in Groningen. “When that happens, I will ask Extinction Rebellion to help glue me to a pole because I think there will be protests,” she said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2022/01/16/in-groningen-meer-dan-8-000-betogers-in-fakkeltocht-tegen-gaswin/\">Thousands marched</a> in a torchlit demonstration in January and more actions are planned.

You continue and continue until it really starts to become blatant and painful.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Teens getting their stomach pumped on the weekend was a pretty normal occurrence; so was giving a stranger on the street a tenner to buy you and your mates a bottle of cheap vodka. “She’s speaking on the big white telephone” was slang in Devon for having your head down the toilet.</p> <p>Everyone found it funny: funny that one time I woke up in a flower bed, and that none of us could ever remember getting home. On holiday in Spain aged 16, I got so sick on sangria that, let’s just say, I never drank anything “with bits in” ever again. Then, university happened, and those three years went by in a white wine blur. Cheap “trebles”, bright blue shots, the Snakebite concoction of lager, cider and blackcurrant. Constant low hum headaches and empty wine bottles rattling about under the bed. Entering the world of work, it was “after-work drinks!!!”, where you got to find out all the juicy stuff about your colleagues and your boss. I drank my way through all of those nights too without ever stopping to ask: is there an option <em>not</em> to do this?</p> <p>It was only in my mid-20s that I finally started to unpick my relationship with drinking. My career was gaining momentum and in my spare time I was reading self-help books and watching Ted Talks. Through my job, I was interviewing psychologists, talking about mental health and listening to doctors explaining facts about our diet, brain chemistry and behavioural patterns , but the elephant in the room was the fact that I was still drinking every night.</p> <p>I really wanted to change my relationship with alcohol and started making progress. Then, 2020 happened. Even <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2021/05/10/gwyneth-paltrow-went-totally-off-the-rails-in-lockdown-14554792/\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> admitted to knocking back the whisky sours seven nights a week during the first national lockdowns. And if it was good enough for the founder of a wellness brand, it was good enough for me. I made a playlist to get drunkly emotional to. I purchased things while drunk, I bought tickets to a band I used to like when I was younger and then asked for a refund when I’d sobered up. I sent people sentimental text messages, waking up the next day wincing. Nothing that<em> bad</em> happened, but I was drinking more and more again each night, convincing myself it was nothing but a chic wind-down part of my routine. I remember placing a huge wine order, thinking it was fine because it was organic with a trendy east London label on it. But I was taking a big bag of clinking bottles out to the recycling bin every week. Something occasional had slowly turned into a nightly habit again, and I couldn’t pinpoint when.</p> <p>It was only when I interviewed author Ruby Warrington, who coined the term “sober curious”, that things started to really change. Ironically, I’d arrived severely hungover to the interview, but Ruby’s non-judgmental message of turning a curious eye to your drinking habits, and/or the role drinking plays in society got my attention. After yet another lockdown was announced, I sheepishly got her book down from my bookshelf. With a deep breath, I decided to be genuinely curious and admit I really wanted something to change.</p> <p>Some people have to give up drinking completely; they can’t have a couple because they know where it would lead. Alcoholism is real. It requires a serious, courageous ongoing recovery process. That feels separate to what I’m describing here. I had fallen into grey-area drinking, a term coined by Jolene Park, that which describes the feeling that you don’t have a “drinking problem”, but you do have a “problem with drinking” without it being a severe alcohol use disorder.</p> <p>Many of us want to question our relationship with alcohol while also maintaining the possibility of moderation. The insidious involvement of alcohol in our daily lives means that until you reach rock bottom there has been little incentive to question it as a lifestyle choice, until recent years. My question is: why do we have to wait until we have a serious problem to question our habits? I knew I didn’t want to give up drinking entirely, but I wanted to give up getting drunk. There was nuance to the conversation for me, and it wasn’t until I discovered the mindful drinking movement that I felt I could put words to this without needing to label myself.</p> <p>Prompted by exercises in Ruby’s book, I gave up alcohol for three months, and found myself reconnecting to the part of myself again that didn’t need to binge or fill a hole. I reconnected with my body and learned how to settle my nervous system through breathwork. I started being more honest with my loved ones, I made changes in my career, I stopped people-pleasing. I found space in my life to be creative for the sake of it. I committed to journalling. I no longer wanted to numb myself out. I enjoyed the odd drink again.</p> <p>Now, I always have alcohol-free beers in the fridge, because I prefer them. I’ll enjoy a glass of red wine if I’m having a steak. But I won’t drink for the sake of it. I don’t miss getting drunk at all. I want to feel present for my life. For me, being sober-curious feels like you are living life intuitively rather than passively. Friends who just wanted to get inebriated with me have fallen away. Industry pals who only ever enjoyed a drunken gossip are gone. I don’t get invited to crazy parties any more. My life is so much better now. I’m so much happier and less anxious. And, did I mention, my skin looks fabulous, too.</p> <ul> <li><p>Emma Gannon is an author, novelist and host of the creative careers podcast, Ctrl Alt Delete</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2022/aug/22/poem-of-the-week-in-winter-the-steep-lane-by-peter-sansom","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T09:00:33Z","webTitle":"Poem of the week: In Winter the Steep Lane by Peter Sansom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2022/aug/22/poem-of-the-week-in-winter-the-steep-lane-by-peter-sansom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2022/aug/22/poem-of-the-week-in-winter-the-steep-lane-by-peter-sansom","fields":{"headline":"Poem of the week: In Winter the Steep Lane by Peter Sansom","trailText":"A spare, haunting depiction of a tricky winter walk points the way to everyone’s final destination","byline":"Carol Rumens","body":"<h2><strong>In Winter the Steep Lane</strong></h2> <p>is often icy<br>one in four, and today<br>it brings me<br>to my hands and<br>dodgy knees</p> <p>absurd under trees<br>tall as the sky<br>a mile or two to go</p> <p>I crawl for a while<br>then scrabble<br>to my feet but stay low,</p> <p>young old man<br>I stop at a dry<br>stone wall then step</p> <p>up<br>atop<br>a stile</p> <p>owl call<br>far city<br>constellation</p> <p>then down<br>to a field<br>that might be snow</p> <p>nothing to do<br>but keep going</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"slim volume\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body style=&quot;padding: 0px; margin: 0px; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;.left-rule:before,.right-rule:before{content:'';float:left;width:43%;height:1px;border-top:1px dotted #bdbdbd;margin-top:12px}.right-rule:before{content:'';float:right}svg{display:block;margin:auto}p{margin:0px}#wrapper{margin:0px}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;left-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;right-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;svg version=&quot;1.1&quot; width=&quot;30px&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot; id=&quot;Layer_1&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot; x=&quot;0px&quot; y=&quot;0px&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 30 24.8&quot; enable-background=&quot;new 0 0 30 24.8&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot; fill=&quot;#fdadba&quot;&gt; &lt;path d=&quot;M29.3,1.4C26.2,0.5,23.4,0,21.2,0c-3.4,0-5.2,1-6.2,1.9C14,1,12.2,0,8.8,0c-2.3,0-5,0.5-8.1,1.4L0,1.6v23l1.3-0.4 C4.2,23.4,6.7,23,8.8,23c4.2,0,5.2,1.8,5.2,1.9l1.9,0c0,0,0.9-1.9,5.2-1.9c2.1,0,4.6,0.4,7.5,1.3l1.3,0.4v-23L29.3,1.4z M8.8,20.9 c-2,0-4.2,0.3-6.8,1V3.1C4.6,2.4,6.9,2,8.8,2c3.7,0,4.9,1.4,5.2,1.8v18.3C12.9,21.5,11.3,20.9,8.8,20.9z M28,21.9 c-2.6-0.7-4.9-1-6.8-1c-2.5,0-4.1,0.5-5.2,1.1V3.8C16.3,3.4,17.5,2,21.2,2c1.9,0,4.2,0.4,6.8,1.1V21.9z&quot;/&gt; &lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Peter Sansom, born in Nottinghamshire in 1958, maps various northern landscapes in his new collection, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/lanyard-9781800170209?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Lanyard</a>, and peoples them with affectionate stories from a past that’s as much shared as personal. This week’s poem, placed towards the end of the book but before the expansive, memory-rich title poem, has a suggestive leanness in its structure, and a protagonist who is finding his way solo, almost without a memory-map. It pares down the foreseeable future. It finds a familiar landscape no longer predictable.</p> <p>The title forms, in effect, the first line of the poem, perhaps prefiguring the walker-narrator’s need to pause and think about his way forward. He has walked the lane before, knows its gradient, knows that in winter it’s “often icy”. Something different happens today – the stumble that brings him to his hands and knees. Events from now on seem to evolve in a landscape that represents a swathe of time.</p> <p>The walker’s knees are already, he admits, “dodgy”. This cheerfully informal allusion to ageing helps establish the “time” trajectory. The scene inevitably suggests the riddle that the Sphinx, in the ancient story, asked travellers intending to visit the city of Thebes: “What has four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs at night?” The fatally correct answer was given by Oedipus: “a man.” When the walker in Sansom’s poem falls, we’re shown both the crawling baby of the morning, for whom the trees are gigantic and the potential old man, three-legged with his walking stick at night. Now the whole perspective has changed: the trees are “tall as the sky” and the “mile or two to go” might be insurmountable.</p> <p>With a new strategy “to stay low”, and accept himself as “a young old man”, the speaker finds his feet and an alternative route. The sparseness of the three-lined stanzas and the dwindling of the already minimal punctuation (a single comma after “four” and “low” respectively) slow the pace, evoke careful stepping and perhaps breathlessness. The line-break separating “dry” and “stone” might indicate both, while depicting the separations between the stones visible in such a wall.</p> <p>The diversionary stile-climbing is a slow, cautious process, measured out word by word: “step // up / atop”. It brings another change of perspective, and there’s a fine panoramic extension of sight and sound in stanza six: “owl call / far city / constellation”. Only now do we realise the narrative takes place at night, or the edge of night. That sense of star formations, present if not yet fully visible to the naked eye, enriches the stanza, and brings space into the scope of the poem’s time-travel.</p> <p>Even less certainty frames the action of stepping down from the stile. The field “might be snow” and so, depending on the depth of cover, might be impassable. I like the fact that the poem works on more than one level, and that it doesn’t tell us whether the walker is ascending or descending the steep and icy lane. His journey seems a universal symbol of the passage into winter which a long life inevitably becomes.

frustration at his own government’s failure to respond to a landmark report on ice addiction, saying he has spent “hundreds of hours” trying to secure cabinet support for the reforms.</p> <p>It has been 30 months since Prof Dan Howard handed down the findings of the special commission into ice, commissioned by former premier Gladys Berejiklian prior to the state election in 2019.</p> <p>Appearing before a budget estimates hearing on Monday, Speakman said he was “disappointed” by the government’s failure to respond, saying Howard’s inquiry was “founded on extensive research and

bestiality by the eminent British historian Prof Joanna Bourke, while admitting he had not contacted the festival for more information before calling for the event to be scrapped.</p> <p>Bourke, the author of several books including 2020’s Loving Animals, is scheduled to deliver her talk The Last Taboo on 17 September, which has been billed as exploring “the modern history of sex between humans and animals” but does not endorse bestiality. FODI has in the past hosted controversial speakers including Christopher Hitchens and Julian Assange.</p> <p>But on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.2gb.com/nsw-government-calls-on-controversial-bestiality-talk-to-be-cancelled/\">after being contacted for comment by the talkback radio host Ben Fordham</a>, the office for the New South Wales arts minister, Ben Franklin, said he was “deeply concerned by the contents of The Last Taboo and is demanding festival organisers remove it from their program”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/his-dark-materials-the-bush-noir-that-grapples-with-mental-health\">His dark materials: the bush noir that grapples with mental health</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the statement, Franklin said he had not contacted FODI before “immediately” asking the NSW arts policy body Create NSW to contact the organisers and demand the event be scrapped.</p> <p>Festival curator and Ethics Centre director, Simon Longstaff, said Bourke’s views had been “quite profoundly misrepresented” in isolated quotes shared by Fordham, including the statement that “interspecies relationships can be complex, rich and fulfilling”.</p> <p>He said that Bourke’s book on the history of bestiality did not endorse it, but “offers just three possible ways of thinking about zoophilia – as dangerous, perverted or wrongheaded”.</p> <p>“If somebody was to provide a history of cannibalism or slavery, does that mean they are therefore encouraging us to eat each other or enslave our fellow man?” Longstaff said.</p> <p>“There is this intense notion that things that you don’t like should be canceled or silenced because they’re difficult. The arch proof of FODI’s necessity is in events of the last few days.”</p> <p>Longstaff said that FODI, which has also hosted Salman Rushdie and Pussy Riot, was established to protect freedom of speech for artists and intellectuals who were silenced in their own countries.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p></li> </ul> <p>“To have a minister in NSW using that approach that we’ve provided refuge from for people from overseas is quite extraordinary,” he said.</p> <p>“How can you possibly determine that a talk isn’t what the community wants to hear about when you have no idea what the talk is about?”</p> <p>He said Bourke was “trolled” online “by lowlifes who have put her in their sights because of misleading comments about what her views are, which are objectively false and obviously so”.</p> <p>Franklin has ordered Create NSW to investigate the matter, as the festival received government funding as part of the state’s Covid-19 recovery package.</p> <p>On Monday, Franklin told Guardian Australia he had always supported and continued to support “independent artistic expression”, but remained concerned about The Last Taboo talk.</p> <p>He said the festival had been funded by taxpayers and it was imperative the festival’s content “cannot be seen to – even implicitly – condone extreme acts that have been deemed by both society and the law to be utterly unacceptable”.</p> <p>He noted the FODI had made changes to its website and the festival’s promotion of its program over the weekend.</p> <p>“However, I remain concerned that ‘The Last Taboo’ could still be seen to condone this behaviour,” Franklin said. “The title itself implies other ‘taboos’ (or practices that were once deemed inappropriate) are now acceptable, and that this is therefore the last domino to fall.</p> <p>“It is for that reason that I do not believe The Last Taboo should remain on the program of the event.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/21/midnight-oil-and-missy-higgins-bring-thousands-of-older-festivalgoers-to-broken-hill\">Midnight Oil and Missy Higgins bring thousands of older festivalgoers to Broken Hill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guardian Australia understands that no government funding provided to the festival was used to pay for Bourke’s speaking fees or flights to Australia.</p> <p>Longstaff said he felt “totally confident” the investigation would find in Bourke’s favour, but said even if it didn’t, “we will go ahead.”</p> <p>“If any government minister sought to intervene to prevent this event, then every reasonable person who believes in the discussion of ideas, both difficult and easy, would stand with us against them,” he said. “I wouldn’t mind if there were some reasonable grounds to censor something that actually exists.

The instances in question are examples of the latter. They are neither the first nor the last examples.</p> \n   <p>How these appointments are communicated is the prerogative of the government of the day. The Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor General is not responsible for publishing these sorts of administrative appointments. As such, they are not and have not been included in the Office’s annual reports, nor would the act of signing an instrument approving an administrative appointment be included in the governor general’s program on the website.</p> \n   <p>In response to current media commentary, there is no secret or conspiracy in the office’s reporting. The office routinely publishes details of swearing-in ceremonies and gazettes the details of when the governor general has directed a minister to hold office. However, the office is not responsible for publishing changes to the administrative arrangements for departments. Again, that is the prerogative of the government of the day.

where the stakeholders are taking this opportunity for roundtable discussions.</p> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Trade Unions wants the government to “quickly establish” a national energy transition authority, making the point that climate and mining jobs are linked.</p> \n  <p>It has released its report, Secure Jobs for a Safer Climate, laying out how 12 coal-fired power stations have closed so far in the last 10 years, with no plan for transitioning the communities that relied on those assets.</p> \n  <p>ACTU president <strong>Michelle O’Neil</strong> said there was a better way, with the renewable sector capable of creating “395,000 secure and well-paid jobs and $89bn in revenue by 2040 in export industries alone”.</p> \n  <p>To realise this, the report recommends that the Albanese government:</p> \n  <ol> \n   <li><p>Establish an independent and properly resourced national energy transition authority to manage an orderly and fair transition process for affected workers – including supports for redeployment, skills and training, and secure jobs opportunities.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Develop a national renewables strategy, ensuring Australia becomes a renewable energy superpower with local industries, supply chains and good unionised jobs.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Build a national disaster response capability that seeks to mitigate, prepare for, respond, and recover from extreme weather events.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Take a leading role in developing climate mitigation and adaption policies and programs.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Ensure that industries and households have access to reliable and affordable energy.</p></li> \n   <li><p>Reach a net-zero emissions public service by 2030, with full engagement of workers.</p></li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>O’Neil said it was about not having to choose between climate action and jobs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Through support for skills and training, redeployment, and secure jobs in new industries we can ensure no worker or region is left behind.</p> \n   <p>Climate change is already with us, with workers across all industries suffering the health impacts of extreme heat and climate-related disasters, while dealing with the rising cost of living due to crop and land degradation – there needs to be a mitigation and adaptation plan from the government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p

While in March the Estonian Orthodox church joined other churches in the Baltic country in condemning the bombing of civilians in Ukraine, the church’s leader back in Moscow, Patriarch Kirill, has been accused of providing theological cover for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/22/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-180-of-the-invasion\">Vladimir Putin’s war</a>.</p> <p>Borisov, 32, who went to theological college in St Petersburg, is treading a thin line.

Many ethnic Russians turn to Russian television for their news, and a high degree of segregation remains.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Estonia’s government, led by Kaja Kallas, has taken a strong line on the need to turn the screw on Russia by strengthening the economic sanctions imposed by the west on its economy, ban travel visas for the country’s nationals and tear down Soviet Union imagery, such as monuments commemorating the second world war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c70d1ed8d1707524dd118bd79993d7ceedb44b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c70d1ed8d1707524dd118bd79993d7ceedb44b1/0_127_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man poses with coffee cup in hand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taniel Vaaderpass at his cafe in Tallinn’s old town.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hendrik Osula/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a dynamic that risks dangerous misunderstandings taking hold in which opposition to Putin’s Russia could be interpreted as disapproval of Russians at large.</p> <p>Karsten Brüggemann, a professor of Estonian history at Tallinn University, said the financial assistance being offered to Ukrainian refugees was also being seen as a threat by some in the Russian community.</p> <p>“Because they see how much money the state is giving to Ukrainian refugees and they haven’t got anything”, he says. “[For] some of the Russians who are in a socioeconomically poor situation this really is quite irritating to say the least.”</p> <p>Hanging out her washing on the terrace of her ground-floor flat in the shadow of Lasnamäe’s church, one 39-year-old mother of a three-year-old and five-year-old, who declined to give her name, said she was born in Tallinn but identified as Russian. “I better be careful what I say because they will deport me,” she said.</p> <p>“It was fine before the war. I worked for two Estonian companies and it was good but now we are seen as dangerous. What are they going to do to us next? I am not in favour of the EU sanctions. They are not hurting Russia but hurting us here. I am a personal trainer and I can’t afford to drive to work. I only take the car with the children. I can’t afford to fill it up. The government should be looking after its own people not the Ukrainians who threaten us, who protest with blood over themselves outside the Russian embassy. I am always looking over my shoulder.”</p> <p>The woman had heard false claims that the Estonian government had stopped free meals for children in Russian-language schools. “I don’t know if it is true, but it could be true,” she insisted.</p> <p>A flashpoint between the Estonian government and the ethnic Russian community was the move last week to remove a Soviet-era T-34 tank from its pedestal in the eastern city of Narva, where 95.7% of the population of Narva are native Russian speakers and 87.7% are ethnic Russians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"82ba59c96cbd5fb323d6c618ad15f9bcc2aabd87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82ba59c96cbd5fb323d6c618ad15f9bcc2aabd87/0_1366_4101_4316/950.jpg\" alt=\"High-rise flats and a few cars\" width=\"950\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lasnamäe district in Tallinn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hendrik Osula/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The decision was made as part of a wider plan to relocate between 200 and 400 public monuments to museums on the grounds that Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine had “opened wounds in our society that these communist-era monuments remind us of”.</p> <p>There had been concerns about unrest. The relocation of a statue known as the Bronze Soldier in Tallinn in April 2007 led to two nights of rioting in the capital’s old town, during which a Russian protester was killed.</p> <p>This time, locals instead gathered peacefully to lay flowers where the tank had sat. Polls have suggested that adherence of ethnic Russians to the Kremlin line is far from sure since the war. A recent survey found that around a third of those who identify as Russians in Estonia agree with the relocation of Soviet monuments from public places to museums. But fears of trouble remain. Russian hacker group Killnet has claimed to be behind what Estonian officials said was a major but futile cyber attack on its institutions in the immediate wake of the tank’s relocation. On Monday, Russian investigators stated that the murder in Bolshie Vyazyomy near Moscow of Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultranationalist Russian ideologue had been carried out by a Ukrainian woman who they said travelled to Estonia after the killing.</p> <p>Katri Raik, a former government minister who has been mayor of Narva since 2020, said there was genuine nervousness in the Russian community that they would be caught in the cross fire between Moscow and Tallinn.</p> <p>“Now it is very important what happens next,” she told Estonia’s largest daily newspaper, Postimees. “Those red monuments are [no longer] there. Is that all now? Or what the Estonian state has in mind in the direction of Narva. We need to restore trust between the country of Estonia and Narva.”</p> <p>Raik added: “We have to get rid of the fear of the people of Narva, which many people expressed yesterday at various meetings. They are afraid that they will be sent away from Estonia. We will certainly not send away the people of Narva”.</p> <p>Speaking on Estonian Independence Day on Saturday, the country’s president, Alar Karis, spoke of the ill will stirred up by the removal of the tank. “We must acknowledge that some residents of our country do have a different historical understanding,” he said. “Many of our compatriots are not yet fluent in Estonian, but in addition to the language, or greatly due to not speaking it, they also have not been taught an ideologically unbiased history of Estonia, Europe and the world.”</p> <p>He called, however, for understanding and sensitivity at a time when nuance was easily lost. “There are 1.3 million of us,” he said. “We possess power and strength. But only if we go forward taking heed of one another, not elbowing our own truth through.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/22/football-transfer-rumours-keira-walsh-manchester-city-united-barcelona-newcastle","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T08:08:00Z","webTitle":"Football transfer rumours: England hero Keira Walsh to join Barcelona?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/22/football-transfer-rumours-keira-walsh-manchester-city-united-barcelona-newcastle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/22/football-transfer-rumours-keira-walsh-manchester-city-united-barcelona-newcastle","fields":{"headline":"Football transfer rumours: England hero Keira Walsh to join Barcelona?","trailText":"Scott McTominay to leave United? | Hans Vanaken to West Ham? | Japhet Tanganga to Milan? | João Pedro to Newcastle?","byline":"Will Unwin","body":"<p>The arrival of Casemiro at Manchester United could mean <strong>Scott</strong> <strong>McTominay</strong> becomes redundant at Old Trafford. <strong>Everton</strong>, <strong>Leicester</strong>, <strong>Newcastle</strong> and <strong>West</strong> <strong>Ham</strong> are all circling should Erik ten Hag decide to part ways with the Scotland international.</p> <p>People may have thought the <strong>Frenkie de Jong</strong> to <strong>Manchester</strong> <strong>United</strong> saga was over, but the Premier League outfit are reportedly planning to have one last go at signing the Barcelona midfielder. <strong>Antony</strong> will remain at Ajax despite Manchester United making some massive bids for the Brazil winger, according to their head coach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2022/jul/06/football-transfer-window-summer-2022-mens-deals-premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-ligue-1-club-guides\">Football transfer window summer 2022 – Europe’s top five men’s leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I have a good feeling about it.

Well, sometimes the two <em>are</em> related. A look at <a href=\"https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/payroll/\">the highest payrolls</a> in MLB reveals that the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Mets lead the pack. The Dodgers and Mets also happen to have <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/standings/_/group/overall\">the best winning percentages in baseball</a>.</p> <p>That the Dodgers are on top of both these standings isn’t shocking: this is a team that won it all in 2020 and entered the year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/07/mlb-2022-predictions-is-the-championship-heading-to-canada-this-year\">as favorites</a> in the National League. The Mets, however, are used to being second in both spending and winning in their own city thanks to crosstown rivals, the Yankees.</p> <p>However, that was before Steven Cohen became <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-steve-cohen-mets-20201030-t5hj3ebvp5deff7mipn3p5n7f4-story.html\">the richest owner in baseball</a> by buying a majority share of the Mets away from the much-loathed Fred Wilpon for a whopping $2.4bn in 2020.

Since then, the Mets have won the NL East exactly once, in 2015, although they did manage to make it all the way to the World Series that go around.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/05/hack-wilson-1930-season-191-rbis-chicago-cubs\">Hack Wilson: the hard-living Chicago Cubs star whose epic 1930 endures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just having money to spend is no guarantee of success, of course. But owning a large-market team in a sport <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/ny-mlb-cbt-explained-luxury-tax-20220304-rtmzefdymbcghll7vhsn42zqni-story.html\">without a hard salary cap</a> should be a huge advantage. The Mets would surely have had more success in recent times with an owner who hadn’t lost a fortune in <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp\">one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history</a>.</p> <p>So, in comes Cohen, a lifelong Mets fan. He quickly made a splash by acquiring shortstop Francisco Lindor – who the team later handed a $341m extension. Unfortunately, money alone wasn’t enough to appease the Baseball Gods in 2021. Lindor floundered in his first year, the Mets missed the playoffs yet again and then had to watch their NL East rivals, the Atlanta Braves, win the World Series.</p> <p>This offseason they completed a fearsome starting pitching rotation by signing Max Scherzer to a three-year, $130m contract. The Mets payroll is now close to $300m and they may <a href=\"https://www.nj.com/sports/2022/08/mets-steve-cohen-could-expand-payroll-to-record-setting-amount-next-season-report-says.html\">increase that next season</a>. And why not? As more and more MLB owners have fallen into the profitable habit of fielding more affordable but less competitive teams, Cohen is right to take advantage of his financial advantage now, rather than wait for the trend to reverse.</p> <p>And in 2022 Lindor has had a <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/francisco-lindor-is-now-underrated\">bounce-back season</a>, the brilliant Jacob deGrom has returned to the starting rotation and Edwin Diaz has <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/34371948/new-york-mets-closer-edwin-diaz-entrance-gets-people-going\">the coolest intro music</a> in baseball (as well as becoming arguably the best closer in the major leagues). Plus, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/34436545/new-york-yankees-retire-paul-oneill-no-21-hal-steinbrenner-booed-fans\">the Yankees are stumbling</a> right when the Mets are playing their best baseball. All is well at Citi Field right?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf8bv230cfo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jf8bv230cfo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Just one thing: they are not running away with their division. The Mets’ most recent trip to Atlanta ended with them dropping three out of four games. While the Dodgers have essentially clinched the NL West already, the Mets are four games ahead of the Braves in the NL East – a healthy lead but hardly an insurmountable one.</p> <p>As has been the case for the longest time, the Braves’ strategy has been less about writing big paychecks for free-agent signings or going after big-name trade acquisitions. Instead, the Braves – who, it should be noted, are hardly poor with MLB’s ninth-highest payroll – prefer to invest their capital in homegrown players, handing them hefty, long-term contracts in the hope that they will be stars for years.</p> <p>Last week, the Braves signed rookie outfielder Michael Harris II to an eight-year, $72m extension. This was shortly after they signed All-Star third baseman Austin Riley to a $212m, 10-year deal. By concentrating on younger players, the new Braves are trying to replicate the success of the old Braves who clinched 11 straight division titles around the turn of the century.</p> <p>“The number one thing I worry about is being sustainable,” general manager Alex Anthopoulos<em><strong> </strong></em><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/braves-contracts-set-them-long-195625028.html\">said recently</a> regarding their payroll. It’s about steady, long-term success rather than relying on the splashy move.</p> <p>Each strategy has risks: veteran players tend to break down as their contracts go on, a fact of baseball life that the Mets know as well as anyone. Meanwhile, it’s impossible to consistently successfully bet on which prospects will pan out in the long run. Plus, sustainable regular season success doesn’t always translate into the postseason: during that run of consecutive NL East titles, the Braves only managed to win the World Series once. Maybe they could have made bolder swings here or there?</p> <p>This is setting up a false dichotomy of sorts. The Mets are relying on some of their young talent as well. The aptly-named Brett Baty <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTNR9us94ao\">crushing a home run</a> in his first major league at-bat may be the highlight of the Mets’ season so far, catcher Francisco Álvarez is <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/prospects/top100/\">considered the best prospect in baseball</a> and more experienced stars like Pete Alonso and Jeff McNeil came up through the draft. Likewise, the Braves roster isn’t fully homegrown, they even have former Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen saving games for them. However, it’s clear that there are two different organizational philosophies at work here and that could make for a fascinating rivalry going forward.</p> <p>With Atlanta’s World Series win last year, the Mets are the only team in their division that has yet to win a championship this century. No wonder Cohen is willing to spend a fortune to please a fanbase that has been waiting decades for a new miracle.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/aug/22/artists-who-burn-artworks-klf-damien-hirst","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"Flaming heck!

It’s likely that since Homo erectus discovered the element and the Neanderthals got arty, valuable things have been claimed by flames.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"249df9cc1addfe1b86c031cc9ab1325a8c118121\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/249df9cc1addfe1b86c031cc9ab1325a8c118121/0_956_5149_6438/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dot dot … Damien Hirst with his spot art.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the spot … Damien Hirst with some of his intact art.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bolton &amp; Quinn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, most fires involving art are accidental. Due to flammable materials and hazardous studios, the art world has experienced more than its fair share of infernos. Glasgow School of Art has gone up in flames <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/25/cause-of-fire-that-destroyed-glasgow-school-of-art-will-never-be-known\" title=\"\">twice in the last decade</a>, while in 2004 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/27/thebritartfire.arts1\" title=\"\">Momart warehouse fire</a> in London destroyed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/15/thebritartfire.arts\" title=\"\">British art worth about £30m</a>, including, ironically, work by Hirst.</p> <p>“An event like a Momart fire is good for revealing the way art metaphorically trips on the carpet,” says Dr Jared Pappas-Kelley, author of Solvent Form: Art and Destruction. He argues that all objects of art hold their own destruction latent within them. </p> <p>The public’s reaction to that blaze was different from the sympathy shown in the wake of the Glasgow fires. “After the Momart fire there was an almost gleeful response. Some saw it as a cultural comeuppance.” Hirst’s was one of the first big names that the public latched on to. Pappas-Kelley suggests it sparked “schadenfreude towards the YBAs” in general.</p> <p>While most such fires, and the reactions, are out of the control of the artists, others become accidental arsonists. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2016/apr/20/tom-de-freston-artist-bedroom-battersea-arts-centre-bac-video\" title=\"\">Tom de Freston</a>, putting the finishing touches to a collection of work with the Syrian writer Prof Ali Souleman, watched his own blowtorch incinerate the <a href=\"https://www.artrabbit.com/events/from-darkness-tom-de-freston\">entirety of his studio</a>. “For various reasons, I decided to kind of ritualistically burn a number of paintings … setting light in order to create,” he explains. The fire “really, really, quickly escalated” and 12 years of <a href=\"https://www.artrabbit.com/events/from-darkness-tom-de-freston\" title=\"\">work was destroyed</a> in as many minutes.</p> <p>Something new, though, was forged in the flames. There was “a period of grief and mourning … but at the same time the very next day looking at the burnt out space and seeing possibility everywhere”. This led to a kind of alchemy, with De Freston turning the ash into new paintings and appreciating the pieces burnt beyond repair as “astonishing sculptural objects” that held a secret history beneath the mystical charcoal.A similar incident happened to art scholar Jes Fernie, who had arranged for Heather and Ivan Morison’s Ultrasauros<em> </em>sculpture to be moved to Colchester, but the <a href=\"http://www.jesfernie.com/index.php/project/archive_of_destruction\" title=\"\">night before</a> the dinosaur’s journey, it burnt down. “I felt quite upset and annoyed and worried about what the hell I was going to do,” Fernie says. As with De Freston, though, a bright side emerged. “Then I thought actually, I’m just much more interested in this now it’s been burnt, what’s that about?” It led to the foundation of the <a href=\"https://archiveofdestruction.com/\">Archive of Destruction</a>, a timeline of destroyed art built on there being something “interesting about something that existed and then no longer exists or is transformed in some way”.</p> <p>It is this potential for transformation that has led to artists such as Hirst burning their work on purpose. John Baldessari famously set fire to his own work; 10 large boxes of ash were stored on a bookshelf for the rest of his career. “To be creative you have to have destruction quite often, too,” he said afterwards. “It’s like the idea of a phoenix rising from the ashes.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2207a28b5a2937c182c33f2123faf79a0267e364\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2207a28b5a2937c182c33f2123faf79a0267e364/0_761_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Money to burn … fragments of the alleged £1m bonfire lit by KLF.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Money to burn … fragments of the alleged £1m bonfire lit by KLF.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others have made immolation part of the art from the start. In his Homage to New York,<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/18/artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Jean Tinguely</a> created a kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2018/apr/13/is-this-cake-server-the-most-extraordinary-but-useless-machine-ever-video\" title=\"\">Rube Goldberg</a> contraption on speed, an assemblage of wheels, drums, toys and a bathtub that set itself alight in the garden of MoMA. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/aug/01/alfredo-jaar-artist-interview-change-the-world-pinochet-chile-edinburgh\" title=\"\">Alfredo Jaar</a> created a paper museum in Skoghall, a small Swedish town, before burning it down after 24 hours. Again, something new emerged: the community outrage led to Jaar being invited back to design a permanent cultural centre. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.ignant.com/2021/08/05/urs-fischers-wax-sculptures-are-set-on-fire-and-burned-in-pariss-bourse-de-commerce/\" title=\"\">Urs Fischer burned gigantic candle sculptures</a> for a slow-motion spectacle that melted over months into amorphous pools of wax.</p> <p>Adding fire doesn’t merely cause a newfound appreciation, it can even add value. Last year, someone known by the Twitter account @BurntBanksy spent $95,00 on a print of Morons (White) – a work by Banksy inscribed: “I can’t believe you morons actually buy this shit” – before burning it and selling the video as, you guessed it, an NFT. “The idea in its purest form was to take something that has ‘value’ and destroy it,” said a representative of Injective Protocol, the company behind @BurntBanksy. The NFT went for four times the price of the original, funding a new crypto-art venture called Burnt Finance, which – if you’re feeling charitable – might be viewed as a symbolic burning down of the old to bring in the new.</p> <p>This chimes with what Hirst is aiming to achieve; while it may seem braver to burn your <em>own</em> work, it’s less courageous when you’re aware of the value it creates. “He’s incredibly savvy about how to play the game,” Fernie says. “He’s trying to create currency (like the title of the work). He knows that his value is in decline – he’s using the machinery of marketing and PR to increase the currency of his identity.” Potentially $20m better off after the stunt, he’s likely to have money to burn.</p> <p>Beyond monetary gain, all these intended burnings rely on a simple, elemental truth: fire is alluring. For Pappas-Kelley, a blaze gives a “bit of razzle dazzle” and involves the audience: “In theory no one is neutral at these specific fires – you either set it, are attempting to put it out or are watching the spectacle of it,” he says. “People are still really interested in a visceral kind of physical experience of destruction,” Fernie thinks. It’s why people still wrap up in sub-zero temperatures to see Guy Fawkes set alight; why Burning Man is named after its end-of-festival effigy; or why vapes aren’t as sexy as cigarettes. So strong is the emotional pull of fire and its ability to destroy something of value that it’s also a source of taboo. The burning of art recalls the Bullingdon Club lighting £50-notes in front of homeless people or Burberry burning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/06/burberry-to-stop-burning-unsold-items-fur-after-green-criticism\" title=\"\">£28.6m worth of clothes</a>. Incineration is wasteful, an environmental sin, reserved for the privileged. Even @BurntBanksy struggled with burning the Morons print, refusing to disrespect it by using lighter fluid: “I didn’t want to tamper with the piece in any way … I remember saying in the video that it looks like this thing wasn’t meant to be set on fire.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9a14442fb85472116a945aeb4820bbef29bb136\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9a14442fb85472116a945aeb4820bbef29bb136/523_69_690_571/500.jpg\" alt=\"On fire … a burnt Banksy.\" width=\"500\" height=\"414\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On fire … a burnt Banksy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BurntBanksy/Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the unrivalled moment in this flammable history of art, bringing together intention, value, performance and taboo is the KLF’s The K Foundation Burn a Million Quid. The firebrand rave duo went to the Scottish island of Jura with £1m in cash that they burned in a disused boathouse. The film was also destroyed, apart from a copy later broadcast on the BBC.</p> <p>Even now, critics find all this difficult to digest. “There’s something different between burning art – the potential of value – and burning money … there is an anguish when you think about what you could do with that £1m,” Pappas-Kelley says. “There is that ‘let them eat cakeness’ to it.” “It’s connected to privilege,” Fernies says, recalling that her own arts-and-crafts creations with real £1 notes as a child horrified her family. The KLF themselves regret the act; but even in this case, something new was created: The Brick, a sculpture created from the ashes and exhibited at the Barbican.</p> <p>While most of us don’t have £1m to burn, is it ever a good idea to burn your own stuff? Unfortunately, fire isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme. As Fernie notes, a “15-year-old with a match” torching something is a “completely different proposition” from successful artists, while @BurntBanksy says that “random people burning art” since their stunt have failed to inspire the same buzz. “Anyone can make fire out of paper,” he notes. </p> <p>Beyond artistic or economic value, though, there is something emotive at play. Burning something has a cathartic quality, realised in the TV trope of moodily burning a photo of an ex. While NFTs may be part of the art world’s move to digital, Fernie argues that the personal burning of possessions is still alive and well: “One of my kids just finished their A-levels and went to someone’s house and had a ceremonial burning of all their revision notes. Honestly it was brilliant – they were all chucking it in the fire.”</p> <p>On 9 September, Hirst will start to burn his paintings, leading to a final blaze for the week-long Frieze art fair London in October. He will, we’re promised, attend the closing fire himself, giving you a chance to watch the creator burn $2,000-a-pop art. We don’t condone theft, but it may be savvy to grab some of the ash – you could pocket a fortune.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/22/the-people-immortal-by-vasily-grossman-review-soviet-wartime-propaganda-with-a-human-face","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"The People Immortal by Vasily Grossman review – Soviet wartime propaganda with a human face","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/22/the-people-immortal-by-vasily-grossman-review-soviet-wartime-propaganda-with-a-human-face","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/22/the-people-immortal-by-vasily-grossman-review-soviet-wartime-propaganda-with-a-human-face","fields":{"headline":"The People Immortal by Vasily Grossman review – Soviet wartime propaganda with a human face","trailText":"An expanded reissue of the author’s 1942 novel about a Red Army unit encircled by German forces is overtly polemical but also vividly written","byline":"John Self","body":"<p>Some authors have a very active afterlife, though the results when the writer’s literary estate dips its hand in the bran tub marked “other works” can be very mixed. The Soviet writer Vasily Grossman already had many of his books available in English at the time of his death in 1964, but a renewed surge of interest in his masterpiece <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/09/life-fate-vasily-grossman\">Life and Fate</a></em> over the past decade means his other work is being rediscovered. These books are not of the same calibre as <em>Life and Fate</em>: even on its first English publication, Grossman’s early novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/03/stalingrad-by-vasily-grossman-review\">Stalingrad</a></em> was called a “<a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v29/n20/john-lanchester/good-day-comrade-shtrum\">socialist realist dog</a>” and a “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/09/books/stalingrad-and-stalins-terror.html\">gelded fictional brontosaurus</a>”.</p> <p>Now we are reintroduced to Grossman’s 1942 novel <em>The People Immortal</em> in a new expanded translation by Robert and Elizabeth Chandler. From 1941 Grossman was a reporter on the army newspaper <em>Red Star</em>, and this novel draws on his experiences and contacts there. The story is based on an account given to Grossman by a Soviet officer of how he led a Red Army unit out of German encirclement after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.</p> <p>The narrative drive comes from the Russian attempts to retreat safely – victory is simply getting out of the German encirclement alive – and the story is told largely from the viewpoint of the army. Among others we meet Bogariov, a former professor now charged with leading this “important mission”; Ivanovich, an expert in military strategy impatient with those who aren’t; the calm, reassuring senior officer Cherednichenko; and in the lower ranks, soldiers Ignatiev, Sedov and Rodimtsev.</p> <p>As we might expect, there is a good deal of vivid action writing, such as a virtuosic account of the “death of a city” by German bombing: “There was something indescribably painful about these few seconds, when many tons of death had been released from the planes and had not yet touched the earth.” But Grossman humanises his tale with occasional comic touches: the army top brass argues about the ripeness of the apples supplied to them, while their cook complains about “all this damn dive-bombing. How can I shape my dumplings properly?” Soviet civilians are there too: the heart of the people is represented by a Cherednichenko’s young son Lionya, and his grandmother Maria, whose efforts to flee their apartment add human drama and underscore the theme of the importance of a secure homeland.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Grossman was not quite Stalin’s poodle. This new translation restores many of his lines that the Soviet authorities removed </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The blurb for <em>The People Immortal</em> says that the book is “far from being mere morale-boosting propaganda”. Well, not so very far – in fact, it’s pretty near. Grossman’s renaissance in the west is unusual since, as Robert Chandler notes in an afterword, we tend to prefer dissident Russian writers and Grossman was not that. Indeed he was, “if not at the very summit of the Soviet literary establishment, [then] not far below it”.</p> <p>As a result, the book contains a lot of dialogue alternately boosterish (“to defeat Lenin means to defeat the natural laws of our life”) and anti-German (“I am constantly amazed by fascism’s monstrous sterility!”), as well as sentimental filler (“I’d never have thought there could be so many tears stored up in my heart”). Sometimes Grossman doesn’t even bother to put the propaganda into the mouths of characters, but delivers it directly: “The day will come [...] when the sun will shine down in disgust on Hitler’s fox-like face.” Even the title has an evangelistic ring to it.</p> <p>But Grossman was not quite Stalin’s poodle. This new translation restores many of his lines that the Soviet authorities removed from <em>The People Immortal</em>. Mostly the cuts make sense – such as a section where the Soviet army commanders have a defeatist discussion about a loss of confidence among their troops – but it’s surprising to see some of the lines Grossman was allowed to keep, such as a long exchange in which Bogariov criticises the poor organisation and tactics of the Soviet forces.</p> <p>Knowledge of these changes comes from the Chandlers’ exemplary annotations to the book: all reissues should be given this much love. (The novel itself is 224 pages long: the notes, sources and commentary add another 118.) Indeed, this might be appropriate for a book that at times – depending on your appetite for discussions on military tactics and Soviet cheerleading – is more interesting to read about than to read.</p> <p>• <em>The People Immortal </em>by Vasily Grossman (translated by Robert and Elizabeth Chandler) is published by MacLehose Press (£25).

A woman’s happiness at having retrieving her wallet gives way to a touching memory about a difficult childhood with her parents, whose picture sits neatly among her credit cards. Gradually, the various tales of loss extend beyond material possessions: people talk of broken relationships, loved ones who have died and families that are left behind. </p> <p>Without giving too much away, the film’s most transcendental moment occurs towards the end, when these anecdotal threads are cleverly knitted into a musical piece that transforms individual losses into a symphony of collectivity.

you don’t drive you’re not getting any assistance.</p> <p>“Part of the reason it was selected back in March is it’s very salient – people drive past petrol stations and see what the price is all the

Its founders, Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers, fostered the development of Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Theo Randall, Stevie Parle, and Sam and Sam Clark of Moro, creating a lineage now in its second or third generation. Today, it is Tomos Parry of Brat, Max Rocha at Café Cecilia or Yohei Furuhashi at Toklas who are carrying elements of its ethos out into the world.</p> <p>That conveyor belt of talent may be described as an unforeseen byproduct of the environment Gray, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/28/rose-gray-obituary\" title=\"\">who died in 2010</a>, and Rogers, still very much in charge, created together. The kitchen currently has a roughly 50:50 male-female split, and each week chefs work four single shifts (9am to 5pm or 3pm to 11pm) and at most one double shift. Wyn Owen is trying to eradicate double shifts as they’re “the worst thing about hospitality”. Working parents are offered flexible hours, and the 150 staff can apply for bursaries from the Rose Gray Foundation for their personal and professional development. These have been used to learn languages, research cookbooks or take courses in charcuterie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"894fba1f3312fd11d57b2724e52ee73c773e06be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/894fba1f3312fd11d57b2724e52ee73c773e06be/0_201_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"River Cafe founder Ruth Rogers (centre), with current executive head chefs Sian Wyn Owen (left) and Joe Trivelli (right).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">River Cafe founder Ruth Rogers (centre), with current executive head chefs Sian Wyn Owen (left) and Joe Trivelli (right).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wyn Owen is wary of portraying the River Cafe as a “sickly, happy family”, saying: “it’s a stressful working environment meeting two non-negotiable deadlines a day – lunch and dinner.” In summer, the kitchen can do 200 covers at lunch on a Monday, but its chefs tend to stay for several years. Wyn Owen, 50, and Trivelli, 48, have both been there for more than 20 years. Stay long enough, explains Wyn Owen, and, “by osmosis, in real time”, chefs learn to “properly cook”.</p> <p>Trivelli and Wyn Owen are disappointed when, instead of staying in restaurants, talented alumni leave the industry, often to become private chefs. “It’s sad they’ve vanished inside someone’s house to make scrambled eggs,” says Wyn Owen. “We’re restaurant chefs and you want them to carry on the mantle.”</p> <p>But a notable number of ex-River Cafe chefs do exactly that: go on to lead highly rated kitchens. </p> <h2>Anna Tobias</h2> <p><em><strong>Chef-owner, <a href=\"https://www.cafe-deco.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cafe Deco</a>, London; she worked at the River Cafe from 2010 to 2013</strong></em></p> <p>“When I joined the River Cafe I was 23 and had only been cooking for 18 months. I was very fresh and not entirely sure I wanted to cook any more. I was in a personally difficult moment and my life could have gone another way. But I thought I’d try one more place: I only applied to the River Cafe, got the job and luckily stayed on the cooking path. It was the River Cafe or rethink.</p> <p>From an employee perspective, there was a level of glamour that felt enticing – big team, huge open kitchen, everyone knew the books, Jamie Oliver had come out of there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"97d6e3c37d9005ed7c9630141ab496873a1c80bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97d6e3c37d9005ed7c9630141ab496873a1c80bf/0_516_6192_7740/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chef Anna Tobias photographed at her restaurant Café Deco\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Wedges of Amalfi lemons of the most incredible quality served with every fish dish – that’s the River Cafe aesthetic’: Anna Tobias.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the morning, everyone does raw prep, filleting fish and butchery. That was a learning curve. Scaling eight sea bass each day is grim, but you get really good at it. More established chefs teach the newcomers with energy, enthusiasm and in detail. After that, I felt confident in my skills to tutor people. At Cafe Deco, that’s a large part of my job. I love teaching.</p> <p>The cooking processes behind food described as ‘simple’ – in essence, enjoying ingredients without mucking about with them – aren’t necessarily simple, and those processes must be perfect. That’s the point of going to a restaurant. You get to enjoy a peeled plum cherry tomato that you would never bother peeling at home. </p> <p>Rose had died two or three weeks before I joined and, when learning dishes from other chefs, instructions would often be prefaced with, ‘Rose used to say’, ‘Rose would do this’, or ‘Rose would hate that’. She was very much there. There was real togetherness and an atmosphere of cooking well, for Ruthie, but keeping Rose’s standards, too.</p> <p>Cooking simply and seasonally requires great care in produce quality. At the River Cafe, tasting the first summer basil, porcini or cherries together, these were are all incredibly exciting moments. I work with tiny farms who can only deliver certain amounts at Cafe Deco, particularly on the veg side. If the produce isn’t incredible the food will, at best, be average to good-ish.</p> <p>Early on, I remember the first borlotti beans coming in. Ruthie cooked them in the oven and put on a dish of borlotti, good oil and chopped parsley. That was it. That’s bold cooking with strong belief in a delicious product. It requires way more confidence than cooking with a million flourishes on a plate.</p> <p>The beauty of the River Cafe is that people stay a long time. As an ambitious chef, that’s also a problem. You hit a glass ceiling where you’re banking on someone leaving to get more responsibility. I wanted to learn new skills: write menus, how to cost, have more of a creative voice. I went to Rochelle Canteen and, after a year, was made head chef.</p> <p>I think of Cafe Deco’s menu as a brainchild of all my former bosses and my own style. My gnudi with good, new season olive oil or my pappa al pomodoro soup aren’t carbon copies, but I take inspiration from the River Cafe. Why wouldn’t I bring some of that learning into my own cooking?”</p> <h2>Avinash Shashidhara</h2> <p><em><strong>Head chef, <a href=\"https://pahlihillbandrabhai.com/\" title=\"\">Pahli Hill Bandra Bhai</a>, London; he worked at the River Cafe from 2008 to 2018 </strong></em></p> <p>“In Bangalore, I worked at Italia, where Antonio Carluccio was a consultant. He and Priya Paul [the chair of Park Hotels India, where Shashidhara trained as a chef] would bring in cookbooks, including the blue <em>River Caf</em><em>e</em> and <em>Easy</em>, and say, ‘This is the kind of food we want.’ I’d look at them thinking, ‘This place must be amazing,’ but I never thought I’d work there.</p> <p>In 2005, I moved to the UK (there was a huge chef shortage in Britain and agencies were recruiting in India) and in 2006 got a job at the Old Bridge Hotel in Huntingdon. The owner, John Hoskins, was friends with Rose Gray’s son, Ossie [a former River Cafe general manager], and John sent us for lunch at the River Cafe. I loved it.</p> <p>Walking along the banks of the Thames and seeing the Harrod’s Furniture Depository in Barnes was like walking through the cookbooks. The food was so simple, so seasonal, nothing like I’d cooked or eaten. My palate wasn’t complex and I remember the olive oil tasted slightly unpleasant to me, bitter and peppery. Having tried the recipe, I had the chocolate nemesis for dessert and the quality was completely different.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"61ed0bd0409827408a4fa1898612452967afb302\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61ed0bd0409827408a4fa1898612452967afb302/0_462_9388_5633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Avinash Shashidhara, at Pahli Hill Bhandra Bhai restaurant, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘As a child, I’d go to market with Dad.

I trained in French fine dining and had to unlearn everything. The River Cafe way meant elegant but rustic. Sian [Wyn Owen] would say, ‘Babes, imagine you’re at home, helping yourself, that’s how I want you to plate food.’ It was a huge change in how I looked at food.</p> <p>It works in a fascinating way which is never repetitive. One head chef starts at 9am, another at 3pm, and each writes that day’s lunch and dinner menu. Chefs get a section to work on each service, which changes daily, and over months you move around to, say, hot starters, pasta, the wood-fired oven.</p> <p>At 10.30am, you also get a jobs list where you’re making risotto or roasting veal for different sections. So every day you’re learning about new dishes and ingredients. Training is intense. Even making salsa verde, somebody would show me start to finish. Next time, you do it with another chef. Third time on your own, but with senior chefs checking it. There is no scope for inconsistency.</p> <p>Rose and Ruthie were like mothers to me. They could be harsh critics but if you messed up you didn’t get shouted at. You didn’t feel personally attacked. They were always willing to show you what you’d done wrong. This created high standards. People wanted to do their best but they weren’t scared to make mistakes.</p> <p>I came out of the River Cafe a calmer chef. Now I’m heading a kitchen, managing 10 chefs, some in their 50s. If something isn’t good enough, I tell people on a professional basis and, importantly, show them how to do it. The River Cafe changed the way I handle people.</p> <p>I had a good work-life balance there. The annual wine and olive oil trips to Italy are a massive perk. I went on 10. You’re taken to hidden restaurants in Tuscany or feasts with producers’ families to understand the River Cafe ethos. You’re in the bubble, part of the family. Why would we leave?</p> <p>Eventually, I needed my own identity. After 10 years, you’re certainly confident you can set up your own restaurant. The River Cafe’s approach of letting ingredients shine is visible at Pahli Hill. I don’t change my menu daily, but I’m in constant touch with my suppliers and use exciting seasonal produce as it comes in: nettles, spring lamb, girolles. I see similarities in Italian and Indian food culture – everything revolves around family and seasonality.”</p> <h2>Pegs Quinn</h2> <p><em><strong>Chef-owner, <a href=\"https://www.sonnystores.com/\">Sonny Stores</a>, Bristol; he worked at the River Cafe from 2014 to 2018</strong></em></p> <p>“I’d applied for jobs at three places in London: Moro, Barrafina and the River Cafe. The first interview I got was at the River Cafe. I started my trial week the next day and then got the job.</p> <p>I was nervous going in. I hadn’t eaten there but the restaurant was always talked about in other kitchens because of the cookbooks and its influence. It’s a Michelin-starred restaurant serving relaxed food, and there aren’t loads of those. Plus, it’s a big restaurant: 10 chefs on a busy shift, the biggest kitchen I’ve worked in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d07068cffc823c815d3807485e2589b76822ed53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d07068cffc823c815d3807485e2589b76822ed53/0_158_5504_7684/716.jpg\" alt=\"Pegs Quinn at Sonny Stores, Bristol.\" width=\"716\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The River Cafe was the first place I got my hands on olive oil that could really lift a tomato salad’: Pegs Quinn at Sonny Stores, Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The amount of time you’re in the kitchen was really manageable. There was space and time for the staff to teach you in depth, while I was dealing with the best produce I’ve ever seen. A senior or head chef would always be around to show you a specific dish. You might get the cookbook out and read the recipe while working together, so you understood how and why it’s cooked that way.</p> <p>Joe [Trivelli] taught me how to make tomato sauce; Sian [Wyn Owen] is a wizard with artichokes; I learned how to cook sweetbreads with Danny [Bohan, the restaurant’s head chef]. We do that now at Sonny Stores. I’ve sent staff on stages to the River Cafe or to Anna [Tobias] at Cafe Deco. We break lambs down with our local butcher – learning from people who know.</p> <p>We say Sonny Stores is Italian-inspired. We’re not as strict as the River Cafe and we have a much smaller team of three chefs. Within that, we work with the same ethos. It’s a changing, seasonal menu, using the best produce we can get, cooking in a simple way and not cutting corners. There aren’t exact translations of River Cafe dishes on the menu, but there are similarities in flavour combinations or River Cafe-inspired dishes made with different cuts. There’s regularly a pork tonnato dish on, which is done with veal at the River Cafe.</p> <p>Keeping staff happy and maintaining a constant team is something I’ve taken from the River Cafe. They run a civilised kitchen. No swearing. No shouting. What Sian, Joe and Ruthie do, getting brilliant food out without it being a place where people get berated, there’s a skill in that.</p> <p>Everybody sits down together around 4pm for a staff meal at the River Cafe, outside if the weather is good. That time-out is massively important and the staff food was mindblowing: sea bass or monkfish that hadn’t been used in the restaurant, fresh pastas and raviolis. We eat together at Sonny Stores. If you’ve not had that meal and sit down before service, you’re not going to make good choices later on.</p> <p>Today, there are chefs working on seasonal, changing menus who haven’t been near the River Cafe. Its relaxed, confident simplicity bled into the wider restaurant community. You see its chocolate nemesis everywhere.</p> <p>I once did a shift with Jeremy Lee at Quo Vadis and, if not exactly word for word, he put it, ‘Well, it’s all River Cafe now, isn’t it?’”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/blog/2022/aug/22/bury-at-a-crossroads-over-historic-merger-but-fans-remain-hopeful-of-homecoming","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T07:00:32Z","webTitle":"Bury at a crossroads over historic merger but fans remain hopeful of homecoming | Will Unwin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/22/bury-at-a-crossroads-over-historic-merger-but-fans-remain-hopeful-of-homecoming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/aug/22/bury-at-a-crossroads-over-historic-merger-but-fans-remain-hopeful-of-homecoming","fields":{"headline":"Bury at a crossroads over historic merger but fans remain hopeful of homecoming","trailText":"After much infighting, supporters are now faced with a momentous decision on whether to unite under one banner","byline":"Will Unwin","body":"<p>Bury is a town divided.

Bury AFC brings a loyal fanbase and BFCSS a number of benefactors who will add funding. A new elected board will make club decisions if the merger is agreed, bringing together fan ownership, private finance and government funding.</p> <p>Bury council has been very supportive of the merger and has put up money to help smooth the process. “Senior men’s professional football needs to come home to Gigg Lane, and this is not only a golden chance but the best chance to make this happen,” Councillor Charlotte Morris said.</p> <p>It is difficult to let something go that has brought so much joy. Fans were taken to Gigg Lane as children with their parents, creating an everlasting bond. People within all factions of the merger have a plethora of memories – for better or worse – and they will hold onto them, but to make new ones, coming together is seen as the best solution. BFCSS have worked valiantly to ensure 134 years of Bury FC history is not lost. Although the company exists on a business level, it does not operate as a football club and has no affiliation with the Football Association. An application made to the Northern Premier League was rejected.</p> <p>Since the demise of Bury FC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/18/bury-inside-story-financial-ruin-winding-up-petition-loans-car-park\" title=\"\">under Steve Dale’s ownership</a>, phoenix club Bury AFC, was created and won promotion to the North West Counties Premier Division in their first full season.

If the vote does not go through, we have no one to blame, except fans arguing among one other. We would almost lose everything again. It would be tragic if we throw all the work of a lot of people away just because of infighting.”</p> <p>Gigg Lane was vandalised when vacant and required plenty of work to get it ready to host football once more. It has been used as the backdrop to a BBC drama and a legends charity match in honour of the Bury icon Lenny Johnrose – his recent death has sharpened minds about what is truly important in the town – but has not hosted a competitive men’s match for far too long. </p> <p>Volunteers cleared rubbish and started the works to restore it, and a merger would result in men’s football returning to the ground in the 2023-24 season. If the merger goes through an application will be made to change the name to Bury FC, ending one of the key sticking points for BFCSS objectors who believe a team by any other name would not be the same as their previous love.</p> <p>“It would be absolutely magnificent to see football return,” Math Pickup, a BFCSS board member, says. “There would be a huge sense of relief after all the hard work we’ve been doing, there would be a sense of joy seeing football come back to Gigg Lane, which should be happening and it’s a travesty that it hasn’t been happening. It would be wonderful to see the fanbase come back together and be reunited and, for the community, it has lost part of its soul not being there. It would be a huge boost for the town, community and local businesses. There can only be positives.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a2e4cebce34415aa836df851ee42c82aa335d82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a2e4cebce34415aa836df851ee42c82aa335d82/0_299_4483_2690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans watch a Bury AFC match at Stainton Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans watch a Bury AFC match at Stainton Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To have a professional team back in Bury – and eventually the Football League – would be a great boon for the town. The council recognises the positives that come from full-time football, and what has been lost in recent years, and has arranged £450,000 of funding to assist making the ground a hub for the local community. The idea that football can be positive for the community is at the heart of the council’s thinking.

This would be the first club model of its type, having fans and private investors coming together, backed by its local council and central government, for the good of the town and community. If they can prove this concept works it could be an important moment in football club ownership. Bury will, sadly, almost certainly not be the last club that needs to start again, but they can be the phoenix flame to light the way for others.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/22/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T07:00:32Z","webTitle":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/22/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/22/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action","fields":{"headline":"Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action","trailText":"Howe points way forward for Manchester City’s rivals, Saliba hits right note for Arsenal and Lampard defends Gordon","byline":"Guardian sport","body":"<h2>1) Fearless Howe has Newcastle on the rise</h2> \n<p>Pep Guardiola’s football is not for everyone – some prefer a more emotional, aggressive style – but what cannot be argued is that it is the hardest style to beat. Though possession is not everything, against a team that has so much of it, an opponent needs to be almost perfect to get a result, and in the hour after they went behind, Newcastle were close to that, producing a scintillating display of power, bravery and imagination – for which Eddie Howe deserves much praise. It’s one thing saying you plan for your team to attack the defending champions with aggression, another to actually mean it, and something else entirely to convince your players that they’re good enough to pull it off. But Howe did all of that, presiding over a performance that will resonate throughout the league, showing other, more fearful – and for now, at least, more expensively assembled teams – what can be done with the right attitude, while also putting them on notice that Newcastle are coming. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/newcastle-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Newcastle 3-3 Manchester City</a></em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>2) Aaronson leaves Chelsea defenders blue</h2> \n<p>Brenden Aaronson’s brother, Paxten, plays for the Leeds playmaker’s MLS alma mater, Philadelphia Union, and his sister, Jaden, is also a fine footballer but the two US-based siblings will surely only be inspired by how the 21-year-old ran this rout of Chelsea for his new team. From a quasi-No 10 berth, Aaronson took many of the set-pieces and flitted all over the Elland Road turf, giving Thomas Tuchel’s vastly more experienced defenders – particularly Kalidou Koulibaly, Thiago Silva and Marc Cucurella – a serious runaround. In pickpocketing the hapless Édouard Mendy for the opener he ignited his team and scored his first Leeds goal. “I’ve dreamed about this for a long time and it’s a dream come true,” he said of what was only his second competitive appearance for the club. “It shows how much progress we have made.” Aaronson’s was a performance of maturity and augurs well for his and Leeds’s future. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/leeds-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Leeds 3-0 Chelsea</a></em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a4aa2e46-3106-4185-97f7-9085f039f835\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hNspekYeCKw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>3) Saliba makes Arsenal happy</h2> \n<p>William Saliba’s sweetly struck left-footed finish for Arsenal’s third goal at Bournemouth was a sublime – if slightly unexpected – moment of individual brilliance. But it was the centre-back’s defensive performance that had Mikel Arteta purring. The 21-year-old, who has spent the last two seasons on loan at Nice and Marseille, has been an assured presence in central defence since his debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/05/crystal-palace-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">at Crystal Palace on the opening day</a>. Saturday saw a pair of key interceptions, Kieffer Moore’s not inconsiderable physicality nullified and each of Saliba’s 76 passes completed. Arsenal fans’ adaptation of The Champs’ 1958 hit “Tequila” – with Saliba’s name inserted – rang out in the late evening sunshine at Bournemouth, before continuing in the Arsenal dressing room. It may become this season’s anthem. <strong>Sam Dalling</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/20/bournemouth-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Bournemouth 0-3 Arsenal</a></em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>4) Conte seeking midfield stability</h2> \n<p>Tottenham’s midfield has been a problem for two or three years now, and remains their biggest barrier to a title challenge. Antonio Conte’s 3-4-3 places a huge burden on the midfield two, who are frequently outnumbered by smart technical sides such as Chelsea last week, and Wolves on Saturday. The issue is not so much personnel – Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Rodrigo Bentancur are fine players – but control. When the front three and wing-backs can coordinate their press and win the territorial battle, as happened in the second half, it works. When they cannot, Spurs look vulnerable. <strong>Jonathan Liew</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/20/tottenham-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">Tottenham 1-0 Wolves</a></em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"448f3db2b18f8bbd9a5333b3b2e4b8182651194a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/448f3db2b18f8bbd9a5333b3b2e4b8182651194a/0_40_2689_1612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antonio Conte has a need for control at Spurs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antonio Conte is still searching for control at high-flying Spurs.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5) Manchester City’s comeback cannot hide vulnerability</h2> \n<p>No team, however brilliant, hits its peak more than a few times a season; City keep winning titles because their modal level is so high, and that was so before they signed Erling Haaland. But having added the game’s first lab-created goalmonster to a side that was already able to dominate any opponent, it’s almost impossible to see how they can be bested over 38 games – and yet. There are more good attackers in the Premier League than before, meaning there are now more teams theoretically able to take points off the best, and the downside of Pep Guardiola’s possession-heavy style is that his goalkeeper and defenders were recruited primarily for their on-ball ability, not their ability to keep goal and defend. So when they meet a side confident enough to go at them – as happens in the later stages of the Champions League – they can be punished and, though the relentless ferocity of their comeback against Newcastle shouldn’t be ignored, their domestic rivals would do well to take note nevertheless. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Jonathan Wilson: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/21/thrills-aplenty-in-the-premier-leagues-great-sportswashing-derby\">Thrills aplenty in the great sportswashing derby</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>6) Trossard’s brilliance benefits Brighton</h2> \n<p>Towards the end of last season, Leandro Trossard was linked with Newcastle, but as the transfer window rolls to a close, he remains at Brighton. “I thought it was a bit longer than that,” shrugged Graham Potter, when reminded that the Belgian has just a year left on his contract. Considering his team’s excellent start to the season without Yves Bissouma and Marc Cucurella, Potter is entitled to be unruffled by the thought of losing another player. He is a manager who makes frequent reference to the concept of “the collective”. Trossard was hailed as a budget Eden Hazard when he joined Brighton three years ago but it some time since we saw his compatriot – still at Real Madrid, in case you were wondering – show off such quality. Trossard’s finish for Brighton’s second goal, winning a battle of wits with Lukasz Fabianski after breaking through West Ham’s lines, showed just why the likes of Newcastle covet him. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/west-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report\">West Ham 0-2 Brighton</a></em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>7) Pereira finds new home at the Cottage</h2> \n<p>After spending four of the past six seasons out on loan from Manchester United, Andreas Pereira has finally found a permanent home at Fulham. Marco Silva brought the Belgian-born Brazilian midfielder to Craven Cottage this summer in the hope he could become a key cog on their return to the top flight. Aleksandr Mitrovic is rightly the man in the spotlight after his dramatic winner against Brentford but Pereira was imperative throughout for Fulham. On Saturday, Pereira pulled the strings in midfield and was a constant threat from set-pieces against a side that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/13/brentford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">ripped apart his former employers, Manchester United</a>, the week before. He looks settled and eager to finally prove he is worthy of being a Premier League player following 11 years at Old Trafford that saw him grace the English top flight on 45 occasions. Succeeding out of spite is a tried and tested method, and Pereira looks to be relishing his new prominent role. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/20/fulham-brentford-premier-league-match-report\">Fulham 3-2 Brentford</a></em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>8) Eze offers Palace another dimension</h2> \n<p>Wilfried Zaha rightly earned the plaudits for his double in Crystal Palace’s first win of the season but another forward also merits considerable credit for his supporting role in sweeping aside Aston Villa. Eberechi Eze was a revelation and the former QPR midfielder looks poised to add another dimension to the Palace attack this season. His recovery from a ruptured achilles tendon has taken time but the 24-year-old is now match fit and seemingly playing with the handbrake off. His stunning assist in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/15/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">draw at Liverpool</a> was an indication of his ability and vision, while his rampaging runs against at Selhurst Park had Villa toiling. Eze, who is playing with more freedom in the midfield after starting all three matches this season, has a great understanding with Zaha. If they both stay fit plenty of other Premier League opponents will be feeling as disorientated as Villa were on Saturday. <strong>Simon Mail</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/20/crystal-palace-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Crystal Palace 3-1 Aston Villa</a></em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a19fc4cb445d2ffa8fd6a2cb79aac883208ec68\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a19fc4cb445d2ffa8fd6a2cb79aac883208ec68/0_198_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aston Villa's John McGinn (left) tries to get to grips with Eberechi Eze during a fine display from the Crystal Palace playmaker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aston Villa's John McGinn (left) tries to get to grips with Eberechi Eze during a fine display from the Crystal Palace playmaker.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>9) Lampard leaps to Gordon’s defence</h2> \n<p>Frank Lampard was irritated by the focus on Anthony Gordon’s end product after Everton claimed their first point of the season against Nottingham Forest, given responsibility for 19 shots producing one late goal lay among several players. “I don’t want to make this a press conference about Anthony Gordon’s finishing,” said the Everton manager. “We work on it all the time with every attacking player.” The scrutiny was fair, and perfectly understandable at the end of a week in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/19/everton-frank-lampard-anthony-gordon-chelsea\">Everton rejected £45m from Chelsea</a> for the 21-year-old and explored a loan deal for Ajax’s attacking midfielder Mohammed Kudus. Gordon was one of the few Everton players to carry a threat in the final third against Forest but few of his five shots seriously troubled Dean Henderson. Lampard said: “Anthony has a lot of strings to his bow and goalscoring will come. At 20 years of age I wouldn’t have got into a modern-day Chelsea team with the way I was playing. I only felt confident to rack up big numbers when I was 23, 24 and onwards. It is a process.” <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/20/everton-nottingham-forest-premier-league-match-report\">Everton 1-1 Nottingham Forest</a></em></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>10) Will set-piece coach fix Foxes’ flaws?</h2> \n<p>No new signings on the horizon, a wantaway star player, a winless start to the season and a familiar defensive vulnerability; these are testing times for Leicester City and Brendan Rodgers. Leicester let in a joint league-high 19 goals from set pieces last season and have already conceded two from dead balls this campaign, with Southampton’s Che Adams profiting from a long throw to equalise on Saturday. Leicester, who took the lead through James Maddison’s precise free-kick, are trying to appoint a specialist set-piece coach, whose arrival has been held up by red tape. “He’s not coming in with a magic wand,” Rodgers said. “He’s going to give us a lot of analysis and he is a very skilled coach of course. But that [goal] is about basics, it’s about getting two contacts on the ball. If you don’t get the first contact, then a set-piece coach won’t make a magic difference to that.” <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Match report:<a

On the other hand, there are plenty of people out there, including some eminent climate scientists, who call out those touting more extreme scenarios as unhelpful doomers who are out of step with reality, and want nothing more than to scare the hell out of us.</p> <p>Doomism in the climate arena is nothing new, and looking around at the extreme weather rampaging across much of the world this summer, it is easy to understand why many of us might be scared about the future. But doomer feelings are not just vague intuitions of something nasty lying in wait. Some in the climate science community have also been damned as doomers too, even by colleagues, and their forecasts of bleak, climate-trashed futures are vetted and published in academic journals.</p> <p>In a<a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2012.0294\"> 2013 paper</a>, the distinguished climate scientist James Hansen and his co-authors, advised that burning all fossil fuels would bring about runaway heating and severe hothouse conditions that we could not adapt to, making most of the planet uninhabitable.</p> <p>Another study, published in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810141115\">warned</a> that we could cross a tipping point where no future actions would be able to prevent a march towards a “hothouse Earth”, ultimately culminating in by far the highest global temperature for more than a million years.</p> <p>A less extreme but still disturbing conclusion was arrived at in a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2007117117\">2020 paper</a> that showed the world was on a trajectory corresponding to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s worst-case scenario. This assumes no mitigation of emissions and sees us blithely continuing with business as usual, driving a catastrophic temperature rise of 5C or more by the century’s end. Actions on emissions are still happening far too slowly, but it is already clear that we are not collectively stupid enough to do nothing. Nonetheless, say the authors, considering our poor understanding of the impact of the feedback loops that reinforce heating, it would be judicious to plan for such an eventuality.</p> <p>The tensions between doomers and appeasers have been especially strained recently by the widely advertised publication of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/01/climate-endgame-risk-human-extinction-scientists-global-heating-catastrophe\">paper</a> whose authors have been thinking the unthinkable on our behalf. They conclude that ominously termed “climate endgame” scenarios – including societal collapse and the extinction of humankind – have so far been “dangerously unexplored”, and call on the IPCC to compile a special report on bad- to worst-case scenarios.</p> <p>Such calls are anathema to many climate appeasers, who feel that even voicing such concerns stymies action on emissions through promoting fear and engendering the feeling that it is already too late to bring global heating to heel. Other appeasers simply have an optimistic – some would say naive – outlook, and are brimming with confidence that humankind will overcome this problem, as it has all others. Neither perspective is helpful and indeed, either may well make the situation worse.</p> <p>Settling on an approach that would satisfy both appeasers and doomers is problematic and perhaps unrealistic. The truth is that the more extreme climate breakdown scenarios are very unlikely to be realised, and even those scientists who have flagged them agree with this. Nonetheless, they are possible, and as such we have a duty to address them, if only because adherence to the precautionary principle makes plain common sense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/top-us-business-lobby-group-climate-action-business-roundtable\">How a top US business lobby promised climate action – but worked to block efforts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While it would be nice to think that we are overplaying the threat of climate breakdown, following an appeaser line would be courting disaster. This is particularly the case as there seems to be a growing propensity to label pretty much anything outside the current consensus as doomist. But consensus doesn’t equate to being right. In fact, research has revealed that climate scientists as a tribe (of which I count myself a member), and IPCC reports <a href=\"https://www.breakthroughonline.org.au/whatliesbeneath\">underplay the speed</a> and intensity with which climate breakdown is happening.</p> <p>The reality is that our understanding of potential tipping points and feedback effects remains too poorly constrained for us to be confident of how severe climate breakdown will end up proving to be. Furthermore, minimising the potential impact of climate breakdown is more likely to lead to increased reticence in relation to slashing emissions than any potential exaggeration of the likely endgame.</p> <p>A middle of the road route would be to no one’s advantage – so, as for most situations wherein the risk is hard to quantify, there is only one sensible way forward: to hope for the best, while preparing for the worst.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bill McGuire is professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards at UCL, and the author of Hothouse Earth: an Inhabitant’s Guide</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Their children, Kim and Adam Hill, subsequently pursued a wrongful death lawsuit against Ford.</p> <p>According to the Hill family’s attorneys, the plaintiffs pursued the litigation in hopes of warning motorists about the trucks’ roofs. Ford defends its products’ quality and plans to appeal, seeking to reduce the amount of the fine, if not wipe it away entirely.</p> <p>“An award of punitive damages to hopefully warn people riding around in the millions of those trucks Ford sold was the reason the Hill family insisted on a verdict,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys said.</p> <p>On Thursday, a day before the verdict was delivered, the jury awarded the family of Melvin and Voncile Hill $24m in compensatory damages. According to the family’s attorneys, the jury allocated 70% of the blame to Ford.</p> <p>The other 30% of blame was allocated to Pep Boys, an automotive service chain that the jury said installed the wrong-sized tires on the Hills’s truck, resulting in the accident.</p> <p>Additionally, the jury determined Ford had sold 5.2m “Super Duty” trucks with weak roofs that would crush people in rollover accidents. The manufacturing flaw was in all “Super Duty” models made between 1999 and 2016, the family’s attorneys said.</p> <p>“While our sympathies go out to the Hill family, we do not believe the verdict is supported by the evidence, and we plan to appeal,” Ford said in a statement to the Associated Press on Sunday.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Butler insisted that the evidence in the case was stunning. “I used to buy Ford trucks,” he said on Sunday. “I thought nobody would sell a truck with a roof this weak. The damn thing is useless in a wreck. You might as well drive a convertible.”</p> <p>In closing arguments, lawyers hired by Ford defended the actions of the US car manufacturing firm as well as its engineers.</p> <p>William Withrow Jr, representing the Michigan-based company, said it was wrong to suggest “that Ford and its engineers acted willfully and wantonly, with a conscious indifference for the safety of the people who ride in their cars when they made these decisions about roof strength,” according to a court transcript.</p> <p>The allegation that Ford was irresponsible and willfully made decisions that put customers at risk is “simply not the case,” another defense lawyer, Paul Malek, said in the same closing argument.</p> <p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs had submitted evidence of nearly 80 similar rollover wrecks that involved truck roofs being crushed and injured or killed motorists, Butler’s law firm, Butler Prather LLP, said in a statement.</p> <p>“More deaths and severe injuries are certain because millions of these trucks are on the road,” Butler’s co-counsel, Gerald Davidson, said in that statement.</p> <p>This year, Ford has issued 49 recalls, more than any other automaker, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-faces-1-7-billion-verdict-in-fatal-rollover-of-f-250-pickup-11661033662\">according</a> to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p> <p>In an earnings call last month reported by the Wall Street Journal, Ford’s chief executive Jim Farley, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-faces-1-7-billion-verdict-in-fatal-rollover-of-f-250-pickup-11661033662?st=z1oyf2htg59vqn9&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share\">said</a>: “We continue to be hampered by recalls and customer-satisfaction actions.

CNN head Chris Licht, who took over after the February <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/02/jeff-zucker-resigns-cnn-relationship-senior-executive\">departure of Jeff Zucker</a>, has indicated that he wants to tone down the opinion quotient of its shows and “return” to an older, straighter and in his view less overtly leftwing style of reporting.</p> <p>It is perhaps predictable that Stelter was to become one of the first casualties among CNN’s stars under the new leadership. As NPR’s media correspondent, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/08/18/1118197553/brian-stelter-cnn-canceled-show\">David Folkenflik</a>, explained, Stelter was a thorn in the side of the Donald Trump White House, regularly exposing its lies and misinformation.</p> <p>As a result, he was “targeted for frequent criticism from conservatives for his coverage of the media during the Trump years”.</p> <p>Since Stelter’s booting, New York’s medialand has been rife with speculation about its causation. Some have pointed the finger at John Malone, a powerful Discovery investor who has led the charge that CNN is too partisan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1561387408381313024\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That was a lot of fun.

Last November, Malone told CNBC that he would like to see CNN “evolve back to the kind of journalism that it started with, and actually have journalists, which would be unique and refreshing”.</p> <p>Other speculation has focused on Stelter’s CNN salary – reported to be almost $1m a year – amid intense pressure to cut the network’s budget given heavy debts within the new media conglomerate.</p> <p>So far the number of star scalps has been relatively small. A week before Stelter was axed, CNN’s chief legal analyst for 20 years, Jeffrey Toobin, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/media/jeffrey-toobin-leaves-cnn/index.html\">announced that he was leaving</a>.</p> <p>Toobin had previously been suspended from the network for eight months after he exposed his genitals during a Zoom call with colleagues of his then-other media outlet, the New Yorker.</p> <p>With Stelter’s departure, the focus at CNN is now likely to shift to whether further casualties of the new “neutral” reporting policy lie ahead. Speculation rippled through social media that Don Lemon and Jim Acosta, two of the more outspoken hosts, might be vulnerable, but according to the entertainment news website <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/don-lemon-jim-acosta-expected-to-stay-cnn-neutral-direction-exclusive/\">the Wrap</a> they are safe for now.</p> <p>Part of Stelter’s argument as host of Reliable Sources, CNN’s longest-running show until its demise, was that it is the role of the media to hold power to account. That function was especially critical in the febrile age of Trump.</p> <p>With Trump hinting at another presidential run in 2024, Stelter appealed on Sunday to the bosses who had just fired him to remain resolute. “The watchword here is accountability,” he said. “CNN needs to be strong. I believe America needs CNN to be strong.”</p> <p>In his at times emotional last address on Reliable Sources, the largely bald-headed Stelter recalled his astonishment at becoming a TV star. “I never thought I’d actually be on TV – I just liked writing about TV,” he said. “I know this is going to sound like BS, but I thought I didn’t have enough hair to be on TV.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/22/from-clairo-to-sugababes-and-a-bunch-of-yeah-yeah-yeahs-autumn-2022s-essential-music","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T07:00:31Z","webTitle":"From Clairo to Sugababes, and a bunch of Yeah Yeah Yeahs: autumn 2022’s essential music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/22/from-clairo-to-sugababes-and-a-bunch-of-yeah-yeah-yeahs-autumn-2022s-essential-music","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/22/from-clairo-to-sugababes-and-a-bunch-of-yeah-yeah-yeahs-autumn-2022s-essential-music","fields":{"headline":"From Clairo to Sugababes, and a bunch of Yeah Yeah Yeahs: autumn 2022’s essential music","trailText":"Kid Cudi promises next-level treats, Lindsey Buckingham does trap, Benghazi synthpop hits the road, and the CBSO celebrates evolution with a Brett Dean premiere – here is the unmissable music of the next few months","byline":"Alexis Petridis,  Ammar Kalia and Andrew Clements","body":"<h2><strong>Pop, rock, rap and more</strong></h2> <h2>Foo Fighters’ Taylor Hawkins Tribute</h2> <p>Taking place in London and Los Angeles, the stadium-sized tributes to the late Foo Fighters drummer boast amazingly varied bills.

Opaque money eventually equates to opaque power; if dirty money is left to flow unhindered into the financial system, the cancer of corruption spreads, global development is retarded and inequity and inequality escalate.

The European Commission, through a contrived process, constructed two blacklists: one for countries they believe were not compliant with international tax standards, and the other for “third countries with weak anti-money-laundering and terrorist-financing regimes”.</p> <p>After the Paradise papers, the EU’s code of conduct group blacklisted 17 countries. Pierre Moscovici, economic affairs commissioner, said: “The adoption of the first ever EU blacklist of tax havens marks a key victory for transparency and fairness … We must intensify the pressure on listed countries to change their ways. Blacklisted jurisdictions must face consequences in the form of dissuasive sanctions … No one must get a free pass.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ed67c697813726fede9824f2bc499c7473b6c8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ed67c697813726fede9824f2bc499c7473b6c8c/0_0_4880_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Placards featuring the portraits of Chinese Communist party leader Xi Jinping and then British prime minister, David Cameron at the entrance of the regional head office of Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca in Hong Kong, April 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Placards featuring the portraits of Chinese Communist party leader Xi Jinping and then British prime minister, David Cameron at the entrance of the regional head office of Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca in Hong Kong, April 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 17 countries in the EU tax blacklist included: American Samoa, Barbados, Grenada, Guam, South Korea, Macau, the Marshall Islands, Namibia, Palau, Saint Lucia, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and the UAE.

Parliamentarians and legislators are equally responsible with their feet dragging to protect private interests in clear cut cases of corruption.</p> <p>The blacklists of the EU, self-appointed god of compliance, are nothing short of economic bullying and hypocrisy. The FATF and the OECD, the international tax authority, have already subjected these vulnerable countries to several processes. The FATF ensure all states are subject to a rigorous peer-review methodology that examines the legal framework to counter illicit finance as well as how effectively they are implemented. The European Commission’s oddly Europe-blind process for developing its lists contrasts starkly with FATF’s thoroughness. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jun/15/state-capture-corruption-blights-developing-world-us-europe-accomplices-mo-ibrahim\">Corruption blights the developing world but the US and Europe are accomplices | Kenneth Mohammed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All countries on the European blacklists are small and relatively underdeveloped; most are territories or ex-European colonies with small GDPs.</p> <p>The amount of money laundered through these countries is tiny in comparison to that of the money laundering cities of Europe.

It’s not near a significant river or estuary. It doesn’t sit on a hill, atop bountiful natural resources. Not only is Birmingham 105 miles from the nearest beach, but, writes Vinen, it is also “one of the least walkable cities in Britain”. Its districts are segregated by class, race and income as much as by its notorious road system.</p> <p>But it is in the middle. From the 18th century onwards, people were drawn to Birmingham by its centripetal position, as a site where useful things were made, traded and dispatched around the globe. Birmingham wasn’t just an engine of modern Britain: it built the very engines that helped make Britain rich. People kept coming to Birmingham for work even as work disappeared: from full employment in the mid-20th century it now has some of the highest unemployment in the country. It’s a city founded on work that lost most of its jobs.</p> <p>This may explain why Birmingham lacks a sense of place in the minds of all but those who were raised there, and even then – and I say this from experience, coming from the city’s eastern outskirts – not particularly well known. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/10/jonathan-meades-architecture-television-fiction\">Jonathan Meades</a>’s words, Brum is “an ignored void at the heart of the country”, an area rarely dwelt upon except as the butt of weak jokes about our accents and getting lost on Spaghetti Junction.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Chamberlain’s period as mayor of Birmingham, between 1873 and 1876, turned a messy town into a proudly equitable city</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Vinen’s biography of the city tries to put this right, and is a spirited attempt at uncovering the mystery of how Birmingham, in his view, has managed for so long to stand at the centre of Britain’s modern industrial, economic, political and cultural history without anyone noticing.</p> <p>It has had quietly revolutionary fingers in all these pies: developing precision engineering in the 18th and 19th centuries, defining and greatly extending the scope of local government at the turn of the 20th century, and, in the past 60 years, forging a distinctive multicultural identity, against all odds, where at its best no one is “less” or “more” Brummie than the next.</p> <p>This book arrives on the wave of excitement in the city created by the recent Commonwealth Games, but is timely for other reasons. In an age when privatised water companies can’t guarantee our supply and fuel suppliers try to treble our bills, all politicians would do well to remind themselves of how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/sep/20/nlgn-report-joseph-chamberlain-lessons\">Joseph Chamberlain</a> – “the most extraordinary British politician of the 19th century” in Vinen’s estimation – brought utilities under municipal control and became the Liberal who invented “gas-and-water socialism”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b246dd39ac25900f4c36ff7b0de4a75ae2f10baa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b246dd39ac25900f4c36ff7b0de4a75ae2f10baa/0_0_3538_3293/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The old Bull Ring Centre in Birmingham, built in 1964 and demolished in 2001\" width=\"1000\" height=\"931\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The old Bull Ring Centre in Birmingham, built in 1964 and demolished in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Kreuger/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chamberlain’s period as mayor of Birmingham, between 1873 and 1876, turned a messy town – literally, given how “excrement piled up in the streets and in the courts” of its slum housing – into a proudly equitable city. The <em>Birmingham Post</em>’s editor recorded how “the gas, cheapened to the lowest point, is (now) in the hands of the corporation and the water supply… is constant and unrestricted, alike to the poorest and the wealthiest in the town”.</p> <p>Chamberlain meant business. He “threatened that he would buy the gas company with his own money if the council failed to act”, also regarding “sanitary engineering (as) a hobby” of his. “Sometimes it seemed that sewage had become a weapon in a class war between the bourgeoisie on Birmingham council and the aristocratic landowners in the countryside around the town,” writes Vinen. Influenced by Ruskin, Chamberlain bought up and demolished swathes of city centre housing to create the grand Corporation Street, looking to “the possibility, made increasingly likely by new means of transport, that working-class people could be moved away from the centre of town altogether”.</p> <p>A combination of Chamberlain’s early drive, which rapidly took him into national politics, and waves of inward migration – roughly in order, from the rural Midlands, south-west England, Wales, Ireland, India, Pakistan and the Caribbean, and now from around the world – set Birmingham on a hard-to-reverse path to expansion far beyond its original boundaries. A ring of massive, largely white council estates was created on its outskirts, while a legacy of poor quality housing and vicious spatial racism persisted around its centre.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Arguably, the best way to think of Birmingham’s spirit is through its music, which Vinen, rightly, also foregrounds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1976, the National Front managed to mobilise a campaign in support of Robert Relf, jailed in Winson Green prison for advertising his house for sale “to an English family only”. “War service” was a criteria for the offer of a council house until the same year. A Barbadian bus driver commented to an interviewer how “only white people had houses, black people lived in maisonettes and tower blocks”, of which the city built more than 430 between the 1950s and 70s.</p> <p>After the war, Chamberlain’s municipal legacy mutated into the hubristic “motor city” with which its mid-20th-century chief engineer, Herbert Manzoni, was associated. The act of building cars and having roads to drive them on became central to Birmingham’s identity – somewhat inconveniently for those who neither built nor drove them.</p> <p>The city, notes Vinen, “became chained to the car industry”, causing its dramatic fall from prosperity into mass poverty when car production moved largely overseas. Brummies were more aware than anyone that they “lived in a man-made city… as though cars, motorways and high-rise buildings had become ends in themselves rather than means of providing for needs”.</p> <p>Birmingham can be a maddening city to come from. Growing up there, you’re only vaguely aware of the sorts of events and processes that are foremost in the collective memories of, say, Mancunians or Liverpudlians. It’s in the DNA of Brummies to minimise our role in changing things, to our detriment. Arguably, the best way to think of Birmingham’s spirit is through its music, which Vinen, rightly, also foregrounds. The Beatles and the Stone Roses? I raise you Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, the Move, Stevie Winwood, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dexys-midnight-runners\">Dexys Midnight Runners</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/23/duran-duran-on-rio-what-it-means-punishment\">Duran Duran</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/30/reggae-revolutionary-bob-marley-britain\">Steel Pulse</a>, the Beat, UB40, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/02/mike-skinner-streets-interview-computers-blues\">Mike Skinner</a>, Broadcast and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/13/rapper-stefflon-don-interview-i-am-never-scared-to-try-things\">Stefflon Don</a>.</p> <p>The great majority of these acts, in their own ways, have sought to elevate the ordinary into the sublime: to escape, to take flight, but also to celebrate how ordinariness, in Vinen’s words, “confers its own importance… Birmingham reminds us that most people’s lives do not revolve around such things” as political centres and grand buildings, but around work, love and snatching luxury when and where you can.

In 2019, when exams were last held, only a fifth (20.8%) of entries achieved at least a 7 or an A grade.</p> <p>Prof Smithers said grades were expected to move back to around halfway between those of 2021 and 2019, meaning disappointment for many.</p> <p>“In 2022, we can reasonably expect to see a drop in top grades, with many more failing to reach the pass level (C/4),” he said. “In England, the biggest percentage fall will be at Grade 9 and many more will fall below Grade 4.</p> <p>“We can take the A-level results as pointers. At A-level, the top grades were cut, but not as far as the government was wanting, I suspect because high marks were scored in the easier exams, and lower grades for higher marks is going to be difficult to defend on appeal.”</p> <p>He said he expected girls to remain “a long way ahead of boys, with only a small narrowing of the gap from the return to exams”. In the latest A-level results, girls continued to outperform boys overall, although the gap was smaller.</p> <p>The proportion of girls who got an A or above was 2.2 percentage points higher than boys this year, compared with a 4.8 percentage points difference last year.</p> <p>This year’s A-level results also showed a growing attainment gap between the more affluent London and south-east regions and the north-east. While the gap between the south and the north-east was between 4 and 5 percentage points in 2019, it now stands at more than 8 percentage points.</p> <p>As with A-levels, extra help was provided for GCSE students with the return to exams, including more generous grading, advance information on topics, formulae and equation sheets for GCSE maths, physics and combined science exams.</p> <p>Prof Smithers said: “Girls have been a lot further ahead at GCSE than at A-level, so I would not expect to see a significant impact on GCSEs, especially with the modified exams.”</p> <p>Figures covering GCSE entries from students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be published by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) on Thursday.</p> <p>While traditional A*-G grades are used in Northern Ireland and Wales, in England these have been replaced with a 9-1 system, where 9 is the highest. A 4 is broadly equivalent to a C grade, and a 7 is broadly equivalent to an A.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/16/no-improvement-in-school-attainment-gap-in-england-for-20-years-report-says\">A study</a>, published last week, found that 16-year-olds who are eligible for free school meals are about 27 percentage points less likely to earn good GCSEs than their less disadvantaged peers, and concluded that the attainment gap between poorer pupils and their better-off classmates is as large now as it was 20 years ago.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2022/aug/22/sennheiser-momentum-4-review-tremendous-noise-cancelling-headphones-bluetooth-battery","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"Sennheiser Momentum 4 review: tremendous noise-cancelling headphones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/22/sennheiser-momentum-4-review-tremendous-noise-cancelling-headphones-bluetooth-battery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/aug/22/sennheiser-momentum-4-review-tremendous-noise-cancelling-headphones-bluetooth-battery","fields":{"headline":"Sennheiser Momentum 4 review: tremendous noise-cancelling headphones","trailText":"Supremely comfortable, feature-packed Bluetooth cans sound brilliant with 60-hour battery life","byline":"Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor","body":"<p>The fourth-generation of the Momentum Bluetooth headphones from the renowned German audio manufacturer Sennheiser are a wholesale redesign, ditching their previous retro styling for something simpler and much more comfortable.

They are the sort of quality headphones that will have you hearing new elements in your favourite tracks, right up there with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/25/sony-wh-1000xm4-review-bose-beating-noise-cancelling-headphones\">Sony</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/21/apple-airpods-max-review-bluetooth-noise-cancelling-headphones-sound-price\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/17/bowers-wilkins-px7-review-bose-beating-noise-cancelling-headphones\">B&amp;W</a>. They have a pleasing balance between powerful, deep bass, warm mids and sparkling highs, without any one element overriding the others. They maintain the separation of tones and preserve detail even in the most complex tracks.</p> <p>The headphones do an excellent job with all music genres, making them extremely adaptable while also handling action-filled movie soundtracks with suitable bombast and immersion. The Control app has an equaliser, bass boost, podcast mode and a system that helps you tailor the sound of the headphones to your liking.</p> <p>They have effective noise-cancelling that can meaningfully reduce rumbles, fan and road noise, and do a reasonable job on higher-pitched tones such as voices or keyboard taps in an office. They can’t quite match the very best from Sony or Bose, but they aren’t too far off. The adaptive system automatically turns down the noise-cancelling when in quieter places and they handle wind noise very well – something that trips up some competitors.</p> <p>You can also manually adjust how much outside sound is let in with a slider in the app or the pinching-to-zoom gesture on the headphones adjusting from maximum noise-cancelling to full transparency, so you can have as little or as much awareness of the outside world as you prefer.</p> <p>The transparency mode is very good, too, although on maximum it is louder than not wearing the headphones. Finally, call quality is excellent, matching the very best headphones without a boom mic, even in noisy environments.</p> <h2>Extremely long battery life</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b051ced13b839efe222f09955d73ab261c69bba1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b051ced13b839efe222f09955d73ab261c69bba1/85_0_5215_3129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The end of the ear cups of the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless headphones showing the USB-C charging and analogue cable sockets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It takes about two hours to fully charge them, with a five-minute quick charge adding up to four hours of playback when low.

They automatically switch off after 15 minutes of being on standby or when placed in the case, too, but I found it more convenient to manually turn them off with the power button.</p> <h2>Sustainability</h2> <p>The battery in the headphones is not replaceable but Sennheiser estimates it will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity after 30,000 hours of listening, which is 27 years of listening three hours a day, meaning it is never likely to need replacing.</p> <p>Spare parts including cushions and cables are available. The headphones do not contain any recycled material. Sennheiser Consumer’s parent company, Sonova, <a href=\"https://www.sonova.com/en/protecting-planet\">publishes sustainability reports</a> but does not operate trade-in schemes in the UK.</p> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless cost <a href=\"https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-UK/p/momentum-4-wireless\">£299.99</a> (<a href=\"https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-us/p/momentum-4-wireless/\">$349.99</a>/<a href=\"https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-au/p/momentum-4-wireless/\">A$549.99</a>) in black or white and ship on the 23 August.</p> <p>For comparison, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/21/bose-qc45-review-commuter-favourite-noise-cancelling-headphones-revamped\">Bose QuietComfort 45</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort-headphones-45.html\">£319.95</a>, the Sony WH-1000XM5 cost <a href=\"https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm5\">£379</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/21/apple-airpods-max-review-bluetooth-noise-cancelling-headphones-sound-price\">Apple AirPods Max</a> cost <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-airpods/airpods-max/silver\">£549</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are some of the very best-sounding, longest-lasting and the most comfortable noise-cancelling headphones available.</p> <p>What they lack in the visual flair of their predecessors, they make up for in performance. The battery lasts for a full 60 hours of playback, with effective noise-cancelling. They are well balanced with thoughtful tweaks to make them super-comfortable even for very long listening sessions.</p> <p>They support the latest aptX Adaptive standard and can connect to two Bluetooth devices at the same time. You can even use them for audio as well as charging over USB-C, plus they still have an analogue headphones cable. Even the controls and voice call performance are top notch.</p> <p>The best bit is how they sound, producing the sort of sparkling audio few top rivals match for a set of wireless headphones.</p> <p>There’s little to fault. The design might not excite. They don’t fold up quite as compact as the very best. You can’t replace the battery but it will probably outlast the headphones anyway. At £299 they are competitively priced, if not exactly cheap.</p> <p>If you want some high-end noise-cancelling headphones, the Momentum 4 are worth every penny.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> fantastic sound, effective noise-cancelling, 60-hour battery life, super-comfortable, Bluetooth 5.2 with aptX Adaptive and multipoint, USB-C charging and audio, 2.5/3.5mm analogue cable, great controls, top voice quality, good cross-platform app.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> expensive, don’t fold up as compact as the best, design less standout than predecessors.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18a13893895d905f1ccb1f872ebe89a62367e133\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18a13893895d905f1ccb1f872ebe89a62367e133/205_483_4426_2655/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless headphones shown in their travel case.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Momentum 4 fold flat in a good hard case, but do not fully collapse making them slightly larger than the best when packed away for travel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/16/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-review-great-noise-cancelling-earbuds\">Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 review: great noise-cancelling earbuds</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/25/sony-wh-1000xm4-review-bose-beating-noise-cancelling-headphones\">Sony WH-1000XM4 review: Bose-beating noise cancelling headphones</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/21/bose-qc45-review-commuter-favourite-noise-cancelling-headphones-revamped\">Bose QC45 review: commuter favourite noise-cancelling headphones revamped</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/21/apple-airpods-max-review-bluetooth-noise-cancelling-headphones-sound-price\">Apple AirPods Max review: stunning sound, painful price</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/10/anker-soundcore-life-q35-review-budget-headphones-with-good-noise-cancelling\">Anker Soundcore Life Q35 review: budget headphones with good noise-cancelling</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/10/urbanista-los-angeles-review-solar-charging-headphones-bluetooth\">Urbanista Los Angeles review: solar charging headphones for epic battery</a></strong></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/22/myleene-klass-honest-playlist","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T06:00:30Z","webTitle":"‘I stole CDs off the front of Reader’s Digest’: Myleene Klass’s honest playlist ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/22/myleene-klass-honest-playlist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/22/myleene-klass-honest-playlist","fields":{"headline":"‘I stole CDs off the front of Reader’s Digest’: Myleene Klass’s honest playlist ","trailText":"The former Hear’Say singer grew up on Kylie and Gustav Holst, and can belt out the Clash, but whose songs will she always avoid at karaoke?","byline":"As told to Rich Pelley","body":"<p><strong>The first song I remember hearing</strong><br>I’m from six generations of classical musicians, so my dad often played Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia from the ballet Spartacus by Aram Khachaturian.

Almost all the money for the purchase was provided by my father – who died in July 2020 – as a gift. Even though he died less than seven years after giving me the money, there was no inheritance tax to pay on it because his estate (including the gift) was valued at less than the £325,000 nil-rate band.</p> <p>I am in the process of relocating to Scotland, with a view, once settled, to purchasing another property (this time with my partner) without selling my existing property. My plan for a while has been to rent out my current house – because of the disparity in property values, this should cover any mortgage payments on a new property and allow me to retain the English property as a retirement nest egg to sell 20 to 25 years down the line. I’m aware that I would be liable for capital gains tax (CGT) at that point, although I think I would be able to claim some relief for the years I was living in the house.</p> <p>I’ve been told by family members recently that I shouldn’t pursue this option. Instead, I should look to sell the house in England right now and take the gain tax free, thus avoiding a tax bill down the line. They then suggested using some of the money to purchase another, cheaper property and use that as an asset for future income. When I pointed out that any increase in value of that property would also leave me liable for CGT, they seemed to think that my current property’s status as being bought with money received as a gift would leave me liable for a far higher bill, and also warned that I could get hit by something unforeseen in the differences in English and Scottish law. They say that a clean break now would alleviate these potential issues.</p> <p>I’m struggling to find advice for my exact situation. I can find general guidance for each facet individually but nothing that brings together CGT on rented properties, properties purchased with gifts and potential effects between English and Scottish law. I think there’s a lot of worry over nothing but need to ask the question to defuse family arguments. Can you help?<br><strong>RM</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Your family members clearly haven’t Googled “CGT in Scotland”; otherwise they would know that the rules for calculating capital gains tax – and also inheritance tax – are the same right across the UK. The taxes that are different in Scotland are Scottish income tax and land and buildings transaction tax (LBTT) which has replaced stamp duty land tax in Scotland since 1 April 2015. They would also know that CGT in Scotland is calculated on the UK thresholds rather than Scottish income tax bands, which means that if you are a higher-rate taxpayer under the Scottish system you still pay the basic rate of CGT of 18% unlike higher-rate taxpayers living in the rest of the UK, who pay the higher rate of 28%.</p> <p>Heaven only knows what your family members Googled to come up with the fiction that is saying that CGT is affected by the way the purchase of a property is financed. The source of the money you used to buy your current home makes no difference to the eventual gain, and so the CGT bill. The gain (or loss) is calculated as the sale price less the purchase price less various expenses whether you were given money, took out a mortgage or used the cash you had stuffed under the mattress. I completely fail to see why differences in English and Scottish law could affect your potential CGT bill but perhaps your family members would like to share their workings.</p> <p>I do agree with your family that selling your current property and buying a buy-to-let in Scotland would be a better option but not for the reasons they give. It just seems more practical as managing a property rental from the other end of the country might be a bit stressful unless you paid a letting agent to do it for you.</p> <p>What really puzzles me is why you are letting your family interfere in your – and your partner’s – personal finances. I have my suspicions that it may have something to do with the money your father gave you but that was his business, not theirs, and definitely not mine.</p> <p>• Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

Across the US, anti-abortion activists in red states chipped away at access and pushed for conservative judges to secure their gains. Yet for many Americans, the prospect of losing the constitutional right to abortion that had existed since 1973 remained worrying but remote.</p> <p>That all changed in June, when in Dobbs v Jackson, the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the 49-year-old ruling which had established the right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/22/brian-stelter-cnn-cancels-show-reliable-sources\">Brian Stelter rebukes CNN on final show: ‘It’s not partisan to stand up to demagogues’ </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since then, bans have taken effect in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2022/jun/28/tracking-where-abortion-laws-stand-in-every-state\">at least 10 states</a>. Republicans are rushing ahead with new restrictions and stirring fears that other rights, including same-sex marriage and access to contraception, could be vulnerable too.</p> <p>And yet, from rural Minnesota to ruby red Kansas and a conservative corner of Nebraska, there are signs of a brewing backlash that Democrats believe will reshape the battle for control of Congress and statehouses this fall.</p> <p>Republicans are “the dog that caught the bus”, said Cecile Richards, a former head of Planned Parenthood. “This is what they’ve been wanting for years. Now they own it.”</p> <p>White House officials, Democratic candidates and party strategists say the loss of reproductive choice has not only galvanized their once-<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/democrats-face-double-digit-enthusiasm-deficit-ahead-midterms-n1287910\">disillusioned</a> base but is strengthening Democrats’ appeal among independent and Republican-leaning women in suburbs who were key to the party’s recent victories.</p> <p>The landslide vote to protect abortion rights in conservative Kansas earlier this month further emboldened Democrats – and emphasized that Republicans risk overreaching on one of the most emotionally charged issues in American life.</p> <p>“The world just completely flipped upside down after the Dobbs decision,” said Richards, now co-chair at American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal Super Pac. “We’re no longer defending a right. We now actually have to fight to get a right back.”</p> <h2>‘A top-tier issue’</h2> <p>Republicans doubt abortion will be a decisive factor in a midterm election shaped by anxiety over high gas prices and inflation and an unpopular Democratic president.</p> <p>“Every public and private poll shows inflation and the economy are the top issues headed into the midterms,” said Mike Berg, a spokesman for the Republican National Congressional Committee. “Democrats are desperate to talk about anything else because they have a disastrous record on both of those issues.”</p> <p>But Democrats are forging ahead, lashing Republicans over their uncompromising stances and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/01/utah-republican-women-control-intake-of-semen-abortion\">sometimes bizarre</a> rhetoric on abortion.</p> <p>Underscoring their confidence in the salience of abortion this election cycle, Democrats are spending heavily on television ads on the subject. One particularly searing ad from Stacey Abrams, the nominee for governor in Georgia, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1554830008350216196\">features a somber montage of women</a> warning that women could be “criminalized” for seeking abortions if Brian Kemp, the Republican governor, is re-elected.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many ads aim to use Republicans’ words against them, as part of an effort by Democrats to cast the GOP as too extreme</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“The only way to stop this attack on the women of Georgia,” the women say, “is to stop Brian Kemp.”</p> <p>Many of their ads aim to use Republicans’ words against them, as part of a broader effort by Democrats to cast the GOP as too extreme.</p> <p>In Michigan, where <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/politics/midterms-abortion-access.html\">voters may decide</a> to enshrine abortion protections in the state constitution in November, the Democratic Governors Association launched an ad attacking the Republican nominee, Tudor Dixon, over her opposition to abortion, without exception for rape or incest.</p> <p>In a similar vein, an ad from the the Democratic nominee for governor in Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, features his far-right opponent, Doug Mastriano, saying “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzkexwZMmoE\">I don’t give a way for exceptions</a>”, including when the life of the mother is at risk.</p> <p>Polling has shown that most Americans support at least some abortion rights. According to the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/05/06/americas-abortion-quandary/\">Pew Research Center</a>, about 60% say abortion should be legal in all or most cases while just 8% say it should be illegal with no exceptions.</p> <p>The aggressive messaging from Democrats is a reminder of how rapidly the politics of abortion have shifted.</p> <p>Molly Murphy, a Democratic pollster and strategist who has studied public opinion on abortion, said: “Six months ago, if you asked voters, ‘What’s the top priority that you want elected leaders to focus on,’ abortion might get 3%, 4%, 5% at most. Now it really is a top-tier issue, only behind inflation and the economy.”</p> <p>Murphy said anti-abortion’s resounding defeat in the Kansas referendum showed voters were motivated by the opportunity “to stop something bad from happening”. To channel that fury, she said, Democrats must convince voters Republicans are not just opposed to abortion but a threat to it.</p> <p>Some Democrats are adopting Republican language about government overreach on issues like masking to accuse their opponents of infringing on individual rights and freedoms when it comes to women’s reproductive health. It is all part of a broader strategy to cast Republicans as extremists determined to strip Americans of a right they have come to rely on.</p> <p>The pitch is similar to Democrats’ messaging in 2018, when they stormed to victory in the House after lashing Republicans over attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, said Camille Rivera, a Democratic strategist.</p> <p>“As we learned with Obamacare, once you have a right, you don’t want, really don’t want, that right taken away,” she said.</p> <p>Another key question for this November is just how much abortion rights will resonate among independent women in battleground suburbs who have deep concerns about the economy. Sarah Longwell, a moderate Republican strategist, said abortion was usually not the first issue raised in focus groups with swing voters. But when prompted, the discussion around abortion often became personal.</p> <p>“The thing that happens when you start talking to a group of women about abortion is they immediately start telling stories about complications and the things that can go wrong during a pregnancy,” she said in a recent interview.</p> <p>What is clear, Longwell said, is that women, even those who call themselves “pro-life”, are “deeply uncomfortable with the idea of getting between women and their doctors on decisions that could put their lives at risk”.</p> <h2>‘We are living it’</h2> <p>Republicans are largely shying away from the issue on the campaign trail. With total bans proving deeply unpopular, some candidates are softening their rhetoric, emphasizing support for exceptions and for the health and wellbeing of women. In Nevada, a battleground state, the Republican candidate for Senate, Adam Laxalt, has argued that his personal opposition to abortion would not change protections already in place.</p> <p>“My views have not shifted the policy in Nevada, nor has the ruling in the Dobbs case,” Laxalt <a href=\"https://www.rgj.com/story/opinion/voices/2022/08/02/setting-record-straight-adam-laxalt/10187587002/\">wrote</a> earlier this month. “Voters in 1990 determined that Nevada is and will remain a pro-choice state.”</p> <p>But the issue is hard to ignore. Harrowing stories have spread. A 10-year-old girl who was raped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/27/indiana-investigates-abortion-doctor-10-year-old-rape-victim\">had to travel from Ohio</a> to Indiana to get an abortion. Weeks later, Indiana became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/06/indiana-assembly-passes-anti-abortion-bill-sends-it-to-governor\">first state in the post-Roe era</a> to adopt a near-total ban. This week, a judge in Florida told a 16-year-old she was not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/florida-pregnant-teenager-abortion-court\">“not sufficiently mature”</a> to decide whether to have an abortion.</p> <p>“We are no longer speaking about this as a hypothetical,” Murphy said. “We are living it.”</p> <p>Among Kansans who registered to vote in the wake of the Dobbs ruling, Democrats held an eight-point advantage, according to <a href=\"https://insights.targetsmart.com/how-abortion-changed-the-kansas-electorate.html\">data</a> from TargetSmart. Among those newly registered voters, 70% were women.</p> <p>Elsewhere, in a pair of post-Roe special House elections, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/10/democrats-minnesota-nebraska-special-elections/\">Democrats outperformed expectations</a>, boosted by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/10/democrats-special-election-minnesota-roe/\">strong turnout</a> in suburban areas.</p> <p>In Minnesota’s first district, the Democrat lost by just four points. Donald Trump won there by more than 10 in 2020. The trend was more pronounced in a June election in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/05/trailer-nationalize-this-race-democrats-run-abortion-special-elections/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5\">Nebraska’s first district</a>. Two years ago, Trump won there by nearly 15 points. This year, the Republican won by six.</p> <p>Analysts caution against drawing firm conclusions from such a small sampling. Republicans only need to win a handful of seats to gain control of the House, as they are <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/\">favored</a> to do, while the 50-50 Senate remains a<a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/senate/senate-overview/three-senate-rating-changes-pennsylvania-colorado-and-utah\">genuine toss-up.</a></p> <p>A special election in New York on Tuesday may offer more clues. In the most competitive House race since Roe fell, the Democrat, Pat Ryan, has made abortion central to his campaign. The Republican, Marc Molinaro, has focused on the economy and inflation.</p> <p>Urging New Yorkers to vote, Ryan said “choice” and “freedom” were both “on the ballot”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/aug/22/a-locals-guide-to-bilbao-spain-guggenheim","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T06:00:30Z","webTitle":"A local’s guide to Bilbao, Spain: home of the Guggenheim – and so much more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/22/a-locals-guide-to-bilbao-spain-guggenheim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/aug/22/a-locals-guide-to-bilbao-spain-guggenheim","fields":{"headline":"A local’s guide to Bilbao, Spain: home of the Guggenheim – and so much more","trailText":"Gaizka Zuazo, director of the city’s school of design, knows where to find the best steaks, late-night bars and post-industrial cool","byline":"Interview by Stephen Burgen","body":"<h2>Food</h2> <p>Bilbao is probably not the ideal city for vegetarians as we do eat an awful lot of meat, especially the famous <em>chuletón</em> or T-bone steak. The meat is dry-cured for 40-60 days and then served with your own mini-barbecue on the table, so you can cook it to your taste. For an particularly good chuletón, go to <a href=\"https://sugarra.eus/\" title=\"\">Sugarra</a> in the old city.

Be sure to order the delicious <em>zamburiñas</em> (small scallops) – they’re speciality of the house.</p> <h2>Inspiration</h2> <p>Bilbao has undergone a huge transformation: from an industrial city built on the iron trade to one where art and culture – and tourism too – have come to the fore. The inauguration of the <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/\" title=\"\">Guggenheim Museum</a> in 1997 made a huge impact, but as well as more mainstream centres, alternative art and cultural bodies are now being established in old industrial buildings, where owners are charging low rents rather than see their properties decay. <a href=\"https://www.ied.edu/bilbao\" title=\"\">For example, IED Kunsthal Bilbao</a>, the school where I teach, is a former paint factory. Plus, there are some cool new galleries in the San Francisco area, such as <a href=\"https://www.scgallery.es/en/\" title=\"\">SC Gallery</a> and <a href=\"http://espaciomarzana.com/\" title=\"\">Espacio Marzana</a>.</p> <h2>Neighbourhood</h2> <p>Years of neglect left the San Francisco neighbourhood very at down at heel, but now thanks to the low rents for premises, young entrepreneurs, artists and designers are able to set up shop there. Be warned, though: the gentrification has only just begun, and at night the area may feel a little too edgy for some people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Thanks to the low rents, young entrepreneurs, artists and designers are able to set up shop</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I grew up on the opposite side of the river, in the old quarter of the city, Casco Viejo, and for my money it’s still the most attractive and stimulating part, with its cobbled streets and innumerable bars. The temptation to eat is everywhere, from the restaurants and <em>pintxo</em> bars to delicatessens such as <a href=\"https://www.gregoriomartin.es/\" title=\"\">Ultramarinos Gregorio Martín </a>and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/laqueseriabilbao/\" title=\"\">La Queseria</a>. When you feel the need for a bit of breathing space in the narrow, busy streets, stop for coffee or a beer in sunlit Plaza Nueva, which has bars on all four sides.</p> <h2>Green space</h2> <p>The Nervión River is the heart of the city. Bilbao has gone from being industrial and grey, albeit with a certain charm, to a place where people enjoy walking and cycling, with a series of linked green spaces. There are parks – such as the <a href=\"https://www.bilbaoturismo.net/BilbaoTurismo/eu/parques/dona-casilda\" title=\"\">Doña Casilda Iturrizar</a>, opened in 1907 in the more modern Ensanche district, which until recently was the only green space in the city. But Bilbao is surrounded by mountains, and there is open countryside just a 20-minute walk from the city centre. Some slopes are rather a steep climb, but Artxanda<strong> </strong>has a funicular.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jul/25/a-locals-guide-to-madrid-paella-bazaars-and-mojitos-under-palm-trees\">A local’s guide to Madrid: paella, bazaars and mojitos under palm trees</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Nightlife</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63694313964ced0f164ae5bf84ad5737a23f3267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63694313964ced0f164ae5bf84ad5737a23f3267/0_497_7360_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plaza Nueva.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plaza Nueva.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Brooks/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In summertime and at weekends many of the bars in the Casco Viejo stay open until 3am. <a href=\"http://bilbao-cafebar.com/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Café Bar Bilbao</a> in Plaza Nueva is a classic while a younger crowd might prefer <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100054608883097\" title=\"\">Café Nervión</a>.

He had made a deal with his wife, Sally: she would train as a yoga teacher and he would “start out as an adventure cyclist”.</p> <p>Four months later, he set off on a 13,000km cycle ride from Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia to Edinburgh, much of it roughly shadowing Marco Polo’s Silk Road. No sooner had he started out than a snowstorm hit. He hid in his tent, wearing every item of clothing he had packed. At -18C it was too cold to venture outside to cook. He survived the next 48 hours by eating a “massive bag of Snickers and Crunchies” his colleagues had given him when he retired.</p> <p>So it is a surprise to hear Collingwood say that he has never feared for his life. Except occasionally when a car veered too close, that is. Surely there were days on that six-month journey when he couldn’t face the saddle?</p> <p>“Never. There’s always something to be curious about,” he says. “And I’m very happy in my own company.”</p> <p>Collingwood has minimised his equipment, often using tips from mountaineers. On very wet or windy nights, he might sleep in a culvert. In 2018 he <a href=\"https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-grandad-officially-breaks-world-17210940\">pedalled solo in a single-speed rickshaw</a> from Edinburgh to Istanbul to earn a place in<strong> </strong>Guinness World Records. “There are very few records a man over 60 can break,” he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a0d9dacddfed118723a0732c51d54859aedd8540\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0d9dacddfed118723a0732c51d54859aedd8540/0_100_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘ It’s not a lot of effort, just a matter of spinning the wheels’ … Collingwood on his way from Land’s End to John o’Groats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘ It’s not a lot of effort, just a matter of spinning the wheels’ … Collingwood on his way from Land’s End to John o’Groats.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Urszula Soltys/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He turns 71 this year. As we speak, he is perched on the sea wall in Penzance, Cornwall, about to pedal to Land’s End to begin the 1,407km trip to John o’Groats. It sounds arduous but he insists “it’s not a lot of effort. The gearing is so low, it’s just a matter of spinning the wheels.”</p> <p>Still, they don’t spin on their own. His daughter – like Sally, a yoga teacher – has suggested weights to maintain muscle mass. He plans to start in the autumn. His son, an ultra-distance cyclist, keeps him up to speed on the latest technology. They each came to cycling independently of one another. “If there is a shared inspiration, it’s the humble bicycle that has the capacity to enable the rider to travel vast distances fast or slow,” Collingwood says.</p> <p>His parents never cycled. His older sister had a bike that he rode back when the handlebars were higher than his head, always going “a bit further down the road, a bit further”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/15/a-new-start-after-60-i-became-a-security-guard-at-66-am-i-ever-scared-no\">A new start after 60: ‘I became a security guard at 66.

It was the incongruity of Italian clothes and camels that caught Collingwood’s eye. The Guinness Book of Records, as it was then, was another favourite: “I would go over and over it.”</p> <p>Collingwood was a precocious reader, but grammar school was not a happy place for him. His family could not afford the uniform and he felt conspicuous.</p> <p>“I fell in with the rebellious crowd,” he says. At 12, he and his friends bought a motorbike to ride around the fields near his home in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. At 15, he started an apprenticeship in heavy mechanical maintenance. But when he finished, he felt a yearning. “I wanted to do something different,” he says.</p> <p>The local psychiatric hospital<strong>, </strong>West Cheshire,<strong> </strong>was looking for nursing assistants. Spurred on by his reading of RD Laing, Thomas Szasz and David Cooper, Collingwood applied and trained. He spent the next 45 years as a mental health nurse with a specialism in psychotherapy and family therapy. “I’ve always been earnest of purpose. If something is to be done, it is to be done properly.”</p> <p>The job taught him resilience. “People go forwards and people go backwards. The difficult bit is managing the times when people go backwards,” he says. “Don’t let the moment spoil the whole thing.”</p> <p>In Mongolia he got a dozen punctures in the space of an hour. But he fixed each one till he was patching the patches.</p> <p>Collingwood is planning new rides in France next year, and beyond that hopes “to spread my wings further.

Since the end of the Silvio Berlusconi era in 2011, Italian politics has been characterised by its instability. In next month’s election, that could change. The beneficiaries are the inheritors of Benito Mussolini.</p> <p>Giorgia Meloni’s post-fascist Brothers of Italy party have come almost from nowhere, gaining just 4% of the vote in the 2018 election. But now the far-right group is at the helm of a coalition which is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-19/italy-right-wing-bloc-nears-50-support-in-poll-for-autumn-vote\">polling almost 50%</a>, and victory looks all but certain, and likely to bring with it a more stable coalition than its recent predecessors.</p> <p>Brothers of Italy themselves have the support of about a quarter of voters. That level of popularity could allow a new government with Meloni at the helm to change the Italian constitution.</p> <p>Meloni is an admirer of the Hungarian nationalist prime minister Viktor Orbán; an opponent of gay rights; and wants a naval blockade to stop undocumented immigrants coming to Italy from Libya. But she is also an advocate of free nursery places, claims to be pro-Ukraine, has toned down her party’s anti-EU stance, and wants to create a family allowance of €400 a month. Meanwhile, many fear that her opponents on the left have lost the ability to connect with the working-class voters who were once their bedrock.</p> <p>Sound familiar? It is – up to a point. Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s Rome correspondent, Angela Giuffrida, is about what Meloni is up to, and what it means for Italy’s future. Here are the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Social care </strong></em>| Thousands of vulnerable people are suffering inadequate care due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/aug/21/staffing-crisis-leaves-many-english-care-home-residents-basic-needs-unmet\">severe staffing shortages</a> in care homes in England. Analysis by the Guardian revealed that a lack of staff was identified as a key problem in three-quarters of all care homes whose rating had dropped from “good” to “inadequate”.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Environment</strong></em> | Sewage monitors at some popular seaside destinations in England and Wales are faulty or not installed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/22/seaside-sewage-monitors-england-environment-agency\">Environment Agency data has revealed</a>, meaning people could be swimming in human waste without realising.

The former head of the European Central Bank, Draghi was a popular, technocratic choice as prime minister. Although he was a caretaker, installed to avoid early elections at a febrile mid-pandemic moment of economic crisis, his 18 months leading a national unity government was a period of relative stability and economic recovery.</p> <p>But the withdrawal of support from three right-wing parties made Draghi’s administration untenable. It also highlighted another dynamic: since voters were last given a say on who leads their country, three very different coalitions have held power.</p> <p>“The last election didn’t produce a clear majority for any one grouping,” said Angela. “This coalition never really got on, and the League” – the far-right party led by hardline Eurosceptic and former interior minister Matteo Salvini – “always had one foot out of the door. It was inevitable that they would bring it down as soon as they saw an excuse.”</p> <p>Into the void created by the collapse of the Draghi administration has come the Brothers of Italy, the heirs to Mussolini’s Italian Social Movement. The party has been accused by its critics of failing to sever itself from its fascist roots and espouses hardline views on immigration and homosexuality.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Why are Brothers of Italy favourites to lead the next government?</p> <p>After an era of governmental musical chairs, in which fundamentally dissimilar parties have hung together for the sake of political expediency or the national interest, depending on how you look at it, Brothers of Italy are distinguished above all by the fact that they have never participated. John Foot, author of Blood and Power: The Rise and Fall of Italian Fascism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/14/georgia-meloni-no-fascist-evokes-grim-memories-italys-past\">wrote in the Observer last week</a> that “Meloni’s decision to stay out of the wide emergency coalition under Draghi looks set to reap a political harvest”.</p> <p>That familiar outsider story – together with a diagnosis of Italy’s vast economic problems that places much of the blame at the feet of immigrants, and a traditionalist appeal on issues like abortion and adoption for gay couples – has allowed Brothers of Italy to seize the initiative despite that 4% vote share in 2018.</p> <p>Crucially, Angela noted, they have backed up their outsider appeal with on-the-ground work that emphasises their roots in working-class communities. “All along the last few years, not just during elections, Brothers of Italy have held these discussions with people on the ground. Last summer they had a stage erected for a month near where I live holding conversations with ordinary people.</p> <p>“They come across as more socially rooted: they don’t have elite educations, they present themselves as of the workers, and it rings true to people. The left hasn’t been able to do that.”</p> <p>On the left, the Democratic party are about even in the polls with Brothers of Italy. But the right-wing party is decisively benefited by its place in a coherent coalition with the League and Silvio Berlusconi’s more moderate Forza Italia – which means there is a chance that they could form a more stable government than any since Berlusconi himself was prime minister. The left “is just so divided that it can’t muster a coalition with a chance of winning”, Angela said.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Why is their leader Giorgia Meloni so popular?</p> <p>While her politics are abhorrent to those of a progressive mindset, there is little doubting Meloni’s political skill – or her canny ability to position herself as a plausible figure for those who might be put off by the most extreme aspects of her party’s agenda and history.</p> <p>“I remember writing about her just before the last elections,” said Angela (you can read that prescient 2018 piece, which notes Meloni’s ambition and ability to connect with voters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/09/giorgia-meloni-brothers-of-italy-party-friendly-face-surging-far-right\">here</a>). “When I spoke to people who had known her since she started out in politics, it was very clear that even then, even though this was a fringe party, she was just relentless – and she had the skill to go to places where the centre left just wouldn’t go and speak to people.</p> <p>“There’s a feeling that she’s one of them. She’s from a working-class background, she’s seen as gutsy. She didn’t go to university but she’s very smart. A lot of voters see what’s called ‘radical chic’ on the left – people comfortably off and far removed from the issues they face.”</p> <p>Meloni also benefits from a familiar dynamic in the chaotic postwar history of Italian politics: “There’s definitely a sense of, we’ve tried everyone else and it hasn’t worked, we should give her a chance. So there’s a hopelessness to it as well.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Does all this mean Italy is on the brink of a fascist government?</p> <p>It’s too simplistic to describe Meloni and Brothers of Italy as fascist (as John Foot wrote: “She will not command black-shirted armed groups and she will not look to overturn liberal democracy”). And Meloni has herself explicitly distanced herself from her party’s neofascist origins, saying that the Italian right “has handed fascism over to history for decades now” and <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/giorgia-meloni-im-not-a-fascist-i-like-the-tories-says-italys-far-right-leader/\">comparing herself</a> to the UK’s Conservatives and the Republicans in the US.</p> <p>Notably, that line came from a video spoken in English, French and Spanish, suggesting that Meloni sees a need to present a respectable face to the international community. She has also – despite messages to the contrary from her coalition partners – promised that Italy will continue to support Ukraine in the war against Russia.</p> <p>At the same time – as Angela laid out in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/scepticism-over-giorgia-melonis-claims-fascism-is-history-in-italian-far-right\">this piece</a> last week – many view Meloni as trying to have it both ways. She recently gave a speech at a rally held by the Spanish far-right party Vox, dwelling far more on the hardline parts of her agenda. She has also used language in which some have seen coded nods to Mussolini – such as the phrase “history has proved us right”, which appears to line up with a Mussolini line: “History will prove me right … a young person will rise, a leader who will inevitably agitate the ideas of fascism”. Meloni is 45.</p> <p>***</p> <p>So what should we conclude from Meloni’s rise?</p> <p>In the end, the question of whether or not Brothers of Italy are fascists is less pertinent than the question of what happens next, and the country’s place within the modern radical right making its influence felt across Europe - with fuzzier distinctions from the mainstream right than ever before. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/15/the-guardian-view-on-giorgia-meloni-repositioning-europes-radical-right\">this Guardian editorial</a> puts it: There is “no reason to be remotely sanguine about Ms Meloni’s possible accession to power”.</p> <p>Italian politics is sui generis – and any parallels with Trump, Brexit, or Marine Le Pen are bound to have their limits. But Angela’s analysis of the left’s response to the threat posed by Meloni, and the likelihood of her success next month, will strike a chilling chord to observers of those political phenomena.</p> <p>“All the left seems to have to say in response is ‘they’re fascists and we’re not, they’re racists and we’re not’,” she said. “I feel that one of the lessons of Brexit was the need to try to get past those designations to understand how voters are thinking. I’ve spent a lot of time trying to do that over the last few years. When I speak to ordinary Italians, they don’t hold racist or fascist views – they might turn a blind eye, but they think it’s all in the past. When they hear that from the left, it leaves them cold.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2> <ul> <li><p>After a bit of a lull earlier in the year, there’s now <strong>a surfeit of television</strong> on the way.

But having siblings (S) in the car was found to increase the chances of backseat breakdowns by 10 minutes.</p> <p>The research, developed alongside LV= Britannia Rescue, found the average child will ask “are we nearly there?” 32 minutes into a car journey and four times during the ride.</p> <p>As families prepare for long drives ahead of the bank holiday weekend, the survey found that boredom is the primary cause of backseat tantrums – cited by 68% of parents – followed by the journey being too long (62%) and kids being hungry (57%).</p> <p>Dr Hind said: “If you have only one child, and you can keep them entertained and occasionally bribe them with food, you could manage two hours of tantrum-free driving.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, two children with no entertainment and no snacks can brew up a tantrum in just 40 minutes.</p> <p>“Snacks are important but there is a limit to how much they can help, so keep them to two an hour max.

The daily briefings had become an insulting game of denial and lies, the death count was rising, PPE and track-and-trace debacles were unfolding, lockdown policy was clearly unstudied and the prime minister had refused even to meet the families of Covid victims. Around the time when those bereaved families began to organise and campaign for an inquiry, it became clear that the comfort, resources and momentum for reform that people needed was not going to be forthcoming from the government. Citizens were going to have to do it themselves.</p> <p>That sense of a body politic and government entirely unsuited to crisis has come around again, and with it the same realisation that change is not going to come from our politicians, not unless they are dragged into it. England in particular currently feels like an eerie, unpoliced, ungoverned, unstable country after a coup. One government is gone but another hasn’t replaced it, and opposition cannot rise to the challenge. Bureaucracy continues to function on inertia, with queues and backlogs and bottlenecks. Private capital, already rapacious and unregulated, grinds on ever more aggressively, extracting profits for basic services such as water and gas, as if we were living in a war economy.</p> <p>The impression of precariousness is not just a feeling. It’s a fact. In a research note earlier this month, the head of macro analysis at Saxo, a Danish bank, said that the UK was looking more and more like that dreaded benchmark for a western democracy, “an emerging market country”. “What Brexit has not done by itself,” he said, “Brexit coupled with Covid and high inflation have succeeded in doing. The UK economy is crushed.”</p> <p>Lockdowns and a lack of in-person contact during the pandemic smothered anger and civil action. These are the forces this crushing cost of living crisis is now unleashing. Another feature of some of the economies of emerging markets, in addition to trade volatility and high inflation, is a realisation on the part of an exploited workforce and stretched citizenry that the government will not deliver. One outcome of that is the emergence of an informal parallel system of support, one in which people share resources and donate their time to help each other out.</p> <p>In some north African countries, a yellowed, frayed document informally called a “diagnosis” will regularly do the rounds in offices and with it, an envelope. Inside, there is a brief summary of someone’s (often a complete stranger’s) medical need, usually a life-saving operation, and a list of names with numbers next to them, detailing their donations to the procedure. With these types of immediate needs – healthcare, food, shelter – people know there is simply no other alternative that involves waiting for the government to step in, and so carry on in a sort of resigned solidarity. The fact that people are giving up on the NHS and begging to borrow money for private healthcare, and the rising dependence on food banks (none of which translated into punishment for the Tories), shows that in that sense, the UK has been an emerging markets country under the Conservatives for some time. Living in what feels like the final stage of grief, we have long been yoked by a fatalism that things cannot get better.</p> <p>Not any more. Something has shifted. Taken too far, the conditions that make people give up on politics can jolt them back into anger. People can accept that government is dead, but that doesn’t mean another can’t be brought to life. The result is civil disobedience. Reported as “disruptions” and “strike chaos”, these are in fact a healthy, and to be honest, much delayed, response to the terminus that the country has reached during a cost of living crisis where private capital, rightwing government and leftwing opposition have all but agreed that only over their dead bodies will the state intervene to transfer wealth from the rich to the poor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/19/uk-humanitarian-catastrophe-shotton-north-wales\">One Welsh town offers a window on to the catastrophe facing Britain.

There were queues around the block to enter.</p> <p>This is nothing less than a public and workforce on a collision course with a model of governance that has so centrally embedded weak regulation and small state ideology that it is heresy to speak against it. The conventional economic wisdom is a dictatorship of capitalist fictions presented as unassailable reality. That is why it is only those from outside the political sphere, such as Mick Lynch of the RMT and the consumer rights campaigner Martin Lewis, or those who are distant and divested from it enough, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/10/gordon-brown-says-energy-firms-unable-to-offer-lower-bills-should-be-temporarily-re-nationalised\">such as Gordon Brown</a>, who have the language, the moral clarity and the sense of urgency to point out that the emperor has no clothes.</p> <p>One plaintive lament in some parts of the media has been “where are the grownups”? The bad news is that the “grownups” did this. The good news is that more and more people are beginning to realise that. The result is an opening of space for the thing we are constantly told is the indulgence of the amateur and the unrealistic – imagination. The public’s response to the cost of living crisis is more energetic, promising, compassionate and righteous than anything we have seen in a long time. If that brings about the kind of disruption we only see abroad in more unstable places, then that is only because it is the appropriate response to our own instability.

As the ballots are nationally aggregated, if more than half of the universities are in favour when they close in early October, every institution will take strike action later in the autumn, which the union said would represent “an unprecedented level of disruption”.</p> <p>Universities say they need to hold on to their surpluses to weather a tough financial climate ahead, and that overall strong performance conceals variation between institution</p> <p>Raj Jethwa, chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association, said: “Each institution has a legal duty to balance its books and the nationally negotiated pay uplift has to be affordable for all 145 institutions. Many higher education institutions are working hard to avoid redundancies, and others are struggling to balance budgets to maintain staffing levels, while delivering this year’s pay uplift into staff pockets.”</p> <p>He argued that it was disingenuous to cite buildings as an area where universities could find savings as this “accounts for less than 10% of total spending and suffered significant cuts during the pandemic, in order to devote resources to supporting staff and students”.<br><br>He noted that, although the current pay offer proposes a minimum increase of 3% for all staff, it provides a 9% rise to the lowest paid staff, who are most affected by inflation.</p> <p>The union’s research suggested that universities generated record levels of income from tuition fees and other sources, hitting £41.1bn in 2020-21, up from £39.6bn in 2019-20.</p> <p>During this period, spending on staff increased by £200m, which the union argued was not enough to meet additional demand for teaching and support from increasing student enrolments, meaning that existing staff members have to work harder.</p> <p>The union said staff have had low pay awards over the past decade, putting pay 25% behind inflation, and estimates that about 90,000 university staff are employed on short-term, insecure contracts.</p> <p>The union argued that some universities waste money on expensive overseas campuses.

The list is almost too many to name. It was all the acts working on the circuit at that time. Boothby Graffoe, Kevin Day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/lee-evans\">Lee Evans</a>, Alan Davies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/eddie-izzard\">Eddie Izzard</a>, John Moloney, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/harry-hill\">Harry Hill</a>, Jeff Green and loads more. The entire comedy circuit inspired me.</p> <p><strong>Best heckle? <br></strong>“Go hang yourself, Blondie.” It reminds me of a time when I had a mop of blond hair.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Before a show I pray a bit and say: 'Over to you, Lord.

An utter genius, hilarious, and weirdly, despite his huge success on shows such as The Generation Game, I think he’s hugely underrated as a comedian.

It seeks to achieve cuts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/26/bbc-announces-raft-of-closures-cbbc-four-online-only\">£285m a year</a> necessitated by the government freezing the licence fee for two years.</p> <p>The new channel will show news of interest to international and British audiences, with adverts only shown abroad and a UK “opt out” stream to cover big domestic stories, using reporters and a breaking news team, that will simulcast BBC Breakfast, BBC One bulletins and a televised version of Radio 5 live presenter Nicky Campbell’s show.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jul/14/bbc-news-and-bbc-world-presenters-among-70-staff-facing-sack\">BBC News and BBC World News presenters among 70 staff facing sack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, some staff claim the proposal to merge the £57m News channel next April will surprise licence-fee payers expecting their money to be used for rolling domestic news and drive people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jun/23/rupert-murdoch-uses-london-visit-to-try-to-boost-ratings-at-talktv\">towards rivals including GB News and</a> Rupert Murdoch’s talkTV. About 79% of UK adults watch TV news, according to Ofcom, but the BBC argues that young people are increasingly accessing stories via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/21/tiktok-is-fastest-growing-news-source-for-uk-adults-ofcom-finds\">social media platforms such as TikTok</a>. </p> <p>They also argue that UK viewers will see fewer regional stories at a time when local newspapers are declining, and that merging the channels might muddy the waters between the BBC’s public service and commercial activities – concerns some politicians share and which the culture select committee will question Davie about next month.</p> <p>Ofcom is due to make a statement this week about the proposed changes, which could delay the plans. Under the regulator’s rules, if the corporation makes “a material change”, it must carry out a “public interest test” and then get Ofcom’s approval. The BBC must also “consider the effect” on competition to ensure that its commercial activities do not distort the market.</p> <p>According to sources, Ofcom has sympathy with the BBC’s financial plight, but some at the regulator want the corporation to be more open about how the proposals will work in practice as they think they could materially change the channel.</p> <p>Staff, who are facing 70 redundancies, also want more details rather than the “engagement workshops”, “bespoke wellbeing sessions” and “‘in the moment’ telephone counselling” they were offered in an internal BBC email this week.</p> <p>In addition, charities have expressed their fears to the BBC’s management. The interim director of BBC News, Jonathan Munro, responded in a letter seen by the Guardian that he understood “there are concerns … but … these proposals do represent the best value for the licence-fee payer as we invest in the most effective ways of reaching all audiences and build our resilience for the years ahead”.</p> <p>However, a report put together by BBC News staff argues that with many other programmes and channels relying on the BBC News channel for content, it could cost the corporation more to replace the footage needed than the amount it will save by closing it.</p> <p>They estimate that, in addition to the News channel’s 8 million to 10 million linear TV viewers, its content is heard, seen or read online by more than 25 million to 35 million people a week – more if footage used by local radio, regional television and iPlayer is counted.</p> <p>Furthermore, as one BBC News insider explained, “News channel content is invaluable” to BBC One’s 1pm, 6pm and 10pm bulletins, which sometimes “wouldn’t get pieces to air without the content the channel provides”, while BBC online uses News channel content “masses on UK stories”, but is often not credited. In addition, all the main BBC radio news programmes use News channel clips.</p> <p>Ofcom would not comment on their plans, but a spokesperson said it expected “the BBC to provide a breadth of local, regional national and UK-wide news, as well as international coverage”.</p> <p>A BBC spokesperson said the staff report was “anecdotal, contains no data analysis, and is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how BBC News operates and on the plans for the new channel. Running one 24-hour channel, rather than two parallel channels, allows us to invest more in our ability to cover breaking news across the BBC.”</p> <p>They added: “We remain totally committed to covering UK stories and to a 24-hour news channel which serves the needs of UK, as well as international, audiences, even better than we do now.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/22/seaside-sewage-monitors-england-environment-agency","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T05:00:29Z","webTitle":"Sewage monitors faulty at seaside spots in England and Wales, data shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/22/seaside-sewage-monitors-england-environment-agency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/22/seaside-sewage-monitors-england-environment-agency","fields":{"headline":"Sewage monitors faulty at seaside spots in England and Wales, data shows","trailText":"Environment Agency figures indicate people could be swimming in human waste this summer without warning","byline":"Helena Horton Environment reporter","body":"<p>Sewage monitors at some popular seaside destinations in England and Wales are faulty or not installed, <a href=\"https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/19f6064d-7356-466f-844e-d20ea10ae9fd/event-duration-monitoring-storm-overflows-annual-returns\">Environment Agency data</a> has revealed, meaning people could be swimming in human waste this summer without realising.</p> <p>Seaside holidays this year have been marred by water companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/19/bonuses-for-water-bosses-in-england-up-20-last-year-despite-sewage-failures\">pumping raw sewage into the ocean</a>, with popular beaches in areas including Sussex and Devon having to close.</p> <p>However, some holidaymakers could be swimming in it without warning, as new analysis by the Liberal Democrats has found that some monitors that are supposed to measure the amount of sewage being pumped into water at popular seaside spots are broken or not even installed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/beachgoers-warned-to-stay-away-after-sewage-alerts-across-england-and-wales\">Beachgoers warned to stay away after sewage alerts across England and Wales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Water companies monitor the dumping of sewage from storm overflows by using event duration monitors (EDMs), which record the frequency and timespan of spills.</p> <p>The Environment Agency data for England and Wales<strong> </strong>shows that 1,802 monitors installed by water companies provided information for less than 90% of the time, with possible high spill counts in those periods, and that 1,717 storm overflows did not have a monitor installed.</p> <p>Last year, for waterways, not just bathing status areas, a quarter of sewage discharges went unmonitored in total because the monitors were not working or were left uninstalled.</p> <p>Across Devon and Cornwall, one in eight of the sewage monitors at designated bathing locations were either faulty or not installed.</p> <p>Many popular seaside destinations were without monitors, including Long Rock, Cornwall; Littlehampton, Sussex; and Lee-on-Solent, Hampshire.

improving mental and physical health.</p> <p>The £12.7m trial, which was announced by the Department for Transport and will begin this year, is part of a wider movement of “social prescribing”, an approach <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/\">already used in the NHS</a>, in which patients are referred for non-medical activities.</p> <p>In 2020 the

natural environment on mental health and wellbeing</a>, while social prescribing has also been embraced in many other countries, including Australia where GPs have begun <a

patients</a>.</p> <p>Minister for health, Maria Caulfield, said the UK is leading the way in embedding social prescribing in the NHS and communities across the country.</p> <p>“Getting active is hugely beneficial for both our mental and physical health, helping reduce stress and ward off other illness such as heart disease and obesity,” she said.<br></p> <p>The latest trial will focus specifically on boosting active travel and will take place in 11 local authority areas in England, including Cornwall, Bradford, and Leeds, with free bike loans, all-ability cycling taster days, and walking and cycling mental health groups among the pilot projects to be supported by the funding.</p> <p>The Department for Transport said that alongside the trials, which are part of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-plan-for-england\">government’s Gear Change plan</a> published in 2020 to boost walking and cycling, infrastructure so people feel safe when undertaking such activities.</p> <p>It is hoped the pilots, which are to be delivered within the next three years through existing social prescribing systems and networks, will help shed light on whether activities such as cycling and walking can help reduce GP appointments and patients’ reliance on medication, among other measures of individuals’ health.</p> <p>Chris Boardman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/22/chris-boardman-to-lead-new-walking-and-cycling-body-in-england\">the former Olympic cycling champion and commissioner of National Active Travel</a>, welcomed the move.</p> <p>“Moving more will lead to a healthier nation, a reduced burden on the NHS, less cancer, heart disease and diabetes, as well as huge cost savings,” he said. “This trial aims to build on existing evidence to show how bringing transport, active travel and health together can make a positive impact on communities across England.”</p> <p>However Dr David Strain, chair of the BMA board of science, said more needs to be done.</p> <p>“These excellent pilots are to be welcomed but to meaningfully reduce health inequalities, climate change and physical inactivity, much more investment will be needed over the long-term, both in public health approaches and capacity and active transport infrastructure across the country,” he said.</p> <p>Paul Farmer, chief executive of the mental health charity Mind, said he welcomed news of the extra investment, enabling the NHS to try new ways of supporting mental health, such as through social prescribing schemes.</p> <p>But, he added, prescribing exercise is not a miracle cure for treating mental health problems.</p> <p>“What we urgently need to see is proper investment into our country’s mental health services,” he said. “Only that will enable us to deliver support to the 1.6 million people currently sat on waiting lists, and the 8 million people who would benefit from mental health support right now but are deemed by the system not to be unwell enough to access it.”</p> <p>It is not only physical activities that have received attention under the banner of social prescribing: <a

<p>Katie Clark, director of literature at The Reader, said its free reading groups are a lifeline for people in tough times.</p> <p>“At a time when so many of us, especially many younger people, those experiencing mental health difficulties or poverty, are facing growing pressures, we’re calling for more shared reading groups in more communities and services all over the UK” she

Starmer’s</a> director of strategy, Deborah Mattinson, claimed the foreign secretary could dramatically improve Conservative fortunes.</p> <p>The document, dated 18 August and leaked to the Guardian,

graft’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the research also suggests that any improvement in the government’s position could be very short-lived, with voters already concerned about aspects of Truss’s character.</p> <p>“Our focus groups suggest that as voters get to know Truss better they like her less,” it says. “Serious negatives – untrustworthiness, inauthenticity, U-turns, lack of grip – are starting to cut through suggesting that any bounce may be very short-lived.”</p> <p>The latest Opinium poll on Sunday gave Labour its biggest lead in months – eight points – while Starmer has surged well ahead of Truss in the past two weeks when voters are asked who would be the best prime minister.</p> <p>Yet the leaked analysis suggests Labour could fall back again in coming months as new prime ministers tend to boost their parties in the polls, which then evaporates after three months in office.</p> <p>“We can expect that Truss will get a bounce of at least 6% if she simply performs in line with the average, which would result in bringing polls to level pegging with Labour,” it says.</p> <p>But party insiders believe she could drive a 10-point, or even 12-point, bounce as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> was such a drag on the Conservatives’ polling in his final months in power.</p> <p>“Johnson was such an anchor on the Tories and Truss is such an unknown, so it will likely be closer to 10% or 12%,” one said.</p> <p>The analysis suggests that Rishi Sunak, who is trailing behind Truss, is less certain to give the Tories a big boost because his negatives are already better known to the public.</p> <p>But either candidate should expect the media to have grown “bored” of criticising the Tories over the Johnson era and to welcome them with “early enthusiasm”.</p> <p>Mattinson warns: “It will be even harder for us to achieve cut-through at this time, making a higher bounce still more likely.”</p> <p>Bleak economic forecasts and the prospect of recession next year have prompted some speculation among Tory MPs that Truss could try to capitalise on any polling boost and announce an early election this autumn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

government.</p> <p>However, calling an early election would also be a big risk for the Conservatives with voters unlikely to thank them for sending them to the polls during a cost of living crisis.</p> <p>Mattinson’s analysis indicates that any bounce “may not be sustained” with voters “already noticing aspects of Liz Truss that worry them”.</p> <p>It adds: “The poll bounce seems to be a triumph of hope over experience for voters – before reality kicks in. Our focus groups so far suggest that voters who know less about Truss view her more positively.

Those visible to the naked eye are usually females. Males are mostly tiny and don’t eat bones. They live in “harems” of tens or hundreds inside a female’s mucous tube, and wait for her eggs to emerge so they can immediately fertilise them.</p> \n<p>All the energy these diminutive males get comes from their mothers via their egg yolks. Once they have run down that energy store, they die. “We called them kamikaze males,” says Robert Vrijenhoek, retired evolutionary biologist from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, California, who was also part of the original <em>Osedax</em>-finding team.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4dfcb8157732ba07686c0480c330f643d7a964c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4dfcb8157732ba07686c0480c330f643d7a964c/0_0_2598_3527/737.jpg\" alt=\"The bone-eating snot flower, Osedax mucofloris, seen in the water with feathery tendrils coming from its head and a clump of roots at the other end.\" width=\"737\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bone-eating snot flower, <em>Osedax mucofloris, </em>seen in the water with feathery tendrils coming from its head and a clump of roots at the other end.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Natural History Museum/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One species, <em>Osedax priapus</em>, <a href=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/story-bizarre-deep-sea-bone-worm-takes-unexpected-twist\">does things differently</a>.

It’s not clear how the worms find bones.

As I draw near, the vision doesn’t end but intensifies as, up close, the cottongrass delivers on its promise. Dozens of gleaming seedheads sway with the breeze, lighting the dark peatland. Sometimes called ghost grass, it is easy to get caught up in the wispy trails that top the stems. The gossamer plumes seem almost otherworldly. Yet its more common name of bog cotton grounds this plant in the wetland home that it is very much a part of.</p> <p>Here in the Flow Country of blanket bog in north Scotland, it is common cottongrass that I find most often by banks of sphagnum moss and shining bog pools, or hare’s-tail cottongrass stretching out across the peaty moorland.</p> <p>Developing in cool places with lots of rain, this blanket bog is extensive, though sadly damaged by past drainage and conifer plantation. Ongoing restoration work has increased the water levels in the drained peatlands, and vegetation is recovering, though there is plenty of work still to do. Cottongrass is one of the few plants suited to the wet, acidic conditions of this habitat, and its white crests wave like flags staked in unsteady ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"145c123f8286de845a6a92f879f71259f5b6ae48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/145c123f8286de845a6a92f879f71259f5b6ae48/0_128_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cottongrass in the blanket bog of Flow Country in Caithness and Sutherland, Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cottongrass in the blanket bog of Flow Country, Caithness and Sutherland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elizabeth-Jane Burnett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While this bog is said to cover the landscape like a blanket, the cottongrass, with its light tufts whipped up like cotton wool balls, seems to offer tiny pillows. Indeed, one of its former uses in parts of England was as stuffing for pillows in place of feathers. In the summer heat, the wide bog covering and soft-headed sedge create a soporific atmosphere. I find myself drifting into the sway of white fluff, the little, low clouds billowing.</p> <p>It takes the bubbling song of a skylark to rouse me. As the cotton-like heads bob, caught by the breeze and the birdsong, I reach out, bringing my fingers to the frothy peaks. After the high spread of the surrounding mountains and low stretch of the bog, it is refreshing to come right up to something small and immediately tangible. Soft as fleece, the sedge heads brush against skin – a feathery light at my fingertips.</p> <p>• Country Diary is on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdncountrydiary?lang=en\" title=\"\">@gdncountrydiary</a></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/22/us-and-south-korea-begin-largest-military-drills-for-years-as-north-ramps-up-tensions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T04:04:21Z","webTitle":"US and South Korea begin largest military drills for years as North ramps up tensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/22/us-and-south-korea-begin-largest-military-drills-for-years-as-north-ramps-up-tensions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/22/us-and-south-korea-begin-largest-military-drills-for-years-as-north-ramps-up-tensions","fields":{"headline":"US and South Korea begin largest military drills for years as North ramps up tensions","trailText":"The show of force is expected to prompt an angry response from Pyongyang and follows failure of Trump-era policy of engagement","byline":"Justin McCurry in Tokyo and agencies","body":"<p>The US and South Korea have begun their biggest joint military drills in years – a show of force that is expected to raise tensions with an increasingly hostile North Korea.</p> <p>The exercises, known as Ulchi Freedom Shield, are being seen as a sign of the allies’ determination to restore large-scale training after they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/03/us-and-south-korea-scrap-big-military-exercises-to-ease-tensions-with-north\">cancelled some regular drills </a>and scaled down others to facilitate nuclear talks, and because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Details of the operation have not been released, but past exercises have involved tens of thousands of troops and large numbers of aircraft warships and tanks.</p> <p>They will reportedly include simulated joint attacks, frontline reinforcements of arms and fuel, and removals of weapons of mass destruction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/north-and-south-korea-tensions-relations-issue-conflict-division-explained-in-30-seconds\">North and South Korea relations: what’s behind the tensions – in 30 seconds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The two militaries said in a joint statement said the drills were a response to an “increased volume and scale of [North Korean] missile tests” over the past year.</p> <p>“With this in mind, and considering the evolving threat … both leaders committed to expanding the scope and scale of combined military exercises and training, they said, adding that Ulchi Freedom Shield would “bolster combined readiness”.</p> <p>The 2019 exercises were cancelled after Donald Trump’s first summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, the previous year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/pentagon-cancels-freedom-guardian-military-drill-with-south-korea\">Trump’s surprise concession </a>was seen as an attempt to persuade Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons programme amid a flurry of diplomacy led by the then president and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in.</p> <p>Four years on, Washington and Seoul have nothing substantive to show for their efforts at engagement.

Supported by her boyfriend and family, she sought medical advice in her home town in Italy’s central Marche region on how to obtain an abortion. She faced obstacles at every turn, from telephones not being answered and surgeries being closed, to one doctor who tried to persuade her to change her mind.</p> <p>Abortion in Italy was legalised in 1978, overturning an outright ban enforced by the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini who deemed it a crime against the Italian race, but the high number of gynaecologists who refuse to terminate pregnancies for moral reasons – 64.6%, according to 2020 data – has meant women still encounter huge difficulties in accessing safe procedures.</p> <p>Conservative leadership in several Italian regions has in recent years impeded abortion access even further, especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/03/success-of-far-right-brothers-of-italy-raises-fears-of-fascist-revival\">in Marche</a>, a former leftwing bastion, which since September 2020 has been ruled by Brothers of Italy – a party with neofascist roots that after national elections in September could be the largest party in a rightwing governing coalition.</p> <p>Giorgia Meloni, the party chief who hopes to become prime minister, has described abortion as a “defeat”, although recently said abolishing the 1978 law was not on her agenda.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b42fe460551433a40bc4d57f9562b17a13347f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b42fe460551433a40bc4d57f9562b17a13347f6/0_39_2297_1378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Lingria/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, Marche, described as a “laboratory” for Brothers of Italy policies, provides an inkling of what might be to come if the coalition led by the party and including Matteo Salvini’s far-right League, which is equally against abortion, clinches power.</p> <p>One of the regional council’s first moves was to not apply a health ministry measure, introduced last year, allowing health clinics, not just hospitals, to provide the abortion pill. While national policy stipulates that medical abortions can be carried out up to nine weeks of pregnancy, in Marche the limit is seven weeks. By law, after a woman receives a medical certificate authorising her abortion, she must reflect for a week before the procedure is carried out.</p> <p>“Sometimes a woman doesn’t discover she is pregnant until the fifth or sixth week,” said Manuela Bora, a regional politician with the centre-left Democratic party. “It’s almost impossible to get an abortion here. Yes, we can’t deny that it was difficult before, but that was due to the moral objectors; now the erosion of abortion rights is a political theme.”</p> <p>Giulia, the 20-year-old seeking an abortion, in the end went online and found details about AIED, a non-profit family counselling clinic in Ascoli Piceno, almost a two-hour drive from her home, that provides abortion services.</p> <p>The clinic prepares women for medical or surgical abortions, the latter carried out each Saturday at the local hospital by two non-objector gynaecologists hired from outside the Marche region, who often face the wrath of anti-abortion protesters outside.</p> <p>The service was contracted out to AIED a decade ago because abortion procedures could no longer be guaranteed by the hospital due to the high number of moral objectors among its staff.</p> <p>On the same morning as Giulia’s consultation, Tiziana Antonucci, AIED’s vice-president, returns the calls of six other women who recount similar stories of their struggles to access abortion services through the public system. A pregnancy termination through AIED costs €200, money that goes towards funding the service, compared with €1,500 in a privately run clinic.</p> <p>“The are some hospitals where there are only objectors, and one hospital – in Fermo – has never even applied the abortion law,” said Antonucci. “But even in hospitals where there are no objectors, the service is inadequate. When the left was in power they did nothing to change it, as they feared losing the Catholic vote. Now we have the right, and remain stuck in this increasingly difficult situation.”</p> <p>The Brothers of Italy-led council has in addition proposed allowing anti-abortion activists, who already infiltrate hospitals to pressure women not to end their pregnancy, to work in family counselling clinics. “Imagine a woman going to a clinic to seek an abortion and finding fanatical people,” said Bora.</p> <p>Bora herself is all too familiar with the tactics of anti-abortion activists. After clashing with Giorgia Latini, Marche’s equal opportunities councillor, on abortion she received 1,450 nappies – representing the number of abortions in Marche in 2019 – from a doctor, who delivered the consignment to the council offices while his son held up a sign saying she had blood on her hands.</p> <p>A priority policy for both Brothers of Italy and the League is to reverse Italy’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/08/italys-birthrate-is-falling-can-the-storks-help\">declining birthrate</a>. One way of achieving that, they believe, is to reduce abortions by providing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/women-could-be-paid-not-to-have-abortion-in-northern-italy\">financial incentives</a> to encourage women to carry through a pregnancy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\">  <iframe id=\"morning-briefing\" name=\"morning-briefing\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/morning-briefing\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--morning-briefing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST<br><br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>“In 2020, when I was elected, there were 2,000 abortions in the region,” said Filippo Saltamartini, Marche’s health councillor. “Could you imagine a square full of this number of children, and their mothers? Mothers who we had helped to provide these children with a home and financial support in their early years. This is the kind of world we need to imagine.”</p> <p>For some, that imagined world would ideally be pure-blooded Italian. “The Italian population is decreasing. I’m not saying foreigners shouldn’t have children but we need to create the conditions for Italians to reproduce,” said Carlo Ciccioli, the Brothers of Italy group leader in Marche’s council who described abortion as “an absolute rearguard battle” and last year provoked controversy after speaking of “<a href=\"https://www.cronachemaceratesi.it/2021/01/27/ciccioli-rincara-la-dose-sullaborto-una-nuova-194-no-alla-sostituzione-etnica/1490789/\">ethnic substitution</a>” of Italian children in schools.</p> <p>Ciccioli, a doctor, was a member of the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), the neofascist party established by a minister in Mussolini’s government that morphed into the National Alliance before becoming Brothers of Italy. In 1974, he shot a political opponent in the leg on a street in Ancona, Marche’s capital.</p> <p>In other policy changes, the party has cut the region’s sponsorship of Marche gay pride, while the female president of the council’s equal opportunities commission suggested creating conditions for women to work part-time so they could dedicate more time in the kitchen.</p> <p>A strong sign of a political pivot in the region came on 28 October 2019, when a commemorative dinner was held in Ascoli Piceno to mark the anniversary of Mussolini’s “march on Rome”. The dinner was attended by Francesco Acquaroli, now the president of Marche, along with a host of other Brothers of Italy mayors.</p> <p>“Marche is a laboratory for Brothers of Italy,” said Paolo Berizzi, a journalist with La Repubblica who has written extensively about the extreme right in Italy. “It’s where the party has done general tests as it prepares for what it could do on a national scale.

As the year went on and industries shut down, our sector kept on going.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2022 and the effects of working through lockdown after lockdown are emerging. Like health and aged care, staff are now leaving the sector in droves as the true impact of burnout, stress, illness and underpayment reveals itself.</p> <p>As a kinder teacher and fully vaccinated pregnant woman, I have just recovered from over 8 weeks of sickness after picking up the flu, then Covid, then <a href=\"https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/respiratory-syncytial-virus.aspx#:~:text=Respiratory%20syncytial%20virus%2C%20or%20RSV,cough%2C%20wheezing%20and%20difficulty%20breathing.\">RSV</a>, all of which resulted in three hospital stays as well as continued hearing loss, respiratory issues and asthma. </p> <p>I have returned to work after five weeks of unpaid sick leave, despite a weak immune system – I have mortgage repayments to make. Sickness is everywhere, but childcare centres are particularly transmittable environments.</p> <p>Despite my own struggles, my greatest concern is for the children. Chronic understaffing means programs such as sport, bush kinder and music are cancelled almost every week. Early intervention options such as speech pathology are fully booked, as are occupational therapists and psychologists, and therefore children who need extra support are not able to receive it, resulting in further challenges in the classroom.</p> <p>We try our best to support them and then feel like failures, with children not receiving the attention they deserve. <br></p> <p>Each day I arrive at work brings a new set of problems. How many staff will be away today? With the return of agency staff – hard to book, but thankfully there – the staffroom is getting full again. But casual relief teachers are forced to settle children they have never met before. Parents, understandably, question who their child’s teacher is today as their child cries and clings to their legs as they look around, barely recognising a face.</p> <p>A new baby arrives, their first time in care; thankfully their parents are finally allowed in the centre to see their room, unlike those who commenced earlier in the year. The baby screams and is handed to an educator paid just $23 an hour.</p> <p>In my kindergarten room, the children question whether we are heading to bush kinder. I advise them that we do not have enough staff to meet the ratio – again – and I watch as their faces drop. Whilst having two educators in the room is deemed more appropriate, today we have 11 children, and the ratio of educator to child is 1:11, so the kinder assistant is taken away and used elsewhere.</p> <p>The children call my name, but I can’t get to them all. A child hurts themselves, but I don’t see what happened. I finally sit down for lunch at 2:30 in the afternoon and listen to the stories other educators tell of the troubles in their rooms. Just this week two staff have resigned. I cut short my break to write an incident report and reply to an important email.</p> <p>Back in the room, a child wants me to sit with them whilst they play. I know this child needs extra support with their fine motor skills, but again, I’m pulled in another direction. Children’s needs are not being met and my heart breaks. I question whether this role is for me. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/21/childcare-worker-strike-7-september-2022\">Childcare workers to strike on 7 September as union says sector needs serious overhaul</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As I’m leaving, I run into a parent I’ve been meaning to talk to, and I recommend a service for their child, knowing they may not get in until the end of the year. Once I arrive home, I crash on the couch – but not before I read multiple journal articles on how I, unqualified in that specialist area, can support them. I then feel guilty for all the times I promised a child I would be back in a minute and never returned. I wonder what they tell their parents. I am unable to support the children in my classroom at a time where brain development is vital and social and emotional skills are developing.</p> <p>I am tired. I am fed up and I have found myself questioning my future in this industry for the first time. </p> <p>I moved into the early childhood sector because I discovered a love for helping kids, and I still do. But after 5 years, I question my future. How can I continue in a role where I am constantly sick and are having to take unpaid leave? Where I am paying off almost $60,000 in student debt for a bachelors and masters degree, a number too close to my salary? Where I don’t feel like I’m doing a good job? Where I can’t even do what I supposed to do? Where I am underpaid and unsupported? I go on (unpaid) maternity leave in November and I am worried about how I will return.</p> <p>For now, I will continue. My passion as an educator is strong. I just hope that the government starts to recognise the difficulties we face and why so many of us are being forced to walk away from the job we love.</p> <ul> <li><p>Belynda Kennedy is an early childhood educator </p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/21/team-gb-decathlete-ben-gregory-bike-crash","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T23:07:05Z","webTitle":"Team GB and Wales decathlete Ben Gregory fighting for life after bike crash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/team-gb-decathlete-ben-gregory-bike-crash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/team-gb-decathlete-ben-gregory-bike-crash","fields":{"headline":"Team GB and Wales decathlete Ben Gregory fighting for life after bike crash","trailText":"Thirty-one-year-old who has taken part in three Commonwealth Games is in a coma and on life support","byline":"Gemma McSherry and agency","body":"<p>The Team GB decathlete Ben Gregory is on life support after being involved in a serious cycling accident.</p> <p>Gregory, 31, who has represented Wales at three Commonwealth Games – Delhi 2010, Glasgow 2014 and Gold Coast 2018 – is in a coma after suffering a fractured skull and neck and brain haemorrhages.</p> <p>Writing on social media, Gregory’s girlfriend, Naomi Heffernan, said: “Ben was in a serious bike accident.

While Sunak has promised government support for insulation too, neither has set out a detailed plan on the issue, or on net zero generally.</p> <p>Alex Luke, author of the Onward report, said it was “natural” that the candidates were focused on immediate issues such as the cost of living crisis, but said the quest for net zero must be “a key priority” for the next prime minister.</p> <p>“I’m glad to see both candidates committed to the net zero target, but we need to hear more from both on how exactly they will do that,” he said. “It’s clear that retrofit [of homes, for energy efficiency] will need to be a massive part of reaching the net zero target.”</p> <p>He pointed out that polling showed net zero was still a top five issue for most Tory voters, and a top four issue for the wider public.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ukonward.com/\">Onward report, Going Green</a>, which will be published on Monday, found that an insulation programme for 15m households offering a combination of government grants and loans subsidised with very low interest rates through the government’s Infrastructure Bank would cost the Treasury about £31bn in total by 2050, plus about £40bn in total by 2075 in subsidising low interest rate loans.</p> <p>Homeowners would save about £20 a month on their bills after the cost of repaying the loans each month at current energy prices, and far more if prices leap again as expected this autumn and next spring.</p> <p>Luke said a previous attempt to do this, the “green deal” programme introduced under the coalition government but scrapped in 2015, had failed owing to “astronomical” market-based interest rates of more than 10%, which meant people barely saw any overall saving.</p> <p>Onward also suggested that “nudges” could play a key role in changing consumer behaviour, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/29/five-things-we-have-learned-about-the-uks-path-to-net-zero\">will be needed to reach net zero</a>. Luke said local authorities could offer personalised transport and commute plans.</p> <p>He pointed to a trial in Ipswich, costing £27 a person, which gives personalised information on public transport, walking and cycling routes, which resulted in an 11% fall in car journeys and a 14% increase in walking and cycling.</p> <p>Luke added: “None of these nudges are a panacea, or an excuse for not thinking seriously about investment [in reaching net zero]. But they are small-scale interventions that are low-cost, that have an impact and bring about change.”</p> <p>The government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/14/government-pulls-plug-on-its-remaining-uk-electric-car-subsidies\">pulled the plug on its incentives to buy electric cars earlier this year</a>, resulting in an uncertain outlook for the sector. Take-up of the cars had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/03/electric-cars-sold-in-uk-passes-half-a-million-despite-supply-chain-issues\">increased markedly</a>, but they are likely to remain more expensive to buy than fossil fuel cars for the next decade, according to Luke.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “The UK is leading the world on climate change. We have driven down emissions by 44% since 1990 whilst growing our economy – more than any other G7 country – and are taking action to help people make greener choices.</p> <p>“We have committed over £6.6bn to decarbonise homes and buildings, which includes our £450m boiler upgrade scheme to increase the uptake of heat pumps. Further, we have invested £2.5bn to accelerate the rollout of zero-emission vehicles and charging infrastructure across the country.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/aug/22/channel-4-40th-birthday-prince-andrew-musical","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T23:01:21Z","webTitle":"Channel 4 to mark 40th birthday with Prince Andrew musical","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/22/channel-4-40th-birthday-prince-andrew-musical","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/aug/22/channel-4-40th-birthday-prince-andrew-musical","fields":{"headline":"Channel 4 to mark 40th birthday with Prince Andrew musical","trailText":"Programme celebrating broadcaster’s ‘irreverent roots’ will also include documentary on extra-large penises","byline":"Jim Waterson","body":"<p>Channel 4 is marking its 40th birthday with a musical about Prince Andrew and a programme about unusually large penises.</p> <p>The broadcaster announced that it would air a satirical musical about the life of the Queen’s second son, who had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/prince-andrew-a-timeline\">step back from public life</a> due to his association with the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p> <p>As part of a season of programmes designed to hark back to Channel 4’s “radical, irreverent and iconoclastic roots”, it has also commissioned a documentary about people who struggle with their penis size.</p> <p>Other new shows will include a documentary about a woman who fled the Taliban and is now a successful porn performer, a show in which Jimmy Carr explores “cancel culture”, and a revival of Ben Elton’s 1980s comedy show Friday Night Live.</p> <p>The Prince Andrew musical has been written by the comedian Kieran Hodgson, who stars as the royal who paid a multimillion-pound financial settlement over a claim from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/15/virginia-giuffre-prince-andrew-civil-lawsuit\">Virginia Giuffre</a>, who accused him of sexual assault in a US civil case.

A couple of minutes into the second half Chloe Kelly, England’s Euro 2022 final matchwinner, had to come off injured and was replaced by Hayley Raso.</p> <p>City were starting to make some great moves and Bunny Shaw came up with City’s best chance.

However Roebuck came to City’s rescue to smother the shot, which was heading into the bottom left corner.</p> <p>Roebuck continued to keep City in the game, but to no avail as their efforts fell short against a well-organised Real Madrid side who went toe to toe with every blue shirt on the pitch. Hemp’s agonisingly close effort across the face of goal summed up the game, the decisive moment City needed failing to materialise.</p> <p>Before the game, Taylor said: “We are going to lose one really good team that should be in the group stages, and that will be a real shame.”</p> <p>This is the fifth time City have been knocked out of Europe by Spanish opposition, and is another lost opportunity to join Chelsea and possibly Arsenal in the current Champions League campaign. </p> <p>Taylor’s side will need to pick themselves up from what will be a big blow before the 2022-23 Women’s Super League begins next month.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/21/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T21:30:20Z","webTitle":"Ten Hag vows to ‘restore’ Manchester United as Liverpool roll into town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/21/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-liverpool-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"Ten Hag vows to ‘restore’ Manchester United as Liverpool roll into town","trailText":"The Dutchman is certain he will turn the club’s season around despite a disastrous start","byline":"Jamie Jackson","body":"<p>A bullish Erik ten Hag has insisted he will “restore” Manchester United with the manager pointing to his record at his previous clubs Ajax, Utrecht and Go Ahead Eagles as evidence he can do so.</p> \n<p>The Dutchman has lost his opening two United matches – against Brighton and Brentford, 2-1 and 4-0 respectively, with Liverpool visiting on Monday.

After the game we knew we had to do the parade with the fans and most of the players didn’t want to do it because they were not in the right mood but the parade helped me a lot personally.

A doorstep clap at the hour of her death, because that sort of thing really worked for the NHS?</p> <p>Not that directors Will Jessop and Barnaby Peel aren’t geniuses. They’ve made a four-part series, microanalysing the circumstances of her death in the Alma tunnel on 31 August 1997, stretching and pulling historical material like cellophane over fading bouquets outside Kensington Palace. Only occasionally can you hear that tearing sound.

But, more importantly, Jessop and Peel have reworked Diana’s death so that Investigating Diana comes on as if it wants to be this summer’s Tiger King or Making a Murderer. In 1997, the death of Diana signified, in part, the softening of the British stiff upper lip, a curious unleashing of grief among many for a woman they barely knew. Today it means something else: Investigating Diana gratifies our obsessive gaze with a real-life CSI Paris that drags the story out over inordinate length.</p> <p>That said, there are moments of canny artistry. Eric Gigou, the Brigade Criminelle’s investigator, recalls releasing the uncharged paparazzi from custody.

The shot lingers, for several seconds, on the door to the street framed by ominous flashbulb lights, the hunters poised to become the hunted.</p> <p>But did the paparazzi drive Diana, Dodi Fayed and their driver Henri Paul to their deaths, as Earl Spencer suggested at her funeral? Someone scrawled “Paparazzi – Assassins” near the crime scene. Another graffito in English read: “The Queen did it.” Are we to infer that the paps were working not for media moguls’ crumbs, but for Her Majesty’s secret service? And that the repeated details of the photographers interviewed here are just smokescreens? Jacques Langevin went for the Eichmann defence: “I was just doing my job.” And what a job: some paps allegedly made £1m a year from Diana pix alone. “I didn’t kill anyone,” adds Langevin. Quite so: there appears to be no proof to contradict that claim.</p> <p>Certainly, Gigou and his team found nothing to suggest that Paul, the driver quickly demonised by British tabloids for allegedly being four times over the legal French alcohol limit when the Mercedes 600 crashed at 121mph in that tunnel, was culpable. The programme dallies withe the possibility that his smearing in the British press may have served a function – to misdirect us from the perpetrators who, the grieving Mohamed Al Fayed told us in contemporary footage, murdered his son and her lover.</p> <p>Two witnesses interviewed in Investigating Diana lend slight credence to a contract killing. François Levistre recalls a motorbike that cut in front of the Mercedes and a flash of light, possibly from a camera, that caused the car carrying Diana and Dodi to crash. The police have not been able to stand up this account.</p> <p>Sabine Dauzonne saw a white Fiat Uno emerge from the tunnel shortly after the crash. She noticed Paris plates and, most significantly, a tanned driver, a muzzled dog in the back and the car’s shattered taillight. The then head of the Brigade Criminelle, Martine Monteil, found white paint from another car on the wreck of the Mercedes and, on the tarmac nearby, bits of broken taillight and, more curiously yet, pearls she supposed were worn by Diana as she was sped to her death. Nothing is conclusive.</p> <p>Hilary Mantel once wrote: “The princess we invented to fill a vacancy had little to do with any actual person.” A quarter of a century after her death, we are still filling that vacancy, stuffing it with speculation and the delusive prospect of closure. Jessop and Peel cleverly end the opening episode with the only survivor from the Mercedes, bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, emerging from hospital five weeks after the crash. Perhaps he could resolve all these questions about the princess’s death once and for all. Probably not, but that’s the possibility left dangling to sucker us back into watching episode two.</p> <p>I wonder how we will mark the 50th anniversary of her death?</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/22/morning-mail-barilaro-letter-revealed-daughter-of-putin-ally-killed-childrens-tv-neglected","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T20:52:56Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Barilaro letter revealed, daughter of Putin ally killed, children’s TV neglected","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/22/morning-mail-barilaro-letter-revealed-daughter-of-putin-ally-killed-childrens-tv-neglected","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/22/morning-mail-barilaro-letter-revealed-daughter-of-putin-ally-killed-childrens-tv-neglected","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Barilaro letter revealed, daughter of Putin ally killed, children’s TV neglected","trailText":"<strong>Monday:</strong> The daughter of ultranationalist Russian Alexander Dugin has died in a car bombing that Russian hawks were quick to blame on Ukraine.

The plans will be “effective immediately”, the memo added.</p> <p>The company’s benefits plan had previously covered abortion only in cases “when the health of the mother would be in danger if the fetus were carried to term, the fetus could not survive the birthing process, or death would be imminent after birth”, according to a copy of the policy viewed by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/walmart-expands-abortion-coverage-employees-rcna44063\">the Associated Press</a> but not confirmed by Walmart.</p> <p>Walmart’s chief people officer, Donna Morris, said in the memo to staff that the new policy will also offer “travel support” for workers seeking abortions covered under its healthcare plans – as well as their dependents – so they can access services that are not available within 100 miles of their locations.</p> <p>“Given how recent events are resulting in state-by-state healthcare environments, we will expand our travel coverage,” the memo said.</p> <p>Walmart employs nearly 1.6 million people in the US. The company is headquartered in Arkansas, where abortion is banned under all circumstances unless the procedure is needed to protect the life of the mother in a medical emergency. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.</p> <p>That means under the revised policy, Walmart employees can travel out of the state – or any other state that bans abortion for rape and incest – to obtain the procedure through the retailer’s health plans.</p> <p>According to the memo, which CNN also reviewed, Morris said that Walmart decided to make the changes after “listening to our associates about what’s important to them”, adding that “we strive to provide quality, competitive and accessible health coverage that supports you and your families”.</p> <p>The company said it will also launch a center that provides employees fertility services, including in vitro fertilization. Additionally, it vowed to add surrogacy support and increase its financial aid for adoptions from $5,000 to $20,000. In June, Walmart said it would expand its offering of doulas – or people who assist women during pregnancies – to address racial disparities in maternal care.</p> <p>Some other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/28/us-company-perks-abortion-pay-roe-v-wade\">large companies</a> – including Meta, American Express and Bank of America – have said they will cover travel costs for their employees in the aftermath of the high court ruling that tossed out the federal abortion rights established by the landmark decision in the 1973 case titled Roe v Wade, including elective abortions. But a Walmart spokesperson did not immediately reply for a request for comment on whether any of the company’s revised policy will cover elective abortions as well.</p> <p>“It’s a step in the right direction, but it’s simply not far enough for a company that employs that many women,” said Bianca Agustin, director of the corporate accountability program for United for Respect, a group that advocates for Walmart workers. She said the organization will be incorporating “safe abortions” for employees in their list of demands pressing the company for better pay and benefits.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/21/test-of-brendon-mccullums-coaching-mettle-starts-now-with-shaky-england","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T20:00:18Z","webTitle":"Test of Brendon McCullum’s coaching mettle starts now with shaky England | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/21/test-of-brendon-mccullums-coaching-mettle-starts-now-with-shaky-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/21/test-of-brendon-mccullums-coaching-mettle-starts-now-with-shaky-england","fields":{"headline":"Test of Brendon McCullum’s coaching mettle starts now with shaky England","trailText":"Bazball was only ever a bit of fun – the remaining South Africa matches will tell us more about the coach’s real plans","byline":"Barney Ronay","body":"<p>Bazbackability! What is it? And does this current England Test team have any? The answers to these questions are of course: 1) It’s not anything at all, just a made-up word; and 2) No, they don’t, because, again, it’s just a meaningless made-up word. But the fact remains, even buzzwords exist for a reason. Perhaps defeat by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/england-south-africa-first-test-day-three-match-report-cricket\" title=\"\">South Africa in the first Test</a> might be even quite useful in helping to clarify a few things.</p> <p>None of the assembled media were foolish enough to ask England’s head coach about the B-word during his debrief at Lords. Brendon McCullum has been scornful of the Bazball stuff from the start, rightly so given it was only ever intended as a throwaway jape, invented off the cuff by ESPNcricinfo’s Andrew Miller.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/21/south-africa-england-test-series-lords-first-test\">As South Africa’s Test fortunes wax, interest in five-day format wanes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In reality teams are complex, precarious things; a matter of details, luck, insight, planning. Frankly, there is enough in the way of actual problem-solving in McCullum’s in-tray after a devastating England Test defeat: bowled out in 82.4 overs, behind in every session, one half century in two innings and folding at the end like a budget flatpack wardrobe hurled over the rails of a seventh-floor fire escape.</p> <p>And yet this is where the Baz-stuff actually touches on something interesting. Why did the term arise? Because journalism abhors a vacuum and for all the wonderful fourth-innings batting in June nobody knows much about the hard details of what McCullum actually hopes to do with this England Test team.</p> <p>Feelings, principles, general intentions. We know this stuff. There will be a vibe on a balcony. There will be no fear, and indeed no socks. Great guys shall be great unto other great guys. But Bazball became popular because of a lack of specifics, a vague word for a vague approach. It isn’t unrealistic to expect more of a picture to emerge before the end of the current series, resuming in Manchester this week.</p> <p>This is not an attempt to chop McCullum down from his current status as motivational unicorn god, or to blame him, absurdly, for all those deeper structural problems. England looked a familiarly underpowered team at Lord’s: brittle top order, long tail, samey bowling attack. This has little to do with the new head coach. But he is being handsomely paid to work on the fine details, the match-readiness; to have, at least, some kind of plan. Perhaps we will soon find out what it is.</p> <p>Whatever the wider chat, McCullum’s brief comes in two parts this summer. First to make the players he has better. And second to identify other players who might improve the team. The first of these tasks has seen some spectacular early success among players who are already very good at Test cricket. It makes a lot of sense that the idea of freeing up the mind, going hard and all the rest should have its most profound effect on experienced players whose greatest weakness is needing a bit of a jolly-up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"892316e2643e813948fdf597bc754ba82c09e354\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/892316e2643e813948fdf597bc754ba82c09e354/0_133_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England's Zak Crawley is bowled out by South Africa at Lord's\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Zak Crawley may require technical help to improve after his struggles against South Africa at Lord’s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Intentionally or not, McCullum embodies the modern school of player-led coaching, the idea that the gold is essentially inside and the journey to find it can be one of shared discovery. Perhaps the statements McCullum makes in public have a clearer meaning at that level of achievement.</p> <p>“One message will be ‘can we go a little harder?’” he said in reply to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/20/brendon-mccullum-suggests-england-not-hard-enough-against-south-africa\" title=\"\">question about changes for Old Trafford</a>. “Did we go hard enough with our approach? Could we maybe go a little harder and try to turn some pressure back on the opposition as well?” To a hammer everything looks like a nail: of course McCullum wants to go harder. But what does this mean to a player who averages 26 with the bat and whose technique is failing. OK, I’ll go harder. But how do I go harder?</p> <p>Is going hard swinging harder? Is going harder batting for a session and making the ball go soft? Ben Stokes has batted like a man standing on a mound of fire ants all summer. Does he need to go harder? Perhaps he could do this by refusing to throw his wicket away, because that is generally a bit of a downer for the opposition? Stokes is good enough to find his own balance. The real issue is whether McCullum can improve players who have yet to make that step, because this is where his impact is most required. Does he have an actual method for improving Zak Crawley’s batting? If so, he is keeping it close to his chest right now.</p> <p>“I look at a guy like Zak and his skillset is not to be a consistent cricketer,” McCullum said at Lord’s. “He has a game which means, when he gets going, he can win matches for England.” Woah. Put aside the David Brent-as-third-XI-club-cricketer aspect (and to be fair “his skillset is not to be consistent” will draw many nods of recognition). There is almost no actual evidence that Crawley is currently equipped to pluck winning performances out of the air.</p> <p>That brilliant double century against a fine Pakistan attack sits alongside 24 single-figure scores in 48 innings, and little evidence in county cricket of going out and winning games for Kent. This view of him is pure feelings, voodoo, know-the-game stuff, based on the purity of his basic talent and some (no doubt great) conversations.</p> <p>A more persuasive argument is that Crawley keeps getting out the same way and needs someone to help him with that. Even in a time of feelings it is surely possible to acknowledge the need for hard technical help. Duncan Fletcher literally told England’s batsmen how to play spin. For a free thinker, a maverick, it seems like pretty conservative thinking to keep shoving him out in front of the new ball and hoping for different results.</p> <p>By the same token it will also be necessary to find something else in England’s bowling attack this summer. There is no disgrace in being outclassed by the current South Africa pace quartet. But there is room for some of that going-hard when it comes to selection.</p> <p>Matt Potts was selected to fill an injury hole and has shown real spirit and skill. He seems biddable, fit and safe. But he has also found things tougher against India and South Africa and might need some time. The real Baz move here, the out-there, maverick choice, would be to get the best out of Ollie Robinson, who is far from prefect material, but averages 21 in Tests against some very good opponents.</p> <p>Feelings, vibes, energy, going hard, trusting the talent. This is so much easier when that talent has 10 Test hundreds, and has been inside the machine for the last decade. McCullum has promised changes in Manchester. This already sounds intriguing. The lesson of England’s return to the mean at Lord’s is that feelings, faith and balcony-charisma will not be enough on their own.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/2022/aug/21/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T20:00:17Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/aug/21/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/aug/21/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","trailText":"Patrick Manson experiment","byline":"Corrections and clarifications column editor","body":"<p>• An article incorrectly said that, several years before he founded the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Patrick Manson “deliberately infected a Chinese man, Hin-Lo, with malaria”.

The Guardian has not verified the authenticity of the claims.</p> \n<p>Concern about whether Russia would step up its attacks around Ukraine’s independence day had been in the air for some time and predated the Moscow car bomb. But it could be used as an additional pretext by Moscow.</p> \n<p>Prominent Russian hawks blaming Kyiv for the car bomb called it “an assassination attempt” and demanded that the Kremlin respond by targeting government officials in Kyiv.</p> \n<p>“Decision-making centres!! Decision-making centres!!!” wrote Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of the state-funded RT television station, reposting a call to bomb the headquarters of the Ukrainian SBU intelligence agency.</p> \n<p>Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry, said that if a Ukrainian link was confirmed and was verified by the competent authorities, “then we should talk about the policy of state terrorism implemented by the Kyiv regime”.</p> \n<p>If the car bombing is definitively tied to the war, it would mark the first time since February that the violence unleashed on Ukraine has reached the Russian capital, touching the family of a Kremlin ally near one of Moscow’s most exclusive districts.</p> \n<p>Kyiv strongly denied the allegations. “Ukraine has absolutely nothing to do with this, because we are not a criminal state like Russia, or a terrorist one at that,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, said in remarks broadcast on television.</p> \n<p>Keir Giles, a Russia expert at the Chatham House thinktank, said it was unclear whether Ponomarev’s claims about the NRA were true: “How the Kremlin will respond depends on whether this is a genuine resistance movement or a Russia-style complex conspiracy of smoke and mirrors – and we may not know for some time yet.”</p> \n<p>The blast occurred shortly after Dugina left the Tradition cultural festival at an estate where her father had given a lecture. The two were expected to leave together, but instead got into different cars, a friend said.</p> \n<p>Five minutes later, a bomb exploded in the car Dugina was driving, killing her instantly. Witnesses said debris was thrown all over the road as the car was engulfed in flames before crashing into a fence.</p> \n<p>Dugin is known for developing an extreme rightwing view of Russia’s place in the world and had previously advocated violence against Ukraine, while his daughter held similar views. He has been described as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/vladimir-putin-ukraine-attack-antisemitism-denazify\">“Russian fascist”</a> and is a well-known conspiracy theorist.</p> \n<p>Some claim he helped shape the Russian president’s expansionist foreign policy. But the influence of Dugin over Putin remains a subject for speculation, with many insiders saying his sway over the Kremlin was minimal.</p> \n<p>Investigators believed the bombing was “premeditated and of a contract nature”, said Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the investigative committee, the main federal investigating authority in Russia.</p> \n<p>Andrey Krasnov, a friend of Dugina and the head of the Russian Horizon social movement, confirmed the reports, <a href=\"https://tass.com/emergencies/1496355\">according to the news agency Tass</a>. He said the bomb could have been intended for her father.</p> \n<p>“This was the father’s vehicle. Darya was driving another car, but she took his car today, while Alexander went a different way. He returned, he was at the site of the tragedy. As far as I understand, Alexander or probably they together were the target,” Krasnov said.</p> \n<p>However, the independent Russian news agency Agentstvo reported that leaked government databases showed the car was registered to Darya, not her father. Footage on social media appeared to show him at the scene in a state of distress. </p> \n<p>Investigators said they had opened a murder case and would be carrying out forensic examinations to try to determine what happened.

Davies’s family are enduring a nightmare and, in a country full of surveillance cameras, there is little trace of her.</p> <p>The Met’s search of 10,000 hours of footage has produced images placing her in Croydon on 7 July. She was seen walking with a man, in a shop and later on the street.</p> <p>Despite appeals, she has made no contact with her family, missing person charities or police. Her mobile phone and bank cards have also offered no clues since the last sighting of her.</p> <p>Nicol, her desperate mother, has made appeals for her daughter to make contact and fears for her safety have grown – as has the family’s anguish.</p> <p>Met officers came across her early in the police search, it has been revealed, but did not realise who she was. She was reported missing to Essex police on 6 July, the force has confirmed, two days after Owami last left the family home.</p> <p>That evening, at about 11pm, Met officers went to a home in Clarendon Road, Croydon, 30 miles away, to investigate concerns about the welfare of a woman.</p> <p>A source said the woman only gave her first name as Owami, and footage recorded by officers’ body cameras shows her in a distressed state. Officers offered to call an ambulance for her, but she declined.</p> <p>Crucially, the Met insists, she was not at that stage listed as missing, or as high risk, and her details were not on the Police National Computer. Furthermore, as no criminal offence was involved, officers had no powers to do anything else.</p> <p>A Met spokesperson said: “The interaction recorded on the officers’ body-worn video has been viewed by members of the Independent Advisory Group and Owami’s family to ensure openness and transparency.</p> <p>“At the time of the call, Owami was not marked as a missing person on national police systems. She had only been reported to her local force as missing earlier the same day.</p> <p>“As a result of the subsequent missing person investigation, it was later confirmed – on 13 July – that the woman officers had spoken to was Owami.”</p> <p>Essex police were in charge of the investigation until 23 July and insist they classed Davies as high risk, treating the case with due seriousness.</p> <p>Concerns over the 24-year-old’s health meant she was seen as vulnerable. </p> <p>The revelation that Met officers spoke to Davies is expected to be investigated by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, after a referral by the force. Currently, the IOPC is considering what action needs to be taken and the scope of any inquiry.</p> <p>For the Met, dogged by a collapse in public confidence and problems with its services to women and ethnic minorities, claims it has not taken the case seriously enough were feared and have been rejected.</p> <p>A Met spokesperson said: “Our efforts to find Owami are being led by a team of detectives from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command, who are experts in complex investigations. They are supported by resources from local policing teams and are working night and day to pursue every possible line of inquiry.</p> <p>“As of Tuesday this week they had recovered 50,000 hours of CCTV and had viewed 10,000 hours as they work to confirm possible sightings and trace Owami’s movements. They continue to carry out additional patrols in the area she was last seen in an effort to identify new leads.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cae945de0cc8e9ac81211ac863651f47154a8126\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cae945de0cc8e9ac81211ac863651f47154a8126/42_37_856_1070/800.jpg\" alt=\"Owami Davies was wearing a black hoodie, green or grey trousers and dark coloured flip-flops when last seen.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owami Davies was wearing a black hoodie, green or grey trousers and dark coloured flip-flops when last seen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Met Police</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Any suggestion that the investigation is not being taken seriously and that we are not fully dedicated to finding Owami is not only disappointing, it is simply not supported by the facts.”</p> <p>Police have arrested and bailed five men, two on suspicion of murder, and three for kidnap. The Guardian understands detectives believe at least some of them were known to Davies before 4 July.</p> <p>Missing person reports are a difficult issue for forces. They are time-consuming, and frequently no crime has been committed – someone just wants to disappear. In the year to May 2022, the Met received 43,040 missing person reports concerning 21,072 people. Of these, about 5,000 reports were assessed as high risk.</p> <p>One police source said: “Even if you find them, it does not mean you can drag them back. It is not a crime to go missing.”</p> <p>Detectives are none the wiser over Davies’s lack of contact with her family and failure to attend work.</p> <p>She was close to finishing her studies, having secured a job at Guy’s and St Thomas’ health trust. She had worked in accident and emergency department during the Covid crisis and was interested in studying infectious diseases, according to her family.</p> <p>Further appeals from the Met are expected this week, and for Davies’s family, the agony continues.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Anyone with information can call the police on 020 8721 4622, or to remain anonymous contact <a href=\"https://crimestoppers-uk.org/\">Crimestoppers</a> on 0800 555 111 or online.</em></p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2022/aug/21/thrills-aplenty-in-the-premier-leagues-great-sportswashing-derby","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T18:39:38Z","webTitle":"Thrills aplenty in the Premier League’s great sportswashing derby | Jonathan Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/21/thrills-aplenty-in-the-premier-leagues-great-sportswashing-derby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2022/aug/21/thrills-aplenty-in-the-premier-leagues-great-sportswashing-derby","fields":{"headline":"Thrills aplenty in the Premier League’s great sportswashing derby","trailText":"Newcastle and Manchester City entertained in a six-goal draw at St James’ but the clubs’ owners and history will not be forgotten","byline":"Jonathan Wilson at St James' Park","body":"<p>Pep Guardiola was agitated. He stalked the touchline, hands on hips, brooding. He gestured at Bernardo Silva and, during a break for an injury, gave him lengthy instructions. Manchester City were 1-0 up and creating chances, but Guardiola often serves as his own canary in the mine, his agitation indicating long before it becomes apparent in concrete actions that something is amiss.</p> <p>When Ilkay Gündogan put City ahead in the fifth minute, the assumption was that Eddie Howe was on his way to an 11th defeat in 11 games against Guardiola. Everybody knows the drill: Guardiola praises Howe for the football his side plays, all that passing and so little of that nasty tackling, all that space and so little of that closing down, and then helps himself to a comfortable win: the cumulative goal-difference between the two before kick-off was 31-4 in Guardiola’s favour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/newcastle-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Haaland and Silva rescue draw for Manchester City in Newcastle thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Guardiola was right. Something had gone awry. The game was surprisingly open; there was little of the control City so privilege. Newcastle landed blow after blow, City landed blow after blow. There was brilliant football, an extraordinary finish from the outside of Callum Wilson’s foot, an exquisite pass from Kevin De Bruyne; there was a breathless physicality to it all, men at it all over the place, something aided – for good or for ill, depending whether you were kicker or kickee – by the willingness of the Australian referee Jarred Gillett to let the game flow, which culminated in his VAR-aided decision to overturn the red card he had shown to Kieran Trippier for a cynical knee-high challenge on a flying De Bruyne.</p> <p>This was, by some margin, the greatest sportswashing derby the Premier League has known. It may have sold its soul to nation states with questionable human rights records (or their public investment funds), but at least it seems to have got a good price for it. There was, needless to say, no reference from the home support to the case of the Leeds student Salma al-Shehab, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/plea-for-liz-truss-to-act-after-saudis-jail-uk-student-for-34-years-over-twitter-use\" title=\"\">who was sentenced last week to 34 years in jail by a Saudi court</a> for apparently supporting activists and dissidents on Twitter.</p> <p>And yes, the transition is awkward, but then so is the whole concept of states owning football clubs; a disconnect of tone is impossible to avoid, which is why these cherished institutions, these beacons of local pride, these theatres of excitement and fun, should never have been allowed to fall into the hands of foreign states looking to gain influence and burnish their images. It should never have become the case that fans should have their weekend recreation tainted by the activities of a distant court.</p> <p>At the heart of the afternoon’s drama was Allan Saint-Maximin, a player whose fizzing, unpredictable talents are the antithesis of Guardiola’s football. Again and again he got a run at Kyle Walker. Inside the full-back, John Stones had the sort of wild, staring look that in the 80s would have won him an Oscar in a film about Vietnam.</p> <p>City, imperious in dismissing West Ham and Bournemouth, suddenly looked as anxious as they had in the final minutes of the Community Shield against Liverpool when Darwin Núñez briefly ran them ragged – which perhaps isn’t saying much more than that it’s difficult for defenders when big powerful forwards run at them. Two of those Saint‑Maximin incursions brought goals before half-time; a third led to the free‑kick from which Trippier whipped in Newcastle’s third.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db8fcb56c55fc60bd576166ac39e77d58d18e498\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db8fcb56c55fc60bd576166ac39e77d58d18e498/0_103_2827_1696/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernardo Silva of Manchester City scores to make it 3-3 against Newcastle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernardo Silva scored the equalising goal for Manchester City against Newcastle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruce White/Colorport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But 3-1 was not lead enough. De Bruyne found a new gear and inspired a City comeback capped by Bernardo Silva’s equaliser, a clever run and neat finish entirely typical both of him and City’s football. Lots of aspects of Barcelona’s pursuit of Silva don’t make sense, of which their capacity to pay for yet another player seems almost the least significant – in their world of fantasy economics, it seems, there is always another lever to be pulled, more family silver to be flogged. Far more profound is the issue of why City would be prepared to let him go.</p> <p>Perhaps it was simply a matter of economics, that if somebody offers £100m for a 28-year-old, it makes no sense not at least to consider it. But Silva – diminutive, technically gifted, industrious, intelligent – feels like the physical embodiment of the Guardiola philosophy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/pep-guardiola-praises-top-class-eddie-howe-and-aggression-of-newcastle\">Pep Guardiola praises ‘top class’ Eddie Howe and aggression of Newcastle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was his first league start of the season, something that perhaps reflects less uncertainty about his own position than the enhanced status of Gündogan since he was voted club captain in the summer. With Rodri and Kalvin Phillips contesting the holding midfield role and De Bruyne essentially guaranteed to start, that reduces midfield opportunities for Silva.</p> <p>At St James’ Park he was deployed on the right, offering vital attacking both width and drifting dangerously infield. It was from wide that he set up the opener for Gündogan, having received the ball in space and then held possession expertly, evading four half-challenges without really having to beat anybody. Yet it was down his flank that the majority of Newcastle’s threat came.</p> <p>So, three games into the season, only Arsenal are left with a perfect record and the more sanguine of City’s rivals will draw heart from the unexpected vulnerability they demonstrated. The less optimistic will note how ominously impressive City’s fightback was. And neutrals will feel blessed to have witnessed a magnificently entertaining draw – while trying their best not to think what has funded it.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/21/palestinian-flight-plan-mired-confusion-eve-first-departure","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T18:33:22Z","webTitle":"Palestinian flight plan shelved on eve of first scheduled departure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/palestinian-flight-plan-mired-confusion-eve-first-departure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/21/palestinian-flight-plan-mired-confusion-eve-first-departure","fields":{"headline":"Palestinian flight plan shelved on eve of first scheduled departure","trailText":"Controversial plan to fly people from occupied West Bank to Turkey has been paused","byline":"Bethan McKernan in Jerusalem","body":"<p>A controversial plan to allow Palestinians to fly to Turkey from southern Israel’s Ramon airport has been shelved on the eve of the first scheduled departure.</p> <p>Israel’s airport authority announced earlier this month that Ramon in the Negev desert, near the Red Sea city of Eilat, would begin allowing Palestinians from the occupied West Bank to travel on Turkish-operated flights to Antalya and Istanbul from 22 August.</p> <p>The proposal is believed to be part of a package of goodwill measures from Israel to the Palestinians unveiled to the US president, Joe Biden, during his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/13/biden-commits-to-israels-security-as-he-embarks-on-middle-east-tour\">visit to the region</a> last month, reportedly offered on the condition that the Palestinians withdraw their charge of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/mar/03/icc-open-formal-investigation-war-crimes-palestine\">war crimes</a> at the international criminal court.</p> <p>However, on Sunday the Israel Airports Authority said in a statement that the plan had been paused and that an announcement would be made when a new date was set,<a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/plan-to-let-palestinians-use-eilats-ramon-airport-shelved/\"> the Times of Israel reported</a>. The statement did not set out a reason for the pause.</p> <p>Officials in the West Bank city of Ramallah had previously publicly rejected the plan, saying it had not been coordinated with the Palestinian Authority (PA) and bypasses the Palestinians’ right to a sovereign airport. Critics have said that Ramon, which opened in 2019, has struggled to attract international business.</p> <p>“Israel failed to turn Ramon airport into an international terminal,” a Palestinian official <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/article-712751\">told the Jerusalem Post</a>. “Now, the Israelis are offering us something that didn’t work for them. This reminds me of the coronavirus vaccines, which Israel offered us because the expiration dates were nearing.”</p> <p>Freedom of movement is one of the biggest problems facing people living in the occupied Palestinian territories. At present, those in the West Bank can only travel internationally through the Allenby Bridge (known as the King Hussein Bridge in Jordan) and then on to Amman. Allenby is often overcrowded, leading to hours-long waits in uncomfortable conditions.</p> <p>In the blockaded Gaza Strip, most people who are given permission to leave travel to Egypt, driving for one or two days through the dangerous Sinai peninsula to reach Cairo.</p> <p>With rare exceptions, only high-level Palestinian officials and family members are allowed to use Israel’s major international airport, Ben Gurion, near Tel Aviv.</p> <p>Remarks attributed to a Palestinian ministry of transport source published in Palestinian outlets last week suggested the PA would fine or otherwise punish people who sought to use Ramon.</p> <p>“The PA has no right to do or say anything about Ramon airport. They have permits and VIP cards so they and their families can travel through Ben Gurion, while we have to go to Jordan and spend one day there before the flight, and spend money,” a Palestinian critic of the PA said in a popular TikTok post.</p> <p>“So do not sell us patriotism, and don’t say it is without coordinating with the PA. All the PA officials care about is their personal interests.”</p> <p>Prior to the IAA’s statement being released many details remained unknown about the plan.</p> <p>A consultant for Israel’s Arkia airline told local media that Palestinians would be issued a special permit from specific tourism offices in order to enter Israel, and would not be able to bring hold luggage.</p> <p>All prospective passengers were to be searched at a checkpoint south of Hebron before being transferred to Israeli buses for a three-hour journey to the airport, he added.</p> <p>Israeli media <a href=\"https://www.israelhayom.com/2022/07/22/eilat-residents-outraged-over-plan-to-allow-palestinians-to-use-ramon-airport/\">also reported</a> that residents of Eilat, as well as the city’s leadership, were unhappy about the proposed arrangement, arguing they were not informed beforehand. The presence of Palestinians at Ramon poses a “security threat”, said the deputy mayor, Matan Beeri, adding: “We won’t let this happen.”</p> <p>Jerusalem international airport, also known as Qalandia, opened in 1924 during the British mandate. It has been occupied by Israel since the six-day war of 1967 and was closed to civilian traffic in 2000, after the outbreak of the second intifada (Palestinian uprising).</p> <p>Yasser Arafat international airport, serving the Gaza Strip, opened in 1998. It operated for two years before also closing as a result of the intifada.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 21 August 2022.

Every generation thinks that its footballers are or were the best, but those of us who lived in past eras don’t have anywhere near as much evidence to prove it. For example what about those who played in the so-called Match of the Century at Wembley in November 1953, including Stanley Matthews and Alf Ramsey for England, and Puskas, Hidegkuti and Kocsis for Hungary? And then in the return game six months later there were Ivor Broadis and Tom Finney. (In both games England got hammered incidentally). And that was just in two teams! Every generation has its greats, not just this one.”</p> <p>Those are all great players, but they were the two best teams in the world at the time so you’d expect that. I’d saying that the Premier League, and football in general, has never had so many good players – not that the ones we have now are the best, just that, as more people want to play the game, there’s more money in it, and better methods of coaching, there are more who are good at it. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6302645f8f081780606cc81c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-21T16:59:20.850Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>68 min </strong>Pope is now up and the game is back under way. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-630264028f08f8ea5d3a1985\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-08-21T16:59:07.132Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>66 min </strong>Pope is down with some kind of knack.

Whether we’re contemplating summer, love or football, once we’re ensconced within a rhythm – hot days, disappointing nights, predictable results – it can seem like things will never change.</p> <p>Such are Manchester City. Champions of England in four of the last five seasons, they’ve won 11 and drawn three of their last 14 league games – in which time they’ve also added Erling Haaland, making the prospect of their failing to win any game look extremely remote. We must never forget that all this is a facility of state wealth, but it feels like a state of permanence nevertheless.</p> <p>Of course, sport and football are rarely like that – City were once where Newcastle are now, bankrolled by some of the planet’s most renowned altruists for the simple joy of the game. Things have changed since then, though. Where City had a free run at players as brilliant as David Silva, Sergio Aguëro and Yaya Touré and rivals, in Man United, whose owners prioritised silver over silverware, there are now financial fair play rules which make it harder to penetrate the elite, and chief execs whose personal interests largely coincide with those of their clubs.</p> <p>Which isn’t to say Newcastle haven’t improved a lot over the last bit; they have. Bruno Guimarães is a fine player, far better than any they might have expected to sign at this point; Joelinton, or Big Joe as Steve Bruce liked to call him, has been a revelation in midfield; and the defence now looks like a defence.</p> <p>All very nice, but to cause problems for City will take significantly more than we’ve seen from the iteration of Newcastle. They are capable – if they find the level they hit in dismantling Arsenal at the end of last season, they can hurt City – but anything less, and they’re for it.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 4.30pm BST</strong></p> </div>   </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/21/ex-russian-mp-claims-russian-partisans-responsible-for-moscow-car-bomb","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T17:54:15Z","webTitle":"Ex-Russian MP claims Russian partisans responsible for Moscow car bomb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/ex-russian-mp-claims-russian-partisans-responsible-for-moscow-car-bomb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/21/ex-russian-mp-claims-russian-partisans-responsible-for-moscow-car-bomb","fields":{"headline":"Ex-Russian MP claims Russian partisans responsible for Moscow car bomb","trailText":"Speaking in Kyiv, Ilya Ponomarev alleges bomb that killed daughter of Putin ally was work of underground group","byline":"Luke Harding","body":"<p>A former member of Russia’s Duma who was expelled for anti-Kremlin activities has claimed that Russian partisans were allegedly behind a car bomb which blew up the daughter of one of Vladimir Putin’s close political allies on the outskirts of Moscow.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GyHRMTA_bc\">Speaking in Kyiv</a>, where he is based, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/07/russian-language-ukrainian-tv-channel-aims-to-topple-putin\">Ilya Ponomarev</a> alleged the explosion on Saturday evening was the work of the National Republican Army, which he claimed was an underground group working inside Russia and dedicated to overthrowing the Putin regime.</p> <p>The Guardian has not verified the authenticity of Ponomarev’s claims.

Bernardo Silva was allowed to direct an in-swinging right-wing cross in Ilkay Gündogan’s direction and, after drifting into the space between Kieran Trippier and Fabian Schär, Gündogan had sufficient time to control the ball before lashing it beyond Pope.</p> <p>With the impressive Pope saving smartly from Kevin De Bruyne in the wake of Joe Willock’s forfeiture of midfield possession and the influential Bruno Guimarães required to watch his step after collecting a booking for clattering De Bruyne, Newcastle were, albeit briefly, up against it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Creditably, such adversity seemed to imbue them with newfound attacking ferocity and, despite Pope’s legs once again coming to the rescue to deny Phil Foden, their counterattacking gave Guardiola’s defence cause for serious consternation. City’s spotless defensive record appeared under acute strain and, in the 28th minute, it was stained when Miguel Almirón used a thigh to nudge Saint-Maximin’s cross past Ederson. Although the equaliser was initially ruled out for offside, a VAR review overruled that decision.</p> <p>The subsequent outpouring of joy from the majority of the 52,000 full house was informed partly by a sense of justice having been finally dispensed in the wake of Jack Grealish’s cruelly classless comments about the Paraguayan’s supposed inadequacies as City celebrated last spring’s title win.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"05a26eca6c150b4f52193bb7cd7be7742a1bac05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05a26eca6c150b4f52193bb7cd7be7742a1bac05/0_236_3714_2228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kieran Trippier leads the celebrations after putting Newcastle 3-1 up against the champions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kieran Trippier leads the celebrations after putting Newcastle 3-1 up against the champions.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The England midfielder’s words incensed Newcastle’s players and there was a suspicion that Grealish’s absence – officially due to injury – on Saturday might have been diplomatic. Watching remotely Grealish will have noted that, bar missing one sitter, Almirón played extremely well, combining superbly with Saint-Maximin.</p> <p>It is safe to assume John Stones will never be tempted to issue the slightest criticism of the latter after this, and particularly not in the wake of being tortured by the French winger near the halfway line in the preamble to Newcastle’s second goal.</p> <p>Callum Wilson proved the beneficiary of the subsequent through pass and, having taken one fabulous touch to dodge Rúben Dias, Howe’s centre-forward evaded Ederson’s reach with his second. Dispatched with the outside of his right foot, it was an imperious finish and, scored in front of the England manager, Gareth Southgate, added credence to the argument that, Harry Kane apart, there is no better English No 9.</p> <p>Strikers rarely come more formidable than Norway’s Erling Haaland but the new focal point of Guardiola’s attack was subdued for long periods by Sven Botman and Fabian Schär. Indeed despite Haaland escaping their attentions by dropping deep when Pope was required to tip his shot onto a post, Newcastle had City on the ropes for quite some time. Guardiola was left literally scratching his head after Trippier sent an out-swinging free-kick arcing over the visiting wall and curving imperiously into the top corner up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/pep-guardiola-praises-top-class-eddie-howe-and-aggression-of-newcastle\">Pep Guardiola praises ‘top class’ Eddie Howe and aggression of Newcastle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The moment had arrived for Haaland to remind everyone what all the fuss was about and, in volleying Rodri’s flick on from De Bruyne’s cross unerringly beyond Pope he did not disappoint.</p> <p>With the power balance shifting imperceptibly and the game becoming more open than ever, Newcastle’s goalkeeper saved well again from Haaland before De Bruyne’s gorgeous, defence confounding reverse pass was stroked into the bottom corner by Silva. Ominously for Howe, De Bruyne’s growing impact was akin to brilliant sunshine emerging from a bank of cloud.</p> <p>The sight of the Belgian illuminating a midfield in which Joelinton had earlier shone, precipitated Trippier catching De Bruyne on the knee with a rash, high tackle. Howe looked suitably relieved as Jarred Gillett’s initial straight red card turned yellow following a VAR review. Things continued in similarly kaleidoscopic, on occasion borderline chaotic, vein until the final whistle finally halted what will surely rank as a 21st-century classic.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/21/the-guardian-view-on-microworking-younger-educated-workers-left-powerless","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T17:30:16Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on microworking: younger, educated workers left powerless | Editorial ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/the-guardian-view-on-microworking-younger-educated-workers-left-powerless","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/the-guardian-view-on-microworking-younger-educated-workers-left-powerless","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on microworking: younger, educated workers left powerless ","trailText":"<strong>Editorial: </strong>Pay rates of £4 an hour should be no surprise when working conditions are overseen by extractive technologies","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>Microwork – short digital tasks assigned to workers, who are paid piece wages via online platforms – is now firmly part of UK employment. <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-11/Platform%20essays%20with%20polling%20data.pdf\" title=\"\">Almost one in eight</a> workers in the UK “won” the right to perform digital tasks remotely in 2021 by bidding for “jobs” on the web.

Academics Phil Jones and James Muldoon found that one in five workers they interviewed relied on this precarious form of labour. A typical microwork day might consist of <a href=\"https://techwontsave.us/episode/101_the_poorly_paid_workers_powering_automation_w_phil_jones\" title=\"\">30 or 40 tasks</a> for different platforms – each lasting between 30 seconds and 20 minutes.</p> <p>The microworkforce is largely hidden, but Autonomy’s report suggests that in the UK it is young and well-educated, with more than 60% having at least a degree. Some workers do appreciate the flexibility of microwork, but the thinktank warns that many are “<a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/online-jobs-for-less-than-4-per-hour-microwork-is-exploiting-thousands-of-brits/\" title=\"\">stressed [and] burnt out</a>” by the constant hunt for tasks. Hidden beneath the claims of freedom is the fact that the platforms exercise firm control over most aspects of how, and to what standard, work is done. Workers have nowhere to go if a platform refuses to pay out.</p> <p>Microworkers are left defenceless because employment rights were established in a legal system designed for another age. At present there are three categories of <a href=\"https://knowledge.leglobal.org/eic/country/united-kingdom/legal-framework-differentiating-employees-independent-contractors-21/\" title=\"\">employment status</a> in the UK: employee, worker and independent contractor. Only the first category is entitled to full employment rights, including redundancy payments, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal. Digital platforms – the first was <a href=\"https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/artificial-intelligence-quietly-relies-on-workers-earning-2-per-hour/\" title=\"\">Amazon’s Mechanical Turk</a> – assume their hires to be contractors. Autonomy suggests changing the law so that they are treated as workers, paid a minimum wage and given paid holidays. It also advocates a universal workers’ rights programme – including rights to <a href=\"https://autonomy.work/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/universal-workers-rights-v2.pdf\" title=\"\">childcare and to disconnect</a>.</p> <p>This would be very welcome, but needs a shift in political thinking.

Melbourne in particular has a thriving game-developer scene, thanks to a combination of state government funding, tax incentives and a creator-friendly vibe. More than 44% of studios are based in Victoria, according to a <a href=\"https://igea.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IGEA-AGD-Survey-Report-2021-22-Final.pdf\">2021 survey from the Independent Games and Entertainment Association</a>, as well as more than 57% of the workforce.</p> <p>“There’s such a creative energy, there’s so many cool studios,” Wilton says. “I think having that community of developers that are on a similar level to you is great inspiration; you can talk shop, compare contacts, they can help you out, you can help them out. It’s very community.”</p> <p>Like many Australian game developers, the Massive Monster team credit the state’s investment in the industry for helping them achieve international success.

Whereas if you have a really big team the ideas might get diluted or standardised.”</p> <p>Dawson agrees: “Because we share culture with North America and the UK [and] yet are also outsiders, Australian and NZ devs are well positioned to come at concepts in fresh and off-kilter ways that can be an effective way to punch through the noise.” </p> <p>Successful ideas so far include the goose-simulating slapstick of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/oct/04/poultry-in-motion-untitled-goose-games-creators-on-how-they-laid-the-golden-egg\">Untitled Goose Game</a>, the meditative zen of sorting objects and moving house in Dawson’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/nov/02/unpacking-the-meditative-puzzle-game-thats-all-about-organising\">Unpacking</a>, and the brutal, challenging exploration of a dead and emptied world of insects in Hollow Knight – to say nothing of Cult of the Lamb’s strange, cute-but-creepy mix of community management and vengeful crusading.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89d47a4ad019aa21c799e3c1a73b8de57d350a5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89d47a4ad019aa21c799e3c1a73b8de57d350a5c/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cult of the Lamb \" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cult of the Lamb could hit more than a million units sold this month, according to its developers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Massive Monster</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dr Marcus Carter, director of the University of Sydney’s Games and Play Lab, believes the success of Australian games internationally is the result of a “solid foundation of talent and creativity”.</p> <p>“It’s clear that Australian games are imagining a much wider audience of players with a much broader conceptualisation of what play can look like,” he says. “Who would have thought moving house could be so fun?”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/02/the-10-best-video-games-made-in-australia-sorted\">The 10 best video games made in Australia – sorted</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Attention has focused on <a href=\"https://www.arts.gov.au/what-we-do/screen/digital-games#:~:text=The%20DGTO%20will%20be%20available,on%20qualifying%20Australian%20development%20expenditure.\">federal-level tax offsets</a> for international companies spending large amounts of money but Carter and his University of Sydney colleague Dr Mark Johnson, think many successful games are now coming “from smaller-scale, bottom-up productions” with roots in the “quality of Australia’s game-development education”.</p> <p>“Insofar as the Australian games sector is doing well, it’s doing so on the back of indies and creatives, rather than major investments or state support,” Johnson says, “but the hope is always that the former might lead to the latter, by proving the viability of the field.</p> <p>“Financial support and government interest is important, but other facets – cultural rather than economic – all take time to slowly evolve and develop.

Someone’s nose will be put out of joint, so potent are our ties to the snacks that form the foundations of our childhood.</p> <p>With that in mind, I’ve decided to go in as hard as I can towards brutal honesty, feelings be damned. Here, then, are the 10 best snacks embraced by Australians.</p> <h2>11. Tim Tams</h2> <p>If you thought this absolute scrublord snack was going to be No 1 on this list, you’re dreaming. The Tim Tam is the most basic Australian snack food, and yes, I mean that as an insult.</p> <p>Coveted for god knows what reason, this mediocrity is sitting here for two reasons: one, because if I don’t put it here, the comments section will blow up, and two, because putting it here outside the confines of the list is deeply amusing, and will <em>guarantee</em> the comments section will blow up. When it comes to hedonism, this sub-par biscuit is the equivalent of a sexy fireman calendar and a bath ringed with scented tea candles. May it burn in the pits of mediocrity forever.</p> <p>If you’re still reading and didn’t log off because that last one touched too much of a nerve, welcome. Here begins the real list.</p> <h2>10. Double Dip</h2> <p>Double Dip is a corner-shop staple, and remains so to this very day. Why? Behold: the illusion of choice. Do you eat the orange sherbert? Do you eat the cherry sherbert? Or do you smash the system, and eat the very implement used for scooping and eating the sherbert? Ahh. But the makers of Double Dip know the terrible truth: you’ll eat it all in the end. It’s like The Matrix, if you take the blue pill AND the red pill. AND eat Morpheus.</p> <h2>9. Scribbler</h2> <p>The Tasmanian Tiger of Australian junk food, the Scribbler was an ice block sold by Streets back in the nineties. It looked like a large pencil, with yellow for the wooden interior and a red coating. A chocolate ball was the lead. There was something so illicit about chowing down on a giant pencil, but it was the combination of ice block and chocolate that really pushed the boat out here.</p> <p>Streets wheeled out chocolate-free bastardisations over the years, but we’re not fooled. So obscure is the original Scribbler that you can only find images like the one above. See? It’s almost mythical. Also, being a kid who refused to pick up a pencil and do their damned homework, but who was only too happy to eat a pencil within full view of their parents? That’s power, my friends.</p> <h2>8. Iced Vovo</h2> <p>People regularly claim that the Iced Vovo used to be larger. Pillowy. And yet when you buy them now, they’re very small, and very flat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulverhoeven/status/1136776915568619520\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">god damn it i just made an angry iced vovo meme <a href=\"https://t.co/xuhISJf9H8\">pic.twitter.com/xuhISJf9H8</a></p>&mdash; Paul F Verhoeven (@paulverhoeven) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulverhoeven/status/1136776915568619520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 6, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Now after much digging – and arguing – it turns out this is a prime case of the Mandela Effect, wherein a large number of people get confused about a thing, perpetuate it, and years later, the fake thing has replaced the real thing in their heads. Enter this thread:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NanoRaptor/status/1395884032886403074\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rewriting history #289. About 20 years ago, maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less, I photoshopped either this image, or one like it (I did some similar ones after the original) to show Australian Arnott&#39;s Iced Vovos with marshmallows on them. I think it was in response to a friend- <a href=\"https://t.co/9vUfwksSaW\">pic.twitter.com/9vUfwksSaW</a></p>&mdash; Dana Sibera (@NanoRaptor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NanoRaptor/status/1395884032886403074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 21, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>See, it turns out there’s a good chance that an old Photoshop job, mingled with real memories, convinced people that Iced Vovos are pillowy, marshmallow wonderment. With all of this in mind, why is the Iced Vovo still so low on this list? Because we’ve been had, that’s why. And someone has to pay. Why not the Iced Vovo?</p> <h2>7. Musk sticks</h2> <p>Musk is used primarily in perfume. Why do we eat it? Why is it compressed into pink sticks and thrown in jars? Because we have refined palates here in Australia, that’s why. In an age where gastronomical pioneering is championed, where sweet and savoury are blended, and where florals work their way into cocktails, what’s so wild about a musk flavoured lolly? Nothing, that’s what. Oh, and much like any good proctologist will tell you, soft ones are good ones, and avoid the hard, chalky ones at all costs.</p> <h2>6. Milo</h2> <p>Milo belongs on the periodic table. So primal and fundamental it is to the firmament, the very bedrock of Australian food culture, that its inclusion on a list of junk food is like including flour in a list of the 10 best cakes. How do you eat Milo? Do you pour then stir like crazy? Hot or cold? Do you deposit three heaped tablespoons atop a glass of milk and try not to sneeze? Or do you eat it from the tin like a filthy bin wizard? No judgement here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jul/04/from-snot-block-to-meat-pie-australian-baked-goods-sorted\">From ‘snot block’ to meat pie: Australian baked goods – sorted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Milo website claims that the drink is named after “MILO® of Croton, a Greek wrestler who lived in the 6th century BC and possessed legendary strength”, which is all well and good. But beware any company so powerful it can literally trademark the name of an ancient Greek wrestler.</p> <h2>5. Bertie Beetle</h2> <p>Plenty of products have been ousted from the annals of Australia’s snack food history books, but much like insects, Bertie Beetle has hidden in the cracks and survived. Thrived? No. But escaping into the confectionary crawl space that is the cut-price showbag industry is an ingenious way to ride out the storm. They’re kind of tasty, I guess, but it’s their bizarre mascot that really makes them shine. Is Bertie Beetle a hero? A villain? Either way, he’ll outlive us all.</p> <h2>4. Tasty Toobs</h2> <p>You’ve got to respect a snack that dies in the early naughties then returns due to public demand. Discontinued in 2001, mounting pressure from Aussies brought the Tasty Toob back in 2007. It left again in 2015, and has come back again, hitting shelves in 2021. Tasty Toobs are the John Farnham of snacks. Smiling Jack? No. Smiling SNACK … I’ll show myself out.</p> <h2>3. Rainbow Paddlepop</h2> <p>“Actually, it’s just caramel flavoured” is the “actually, it’s Frankenstein’s MONSTER” of the Australian ice-cream world. Yes, Dad, we know the rainbow paddlepop is caramel flavoured. Although … is it? Remember climbing out of the local pool, hot pavement burning your feet as you run to the shade of the kiosk to order a paddlepop? Remember gazing upon the swirling eddies of colour, drunk on the possibilities? The sugar rockets straight to your young brain; the stick is tacky with melting icecream. We don’t care. Caramel? That’s not caramel we’re holding in our hands. That’s the universe.</p> <h2>2. Polly Waffle</h2> <p>Dads love two things: making excellent time, and Pollywaffles. Perhaps it’s because deep down, dads feel deeply misunderstood. Perhaps they love an underdog. Perhaps they’re running headfirst towards a diabetes diagnosis. Whatever the case, I’ve bought and handed a Pollywaffle to three dads in my life. Each time, they reacted like I was the Lady in the Lake handing Excalibur back to Arthur. Honestly, there’s something weird going on here, and who am I to get between a Papa and his Polly? Nobody. That’s who.</p> <h2>1. The Agro cone</h2> <p>It’s the most basic rule of economics: scarcity increases value. By that metric, the Agro cone is staggeringly valuable. Technically, the sugar content of many of the snacks on this list would all but guarantee they’d survive the nucleariest of nuclear winters. But the Agro cone? That was a moment in time. A cultural touchstone tethered to a perpetually petulant puppet. It’s the food equivalent of Nikki Webster being lowered into the Olympic stadium.</p> <p>Sure, you can technically go and order an Agro cone from a Mister Whippy. Sure, you can technically knock on Nikki Webster’s door and ask her to perform for you. But both had a brief, shining window outside of which, unless you were there, you’ll never truly grasp what all the fuss was about.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2022/aug/22/easy-book-week-costume-ideas-do-you-have-a-box-there-are-lots-of-cubes-in-childrens-books","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T17:30:16Z","webTitle":"Easy Book Week costume ideas: ‘Do you have a box?

She was that mum.</p> <p>And then, one year, there was a glitch in the system. I found myself on book parade in a cardboard box, with some doors drawn in black marker on it.

Eyeliner will save you</h2> <p>Do you have face paint in the house? Wonderful!

Makeup is also fine. A bit of judicious eyeliner will make a very good nose and whiskers – the foundation for so many storybook animals.</p> <p>Is that Fantastic Mr Fox there with ears made from Weetbix cardboard and a pillowcase hastily labelled ‘Rabbits and Chickens’? Why yes. Could that be Laura from Little House on the Prairie with her freckles and gingham dress? Indeed, it is the one and same. Do I spy Vincent Van Bear with the straw hat and paint palette?

rebound slowed by Australians leaving the country since borders reopened","trailText":"Deloitte employment forecast adds to calls to improve pathways to permanency for skilled migrants and expand humanitarian visa program","byline":"Paul Karp","body":"<p>Australia’s migration rebound since reopening its borders is being slowed by an almost equal flow of Australians holidaying or moving overseas for work.</p> \n<p>That is one finding of a Deloitte Access Economics employment forecast, to be released on Monday, which adds to calls before the jobs and skills summit to improve pathways to permanency for skilled migrants.</p> \n<p>The Deloitte report notes “there are now only slightly more unemployed people than job vacancies” and says those record job vacancies could be a “great opportunity” to expand the humanitarian visa program.</p> \n<p>More than 29,000 people arrived in the three months to December 2021 – the first net increase since the onset of Covid – although this only reverses about one-quarter of the 113,000 people lost to overseas migration in the previous 18 months.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/14/labor-vows-to-prioritise-australian-jobs-as-government-eyes-migration-boost\">Labor vows to prioritise Australian jobs as it eyes migration boost </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Deloitte report noted this was a “good first step” and a “turning point in Australia’s population and labour supply fortunes”.</p> \n<p>“Currently, for every permanent or long-term arrival in Australia there are 0.9 departures – well above the ratio of 0.65 departures per arrival seen prior to the pandemic.</p> \n<p>“Despite this ratio being elevated, there are still more people arriving permanently or long-term in Australia than there are leaving – a strong indication that net overseas migration in Australia was positive through the first half of 2022.”</p> \n<p>Separate to the Deloitte report, the government released the top 10 in demand professions for Australia over the next five years, based on the skills priority list, data on job vacancies and projected growth in employment.</p> \n<p>Construction managers, civil engineering professionals, early childhood teachers, registered nurses, ICT and system analysts and software and application programmers top the list, with electricians, chefs, child carers and aged and disabled carers rounding it out.</p> \n<p>The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the government’s promised 465,000 fee-free Tafe places would help address some skills shortages.</p> \n<p>“Our goal is to build a strong VET sector to help more Australians get secure, well-paying jobs, while providing the skilled workers that business needs to grow our economy,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Next week we are hosting our Jobs and Skills Summit that will brings together unions, business groups and the people who help run our world-class VET sector, to look at how we deliver immediate action on the skills shortages Australia is facing.”</p> \n<p>A Deloitte partner, Fiona Webb, said the “highest order priority” of Australia’s migration settings at the summit to be held in Canberra was “to clearly signal to the world that Australia is open for business”.</p> \n<p>Skilled migrants “want to know they will be able to get in and out of the country without complication and have greater certainty about longer term options to remain in Australia”.</p> \n<p>A Deloitte partner and the report’s lead author, David Rumbens, said “migration comes in many forms, and while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/17/unions-and-employers-agree-40000-more-migrants-a-year-needed-to-fill-australias-skills-shortage\">skilled migrants have been a recent key focus for business</a> and the media, there are also other streams that can enhance Australia’s pool of labour”.</p> \n<p>“We have a great opportunity to expand our existing humanitarian migration program, with the longer-term economic and social benefits of doing so profound.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a

Nor is it surprising that there is a variation in the coverage now, as some were even less enthusiastic than others. But it’s still really disappointing, because in a landscape that’s flooded with all kinds of content from all kinds of sources, properly curated, readily accessible Australian programming is needed more than ever.”</p> <p>The minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, said the figures were stark.

called “NSW Deserves Better” and “The 10 Big Ideas to Grow NSW” in 2010 and 2011 before the election that saw the Coalition sweep to power.</p> <p>“After the landslide win by the Coalition in March 2011, I am pleased to say that the O’Farrell government quickly implemented six of our 10 Big Ideas,” he wrote.</p> <p>“I will always feel that I was privileged to have led the chamber in NSW during

Earlier this year Pask and his team received <a href=\"https://www.unimelb.edu.au/newsroom/news/2022/march/no-longer-science-fiction-$5m-gift-brings-de-extinction-of-the-thylacine-one-step-closer\">a $5m philanthropic gift</a> to set up a thylacine integrated genetic restoration research (acronynm: Tigrr) lab. Last week came the announcement that the lab had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/de-extinction-scientists-are-planning-the-multimillion-dollar-resurrection-of-the-tasmanian-tiger\">partnered with Colossal</a>, a US “de-extinction” company that uses cutting edge CRISPR gene-editing technology, for an even larger sum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/de-extinction-scientists-are-planning-the-multimillion-dollar-resurrection-of-the-tasmanian-tiger\">De-extinction: scientists are planning the multimillion-dollar resurrection of the Tasmanian tiger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ambition breeds grand statements, and Pask and Colossal’s co-founder, the tech and software entrepreneur Ben Lamm, have their share. Their timeframes differ a bit – Pask is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/16/de-extinction-scientists-are-planning-the-multimillion-dollar-resurrection-of-the-tasmanian-tiger\">more cautious</a> – but both say the Tasmanian tiger could be back in its homeland within a decade. It sounds fantastic, in both senses. The suggestion by some that it was all a Jurassic Park-style reverie was perhaps not helped by the news that <a href=\"https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/hemsworth-fund-thylacine-research/\">actual movie stars</a> – Chris Hemsworth and his brothers Luke and Liam – were among the funders.</p> <p>In Tasmania, where I live, it is hard to overstate the conflicted place the thylacine holds in the local psyche. Within a few decades of colonisation, Europeans had mislabelled it a cat, put a bounty on its head based on lies <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbressan/2017/09/07/remembering-today-the-last-thylacine-species-hunted-into-extinction/?sh=39c38b927a50\">about how many sheep it killed</a>, and hunted it to the edge of extinction. When the last animal died, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/20/from-pest-to-quest-how-the-tasmanian-tiger-captured-the-imagination\">it was initially ignored</a>.

It wasn’t a dog either, though it looked a bit like one. It was Australia’s only marsupial apex predator, and its place in the landscape remains unfilled a near century on, unless you count feral cats. The scientists behind the recreation project are right when they say its reintroduction could have a positive impact on the ecosystem. In theory, it could slot right back in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/20/from-pest-to-quest-how-the-tasmanian-tiger-captured-the-imagination\">From pest to quest: how the Tasmanian tiger captured the imagination</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I’m not here to tell you what to think about this project. I’m certainly not here to say whether the plan – to edit stem cells from a living marsupial with similar DNA, probably the mouse-like <a href=\"https://www.bushheritage.org.au/species/dunnarts\">fat-tailed dunnart</a>, and turn the edited cells into a viable thylacine embryo and baby – will work. Smarter people with more expertise than me differ on that. But it is worth considering some of the questions that could lie ahead.</p> <p>A key one: to what extent would the recreated animal actually look and behave like a thylacine? The editing process means minor variations on the original genome are probably inevitable. Pask says they are aiming to make a 99.9% Tasmanian tiger, but it may involve some trial and error.</p> <p>Without experience with others of their kind, would test-tube created thylacines know how to behave like wild thylacines?</p> <p>Some behaviours – hunting, for example – may be hard-wired, and there are examples of human-raised predators being trained before being released into the wild. But nurture has a part to play, and ecologists say it is difficult to know what the absence of a generational imprint would mean, and impossible to predict how a new-model thylacine would interact with its ecosystem.</p> <p>Can a lab-made thylacine have enough genetic diversity to thrive, or would it end up struggling to sustain a viable population?</p> <p>Pask, who five years ago wrote a paper that showed the thylacine was in poor genetic health before it was hunted to death, says addressing diversity is “nothing compared to bringing the whole animal back” and “really sweating the small stuff”, as it could be done by sequencing the genomes of between 80 and 100 specimens. Others, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/can-we-resurrect-the-thylacine-maybe-but-it-wont-help-the-global-extinction-crisis-178425\">such as Prof Corey Bradshaw</a> from Flinders University, are unconvinced.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/20/the-dire-state-of-the-environment-report-is-a-major-challenge-for-labor-and-an-opportunity\">The dire state of the environment report is a major challenge for Labor – and an opportunity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reaction to the project in the scientific community <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/should-we-bring-back-the-thylacine-we-asked-5-experts-188894\">has been mixed</a>, and has included some understandable frustration that money is being spent to resurrect a dead species when hundreds of living threatened species are comparatively ignored.</p> <p>I look at it slightly differently. As Deakin University Prof Euan Ritchie <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/should-we-bring-back-the-thylacine-we-asked-5-experts-188894\">has said</a>, funding for conservation is not a zero sum game, and the support for de-extinction research has not come at the expense of other environmental protection. It is additional.</p> <p>What it has highlighted is how little, in relative terms, we prioritise our existing environment. Ritchie gives an example: the previous federal government announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/21/new-threatened-species-strategy-wont-overcome-australias-appalling-record-campaigners-say\">$10m for 100 priority threatened species</a> as native forests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/20/the-dire-state-of-the-environment-report-is-a-major-challenge-for-labor-and-an-opportunity\">continued to be cleared</a> and billions were spent on subsidies <a href=\"https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/australian-fossil-fuel-subsidies-surge-to-11-6-billion-in-2021-22/#:~:text=Key%20Findings,21%20total%20of%20%2410.3%20billion.\">to expand fossil fuel industries</a>.</p> <p>Pask says he hopes his team’s research proves worthwhile even if they fail to bring back the thylacine. His wish is that the technology developed can be used to preserve the genetic diversity of the growing list of threatened marsupials that could be wiped out. Which, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/19/labor-says-it-wont-put-head-in-the-sand-as-it-releases-shocking-environment-report\">given the challenges faced</a>, is a noble idea.</p> <p>I’m perhaps a little more naive. I hope our leaders make the choices needed so we don’t have to rely on de-extinction projects to give our wildlife a future.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2022/aug/22/another-collingwood-miracle-caps-off-extraordinary-week-in-afl-football","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T17:30:15Z","webTitle":"Another Collingwood miracle caps off extraordinary week of AFL football | Jonathan Horn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/22/another-collingwood-miracle-caps-off-extraordinary-week-in-afl-football","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2022/aug/22/another-collingwood-miracle-caps-off-extraordinary-week-in-afl-football","fields":{"headline":"Another Collingwood miracle caps off extraordinary week of AFL football","trailText":"As Essendon decided Ben Rutten’s fate, diehard fans were already making their way to the MCG","byline":"Jonathan Horn","body":"<p>David Barham, who took over as Essendon president this week, was the producer of the 1996 documentary ‘100 Years of Australian Football’. From Jezza to Jacko, from John Coleman to John Bourke, it showcased the best and worst of the sport. Heading into round 23 – whether it was Essendon refusing to return Ben Rutten’s calls, Kevin Sheedy speaking sideways, or Tom Browne offering $1.05 on Alastair signing with the Bombers – a century of footy’s folly and folderol was crammed into a few days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/21/essendon-sack-afl-head-coach-ben-rutten-after-week-of-bombers-turmoil\">Essendon sack AFL head coach Ben Rutten after week of Bombers turmoil</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By Friday, people who should have known better were floating the idea of James Hird returning as senior coach. A few months ago, dressed for the boardroom, carrying a Sherrin and sporting what appeared to be a straight face, he emerged through a thick wall of smoke at the MCG. It was an astonishing scene. They wouldn’t, would they? It would boggle the mind, but stranger things have happened at Essendon.</p> <p>For North Melbourne, as Peter Ryan wrote in The Age, “it was a victory of process over panic, of decency over desperation.” For years, they ran on the smell of an oily rag. They’ve been kicked to the curb this year. In recent times, there’s been talk of shunting them off to Tasmania, or out of the competition altogether.</p> <p>Clarkson spoke very well on Friday. He spoke of a club that helped steer him on the right path after his brother had been killed. The industry was pitiless, he said. But there were good people involved too, and the occasional moments of grace. His new president, the polar opposite of his old one, runs more than 100 programs supporting kids from non-English speaking backgrounds. The North Melbourne presidency, Dr Sonja Hood says, is her “weird job”. Her sentences are spare. There are no weasel words, no corporate mumbo jumbo. Professional fault-finder Kane Cornes described her as “uninspiring”. But she held her nerve, stared down the industry and got her man.</p> <p>From that point on, the focus was on the mad scramble for double chances and home finals. More than 200 home-and-away games boiled down to a few Sunday afternoon fixtures. But before that, there were the warm-up acts. Melbourne flexed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/20/brisbane-captain-dayne-zorko-apologises-for-sledge-that-left-demon-harrison-petty-in-tears\">Zorko sledged</a> and Brisbane bottled it. In Canberra, Fremantle dozed and then rallied. In Geelong, Dangerfield celebrated his 300<sup>th</sup>, exploded away like a speed skater and shanked his first kick into a construction site. That night, footy bid farewell to the sublime Robbie Gray, and to Michael Hurley, who could barely raise a gallop but managed a goal with his last kick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d33ea7ca6c92c492a45d2e6384aac33afd6529a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d33ea7ca6c92c492a45d2e6384aac33afd6529a2/446_701_4189_2514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Melbourne president, Dr Sonja Hood with incoming coach Alastair Clarkson on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North Melbourne president, Dr Sonja Hood with incoming coach Alastair Clarkson on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrian Traynor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there was Sunday. As Essendon’s meeting of minds dragged on at Tullamarine, diehards were already making their way to the MCG. For his entire presidency, Eddie McGuire would make Churchillian speeches about the hatred between Collingwood and Carlton. He’d get the old legends in for a rev-up. But the fizz had gone out of the rivalry.</p> <p>On Sunday, however, it was visceral. Watching the hordes snake their way through Fitzroy Gardens, it felt like a city emerging from its winter burrow. It felt like a big final. Collingwood were playing for the double chance. Carlton, who’d been in the top eight every week this season, were hanging on for dear life. Most Carlton fans had taken the full seven days to get over the final 90 seconds of the Melbourne game. This was their biggest game in nearly a decade. If Hawthorn could upset the Western Bulldogs in Tasmania, they could all kick back and ponder an elimination final.</p> <p>For several hours, every single person at the MCG seemed to be in deep consultation with their phone. They learnt of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/21/essendon-sack-afl-head-coach-ben-rutten-after-week-of-bombers-turmoil\">Rutten’s sacking</a>. They learnt that Sam Walsh, one of the hardest runners in the game, was a late withdrawal for Carlton. They saw the Hawks, in Jeff Kennett’s last game as President, give the Dogs an almighty fright. But as the Hawks petered out, Carlton’s destiny was in in its own hands. With most of their starting midfield sitting in the stands, much of it rested on Patrick Cripps’s shoulders.</p> <p>It was an oddly subdued and cautious Carlton in the first half. As usual, the Blues were dominating in close, but the Pies were cutting them to ribbons on the outside. Their ability to quadruple their numbers at the contest and move the ball laterally at full pelt had Carlton floundering. The Blues were rushed, wasteful and in danger of being tipped out of the eight.</p> <p>But they sprung to life after the main break. It was David Parkin who coined the term ‘premiership quarter’, and Carlton’s third quarter was one for the ages. They dominated in the air, at the coalface and at the fall of the ball. Adam Cerra played the quarter of his life. Their small forwards were insatiable. Curnow, who’d squandered so many chances in the first half, was suddenly straighter than Fred Nile.</p> <p>Up the road, and under the roof, the Swans were taking care of St Kilda, though not by enough to secure an SCG final. But the football universe – so consumed with Essendon and Clarkson all week – was focused squarely on the MCG. They were so close, the Blues. They could taste it. But this was Collingwood. And this Magpies side simply doesn’t stop. You can’t play safe against them. You can’t chip 9 irons into your forward 50 and hope for the best. You can’t kick 0.6 in your most important quarter of football in 10 years and expect to hang on.</p> <p>Carlton erred in so many ways, and paid a terrible price. Yes, they were stiff. They copped some rotten decisions. They watched Beau McCreery kick a preposterous goal from deep on the 50-metre boundary line. It’s hard to remember many more heartbreaking losses. It’s hard to think of a footballer who deserves to play finals more than Patrick Cripps. But ultimately, after six months in the top eight, they got the staggers, and the Pies swooped. It was cruel, utterly compelling and a fitting end to one of the most extraordinary weeks of football we’ve ever seen.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/21/the-guardian-view-on-earth-friendly-diets-cooking-animals-is-cooking-the-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T17:25:14Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Earth-friendly diets: cooking animals is cooking the planet | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/the-guardian-view-on-earth-friendly-diets-cooking-animals-is-cooking-the-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/21/the-guardian-view-on-earth-friendly-diets-cooking-animals-is-cooking-the-planet","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Earth-friendly diets: cooking animals is cooking the planet","trailText":"<strong>Editorial:</strong> Eating less meat will help, but governments remain indispensable actors in solving the climate crisis","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/the-ministry-for-the-future-interview-kim-stanley-robinson-1101738/\" title=\"\">Ministry for the Future</a> is a sci-fi novel in which the climate crisis is an emergency so dire that it forces humankind to shift course.

Cows die off and beef, now too risky to eat, quickly comes off the menu.</p> <p>Nothing so drastic has been advocated by the UK government’s food tsar, Henry Dimbleby. He sensibly favours public messaging based on persuasion rather than fear. The science is clear: animal-based foods <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/13/meat-greenhouses-gases-food-production-study#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20cows%2C%20pigs,as%20for%20cotton%20or%20rubber.\" title=\"\">account for 57%</a> of agricultural greenhouse gases versus 29% for food from plants. By cooking meat, people are cooking themselves. That explains why Mr Dimbleby is in a hurry. Ministers, he told the Guardian, need to warn the public that they have to stop eating meat to save the planet.</p> <p>Mr Dimbleby <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/16/england-must-reduce-meat-dairy-intake-says-henry-dimbleby\" title=\"\">believes</a> that a 30% meat reduction over 10 years is required for land to be used sustainably in England. Currently, 85% of agricultural land in England is used for pasture for grazing animals such as cows or to grow food that is then fed to livestock. Despite polls conducted for the government showing support for some meat reduction measures – such as setting targets for supermarkets – none were included in the food strategy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/10/worse-than-half-baked-johnsons-food-strategy-fails-to-tackle-cost-or-climate\" title=\"\">white paper</a> released this June. Mr Dimbleby understands that the public won’t be easily moved. Meat-eating is sold as necessary, even though red and processed meats have been <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/diet-and-cancer/does-eating-processed-and-red-meat-cause-cancer\" title=\"\">linked</a> to cancer and heart disease. Early humans mostly ate vegetables. But eating meat was long seen as something to aspire to – and peer pressure makes it harder to change habits.</p> <p>Perhaps the answer is to shame the public into action over its gluttony. To eat within our planetary boundaries – that is, with no net environmental damage – it has been <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972030718X\" title=\"\">estimated</a> that we should consume no more than 98g of red meat, 203g of poultry and 196g of fish a week. However, in high-income countries such as Britain, households are currently consuming double this. Putting one’s needs ahead of others’ is not only unfair but also dangerous for the planet. Thankfully the mood is shifting. The rise in vegetarian and vegan diets reveals a conscious effort to reduce meat intake.</p> <p>Different diets will shift the industry slowly, but may not transform food production systems quickly enough. That will need governments to act – and to treat eating meat like burning coal. <a href=\"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2022/01/11/The-positive-environmental-impacts-are-huge-Researchers-compare-chicken-egg-white-to-precision-fermentation-alternative\" title=\"\">Greener alternatives</a> such as precision fermentation can produce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/lab-grown-food-destroy-farming-save-planet\" title=\"\">animal-free eggs, milk and meat</a>. Bill McKibben, <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/12/17/kim-stanley-robinson-not-science-fiction/\" title=\"\">writing</a> about The Ministry of the Future, noted that in the book it is legislation that creates “a new legal regime that is fair, just, sustainable, and secure” to solve the climate crisis.

This is not a call to end rich-world farming, but rather to end a form of farming that risks costing the planet. Mr Dimbleby deserves to be heard.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/21/liz-cheney-work-against-republicans-who-embrace-trump-election-lie","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T17:08:10Z","webTitle":"Cheney vows to fight other Republicans who embrace Trump’s election lie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/21/liz-cheney-work-against-republicans-who-embrace-trump-election-lie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/21/liz-cheney-work-against-republicans-who-embrace-trump-election-lie","fields":{"headline":"Cheney vows to fight other Republicans who embrace Trump’s election lie","trailText":"Cheney says two Republican US senators – Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley – have both made themselves ‘unfit for future office’","byline":"Ed Pilkington in New York","body":"<p>The former top Republican Liz Cheney, who lost her Wyoming seat in Congress <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/16/wyoming-republican-primary-liz-cheney-donald-trump-harriet-hageman\">last week</a> when she was beaten in a primary by a Donald Trump-endorsed challenger, is threatening to turn her political muscle against other prominent politicians in her party who have embraced the former president’s attack on democracy.</p> <p>In an interview with ABC News aired on Sunday, she said that some of the best-known Republican figures are now within her sights.

McCarthy is a leading candidate to become speaker should the Republicans take back the House of Representatives in November.</p> <p>McCarthy was initially critical of Trump’s role in unleashing the violent storming of the Capitol, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/us/politics/trump-mitch-mcconnell-kevin-mccarthy.html\">privately telling fellow party leaders</a> “I’ve had it with this guy”. But since then he has swung behind Trump’s anti-democratic movement.</p> <p>“My views on Kevin McCarthy are very clear,” Cheney said. “He’s been completely unfaithful to the constitution. … I don’t believe he should be the speaker of the House.”</p> <p>She also accused DeSantis of campaigning for election deniers. “This is something that people have got to have real pause about,” Cheney said.</p> <p>The Wyoming congresswoman is vice-chairperson of the House committee which has been investigating the January 6 Capitol attack. She was also one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the breach of the Capitol compound – eight of whom will not be returning to Congress in January.</p> <p>The fact that those who stood up against Trump’s attempt to subvert American democracy have been almost universally forced from the party was revealing, she said, adding: “It says people continue to believe the lie, they continue to believe what [Trump] is saying, which is very dangerous.”</p> <p>She continued: “It also tells you that large portions of our party, including the leadership of our party both at a state level in Wyoming as well as a national level with the RNC [Republican National Committee], is very sick.”</p> <p>Cheney would not specify whether or not she would run for the presidency in two years’ time.

Fringe veteran and sometime Ricky Gervais collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/12/anna-mann-cheese-sex-and-self-isolation-party-nextup?CMP=gu_com\">Colin Hoult</a> has been performing as the indiscreet thespian Anna Mann (“I was in the same hand gestures class as Helen Mirren”) for years. But now Anna is taking her final bow. A terminal doctor’s diagnosis is hinted at, which is all the prompt she needs to re-tread for us her life’s journey: the escape from Nottingham, the whiff of the greasepaint, the many marriages. But the real story of Anna’s swan song starts leaking out, through the loose stitching that holds this lovable but vague character together.</p> <p>What emerges is a show with a surprising emotional underpinning, a show that – while on a superficial level is as silly as can be – treats Anna’s death, and that of her ever-so-humble sister Jane, with a degree more seriousness than you’d expect. That this doesn’t overbalance the comedy is testament to the levity elsewhere, as this gushing theatrical dame hymns her career peaks (Predator the Musical; the video nasty Cannibal Bagpipers), winces at her relationship troughs (finding her action-hero husband in bed with her best friend) and interacts camply with the crowd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7adbc362f8ad25c13f7a2950cfc6ab4b11bc752e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7adbc362f8ad25c13f7a2950cfc6ab4b11bc752e/0_312_5885_3532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Hoult: The Death of Anna Mann.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A degree more seriousness than expected … Colin Hoult.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kat Gollock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chief pleasure is the persuasiveness of Hoult’s creation. The luvvie cadences are pitch-perfect, Anna’s self-dramatising consistently amuses, and her past is populated by a winningly ridiculous array of husbands, sexual encounters and stage credits. All this is achieved without remotely pretending that Anna isn’t made up – just a bloke in a dress whose biographical details might as well have been written in the wind.</p> <p>Perhaps that’s because, rather than meticulous characterisation, the point of Anna Mann may have been to let Hoult be who he wanted to be on stage – a usefulness she has now outlived. As these ideas emerge, after a touching reverie that finds Anna embarking on her heavenly journey, the show makes a late and fairly cursory application to the pantheon of fringe comedies about mental health. It’s barely that – but it is an elegiac send-off for this fringe staple, and a new start, too, for the man behind the not-very-concealing mask.</p> <ul> <li><p>Colin Hoult is at <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/colin-hoult-the-death-of-anna-mann\">Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 28 August.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2022\">All our Edinburgh festival reviews</a>.</p></li> </ul>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/21/thomas-tuchel-edouard-mendy-chelsea-leeds-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T16:58:41Z","webTitle":"‘It is a huge mistake’: Tuchel rues Mendy error in Chelsea’s heavy defeat at Leeds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/thomas-tuchel-edouard-mendy-chelsea-leeds-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/21/thomas-tuchel-edouard-mendy-chelsea-leeds-premier-league","fields":{"headline":"‘It is a huge mistake’: Tuchel rues Mendy error in Chelsea’s heavy defeat at Leeds","trailText":"The Chelsea manager criticised how his defence conceded a second from a free-kick as in the 3-0 defeat at Elland Road","byline":"Jamie Jackson at Elland Road","body":"<p>An unhappy Thomas Tuchel branded Édouard Mendy’s error that allowed Leeds’s opening goal as “huge” and criticised the way his defence conceded a second from a free‑kick as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/leeds-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea were beaten 3-0 at Elland Road</a>.</p> \n<p>Leeds’s first win in this fixture in 20 years was precipitated by Mendy’s decision not to clear a backpass.

Starting salaries for reporters on Reach’s national newspapers are about £22,000 – well below the median average British salary for jobs that often require extensive training and experience. Regional newspaper journalists can earn under £20,000, with many now facing increased energy bills due to a permanent shift to home working. One issue facing striking staff on Reach’s local newspapers is that it is unclear how they can picket their workplace, given that Reach has closed most of its local newspaper offices.</p> <p>Matt Capon, an organiser for the Mirror branch of the NUJ, said: “Our members are focused and clear on what they want – a dialogue with the company to make them understand that the cost of living is an issue that affects everyone, including journalists.”</p> <p>Reach – formerly known as Trinity Mirror – is one of the biggest employers of journalists in the UK. In recent years it has bought up dozens of newspapers including the Daily Express and Daily Star in addition to launching new local web-only sites under the “Live” branding.</p> <p>In an attempt to limit the extent of the action, bosses have written to staff reminding them that anyone who strikes will give up their right to take part in an annual share bonus scheme. Staff have also been asked to contact the company if they feel pressured into striking.</p> <p>Journalists at the Mirror are particularly aggrieved by the juxtaposition between the outlet’s stated leftwing political beliefs and its treatment of employees. The newspaper has repeatedly criticised the fat-cat pay of executives and inequality in society.</p> <p>There is a still chance that talks on pay could resume, amid speculation that Reach will make a last-minute financial offer in a bid to win over staff. Some Mirror journalists represented by the rival British Association of Journalists union have already voted to accept the 3% pay deal in the belief the company will not go any higher.</p> <p>Despite its rightwing political stances in recent decades, staff at the Express have a strong history of union activity. The NUJ general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, worked for the Express before becoming a full-time union official. Even the newspaper’s bosses do not necessarily come from a rightwing tradition; the Daily Express’s editor, Gary Jones, is a lifelong Labour voter.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/21/singapore-to-repeal-law-that-criminalises-sex-between-men","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T16:23:47Z","webTitle":"Singapore to repeal law that criminalises sex between men","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/singapore-to-repeal-law-that-criminalises-sex-between-men","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/21/singapore-to-repeal-law-that-criminalises-sex-between-men","fields":{"headline":"Singapore to repeal law that criminalises sex between men","trailText":"Scrapping of colonial-era section 377A law hailed as ‘a win for humanity’ by LGBTQ+ rights groups","byline":"Rebecca Ratcliffe South-east Asia correspondent","body":"<p>Singapore will repeal a colonial-era law that criminalises sex between men, a landmark decision described by LGBTQ+ groups as “a win for humanity”.</p> <p>In a national address on Sunday, the prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said that scrapping section 377A of the penal code would bring the law into line with current social attitudes and “provide some relief to gay Singaporeans”.</p> <p>However, Lee added that the government did not want “wholesale changes in our society”, including changes to the legal definition of marriage.</p> <p>“Even as we repeal 377A, we will uphold and safeguard the institution of marriage.

The counter-example is one that was well known to our medieval ancestors: floodplain hay meadows. Because of their traditional management – haymaking and grazing the aftermath – these wildflower meadows are now hotspots of botanic diversity, and their deep-rooted perennial plants capture and store carbon in their soils more securely than forests, which are prone to disease and fire.</p> <p>The cattle and sheep reared on these meadows are effectively carbon neutral, because the meadows provide sufficient food – and without the inputs of fertiliser, pesticides or herbicides used in most arable farming. In addition, the meadow soils are highly porous and so they buffer floods, capture silt and filter pollutants from floodwater entering rivers and aquifers.</p> <p>Unfortunately, in the last 100 years we have destroyed most of these ancient meadows – only 4 sq miles remain in the UK.

Alongside intermittent fasting, I eat just two small meals a day with a low carbohydrate content, which has slowed my weight gain, without stopping it. Severe hypothyroidism; limited mobility as a result of other medical conditions; a genetic predisposition to hyperinsulinemia, which promotes fat deposition; a mitochondrial disorder that prevents my body from effectively using energy reserves; weight gain following menopause – all these are problems that I am trying to address myself, with help from a private doctor when I can afford it.</p> <p>NHS exhortations to cut calories and move about more are simplistic, and worse than useless for someone like me.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>• We live in a world in which it is increasingly difficult to communicate inconvenient truths.

It is a show about a cult that envelops a rising pop star.

And, over the past three days, starting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/19/duel-in-the-pool-begins-with-bondi-beach-battle\">an open-water relay</a> at Bondi beach, followed by two nights at the Aquatics Centre at Sydney Olympic Park, the Australian Dolphins threw everything at their US counterparts.</p> <p>Specialist ocean swimmers for the Bondi relay, an all-star lineup in the pool, smart tactics, mind games and more. They came for the king, and they came close – the closest Australia has come across four editions of the Duel in the Pool. But at the end of the night on Sunday, the US remained the dominant nation in international swimming, continuing an unbeaten sequence with a 26-point overall victory, 309-283.</p> <p>“We thought we had the opportunity today, but they were too good at the end of the day,” said the Dolphins head coach, Rohan Taylor. “They know how to race and they probably do the strategy a little bit better. But we’re going to learn.”</p> <p>Taylor suggested that after a 15-year absence from the calendar, Australia v US would be back with more regular frequency. “Back to the drawing board,” he said.</p> <p>The Australians entered the third and final day of competition trailing the US by 13 points, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/20/australia-keep-pace-with-united-states-amid-wacky-races-at-duel-in-the-pool\">after an 11-point deficit overnight</a> was extended following a points recalculation. The Dolphins quickly ate into the American advantage, winning the opening event – a 6x50m freestyle relay involving three swimmers from each nation, with each swimmer was required to swim two non-consecutive legs.</p> <p>The American lead see-sawed throughout the night, as both nations demonstrated their dominance in different disciplines. Twice Australia finished first and second in “skins” events – where a field of six was slimmed to four, and then two, over successive races.</p> <p>In the women’s 50m freestyle, the Australian stars Shayna Jack and Madi Wilson won through to the last race – purposefully swimming a slow, recovery lap with maximum points for Australia already in the bag. “We were trying to tie,” Wilson laughed afterwards, having been beaten to the wall by Jack by less than a 10th of a second.</p> <p>It was more of the same in the women’s 50m backstroke skins, with Kaylee McKeown and Mollie O’Callaghan sharing the plaudits in a one-two finish. The placings also foreshadowed what could become an intriguing intra-team rivalry in the years ahead, as the 18-year-old O’Callaghan, better known for her freestyle, continues to improve in the backstroke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa4cc147c25e3a621217cb88e5df73296d39193c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa4cc147c25e3a621217cb88e5df73296d39193c/0_63_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shayna Jack and Madi Wilson react after competing in the 50m freestyle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shayna Jack and Madi Wilson react after competing in the 50m freestyle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Ng/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But despite these star turns, the Americans showed their breadth and depth to maintain a double-digit lead for much of the second half of the evening. Midway through the US won a thrilling men’s 4x100m freestyle relay, and claimed double points having deployed a power play. North Carolina’s Justin Ress won the 100m backstroke, while the US went one-two in the men’s 50m freestyle.</p> <p>Even a late charge from the Australians was insufficient to reel in the Americans. The rising Australian para-swimming star Will Martin won a staggered 100m start race that saw the field compete across different classes and different strokes. McKeown then won the penultimate contest of the meet, a 200m mystery individual medley (with the swimmers given their own random stroke-order just before the race). The 21-year-old held on despite her stroke-order ending with breaststroke, the slowest stroke. But the format was enough to confuse her compatriot Mikayla Smith, who was disqualified after swimming in the wrong stroke-order.</p> <p>The Australians won the last race of the night, a mixed freestyle relay where the US raced 2x200, with a head start, while the Australians raced 4x100. O’Callaghan caught the US prodigy Bella Sims in the final lap. The unusual format continued the weird, wacky and wonderful that defined this edition of the Duel.</p> <p>The final night was a swansong for Ellie Cole, Australia’s most decorated female Paralympian, who hangs up her goggles having collected 17 medals (including six gold) across four Games. Cole made history as she competed in the first integrated relay in international swimming, with the 4x50m freestyle relay on Sunday including both non-disabled and para swimmers. Despite teaming up with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/01/emma-mckeon-becomes-most-successful-commonwealth-games-athlete-with-11th-gold-medal\">Australia’s most-successful Olympian, Emma McKeon</a>, plus Martin and Grayson Bell, the Dolphins were beaten by a fast-finishing American relay team.</p> <p>“It was the perfect way to finish off a career,” Cole said. “To swim here, as my last swim as an Australian Dolphin, with a mixed able-bod, para relay, it is something I never dreamed would ever happen. Well, I always hoped it would, but never thought it actually would. To have Duel in the Pool in a format where we were able to showcase our para swimmers alongside our Olympic swimmers was really cool.”</p> <p>Cole was given a standing ovation from the crowd as she was paraded around the pool deck on the shoulders of teammates. Sunday was also the final competitive swim meeting for the retiring para-swimmer Matt Levy, who has won three gold medals across five Paralympic Games for Australia.</p> <p>The Duel in the Pool concludes a busy 2022 campaign for the Dolphins, after the team starred on the international stage at the world championships in Budapest and Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. A select few national team swimmers will back up at the Australian shortcourse championships in Sydney, from Wednesday, which serves as the qualification event for the shortcourse world championships to be held in Melbourne in December. Shortcourse events take place in a 25m pool, compared with the typical 50m pool.</p> <p>For the rest of the team, a long overdue holiday beckons – indeed, some stars are already on European beaches, having opted out of the Duel. After a well-deserved break, focus will turn towards the road to the Paris 2024 Olympics. At the world championships next year, and again in Paris, the Australians will come at the king. For now, at least, the US remains the world’s best swimming nation. But how long until the Australians don’t miss?</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/21/jacob-rees-mogg-backs-liz-truss-claim-uk-workers-need-more-graft","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T15:51:42Z","webTitle":"Jacob Rees-Mogg backs Liz Truss’s claim UK workers need ‘more graft’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/21/jacob-rees-mogg-backs-liz-truss-claim-uk-workers-need-more-graft","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/21/jacob-rees-mogg-backs-liz-truss-claim-uk-workers-need-more-graft","fields":{"headline":"Jacob Rees-Mogg backs Liz Truss’s claim UK workers need ‘more graft’","trailText":"Brexit opportunities minister says Tory leadership hopeful’s comments reflect Britain’s ‘poor productivity’","byline":"Rowena Mason Deputy political editor","body":"<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg, a key ally of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liz-truss\"> Liz Truss</a>, has defended the Tory leadership frontrunner’s suggestion that British workers need “more graft” as “sensible”.</p> <p>Rees-Mogg, the Brexit opportunities minister, told the Mail on Sunday that her comments reflected “poor productivity in the British economy”.</p> <p>He said they “attracted confected political criticism but they reflect an unfortunate reality in much of the British state”, adding: “This is not good for the government, or for the public as a whole.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacob-rees-mogg\">Rees-Mogg </a>has been tipped for a cabinet position in a Truss government – perhaps as levelling up or trade secretary.</p> <p>Truss’s remarks from her time as a Treasury minister in 2017-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/16/leaked-audio-reveals-liz-truss-said-british-workers-needed-more-graft\">were leaked to the Guardian last week</a>.

Audiences were always on Liz’s side thanks to Tewson’s mastery of when to give and take focus, and she balanced perfectly with Routledge’s tour-de-force performance, helping to ensure that the laughs came in all the right places. “Sometimes you have to dictate to the audience when not to laugh or they’ll run away with you,” she observed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d60981a26c49b9e9e254b89eb875b8083b23941d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d60981a26c49b9e9e254b89eb875b8083b23941d/0_91_2945_1768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Josephine Tewson, left, with Ronnie Corbett, centre, and Ronnie Barker in Frost on Sunday, 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josephine Tewson, left, with Ronnie Corbett, centre, and Ronnie Barker in Frost on Sunday, 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tewson was born in Hampstead, north London, the only child of Kate (nee Morley), a nurse, and William Tewson, who played double bass for the restaurants in Joe Lyons’ corner houses and the BBC Symphony Orchestra. After a grammar school education she was all set to study English at Durham University when her teacher intervened and told her parents that she was well equipped for a life on the stage. Somewhat shy, she gained confidence when assuming characters, and so flourished when she enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating in 1952.</p> <p>She went straight into rep and at Darlington was singled out by the Stage as “a young actress of great charm and promise”: stints at Cleethorpes, Mansfield and Morecambe followed.</p> <p>While playing the principal boy in pantomime at Salisbury in 1957, she and fellow cast member Leonard Rossiter were picked to appear in the musical Free As Air at the Salisbury Playhouse, which toured and transferred to the Savoy theatre and so became her London debut.

Leeds and Chelsea arrive at the third weekend of the season unbeaten on four points. The two clubs have seen big changes over the summer; Jesse Marsch enjoyed finally being able to put his imprint on the squad he inherited from Marcelo Bielsa. They play to the American’s style and look reinvigorated after the Argentinian’s spell put them in trouble last season and only a final-day win ensured survival.</p> <p>Leeds last beat Chelsea in the Premier League way back in 2002 but there is a new-found optimism around Elland Road. The place was bouncing after they downed Wolves on the opening day and they will be eager to see their team test themselves against a supposed title-challenger, especially after they lost all 12 meetings with the top six last season.</p> <p>Chelsea were pegged back by Spurs last weekend and the match ended with some argy-bargy between the two managers. Thomas Tuchel showed he is up for the fight and a summer spending spree, which is set to continue, is getting all the fans pretty ruddy giddy. Following the slip up against Spurs, Tuchel will be eager to get back on track against a team still finding their feet.</p> <p><em><strong>Kick-off: 2pm</strong></em></p> </div>   </div>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/21/leeds-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T15:21:17Z","webTitle":"Leeds demolish Chelsea after Édouard Mendy howler sparks emphatic win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/leeds-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/21/leeds-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Leeds demolish Chelsea after Édouard Mendy howler sparks emphatic win","trailText":"Leeds took a 3-0 lead through Brenden Aaronson, Rodrigo and Jack Harrison before Kalidou Koulibaly’s red card completed a miserable afternoon for Chelsea","byline":"Jamie Jackson at Elland Road","body":"<p>There was sound from the raucous Leeds congregation and a relentless fury to their side’s play.

What followed was a final-day survival act and time for Marsch to implement his ideas across a full pre-season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/aug/21/leeds-united-chelsea-premier-league-live\">Leeds United v Chelsea: Premier League – live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Seven points thus far and this invigorating dismantling of Chelsea are the fruits. “I could sense before the game that there was no fear,” Marsch said. “Last year every game there was fear. It means we can go out and perform better.”</p> \n<p>Thomas Tuchel was out-thought by an opposite number taking charge of only his 15th game in English football. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/aug/14/engrossing-spectacle-ends-with-tuchels-and-contes-handshake-war\" title=\"\">the handshake episode with Antonio Conte</a> last week, Tuchel warmly did the honours with Marsch, but the Chelsea coach will have to revive his team before the visit of Leicester on Saturday.</p> \n<p>As with all of those in blue, Raheem Sterling was bright initially then faded. He went close to opening his Chelsea goalscoring account when Conor Gallagher poked the ball down the left. In blazing sunshine, Sterling skipped infield and unloaded at Illan Meslier’s goal: the stadium hushed for a moment before relief surged from the local support as the ball missed to the goalkeeper’s left.</p> \n<p>Sterling was incisive soon again, this time prodding the ball to Mason Mount, who played a no-look pass to Ruben Loftus-Cheek. He should have shot instantly but dawdled and Leeds escaped.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"69689c007c9b4b7300d549c5a9298c2b09da841e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69689c007c9b4b7300d549c5a9298c2b09da841e/0_209_4949_2969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rodrigo (right) hugs Jack Harrison after doubling Leeds’s lead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rodrigo (right) hugs Jack Harrison after doubling Leeds’s lead.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Davies/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Those in white were effervescent throughout. Aaronson, once of Philadelphia Union and RB Salzburg, was a floating playmaker who shone all game, one surge along the right troubling Kalidou Koulibaly enough for him to yank the No 7 down. The Leeds faithful howled, Stuart Attwell waved a yellow card, and in went a free-kick that Chelsea scrambled clear.</p> \n<p>The heat seemed to invigorate the players, who were making this a pageant of action. Sterling beat Meslier but his strike was ruled offside. Almost instantaneously Aaronson again darted at Koulibaly down the right as Leeds swapped possession with a rat-a-tat rhythm.</p> \n<p>Rodrigo went close when he swooped along the left channel and fired across Édouard Mendy. The response was impressive: Kai Havertz, on halfway, nodded to Mount, who bamboozled two defenders before Meslier saved a low effort to his left.</p> \n<p>For a time Chelsea staged an occupation in Leeds territory. Gallagher, Sterling, Marc Cucurella, Thiago Silva and Jorginho engineered a sequence of keep-ball that had their opponents chasing. Leeds’s way out was to nab possession and, via Rasmus Kristensen, ping another pass to Aaronson down the right. This won a corner that led to nothing, but the 21-year-old was the most likely creator for his team.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ae34b1707c858f318b83f1dd712fce572e2e8ec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ae34b1707c858f318b83f1dd712fce572e2e8ec/0_147_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kalidou Koulibaly is sent off by Stuart Attwell with Chelsea 3-0 down\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kalidou Koulibaly is sent off by Stuart Attwell with Chelsea 3-0 down.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A pirouette was followed by a burst into open field and when Aaronson next acted it was decisive. Silva tapped the ball to Mendy, who was about to endure the proverbial nightmare. A Cruyff turn went awry and Aaronson pounced and finished from inches out. The player, Marsch and Leeds’s fans went ballistic.</p> \n<p>Next up was double trouble for Chelsea. From the left Jack Harrison stood up a free-kick and Rodrigo, beating a static Reece James, headed sweetly home. Evidence, perhaps, of why Tuchel wants to add Wesley Fofana, the Leicester defender, to stiffen his rearguard. Against a delirious wall of sound, Tuchel stood sullen-faced. What Mendy was thinking in the wake of the error that presaged this passage could surely be guessed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/thomas-tuchel-edouard-mendy-chelsea-leeds-premier-league\">‘It is a huge mistake,’ Tuchel says of Mendy error in heavy defeat at Leeds</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At the break Leeds were roared off. They deserved it. To the question of whether they could maintain their intensity, the answer was a resounding yes. Daniel James and Rodrigo led the charge by threatening Mendy’s goal when the match resumed. And, if Chelsea attacked, they were squeezed – as Cucurella and Sterling found near the Leeds area.</p> \n<p>Tuchel, disenchanted, replaced his midfield, hooking the ineffective Jorginho and Gallagher for Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech. It changed nothing as an afternoon to remember for Leeds was crowned by Harrison scoring the third. A James chip aimed for Aaronson was turned back by Rodrigo and Harrison couldn’t miss. As the contest neared its end Koulibaly grabbed Joe Gelhardt, on as a substitute. Out came Attwell’s red card and Chelsea’s misery was complete.</p> \n<p>“We all love Leeds,” the fans sang. This was a scintillating, admirable performance, and Marsch’s charges will arrive at Brighton for the next league outing in buoyant mood.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2022/aug/21/west-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T15:15:17Z","webTitle":"Leandro Trossard seals Brighton victory to send West Ham to bottom of table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/21/west-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/aug/21/west-ham-brighton-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Leandro Trossard seals Brighton victory to send West Ham to bottom of table","trailText":"Goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Leandro Trossard fired Brighton to a 2-0 victory at West Ham to send David Moyes’s side bottom of the Premier League","byline":"John Brewin at London Stadium","body":"<p>David Moyes is attempting something unprecedented in West Ham’s history, to deliver a third consecutive top-seven league finish.

Moyes later said picking the German had been a decision he had needed to sleep on: “I don’t think he was ready to start. The last couple of games we hadn’t gone so well so I put in a recognised central defender.”</p> <p>Making one, ill-fated change from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/14/nottingham-forest-west-ham-premierr-league-match-report\" title=\"\">last week’s loss at Nottingham Forest</a>, Moyes had left further new signings in Gianluca Scamacca, Flynn Downes and Maxwel Cornet on the bench. He is not a manager given to sweeping changes, but it might soon be time to start considering them. “We’re having to bed people in,” said Moyes. “And I’m not sure we are ready yet. The season started three weeks ago, we have to be ready, I take responsibility for that.”</p> <p>Moyes’s group of players are bearing the scars of two previous seasons where a small squad was stretched thinly, and he appears not to trust his new recruits. For Potter, a careful, progressive approach is bearing fruit in early season, further adding to his reputation. He had stuck to the same XI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/07/manchester-united-brighton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">that beat Manchester United</a> on the opening weekend and drawn at Newcastle. The loss of Yves Bissouma and Marc Cucurella has so far proved no impediment to progress. “We have had to deal with key players leaving us,” Potter said. “We are humble and respectful of our opponents but we also have ambition.”</p> <p>With days left of the transfer window, Brighton still lack a prolific striker but, in Danny Welbeck, they have a player expert in leading the line. The former England man showed off his key attributes of pace and positioning in winning the penalty, surging past Kehrer after Kurt Zouma’s charge forward, and loss of the ball, had left his new partner exposed. “He made the wrong decision to go to ground,” said Moyes of Kehrer. “If he had stayed on his feet he would have seen it out.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"69c1c2231bfa05be8c8e0db6a95b202e5a95708f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69c1c2231bfa05be8c8e0db6a95b202e5a95708f/0_100_3511_2108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Mac Allister celebrates opening the scoring in Brighton’s victory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Mac Allister celebrates opening the scoring in Brighton’s victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trossard’s acute, angled pass sent Welbeck away and though there was a VAR delay to confirm Kehrer had tripped Welbeck in the area for a delayed fall, there was nothing controversial in the decision by Anthony Taylor, the referee. Mac Allister, from a short run-up, sent Lukasz Fabianski the wrong way.</p> <p>Brighton looked far likelier to score as the first half went on, with Moisés Caicedo having the better of the midfield battle with opposite number Declan Rice. The visitors were unhurried, comfortable in possession. Loud half-time boos were predictable and West Ham did begin the second period with far greater urgency. Jarrod Bowen on the right flank was their most reliable outlet, setting up a Rice shot, deflected wide. From the corner, Aaron Cresswell, the crowd expectant as the ball dropped, could only clatter the ball into Joël Veltman.</p> <p>At last, Pablo Fornals and Saïd Benrahma saw more of the ball, and Robert Sánchez in Brighton’s goal was asked to save a skidding drive from Fornals, the Spaniard’s last action before he was withdrawn in the 62nd minute for Scamacca. The Italian, who Moyes pointed out had played no football in pre-season, then failed to add anything to West Ham’s attack.</p> <p>By contrast, within seconds of the arrival of the Ecuadorian debutant, Pervis Estupiñán, in place of Adam Lallana, Brighton doubled their lead with a level of incision way beyond West Ham.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe id=\"the-fiver\" name=\"the-fiver\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-fiver\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-fiver\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mac Allister strode forward, and Pascal Gross, falling as he did so, flicked Trossard through on goal.

A 17-year-old man was also attacked and remains in hospital with serious injuries.</p> <p>Police have launched a murder inquiry into the incident, which occurred just hours after the world heavyweight boxing match between Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk.</p> <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and remains in custody. A short while later, a 20-year-old man was also arrested and he too remains in custody. Police have appealed for anyone with information to come forward – including those with phone footage from the night.</p> <p>In a post on social media on Sunday morning, heavyweight champion Fury wrote: “My cousin was murdered last night, stabbed in the neck. This is becoming ridiculous idiots carry knives. This needs to stop ASAP. </p> <p>“UK government needs to bring higher sentencing for knife crime, it’s a pandemic and you don’t know how bad it is until it’s one of your own!”</p> <p>He added: “Life is very precious and it can be taken away very quick enjoy every moment. RIP RICO BURTON. May the lord god grant you a good place in heaven. See you soon.”</p> <p>Fury included an image reading “Stop knife crime” and ended the emotional post with a hashtag saying “only cowards carry weapons”. </p> <p>Incidents of knife crime rose by 10% to 49,027 offences in England and Wales during the year to March 2022, recent statistics show.</p> <p>Fury, 34, grew up in Wythenshawe, Manchester, and is a two-time world heavyweight champion, having held the WBC title since defeating Deontay Wilder in 2020, and having held the Ring magazine title from 2020 to August 2022. </p> <p>A Greater Manchester police spokesperson praised people who had given first aid at the scene and confirmed Burton had died in hospital and a 17-year-old boy remains in a “serious but not life-threatening condition”.</p> <p>Asked if the perpetrators were known to the victims, he said he could not confirm that at this stage.</p> <p>On whether they are looking for more suspects, he said: “There are a number of people we need to identify and that’s again why I stress that anyone who was out with these groups come forward.”</p> <p>He added that it is “imperative” for police to “identify” and “eliminate” people from the investigation.</p> <p>“Everything suggests at this stage that [Burton] was enjoying an evening out with friends, and this has taken place spontaneously and unplanned – it’s a very tragic ending to what should have been a good night out with friends,” he said.</p> <p>Asked about Fury’s post, he said: “I am aware of the media circulation. I can’t confirm whether there is a connection with the family.”</p> <p>He added: “It remains a number one priority of ours to remove knives from the street and try to tackle these kinds of incidents.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/21/marie-antoinette-candelabras-paris-hotel-lambert-auction","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T15:01:39Z","webTitle":"Paris mansion’s contents at auction in house clearance par excellence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/marie-antoinette-candelabras-paris-hotel-lambert-auction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/21/marie-antoinette-candelabras-paris-hotel-lambert-auction","fields":{"headline":"Paris mansion’s contents at auction in house clearance par excellence","trailText":"Hôtel Lambert auction includes a silver tureen given by Catherine the Great and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor’s sofa","byline":"Kim Willsher in Paris","body":"<p>It has been described as the “sale of the century”, an auction of more than 1,300 pieces of 17th to 20th-century furniture, art, jewels and interior decoration from one of Paris’s grandest mansions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab9dc0af6332aa493bd22fbe56a26e22f8ed0361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab9dc0af6332aa493bd22fbe56a26e22f8ed0361/0_0_5792_8688/667.jpg\" alt=\"The lavish interior of the Hotel Lambert, by interior designer Alberto Pinto, who in many rooms followed in the sumptuous style originally envisaged and conceived by Renzo Mongiardino\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lavish interior of the Hôtel Lambert, by interior designer Alberto Pinto, who in many rooms followed in the sumptuous style originally envisaged and conceived by Renzo Mongiardino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby’s</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The provenance of items reads like a scroll through the history of European aristocracy: a sofa belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor;

Examples of comments care workers made to inspectors include “staffing is a disaster” and “because of how intense it’s been and lack of support, staff just don’t want to do it any more”.</p> <p>The average pay in independent care homes in England is £9.01, according to <a href=\"https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/adult-social-care-workforce-data/Workforce-intelligence/publications/Topics/Pay-rates.aspx#:~:text=Key%20findings,6.2%25%20in%20nominal%20terms).\">the latest available analysis for 2020/21</a>.

Another person went missing and was only found after a member of the public escorted them to a police station.</p></li> <li><p>At Osbourne Court care home in Hertfordshire, staff had so little time, they used wet wipes to clean one resident and only showered and washed their hair once a week.</p></li> <li><p>Residents were left in soiled incontinence pads overnight at the Hollies in Westcliff-on-Sea.</p></li> </ul> <p>Workers have been walking out to take less stressful, better-paid jobs in supermarkets, hospitality, hairdressing and factory work, care managers report. Low pay worsened by high inflation and burnout are among the most common reasons given for quitting.</p> <p>Last week, it was reported that the health secretary, Steve Barclay, would try to recruit overseas workers in care homes amid concerns about staff shortages this winter.</p> <p>“Inadequate” care homes remain a small minority – just 241 homes out of 14,597 registered with the CQC – but a further 2,441 “require improvement”.</p> <p>Analysis of dozens of inspection reports shows activities being cancelled, residents being left in their rooms for hours, going without water, and waiting “bursting” for up to 30 minutes to be taken to the toilet. In one home, staff refused a resident’s request to be helped out of her chair because they were too busy.</p> <p>“We haven’t got time for the residents,” admitted one care worker.</p> <p>At one home the lack of staff meant a resident wasn’t helped out of bed until 3pm and several others after 12 noon, while at another, the night shift workers started to wake people at 4.45am “to help the day staff”.</p> <p>In a home with five staff to look after 25 people, a worker told the CQC: “You haven’t got time to finish supporting one person before the other and you have the buzzers going on. You’re rushing them, it’s dangerous, and it’s not fair at all.”</p> <p>Families said the staffing shortages had reached “crisis point”.</p> <p>“Older people are paying a heavy price for these failings, as poor care robs them of their dignity, breaks their will and makes them feel unsafe in their own home,” said Helen Wildbore, director of the Relatives and Residents Association. “Older people need much more than empty slogans from the next prime minister about ‘fixing social care’.”</p> <p>Last year’s announcement of social care reforms focusing on capping costs for service users have been criticised for failing to address the staffing shortage or increasing pay. In July, 88% of <a href=\"https://www.nhsconfed.org/publications/system-cliff-edge-addressing-challenges-social-care-capacity\">NHS leaders polled</a> said a lack of adequate capacity in social care was having a significant or very significant impact on emergency department pressures.</p> <p>A separate snapshot survey of 45 independent care homes that have lost staff, conducted by the National Care Association (NCA) for the Guardian, found that over half of homes had had to reduce the amount of time staff spend talking to residents and cut back on entertainment and trips out of the home. Despite rising demand because of an ageing population, several managers said more than a quarter of their beds were unused because they lacked the staff to support them.</p> <p>July’s announcement of a £1,400 pay rise for many NHS nurses has seen more care workers consider switching, said Karolina Gerlich, chief executive of the Care Workers Charity, who is calling for all care workers to be paid at least £9.90 an hour and £11.05 in London.</p> <p>“The quality of care suffers not because the people that stay aren’t working hard enough, but because there is only so much one person can do,” Gerlich said. “Unless we have parity of pay and conditions [with the NHS], this crisis will continue.”</p> <p>“We can’t compete with retail, where pay is more appealing, especially as the cost of living begins to bite,” said Nadra Ahmed, executive chairman of the NCA, which represents independent care home operators. “Small and medium-sized providers struggle as many are reliant on local authority funding, which remains woefully inadequate. In hospitals, the beds are based on funding of around £2,000 a week, but in a care setting, the same person warrants around £650 or less.”</p> <p>Vanessa Meggs, registered manager at the Hollies, strongly denied that staff shortages were preventing adequate care. She said her residents who had learning difficulties and schizophrenia wouldn’t allow incontinence pads to be changed at night.</p> <p>Jamie Warnock, the registered manager of Cedar Lodge, declined to comment.</p> <p>Four Seasons Health Care, which runs Osbourne Court, said: “Following the pandemic, the sector has struggled to recruit across the country, and we continue to invest in hiring and developing talent in our homes. Since the inspection in March, we have reviewed our staffing management systems and installed an experienced senior manager to oversee the home, working closely with the CQC and the local authority to demonstrate that staff receive training, support and leadership.</p> <p>“We always maintain safe staffing levels and continue to recruit new team members into the home. The care and support of our residents and colleagues remain our first priority.”</p> <p><em>Data research: Karl Martinsson</em></p> <p>• This article was amended on 22 August 2022. Osbourne Court care home is in Hertfordshire, not Herefordshire as an earlier version said. And, to clarify: £9.01 is the average pay in independent care homes in England, according to the latest available analysis for 2020/21, rather than the “current average pay”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/21/we-are-monchichi-review-the-studio-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T15:00:11Z","webTitle":"We Are Monchichi review – culture-clash dance duet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/21/we-are-monchichi-review-the-studio-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/21/we-are-monchichi-review-the-studio-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"We Are Monchichi review – culture-clash dance duet","trailText":"Shihya Peng and Marco di Nardo bicker ceaselessly through movement in a child-friendly exploration of cultural misunderstanding","byline":"David Jays","body":"<p>Will these two dancers find any common ground? She’s slight and tentative, he’s buff, inked and smiley. They step forward to introduce themselves in the soft strawberry light but things soon become fractious. Part of the Edinburgh international festival’s “refuge” strand, celebrating artists’ trans-global journeys, We Are Monchichi is a sweet, if repetitive and sometimes thin, piece about reaching an understanding.</p> <p>Designed for young audiences, the show admirably doesn’t condescend to them. Choreographers Honji Wang and Sébastien Ramirez build on the cast’s own stories. Shihya Peng is Taiwanese (not, she insists crossly, Chinese) and now lives in Paris; Marco di Nardo is Neapolitan (not, he insists crossly, Italian) and now lives in Berlin.

Like many of the cultural misunderstandings here, it more than skirts racism – there’s a peevish sequence in which the dancers trade needling stereotypes about smothering Italian mamas and pasta (“They stole our noodles,” Peng protests) or dogs on the menu in China.</p> <p>There’s an animated duet in which they happily toss around a ball of light – until Peng abruptly pops it into her mouth and chews. Whenever you feel the pair are moving on, they relapse into squabble, and this ceaseless wrangling becomes a tiring pattern. Only belatedly does their movement mesh.

Jo lives here with her husband, James, and their three children, Bella, Annie and Ronnie. The family moved into the 1970s detached property with their first newborn in 2007. “We were looking for a period house with beautiful original features,” Jo recalls, “but we soon realised that we’d get a lot more for our money if we went with this 70s box instead.”</p> <p>They inherited a disjointed interior that had been heavily influenced by the decorating TV shows of the early 1990s. “There were seahorse stencils everywhere and lots of floral borders – not our taste at all,” says Jo. A few cosmetic updates were made, but the real change came a decade later. “By then, we had three children and were thinking of moving again,” Jo explains. “We put in an offer on a lovely period property in the village, but it fell through. After that, we thought we might as well stay put and extend.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"492dcebe3bf84ba0552c5caaac8c2bb659e6a589\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/492dcebe3bf84ba0552c5caaac8c2bb659e6a589/0_1249_10860_6518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The kitchen, and dining/pool table.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colour therapy: the kitchen, relocated to the back of the house and dining/pool table.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The couple employed a local architect to reconfigure the ground floor, which had a kitchen at the front and a long, narrow living and dining room at the back of the house. “The kitchen was just too small and pokey,” Jo says. “It wasn’t connected to the rest of the living space, so I was constantly having to shout from the kitchen through to the other room, where the kids would be playing or doing their homework.”</p> <p>The couple added a full-width, single-storey extension to the back of the house. “It’s essentially a big, white box,” says Jo. The existing living room now steps down into a large, bright kitchen and dining area with sliding glass doors that connect the space to the garden beyond. The colour-blocked kitchen was constructed from a combination of Ikea cabinets and bespoke laminate-faced plywood made by Plykea – a design company that specialises in modifying Ikea carcasses with bespoke work surfaces and door fronts. The colours were chosen “because we love the beach”. The yellow represents the sun, the blue the sea and the grey the rocks. Jo also chose plywood for the flooring and, in order to save money, decided to sand and oil the sheets herself. “I didn’t realise what a massive expanse it was,” she says. “It nearly killed me, but it was a total labour of love.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f7e70bf4809572bddbf38a59365db3983eecd0f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7e70bf4809572bddbf38a59365db3983eecd0f5/0_1735_11567_6942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teal sofa in the sitting room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teal deal: most of the furniture was found at bargain prices on eBay and Facebook Marketplace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The dining table is now within earshot of the kitchen. When it’s not in use, the top can be removed and it transforms into a pool table. Similarly, the outdoor dining table transforms into a ping-pong table. “It’s a brilliant party house,” says Jo. “We’ve created all these zones, so when we have lots of friends over there is something for everyone. The kids love it and never want to leave.”</p> <p>By the time the extension was complete, the couple had exhausted themselves and their budget. They had planned to turn their former kitchen at the front of the house into a wet room and separate utility room. Instead, the old cabinets and tiles have been given a fresh coat of paint and the room has become a diminutive home gym/laundry/storage space. In the main space, they decided “to whitewash everything and fill the space with colourful accessories”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8bf364013186c220554251cd9645cd47f80f2844\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bf364013186c220554251cd9645cd47f80f2844/0_877_11429_6859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The living room, which opens out to the kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joined up: the living room, which opens out to the kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bright soft furnishings (cerise armchairs, a teal corner sofa, sunny yellow cushions) are paired with retro cabinets and coffee tables, most of which have been found at bargain prices on eBay and Facebook Marketplace. “I’m obsessed with hunting for retro furniture now,” Jo laughs.</p> <p>The family lived happily in the gleaming white space for several years before lockdown struck. “Stuck in the house, I just started painting wherever I could,” recalls Jo. Inspired by interior images found on Instagram and Pinterest, she created three graphic patterns in the living space.

They don’t have the time to talk to the residents, hug them, communicate with them. The care is fragmented.</p> <p>“A lot of agency staff are being used [because rising Covid infections in the community means more permanent staff isolating]. The sense of community they used to have has all but vanished.”</p> <p>Vida Hall, the care home where Michael has lived for more than six years, is far from the worst in the country. In fact, the latest Care Quality Commission (CQC) report ranks it “outstanding”, as perhaps it should be for a facility that costs £1,600 a week.</p> <p>In homes inspected recently by the CQC that it rated as “inadequate”, residents have been left in danger of choking, uncleaned and shut in their rooms. But while Anne says staff attend to her husband’s physical needs, even in such a well-funded environment they have to move on after brief interactions.</p> <p>In the 28 days from mid-June to mid-July, she said he had only been out of his room four times. Michael, her partner for more than 50 years, with whom she used to climb in the Bavarian Alps and Italian Dolomites, has lost the habit of walking and, she said, is now “frightened to walk”.</p> <p>“The staff can’t help him because they don’t have the time,” she said. “They haven’t got enough staff.”</p> <p>James Rycroft, managing director at Vida Healthcare, said the firm was “saddened to hear Anne’s feedback and we are working very closely with her to make sure that the care we’re providing Michael is helping him to stay happy and healthy.”</p> <p>He said the firm had increased pay by 30%, had recruited 120 new staff since January – with more joining soon – and supports staff to give residents “the physical and emotional care they need”.</p> <p>“We also regularly review our staffing ratios for each resident to enable us to go above and beyond their minimum care requirements and meet their unique needs successfully,” he said.</p> <p>At another care home in West Yorkshire, a daughter, who asked not to be named, described how her 93-year old mother’s teeth were not being cleaned because of staff problems. Some are falling out and her false teeth have gone missing.</p> <p>The door from her room to the garden is locked, which exacerbates her claustrophobia, and on several occasions she has lost her emergency buzzer worn around her wrist or neck.</p> <p>“Since Covid, I feel there has been a lack of care and lack of attention to detail,” she said. “It may be they are battle-weary, burned out and exhausted. I can empathise with that. But my mum has a history of falling and if she doesn’t have her call button … As a family, you want assurances that wherever you place your loved one is safe.”</p> <p>Neil Russell, who runs three neurological care homes in Peterborough and Milton Keynes, is short of 30 staff – a problem that started with Brexit, when many workers from the EU left because they felt “unwanted”.</p> <p>“The staffing issue began with Brexit and it got worse with the pandemic,” he said. “It has just tired people out, it has left people exhausted.”</p> <p>A Covid outbreak in June led to 20 staff being placed in isolation at home for a week. “There is no wriggle room and it puts pressure on the existing staff,” Russell said. “They end up working too many shifts.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/21/undercurrent-by-barney-norris-review-a-meditation-on-love-and-loss","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T15:00:11Z","webTitle":"Undercurrent by Barney Norris review – a meditation on love and loss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/21/undercurrent-by-barney-norris-review-a-meditation-on-love-and-loss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/21/undercurrent-by-barney-norris-review-a-meditation-on-love-and-loss","fields":{"headline":"Undercurrent by Barney Norris review – a meditation on love and loss","trailText":"The author and playwright’s latest novel incisively captures the search for meaning in uncertain times","byline":"Lucy Popescu","body":"<p>Like much of Barney Norris’s work (his 2018 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/07/turning-for-home-by-barney-norris-book-review\">Turning for Home</a> </em>and his latest play, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/24/we-started-to-sing-review-barney-norris-arcola-london\">We Started to Sing</a>),</em> <em>Undercurrent</em> deals with beginnings and endings, love and loss, and borrows from his own family’s experience. It opens at a wedding where Ed meets a young woman, Amy, who claims he rescued her from drowning when they were children. Ed feels the pull of something, as does Juliet, his girlfriend of six years. Shortly afterwards, they split up and he begins to see Amy.</p> <p>At first you think this is going to be a novel about thirtysomething relationships, lovers recognising the “secret currents which align our lives”, but then the focus shifts. Norris offers a profound meditation on dealing with loss and finding your moorings in destabilising times. Throughout, he compares the ebb and flow of life to the undercurrents of water.</p> <p>Interwoven with Ed’s narrative are chapters describing his forebears – from his great-grandparents’ meeting in India in 1911 and their relocation to a remote sheep farm in Wales. These snapshots from the past are Ed’s reimagining of “the stories that had shaped and brought us here… drawn through time by deep, irresistible currents”. He asks: “How far does that history reach into us, control us?”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Norris’s prose is pleasingly simple and direct but every so often he raises the bar and delivers a stunningly crafted, perceptive description</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He also recalls his childhood with his mother, alcoholic father and stepfather. His mother wants him to take over the sheep farm. Ed resists, desperate to forge his own path. Eventually, he discovers that “to know that someone cares about whether or not you’re around is the heart of all meaning, the heart of belonging”.</p> <p>For the most part, Norris’s prose is pleasingly simple and direct but every so often he raises the bar and delivers a stunningly crafted, perceptive description that will resonate with many, such as this one: “The loss of a mother was like all the lights going out on the shore, and I was left alone on the waves, turning back in the hope of receiving some encouragement, seeing only the dark instead.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Undercurrent</em> by Barney Norris is published by Doubleday (£16.99).

However, he dismissed the idea that the move would tie the hands of the next prime minister, following reports that the Truss campaign was worried that it was irreversible.</p> <p>“In the next few weeks, we will announce a government investment decision on Sizewell C where the government formally commits to the project’s financing. It allows the project to raise private capital in the markets. But it’s only at the point of the final investment decision in early 2023 that the government would formalise any equity share.”</p> <p>Johnson’s decision over Sizewell was challenged by a campaign to stop the nuclear reactor being built.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the campaign, Stop Sizewell C, said: “Whatever way you look at it, this is a very dodgy decision. Has it been made by a lame duck PM who is not supposed to tie the hands of his successor, or was it in fact made before Sizewell C was granted planning consent, lending serious weight to our conviction that this was a prejudiced, political decision?</p> <p>“Our next prime minister should call Sizewell C in. There are so many better ways to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money than on a project that won’t light a single lightbulb for at least a decade.”</p> <p>Truss has not stated a clear position on Sizewell C, but hinted last year at concerns about the involvement of China’s state-owned energy company, CGN, as part of a consortium providing funding for the preparatory work at the nuclear plant. She told the Telegraph at the time: “I think it’s very important that we don’t become strategically dependent and I think it’s important that we make sure that we’re working, particularly in areas of critical national infrastructure, with reliable partners.”</p> <p>EDF, the French state energy firm, worked with CGN on the first phase of the project for a new nuclear power station to sit alongside Sizewell B, which is operational, and Sizewell A, which is being decommissioned. The UK government is keen to ease CGN out, however, over concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets.</p> <p>Johnson’s government has already put up £100m of funding this year to support the development of Sizewell C.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/21/billionaire-brexiters-energy-giant-ineos-nets-474m-profit-thanks-to-soaring-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T14:34:36Z","webTitle":"Billionaire Brexiter’s energy giant Ineos nets £474m profit thanks to soaring prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/21/billionaire-brexiters-energy-giant-ineos-nets-474m-profit-thanks-to-soaring-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/21/billionaire-brexiters-energy-giant-ineos-nets-474m-profit-thanks-to-soaring-prices","fields":{"headline":"Billionaire Brexiter’s energy giant Ineos nets £474m profit thanks to soaring prices","trailText":"Oil and gas division at Jim Ratcliffe’s company had reported loss of £226m in 2020","byline":"Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent","body":"<p>Billionaire Brexiter Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s petrochemicals company Ineos has made an almost £500m profit thanks to soaring energy prices that are hammering struggling households.</p> <p>Ineos UK E&amp;P Holdings, the oil and gas division of Ratcliffe’s empire, reported a profit of £474m in 2021 compared with a loss of £226m in 2020, <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/SC200459/filing-history\">according to new filings at Companies House</a>.</p> <p>The company said it was benefiting from average gas prices rising by 264% to 91p per therm during the period.

He joined various eccentric avant-garde collectives that sprung up during the last two decades of the Soviet Union, where he was known for his flirtation with the politics of Nazi Germany.</p> \n<p>He came to national attention in the 1990s as a writer for the far-right newspaper Den<em>. </em>In a 1991 manifesto published in Den, Dugin first laid out his anti-liberal and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultranationalist\">ultranationalist</a> vision of Russia, a country he said was destined to face off against an individualistic, materialistic west.</p> \n<p>During the tumultuous years following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Dugin co-founded the National Bolshevik party with the novelist Eduard Limonov, merging fascist and communist-nostalgic rhetoric and symbolism.</p> \n<p>Dugin’s worldview is most clearly articulated in his 1997 publication The Foundations of Geopolitics, which reportedly became a textbook in the Russian general staff academy and solidified his transition from a dissident to a prominent pillar of the conservative establishment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f913f92e-746e-4d2d-aa5a-8d3a43667b50\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dsWYFVvDcQY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the book, Dugin laid out his vision to divide the world, calling for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances while proclaiming his opposition to Ukraine as a sovereign state.</p> \n<p>“Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>“Its certain territorial ambitions represent an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics.”</p> \n<p>Twenty-five years later, Russia’s president repeated some of Dugin’s views on Ukraine in his 4,000-word essay <a href=\"http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66191\">On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians</a>, which many saw as a blueprint for the invasion he launched just six months after it was published.</p> \n<p>However, it was far from certain that Dugin’s radical anti-western thoughts would eventually become mainstream in Moscow when Putin became president in 2000.</p> \n<p>Boosted by high oil prices, the newly elected leader appeared to be overseeing the country’s integration into the global capitalist system while ordinary Russians embraced western fast food and pop culture.</p> \n<p>Dugin’s illiberal totalitarian ideas were deemed irrelevant, and he found himself on the fringes of political power. However, he continued writing and lecturing, further developing the concept of Eurasianism, the Russian-flavoured, fascist political doctrine that sees Moscow as the centre of a rival empire to the Atlanticist west.</p> \n<p>Dugin’s standing changed in 2012 when Putin took power once again following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/04/anti-putin-protests-moscow-russia\">mass anti-government protests</a> and the Russian leader embraced a conservative vision for his country.</p> \n<p>Dugin felt further vindicated when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/putin-confirms-annexation-crimea-ukrainian-soldier-casualty\">Russia annexed Crimea</a> in 2014 and launched a bloody war in the Donbas following the pro-western revolution in Kyiv.</p> \n<p>“I think we should kill, kill, kill [Ukrainians], there can’t be any other talk,” Dugin said in one video address to his followers at the time, making him one of the most hated Russian public figures in Kyiv.</p> \n<p>Despite Dugin’s violent rhetoric, he continued to travel abroad, maintaining close links with thinkers of the European New Right, who also denounced liberalism, feminism and US domination.</p> \n<p>He was also frequently invited to conferences around the world, debating the French philosopher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bhl/status/1175415745477562374\">Bernard-Henri Lévy</a> in Amsterdam as recently as 2019.</p> \n<p>Dugin reportedly travelled without security inside and outside Russia, which some hastily pointed to as one of the possible explanations behind Saturday’s attack, which was reportedly intended to kill him.</p> \n<p>The actual influence of Dugin over Putin’s day-to-day operations has been a longstanding topic of debate, with some Russia experts calling him “Putin’s spiritual guide” and others, mostly those in Moscow, saying he was an irrelevant figure eager to appear close to the Kremlin for personal profit. Dugin <a href=\"https://www.codastory.com/lgbt-crisis/frontiers-of-the-russian-world/\">reportedly</a> asked for as much as €500 (£425) for interviews with western media.</p> \n<p>The two men have never been photographed together, and Dugin has never held an official position within the state.</p> \n<p>“This caricature pseudo-intellectual foist is certainly not part of the decision-making system,” Leonid Volkov, a key ally of the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leonidvolkov/status/1561241783060860928\">wrote</a> hours after the car bombing.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, his brand of Russian nationalism has indisputably become popular among much of Russia’s political elite, and his views helped shape the ideas behind the invasion of Ukraine.</p> \n<p>The killing of Dugin’s daughter Darya, a pro-Kremlin journalist ideologically aligned with her father, will send shock waves through the top echelons of Russian society.</p> \n<p>Footage that circulated across Russia of the burnt-out car will also bring back memories of the turbulent 1990s when car bomb assassinations were routine, a dark feature of a previous era that Putin’s presidency vouched to end.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/aug/21/total-by-rebecca-miller-review-emotionally-complex-stories","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T14:00:10Z","webTitle":"Total by Rebecca Miller review – emotionally complex stories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/21/total-by-rebecca-miller-review-emotionally-complex-stories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/aug/21/total-by-rebecca-miller-review-emotionally-complex-stories","fields":{"headline":"Total by Rebecca Miller review – emotionally complex stories","trailText":"Wit and wisdom are constant delights in the film-maker and writer’s second short story collection, as she expertly picks apart the confusions of intimacy","byline":"Hephzibah Anderson","body":"<p>“What a weird thing reading is,” reflects Joad, the protagonist of <a href=\"https://rebecca-miller.com/\">Rebecca Miller</a>’s short story, I Want You to Know. Joad’s marvelling arises less from a sense of wonderment than menace. She and her partner have left behind their city lives to become blogging smallholders. Upon discovering an old desk in the attic, she takes a “before” photo and sets about stripping it down, inadvertently unlocking a secret drawer in which lie sheets of onionskin paper that tell a terrible tale.</p> <p>“Joad felt as though reading the typed pages had infected her with a virus that she had to carry around now, nasty images downloaded into her head,” Miller writes. Where I Want You to Know really expands on the twisty delight of reading, however, is in its closing pivot, a turn that at once defuses this specific threat and underscores the form’s wonderfully insidious ability to unnerve.</p> <p>I Want You to Know appears in the film-maker and novelist’s new collection, her second, alongside half a dozen similarly expert short works. Each deftly evokes a recognisable social milieu – often privileged, though not always wealthy, east coast America – as well as an array of life stages, from the 14-year-old girl, young for her age, whose body has suddenly become an 18-year-old’s in The Chekhovians, to She Came to Me’s blocked middle-aged author – the book’s lone male protagonist – whose marriage of nearly 20 years has reached the point where his wife lands “faintly accusatory, percussive kisses on his head at breakfast”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Miller’s stories read as though they’ve been written by someone who takes immense pleasure in their creation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Intimacy’s tugs and minor revulsions, its drug-like intensity and unravelling confusions, filter through these pages, and they’re made overt in Vapors. An account of the romantic chaos of heroine Justine’s younger years, it finds Miller noting of one particular relationship: “They fought with the clean, absolute rage of siblings, pulverising their sex life while ballooning their mutual affection to a point where they seemed destined to be together.”</p> <p>Wit and coolly slaying wisdom are constant delights in these emotionally complex stories. Nor is the intimacy that Miller conjures always sexual. The maternal bond recurs, exemplifying both unrivalled connection and chafing confinement. The title story, for instance, may be a lightly dystopian slice of sci-fi, but in recounting what happens when teenage Roxanne misguidedly abducts her sister – one of a small global population of ethereal children badly damaged in utero by their mothers’ exposure to a fiendishly expensive new phone – it becomes a slyly incisive meditation on the mother-daughter dynamic.</p> <p>Most authors, especially the better ones, have a fairly conflicted relationship with their craft, but Miller’s stories read as though they’ve been written by someone who takes immense pleasure in their creation. Line by line, they’re cinematically vivid, and she isn’t afraid to make things happen either. Just take the opening story, Mrs Covet, whose dreamy interiority is interrupted by an alarming event.</p> <p>If some of these characters feel like established literary types, that seems integral to the playfulness and profundity of the narratives in which Miller embeds them, lulling us along in order to accentuate the swerve that lies in wait. What does she want us to know? Perhaps simply that reading should always feel electrifyingly weird.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Total</em> by Rebecca Miller is published by Canongate (£14.99).

Will these ‘authentic’ networks change the way we connect?","byline":"Laurie Clarke","body":"<p>“Instagram, please stop trying to be TikTok.” App users including Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner shared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/31/tiktok-video-instagram-revolt-update-kardashians\">this plea</a> last month when Instagram trialled changes that flooded users’ feeds with short-form videos called “reels” and content uploaded by strangers. They were reacting to Instagram’s attempt to wrest Gen Z eyeballs away from TikTok by mimicking some of the app’s signature features.</p> <p>Early social media platforms such as MySpace and Facebook were built on the quaint notion of “friends”, mirroring your real-life social networks online. But the ruthless dynamics of the attention economy mean that the platforms most popular with young people today, Instagram and TikTok, double as global arenas to launch influencer careers. Content – not connection – is king, and algorithmically optimised virality is the metric that determines what you see.</p> <p>It’s these app design choices that mean the whole world can follow the evolution of a wildly popular makeup trend, or join <a href=\"https://slate.com/podcasts/icymi/2022/01/west-elm-caleb-tiktok-dating-new-york\">a campaign</a> against a 20-year-old furniture designer from Brooklyn who ghosted some girls on Tinder. “TikTok is like my generation’s TV,” says Deborah Mackenzie, 23, from Aberdeen. She and her friends don’t post much themselves; it’s more about browsing other people’s content to pass the time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Users snap whatever they’re doing at the time – no matter how unglamorous – paired with a selfie – no matter how unkempt</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the scale of Instagram and TikTok becomes increasingly impersonal (and, to be fair, the latter has always insisted it’s an entertainment app, rather than social media), a new generation of social media companies including BeReal, Locket Widget, Yubo and Poparazzi have spotted an opportunity to prioritise intimacy over infamy.</p> <p>“What we’re seeing now is Gen Z’s taste shifting towards deeper, more personalised experiences,” says Matt Moss, the founder of Locket, an app that’s about as stripped-back as it’s possible to be: allowing close friends and family to share photos that appear as an enlarged widget on the other person’s home screen. Moss originally built the app to keep in touch with his long-distance girlfriend when he finished university but says a billion photos had been shared on it by the end of July, after it blew up following a viral moment on TikTok at the end of last year.</p> <p>Another app clocking up its fair share of viral moments is <a href=\"https://bereal.com/en\">BeReal</a>, launched in 2019 by the French entrepreneurs Alexis Barreyat and Kévin Perreau. The app prompts users to take a simultaneous front and back camera picture every day at a specific time, within a two-minute window. Users can take it later, too, but can’t see their friends’ content until they’ve posted themselves. This is supposed to ensure that users snap a picture of whatever they’re doing at the time – no matter how unglamorous – paired with a selfie – no matter how unkempt – to promote a way of relating more authentically to friends online.</p> <p>Currently the No 1 social networking app in the Apple App Store in the US, BeReal is growing rapidly. The vast majority of its lifetime 28m downloads <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/bereal-statistics/\">happened this year</a> according to the Business of Apps. Its popularity is radiating out beyond the college students that first jumped on board, thanks, in part, to an ambassador programme and payments for signing up.</p> <p>With TikTok and Instagram both expanding beyond social media’s original remit, Kristin Merrilees, a 20-year-old New Yorker, says BeReal is capturing that unfulfilled urge to connect with friends throughout the day. “I like to see what my friends are up to, especially during the summer where a lot of us are more spread out because we’re not in the same place or in school,” she says.</p> <p>In addition to facilitating meaningful connections with friends, the new wave of social media platforms claim to be solving another issue: the increasing pressure to perform, grow a following, and become an influencer on TikTok and Instagram.</p> <p>Olivia Bamford, 23, from Derbyshire, says she stopped using Instagram because she felt that other people’s content would always be better than her own. Merrilees and Mackenzie say they still use Instagram to share content with friends, but its main purpose is to showcase major events or for photo dumps rounding up the month’s highlights.</p> <p>Instagram justified its recent changes by saying it wants to help its creators reach a wider audience. By contrast, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bereal-your-friends-for-real/id1459645446\">BeReal says</a> it won’t help people become influencers. “It’s not exactly a platform where you can grow a following, but that’s sort of the point,” says Merrilees. Locket goes so far as to limit the number of people you can add: a proposition that would make Instagram break out in a cold sweat.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Clubhouse drew a huge number of users to audio chatrooms at the height of the pandemic before fading into obscurity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, one person’s positive affirmation is another’s self-righteous edict. An inevitable backlash against BeReal’s claims to unvarnished authenticity has swiftly ensued. “The difference between BeReal and the social-media giants isn’t the former’s relationship to truth but the size and scale of its deceptions,” <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/bereal-and-the-fantasy-of-an-authentic-online-life\">wrote RE Hawley in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/bereal-and-the-fantasy-of-an-authentic-online-life\">New Yorker</a></em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/bereal-and-the-fantasy-of-an-authentic-online-life\">.</a></p> <p>What’s more, will thinking small ever lead to big returns? Most of the apps mentioned say they have opted out of the attention economy entirely, saying they will shun ads for alternative business models. This hasn’t stopped major backers piling in. Locket has just raised a $12.5m funding round led by OpenAI’s Sam Altman; BeReal is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bereal-buzzy-gen-z-social-media-app-raise-630m-valuation-2022-5?r=US&amp;IR=T\">reportedly on track</a> to close a funding round that will quadruple its valuation to over $600m.</p> <p>Whether these apps are tracking a zeitgeisty generational shift, or simply tapping into the self-evident truth that people like to share with friends on the internet, is another question. Right now, most aren’t even aiming to replace Instagram and TikTok. “We love Instagram and TikTok [but] they’re not really competition in our space,” says Poparazzi co-founder Alex Ma.</p> <p>This reflects a greater fragmentation in the app market for social media, where users visit different apps for different experiences. “Instagram used to be the app for everything,” says Merrilees, but that’s changed now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/24/people-get-bored-quickly-how-uk-teens-turned-to-social-media-for-their-news\">‘People get bored quickly’: how UK teens turned to social media for their news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s tough to predict whether these new social media apps will survive, let alone herald a sea change across the industry. Social apps like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/clubhouse\">Clubhouse</a> attracted a huge number of users to audio chatrooms at the height of the pandemic before fading swiftly back into obscurity. (Incidentally, Clubhouse is pivoting to “small” too, with the launch of its “Houses” feature for close-knit friendship groups.)</p> <p>Gimmicky features that users find compulsive in the beginning, such as BeReal’s daily nudges to snap a picture, could also be what eventually makes users tire of the app.</p> <p>But whether these apps live on or not, they may be correct about the gap they aim to plug. Mackenzie has resisted downloading BeReal, despite most of her friends using it. “It’s just another thing to keep reminding you to get on your phone,” she says.</p> <p>Even so, she sees the appeal. ​​“It’s kind of a modern-day Facebook or something, where people just post their everyday thoughts and the things they’re doing.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/aug/21/its-all-up-up-up-sweat-tears-and-very-low-gears-cycling-italys-stunning-maratona-dles-dolomites","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T14:00:10Z","webTitle":"‘It’s all up, up, up’: sweat, tears and very low gears while cycling Italy’s stunning Maratona dles Dolomites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/aug/21/its-all-up-up-up-sweat-tears-and-very-low-gears-cycling-italys-stunning-maratona-dles-dolomites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/aug/21/its-all-up-up-up-sweat-tears-and-very-low-gears-cycling-italys-stunning-maratona-dles-dolomites","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s all up, up, up’: sweat, tears and very low gears while cycling Italy’s stunning Maratona dles Dolomites","trailText":"If you can catch your breath, the Maratona in Italy’s Dolomites is the world’s most beautiful bike race, says Martin Love","byline":"Martin Love","body":"<p>Don’t forget to look up,” says Miguel “Big Mig” Indurain, the great Spanish cycling <em>campeón</em>, to the massed ranks of nervously fidgeting riders.

It’s come a long way since the first edition in 1987, when just 166 piston-legged riders took part. Today, the Maratona has evolved into one of the highlights of the Italian cycling calendar. It’s broadcast live for six hours on national TV; numerous former champions take part and some of the sport’s most talented amateurs turn up to fly around the longest of the three routes in about half the time it takes the rest of us mortals to drag ourselves around it. But the magic of the event is the sense of accomplishment that everyone has: whether finishing in four and half hours or 10 and a half hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"75d02c3d5996cbdec69efe57b345f240c0a3bea9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75d02c3d5996cbdec69efe57b345f240c0a3bea9/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vote for Michel: race organiser Michil Costa gets into the spirit of the event.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vote for Michel: race organiser Michil Costa gets into the spirit of the event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Costa Denis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The action gets under way at 6.30am at the bottom of a tree-lined valley outside the town of La Valle. Despite the severity of the challenge that lies ahead, there’s almost a carnival atmosphere among the peloton, with hot-air balloons, low-flying helicopters, a brass band oompah-ing away and the race director, Michil Costa, sitting at the starting gate in traditional lederhosen on a penny-farthing. It’s only actually 5km from here to the finish in nearby Corvara, but the route takes a dramatic 138km, six-town detour instead.</p> <p>If you look at a side profile of the Maratona’s route it looks like the serrated edge of a terrifying knife. There are no flat sections, it’s all up, up, up or down, down, down. The seven epic peaks along the way add up to more than 4,000m of vertical climbing, and the names of the legendary mountain passes that straddle the route almost sound like found poetry: Passo Campolongo; Pordoi; Sella; Gardena; Giau and Valparola. Of these the real monster is the Giau. It’s 10km at a lung-busting average of almost 10%. And after the relentless drag up its flanks, what do we do? Plummet down the other side at rollercoaster speeds of up to 50mph.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c775da291d77b7abbf805fb67e6eb0cdcacf406\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c775da291d77b7abbf805fb67e6eb0cdcacf406/0_40_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peak practice: riders at Passo Gardena, one if the most picturesque of the summits\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peak practice: riders at Passo Gardena, one if the most picturesque of the summits</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the tears, sweat and swearing, there is much camaraderie. Riders of more than 70 nationalities take part and on the back of our jerseys, rather than race numbers, we have our names and a national flag. It makes for a great conversational opener for on-the-course chats – not that we had any spare puff. On one particular climb I tried to distract myself by counting the droplets of sweat as they fell from my chin on to the handlebars of my trusty Pinarello bicycle.</p> <p>The Alta Badians are rightly proud of their mountain home and the Maratona is a showcase for the area, which has a rich heritage of distinctive dress, food and even language – many still speak the local dialect, Ladin.

Big spending decisions are being delayed until his successor as prime minister is in post. However, the result of the Conservative leadership election will not be announced until 5 September.</p> <p>In the meantime, a major increase in the regulated energy price cap, which puts a ceiling on gas and electricity bills, is due to be announced this Friday. It is forecast to rise from just under £2,000, to £3,600 a year for the average household.</p> <p>While the nation waits to hear whether any further help is coming, the Treasury is working on a menu of options. Here we outline the main ideas, and assess the political and economic impact of each one.</p> <h2><strong>Targeted help for the most vulnerable</strong></h2> <p>The most limited option for the Treasury is to direct additional help for households to those on the lowest incomes, many of whom are already in fuel poverty and struggling even before the bill increases come in this winter. More than half of British households, 54%, will be in fuel poverty by October and more still in January.</p> <p>The most targeted way of getting money to the most vulnerable is via increases in universal credit and pension credit. Liz Truss has also promised to reverse the national insurance rise – though many poorer households were not affected by that because the last cost of living intervention by Rishi Sunak as chancellor.</p> <p><strong>Jessica Elgot, chief political correspondent: </strong><em>This is the most likely level of support Truss is prepared to offer, citing the cost of the package from Sunak announced earlier this year and with the need to fund her promised tax cuts. She has called it “Gordon Brown economics” to have a high tax burden and then high amounts of state help. But such a route would mean starting her premiership with tax cuts that benefit the wealthy and some additional aid for the poorest</em><em> </em>–<em> meaning the majority of working people get very little. MPs are worried that is not a sound electoral strategy.</em></p> <p><strong>Richard Partington, economics correspondent: </strong><em>Charities are calling for the existing £1,200 energy support payment for 8 million households on means-tested benefits to be doubled. There is a strong economic case for such targeted support because poor families spend more of their budget on essentials – such as energy and food – than richer households, leaving them the most exposed to the inflation shock. The Resolution Foundation estimates a “cost of living” inflation rate for the poorest of 1.5 percentage points higher than for the richest.</em></p> <h2><strong>Double the fuel discount from £400 to £800</strong></h2> <p>Sunak announced earlier this year that eligible UK households would receive a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/energy-bills-support-scheme-explainer\">£400 discount to help with energy bills from October</a>. Officials have been looking at the potential for people to receive additional support, perhaps up to £800, because forecasts for price rises are now considerably higher.</p> <p>The discount is easier to administer but somewhat of a blunt instrument because more well-off households will benefit from the discount.</p> <p><strong>Jessica Elgot:</strong> <em>This looks more like the kind of package Sunak would back but Truss has said that she favours giving targeted support rather than increasing the £400 grant for every household, and her allies including the chief secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, have been disparaging about the entire £400 scheme – though have said they would not cancel it.</em></p> <p><strong>Richard Partington: </strong><em>The case against universal support is that many wealthier households saved money during the pandemic while working from home, with the Bank of England estimating about £180bn of “excess savings”. With inflation the result of demand outstripping supply, some economists say putting more money in the pockets of those who can afford to keep spending will pour fuel on the inflationary fire. However, others say the scale of the energy shock requires more people than usual to receive support.</em></p> <h2><strong>Scrapping VAT on energy bills</strong></h2> <p>This measure, which was first proposed by Labour, is another option being worked on to reduce bills. VAT on domestic energy is charged at a rate of 5% and it would save a typical consumer £154 over the year, and cost the exchequer about £4.3bn initially. Removing VAT would help those who face the biggest rise in their energy bills – those who consume the most.</p> <p><strong>Jessica Elgot:</strong> <em>Sunak rejected this as chancellor but has made it a key part of his policy offer as a Conservative leadership candidate. This was widely pilloried by the Truss campaign as a screeching </em><em>U-turn, making it difficult for her to adopt it in No 10 without losing face. But it has the advantage of </em><em>enabling a new PM to talk up the measure as a “Brexit freedom</em><em>”.</em></p> <p><strong>Richard Partington: </strong><em>One consequence of higher energy bills is that the Treasury will rake in more than expected from the VAT charged on them. Giving some of this back to struggling families therefore makes sense. However, Sunak had previously worried that it would be difficult to put the tax back on again in future, which could cause trouble for the government’s budget deficit amid weaker economic growth and rising spending pressures.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97d503aeea7802dea7b33ed401f8ddc55745d6a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97d503aeea7802dea7b33ed401f8ddc55745d6a2/0_102_2988_1792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A windfall tax is more likely if Sunak wins the leadership contest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A windfall tax on oil and gas companies is more likely if Sunak wins the leadership contest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>A new windfall tax</strong></h2> <p>Nadhim Zahawi as chancellor has been candid with energy firms about the option for an expansion of the windfall tax on oil and gas companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/26/sunak-announces-windfall-tax-energy-firms\">announced by Sunak</a> in May. Truss has said she is opposed to windfall taxes though Sunak has not ruled it out if he wins – though that seems unlikely.</p> <p>Extending the levy could raise £4bn, providing some much needed leeway for the government to help with energy bills. Labour has said the existing windfall tax could be tightened to remove the option for energy firms to claim tax relief on more than 90% of the levy if the money is reinvested.</p> <p><strong>Jessica Elgot: </strong><em>There were raised eyebrows in both leadership camps when Zahawi started talking up the potential for a windfall tax. Truss and her likely future chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, are staunchly opposed to the tax, believing it makes Britain an unpredictable place for investment. Truss has also said profit is “not a dirty word</em><em>”. But there is mass public anger about extraordinary profits, which Zahawi has alluded to, so it may be an unpopular stance to defend them.</em></p> <p><strong>Richard Partington:</strong> <em>Continued high energy prices have helped the world’s five biggest oil companies to bumper profits of nearly £50bn, lining shareholders’ pockets at the expense of consumers. This shows a clear case for a bigger windfall tax. However, chopping and changing the plan could undermine the argument that the policy is a one-off, potentially leading firms to reassess their investment plans.</em></p> <h2><strong>Scrapping the price rise and absorbing the costs</strong></h2> <p>This is the plan that is gaining momentum, backed by Labour and the Lib Dems, so it would be unusual if the Treasury was not beginning some preliminary work on the possibility. It would involve freezing the energy price cap at its current level of just under £2,000 a year rather than allowing it to rise in line with global wholesale gas prices.</p> <p>Labour says the plan would cost just under £30bn, although that’s on the assumption that it would apply only for the next six months – so it may cost much more in the long term.</p> <p><strong>Jessica Elgot: </strong><em>Both candidates have ruled this out, despite overwhelming public support for the measure, which is backed by 85% of Tory voters. However, given past experience of the Tories dismissing and then adopting popular cost of living policies, it is not impossible this one could seem appealing in the cold light of day in September.</em></p> <p><strong>Richard Partington:</strong> <em>There are clear pros and cons. A universal cap could halt headline inflation from rising further, potentially saving the government money on inflation-linked borrowing. However, it would have a hefty price tag and need to be in place for a year (inflation is based on the 12</em><em>-month change in consumer prices). Free-market economists argue it would destroy price signals; incentivising energy use, rather than lower consumption and investment in insulation. It would also benefit rich and poor alike.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe id=\"business-today\" name=\"business-today\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/business-today\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--business-today\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk<br></figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Deficit fund for suppliers to cover fuel price rise</strong></h2> <p>The idea has been suggested by the boss of ScottishPower that the government could set up a deficit fund to cover the difference between what people pay and how much it costs to supply their homes with gas and electricity.</p> <p>The fund could be underwritten by the government, or a willing financial institution, and repaid over a 10 to 15 year period to smooth out the costs.

But it would still require vast sums which she has said she is not prepared to spend – and that would be on top of additional billions of spending commitment she has made on tax cuts and defence.</em></p> <p><strong>Richard Partington: </strong><em>Spreading energy bills over a longer time frame would ease some of the pain today, helping the economic outlook in the short-term. However, it would build up costs for the future, and would ultimately be a cost ultimately borne by consumers rather than the state. If prices stay high, it would mean higher bills for households in future. However, it could help smooth the transition, rather than having cliff-edge moments each time the Ofgem price cap is updated.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/21/texas-in-god-we-trust-posters-law","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T13:37:44Z","webTitle":"Alarm over Texas law forcing schools to display ‘In God We Trust’ signs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/21/texas-in-god-we-trust-posters-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/21/texas-in-god-we-trust-posters-law","fields":{"headline":"Alarm over Texas law forcing schools to display ‘In God We Trust’ signs","trailText":"Civil rights advocates say it ‘imposes religion’ as new law requires public campuses to display donated items bearing that phrase","byline":"Samira Asma-Sadeque","body":"<p>Civil rights advocates are ringing alarm bells about officials <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/us/texas-schools-in-god-we-trust/index.html\">distributing</a> “In God We Trust” posters in Texas schools after a state law took effect requiring public campuses to display any donated items bearing that phrase.</p> <p>“These posters demonstrate the more casual ways a state can impose religion on the public,” Sophie Ellman-Golan of Jews for Racial &amp; Economic Justice (JFREJ) told the Guardian. “Alone, they’re a basic violation of the separation of church and state.

About half of Muslim students in Texas’s Dallas-Fort Worth area have reported being bullied at school over their faith, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press_releases/cair-dfw-survey-almost-half-of-muslim-students-say-they-have-been-bullied/\">2020 Cair report</a>.</p> <p>Sometimes in Texas, a fear of people from non-Christian backgrounds has prompted their being reported to police.</p> <p>For instance, In 2015, a 14-year-old Muslim boy in a Texas suburb was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/22/ahmed-mohamed-withdraws-from-texas-school-that-suspended-him-over-clock\">arrested</a> after he brought a clock he made to school, and a teacher fearing it was a bomb called police on him. A few months later, a 12-year-old Sikh boy in another Texas suburb was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/20/this-was-the-year-fear-nearly-won-we-cant-let-it\">arrested</a> after a bully told his teacher he was carrying a bomb in his backpack.</p> <p>Saylor said the “In God We Trust” initiative’s success depended on “students of minority faiths’ [feeling] supported by educators to express how they understand trusting God”.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/21/sami-abu-wardeh-review-underbelly-edinburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T13:04:25Z","webTitle":"Sami Abu Wardeh review – a clown in character-comic’s clothing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/21/sami-abu-wardeh-review-underbelly-edinburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/21/sami-abu-wardeh-review-underbelly-edinburgh","fields":{"headline":"Sami Abu Wardeh review – a clown in character-comic’s clothing","trailText":"Outlandish physical antics and a spontaneous stage presence keep Wardeh’s audience laughing as he clowns through a cast of oddball characters","byline":"Brian Logan","body":"<p>Clown is in vogue again, coming at us wide-eyed wherever you look on the fringe – at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/07/frankie-thompson-review-all-the-feline-feels-with-a-magnetic-performer\">Frankie Thompson’s Catts</a>, Julia Masli’s Choosh!, or with this fine debut from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jul/10/clownts-review-three-maestros-compete-in-a-celebration-of-anarchic-hilarity\">Sami Abu Wardeh</a>. The show introduces us to a clown in character-comic’s clothing, as a faux-naif, Palestinian-accented Wardeh depicts the co-workers he met while cleaning on a cruise ship. These dancers, martial artists and sauna attendants give full rein to Wardeh’s flexible physicality: most of the laughs – and there are plenty – come from our host’s outlandish physical antics, be they prancing, street fighting or catching innumerable cherry tomatoes the audience lob towards his mouth.</p> <p>While Wardeh himself makes for an engaging and spontaneous stage presence, as he chases those tomatoes and beats us to attention on his tabla drum, there’s no doubt who his standout character is here. Giralomo is an Italian movement guru, inflated with the importance of his chosen calling. He depicts for us the practical applications of dance in everyday life – if not in England, whose movement traditions he disdains. (“Billy Elliot? For me, it is better if he stays in the mine.”) He solicits favourite films from the crowd – films he will then turn into pure choreography. Wardeh is blissfully funny here while barely speaking a word, signalling boredom with his audience’s film synopses, and (having agreed to enact The Sound of Music) ungraciously accepting the burden of depicting Nazis in dance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79ce869f674f1bf12abceab772700193a280fbbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79ce869f674f1bf12abceab772700193a280fbbe/756_902_4501_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sami Abu Wardeh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fun to be had … Sami Abu Wardeh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shazad Khalid</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The succeeding characters aren’t as rich – but there’s still fun to be had with his over-enthusiastic kids’ ninja teacher, and sleazy Spanish guitarist Rodrigo, matchmaking members of his public in song.

The book, <em>Cooking: Simply And Well, For One or Many</em>, was the result of many years of work, on and off, and he wasn’t quite ready to face its reality.</p> <p>Loved by the London food world since making his mark at Terence Conran’s Blueprint Cafe, it seems like an oversight that Lee has not published a cookbook until now. “I had shied away, I suppose, mostly because I thought it had all been done. God knows that this kind of thing is standing on the shoulders of the great and the many,” he says, gesturing to the shelves on all walls of his home. They’re filled with books about food, from nouvelle cuisine pioneer Michel Guérard to current London pastry sensation Ravneet Gill. And of course, the holy trinity of Elizabeth David, Julia Child and Jane Grigson. But Lee had long felt a volume of his own work may be simmering away, and when approached by Fourth Estate in about 2016 he knew it was time to make it real, eventually.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95eff09a9f9a8784de25c14618f0eb01e137722a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95eff09a9f9a8784de25c14618f0eb01e137722a/0_516_6192_7740/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Lee, photographed at his restaurant, Quo Vadis, in London.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Lee, photographed at his restaurant, Quo Vadis, in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“It’s been a great adventure, but I underestimated entirely what it would take,” he admits. The pressures of writing daily menus and working in a busy kitchen meant that structuring a whole book seemed overwhelming. Lee hastens to add that at least it didn’t take 20 years to put together, like Alan Davidson’s <em>Oxford Companion to Food</em>.</p> <p>The book is arranged with a chef’s eye for ingredients, and favourite things to eat throughout the seasons, rather than in courses or meals. A chapter on blood oranges sits between Biscuits and Breadcrumbs, while Impromptu Dinners provides meals (such as a perfect pork chop and pan juices) that can be made for one or scaled up; and there are simple, joyous meals to feed a crowd (little meatballs, or fennel and lemon spaghetti).</p> <p>It’s also a journey through Lee’s career, from his signature snack of baked salsify, back to a classic pommes anna from his time at the London club Boodles, as well as a tribute to peers, mentors and his food-loving parents, who would think nothing of driving across Scotland for hours to pick up a good lobster. “We only liked food folk,” he says. “If you weren’t eating it, you were talking about it.”</p> <p>As anyone who has seen him laugh and charm his way through the room at Quo Vadis would expect, Lee is as generous in prose as he is when talking about the book, heaping praise on the close team who helped bring it all together. Lee and friends shot the photographs for the book at his home, for a true reflection of his cooking – the chocolate tart is a little spilled, the pastry a little blond, the plates and cookware his own. “It’s all very real,” he says. “We’re keen on that.”</p> <p>Despite his slow start, in the end Lee over-delivered with his manuscript, and some favourite recipes were lost to the editing process. Mince and tatties did not make the cut. He wonders if calling it “Scottish ragu” would have improved its chances of making the final version and if, perhaps, it could go in a second book. “We’ll see how this darling does. It’s all a bit nerve-racking,” says Lee, breezily. “The adventure continues.”</p> <h2>Sardines on toast with a fried egg (pictured above)</h2> <p>Worth considering too for this charming dish are mackerel and herring, cooked similarly.</p> <p><em><strong>For each person</strong></em><br><strong>spring onions</strong> 3, trimmed <br><strong>bread</strong> 1 slice <br><strong>butter</strong><br><strong>olive oil </strong>1 tsp <br><strong>fresh sardines</strong> 3, butterflied (ie split and flattened)<br><strong>organic egg</strong> 1</p> <p>Heat a griddle or frying pan over a high heat. Lay the spring onions on the hot pan to blister, turning after 3-4 minutes to blister the other side.</p> <p>Toast the bread and chop the cooked spring onions finely. Butter the toast and spread with the chopped spring onions.</p> <p>Lightly oil and season the skin side of the sardines, then lay them in the onion pan, skin side down, and cook undisturbed for 3-4 minutes, until the flesh turns pale. Flip and cook for no more than 1 minute on the other side.</p> <p>Heat a small frying pan and gently fry the egg. Carefully lift the sardines and set them skin side up on the onion, then place the egg on the sardines – <em>et voila</em>̀.</p> <h2>Pork chop</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fa68ed183cfc5202e88535abeea3ae5667abab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fa68ed183cfc5202e88535abeea3ae5667abab5/0_514_3254_3254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pork chop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pork chop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>For each person</strong></em><br><strong>pork chop</strong> 1 x 300-400g, preferably on the bone <br><strong>light vegetable oil</strong> 1 tsp <br><strong>garlic</strong> ½ clove, peeled and finely chopped<br><strong>unwaxed lemon </strong>zest<strong> </strong>of ½ <br><strong>thyme leaves</strong> a pinch <br><strong>rosemary</strong> 2-3 sprigs<br><strong>fennel seeds and celery seeds</strong> a pinch of each<br><strong>very good red wine vinegar</strong> 1 tsp (such as Banyuls)</p> <p>Heat a cast-iron frying pan over a moderate heat. Liberally and evenly pepper the pork chop on both sides and lightly season with sea salt. Put the oil into the cast-iron pan, lay the pork chop on top and let cook undisturbed until deep mahogany in colour, roughly 8-10 minutes.</p> <p>While the pork chop is cooking, grind the garlic, lemon zest, thyme and rosemary with the fennel and celery seeds in a pestle and mortar and set aside.</p> <p>Turn the pork chop and cook for a further 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and spoon the contents of the mortar on to the chop. Discard any excess fat from the pan, pour the red wine vinegar on to the chop, and turn it a few times to make sure it’s evenly coated. Cover and set aside to rest in the pan for at least 3-4 minutes.</p> <p>Gently warm the pan to heat up any juices gathered, to pour over the pork chop before serving. The chop goes wonderfully with so much, from olive oil, mash or potato and celeriac gratin to green beans, asparagus, peas, courgettes, Jerusalem artichokes or chicory.</p> <h2>Hake with parsley, dill and anchovy sauce</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e176f880c8cff39470f491df41444ef95c05d81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e176f880c8cff39470f491df41444ef95c05d81/76_1066_3642_3642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hake with parsley, dill and anchovy sauce.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hake with parsley, dill and anchovy sauce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A striking dish with the pale green sauce pooled in the plate, contrasting with the delicate silvered skin of the hake.</p> <p><em><strong>Feeds 6</strong></em><br><strong>shallots</strong> 3 small <br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 clove <br><strong>anchovy fillets</strong> 6 <br><strong>olive oil</strong> 7 tbsp <br><strong>double cream </strong>200ml <br><strong>flat-leaf parsley </strong>150g picked leaves<br><strong>dill</strong> 30g picked leaves<br><strong>hake</strong> 6 fillets, roughly 1kg in total</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6.</p> <p>Peel and finely chop the shallots and garlic.

Press the cake down lightly with the bottom of a frying pan, then cook for a further 30 minutes, until the edges of the cake have coloured deep gold.</p> <p>Insert a small knife into the cake for doneness; there should be no resistance. Remove the cake from the oven, press down lightly with a frying pan one last time, then let sit for 5 minutes.</p> <p>Carefully work a spatula round the edges, lifting slightly to loosen the cake. Work the spatula gently towards the centre to free any slices that are sticking. Shake the pan gently to see if the cake shifts free. Place a board or dish on top. With one swift move, invert.

Served with cream, ice-cream and custard, this is very good in those last days of winter when a treat is often much needed. A thought for the cook is to prepare it the day before, as frangipane cooks best when refrigerated. Any leftover pastry can be sliced thinly, laid on a baking sheet and baked in a low oven until crisp and lightly coloured, making rather wonderful biscuits.</p> <p><em><strong>Feeds 6</strong></em></p> <p><strong>sweet shortcrust pastry</strong> (see below)<br><strong>flour</strong> a little for dusting<br><strong>marmalade</strong> 4 tbsp<br><strong>best dark chocolate</strong> 125g, at least 70% cocoa solids, cut into small pieces</p> <p><em><strong>For the frangipane<br></strong></em><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 250g, softened<br><strong>caster sugar</strong> 200g<br><strong>organic eggs</strong> 2<br><strong>whole almonds</strong> 250g blanched, coarsely ground</p> <p><em><strong>For the sweet shortcrust pastry<br></strong></em><strong>cold butter</strong> 150g<br><strong>00 flour</strong> 250g, plus extra for dusting<br><strong>icing sugar</strong> 75g<br><strong>salt</strong> a pinch <br><strong>organic egg</strong> 1<br><strong>cold water</strong> 1 tsp</p> <p>To make the pastry, put the cold butter, the flour, sugar and a pinch of salt into the bowl of a food processor and render to a fine crumb. Add the egg beaten with the water and pulse until a dough forms. Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and knead deftly into a drum shape. Cut the dough in half, then gently press down to form a disc. Wrap each disc, and freeze one for another time. Refrigerate the one you are using for at least 30 minutes. Each will fit a 20-25cm x 4-5cm tart case.</p> <p>To make the frangipane, beat the butter and sugar together in a bowl until mixed. Crack the eggs into a jug and beat lightly. Pour into the beaten butter and sugar. Stir in the ground almonds. Mix all together thoroughly and refrigerate, preferably overnight.</p> <p>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry large enough to line a 25cm x 2.5cm tart case with a removable bottom. Pop this into the fridge until required.</p> <p>When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 130C fan/gas mark 2. Spoon the marmalade over the bottom of the tart case. Heap the frangipane in little clods over the marmalade. Strew the chocolate over the frangipane.</p> <p>Place the tart on a wire rack over a tray to catch any butter that may fall from the tart while baking. Bake in the oven for 1 hour. At the end of the hour, lower the temperature to 100C fan/gas mark ½ and bake for a further 20 minutes, until golden and crusted. Remove from the oven and let the tart sit on a rack for at least an hour before serving. It is very good when served just warm.</p> <h2>Apple tarts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1fa744a40c194e60448416a494f1f5267194aa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1fa744a40c194e60448416a494f1f5267194aa1/477_1836_3167_3167/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple tarts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple tarts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a lovely pudding, timeless, elegant and delicious, and simplicity itself.</p> <p><em><strong>For each person<br></strong></em><strong>rough puff </strong><strong>pastry</strong> 50g (see below)<br><strong>apple</strong> 1, such as egremont russet, cox’s orange pippin or jonagold<br><strong>lemon juice</strong> a squeeze<br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 15g, melted<br><strong>caster sugar</strong> ½tsp</p> <p><em><strong>For the rough puff pastry<br></strong></em><strong>plain flour </strong>500g, plus extra for dusting<br><strong>unsalted butter </strong>500g, cold, cut into small squares<br><strong>salt</strong> a big pinch <br><strong>cold water</strong> 250ml</p> <p>To make the rough puff pastry, sift the flour on to a wide surface or into a large bowl. Add the cold butter and salt, then, using your fingertips, work the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs. Slowly add the water, about 50ml at a time, working deftly until all the water has been added. The dough will not be even but shape it into a rough ball, cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes.</p> <p>Lightly flour the surface and roll the ball into a rectangle, about 40cm x 20cm. Fold this in three and turn 90 degrees. Roll into the same sized rectangle again and fold in three. Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Repeat this two more times, turning each folded rectangle 90 degrees. Chill the pastry for an hour, or overnight, or freeze for future use.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6.</p> <p>Take a 50g portion of the pastry and roll it out thinly on a lightly floured surface into a 12-13cm disc.

Three years later, they feel rejected","byline":"Severin Carrell Scotland editor","body":"<p>Aimen Dean remembers the moment he and his wife, Saadia, decided to make their home in Scotland. They had toured the Highlands and were standing on the battlements of Edinburgh Castle, looking out over the city’s skyline.</p> <p>Dean already knew Scotland: as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/aimen-dean-spy-al-qaida-edinburgh-st-georges-school-daughter-discrimination\">one of the UK’s key spies</a>, operating in the highest levels of al-Qaida, he had visited the country in secret six times before, to be debriefed by MI6 officers at safe houses deep in the Highlands or, on one occasion, a hotel on the island of Iona.</p> <p>Saadia was from Pakistan and of Kashmiri descent and Dean recalls that the beauty of the Highlands resonated with her. “I want to see mountains; I want to see greenery and all of those things,” she said. “It’s a place I will never get tired of.”</p> <p>By December 2019, it was decided. They rented at first and then found a newly built house near Edinburgh, settling into a new life. They applied for their infant daughter to join the nursery at St George’s school, one of Scotland’s premier private schools. “We thought it would be perfect for her,” he said. “Actually, it was a mistake.”</p> <p>For Dean, this new life was the ultimate reward. For eight years he had worked undercover for MI6 deep inside al-Qaida, the Islamist terrorist group run by Osama bin Laden, which in 2001 carried out the 9/11 bombings and a series of other atrocities.</p> <p>Then a Bahraini citizen, he had been recruited by al-Qaida to become a bomb maker after fighting in Bosnia, like thousands of other young Muslims, against the ethnic cleansing campaigns of Serb nationalists. In 1998 al-Qaida announced itself to the world by bombing two American embassies, in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. It killed 224 people including 12 US personnel, injuring thousands more.</p> <p>Dean said those atrocities shattered his faith in the cause. Attacking civilians had no theological or political justification, he reasoned, nor did a borderless war against the west. Some months later, he was recruited by MI6. By the time of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in September 2001, Dean was the west’s most important human asset within al-Qaida.</p> <p>Philip Ingram, a former colonel in British military intelligence, saw Dean’s reports from Afghanistan. “I remember thinking, ‘Wow, this is significant stuff. There’s someone in there who has a very detailed understanding.’”</p> <p>He quit spying in 2006, becoming instead an expert in Islamist terrorist financing at HSBC. Granted British citizenship, in 2015 he outed himself in a BBC interview, before publishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/19/nine-lives-my-time-as-mi6-top-spy-inside-al-qaida-aimen-dean-review\">a critically acclaimed account</a> of his time in the group, Nine Lives, and launching his own podcast series on fundamentalism and global affairs, Conflicted.</p> <p>In September 2021, Channel 4 screened a three-part documentary on Bin Laden to mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 bombings. Dean was a star witness. By then, their daughter had started at St George’s and appeared to be flourishing. But a few weeks later “everything became sour”.</p> <p>On 14 October, Dean and his wife were summoned to an urgent online meeting with the school’s headteacher, Alex Hems, and a senior colleague. The couple were told that several parents had raised concerns about his presence, fearing he could be a target for assassination on school grounds. They were asked to alter their daughter’s drop-off and pickup times and, according to Dean, to delete a photograph of her in her school dress from Dean’s social media accounts.</p> <p>Dean says Hems confirmed the school had fresh assurances from MI5 that he posed no threat to the school’s safety, repeating its promises from 2019. Even so, Dean alleges Hems told the couple: “Do not expect a welcome here in Scotland, especially in Edinburgh. The people here are conservative with a small C, and they will not be as welcoming as people in London.”</p> <p>The couple reluctantly complied, Dean said. For the next seven months their daughter arrived at school 20 minutes after her classmates and was picked up 30 minutes after school finished. But still things did not go smoothly. He claims some parents would linger outside, giving hostile and sneering looks, and on numerous times he and his daughter were left waiting for long periods at the gate, sometimes in the rain, for staff to buzz her into school. After he complained about one delay, Hems apologised.</p> <p>Repeatedly late for class, his daughter was allegedly shouted at by a member of staff. That, the couple say, deeply damaged her confidence. Dean recalls his daughter telling them: “They aren’t kind. They keep shouting at me, ‘Sit down, sit down’. Why do I have to go to school here? Why does the school hate me?”</p> <p>Unable to mollify the unidentified parents who had complained – and anxious about encountering any hostility – the couple decided not to risk allowing their daughter to attend class parties. Nevertheless, in April they applied for their son to join St George’s nursery; he is autistic, so the couple offered to pay for one-to-one assistance in class for him.</p> <p>Staff had indicated this would be accepted, they say, but to their shock the offer was rejected. During a meeting at school, with their son playing close by, Dean alleges one teacher said she had “a radical idea”. In his complaint to the registrar, Dean claims she said: “What is holding you back here in Edinburgh? Why don’t you leave the country? The Middle East offers fantastic facilities for children like [your son].” Dean claims a colleague concurred, stating: “You must take the wellbeing of both your kids into consideration.”</p> <p>That shocked them profoundly, he said. It felt like a total rejection, one they feared could be repeated at another British school or town. Rather than risk relocating, Saadia told Dean she wanted to sell up and leave the UK. A week later, the couple told St George’s they were leaving.</p> <p>In mid-May, feeling their relationship with the school had become irreparable, a furious Dean accused other “racist and bigoted parents” of triggering the crisis in a message to a parents’ WhatsApp group, and warned: “You messed with the wrong person here!” He posted, but quickly deleted, a third message asking some named parents to confirm whether they were the complainants. Hems responded, Dean said, by banning him from the school grounds, calling his message “deeply offensive” and “upsetting”.</p> <p>On 7 June, Hems met the couple at school, where she pressed them to agree to mediation to settle their dispute, which the couple rejected. Dean said Hems rejected his request for an apology and to allow their daughter to resume normal school hours. He alleges she told them: “You’re al-Qaida. That is scary for other parents. I did my research; al-Qaida is a scary matter all over the UK.”</p> <p>The school said it “very strongly disputed” Dean’s allegations, and was confident the registrar would find it “acted fully in accordance with all relevant safeguarding and regulatory procedures”. Hems is also understood to strongly reject his account.</p> <p>Dean told the Guardian he was publicising his complaint because he feared failing others who risked their lives for the sake of the UK. “[Next time] it will be the kids of Afghan interpreters or brave Russian spies who we’re helping. It’s tempting to sweep this under the rug and never speak of it again. This scenario will be repeated, whether it’s York or Brighton or London or anywhere else, if we don’t take a stand on this now.”</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/21/the-rise-of-vertical-farms-could-indoor-plant-factories-be-the-norm-in-10-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T13:00:09Z","webTitle":"The rise of vertical farms: could indoor plant factories be the norm in 10 years?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/21/the-rise-of-vertical-farms-could-indoor-plant-factories-be-the-norm-in-10-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/21/the-rise-of-vertical-farms-could-indoor-plant-factories-be-the-norm-in-10-years","fields":{"headline":"The rise of vertical farms: could indoor plant factories be the norm in 10 years?","trailText":"The UK is leading the way in vertical farming, a more sustainable way to grow herbs, salads and soft fruits year-round","byline":"Linda Geddes Science correspondent","body":"<p>Behind an airtight door, inside a warehouse 10 minutes walk from Bristol city centre, shelves of vibrant chives sprout enthusiastically towards a sky of multicoloured LEDs. The air they are transpiring smells earthy, despite the absence of soil, while a mechanical hum provides a soothing substitute for birdsong.</p> <p>Welcome to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/indoor-vertical-farms-agriculture\">future of farming</a>, where herbs, salads and soft fruits are grown year-round, in vast, indoor plant factories.</p> <p>In June, the British vertical farming startup the Jones Food Company (JFCo), announced it was building the world’s largest vertical farm on the site of an old forge in Lydney, Gloucestershire. </p> <p>Its CEO, James Lloyd-Jones, predicts that within 10 years the UK could be growing all its herbs, salad leaves, soft fruits – and potentially cut flowers – this way: “Vertical farms will become the norm within the supply chain, and probably take away greenhouse production and imports.”</p> <p>The seeds of this revolution are being sown – in vertically stacked layers of sheep’s wool – at JFCo’s innovation centre in Bristol. Lloyd-Jones said: “Vertical farming can grow anything. It just grows lots of things too expensively to be commercially viable, so here is where we are learning how to commercialise it.”</p> <p>In the first of four 69 sq metre grow rooms are stacks of brilliant green chives. Every environmental parameter in the room is tightly controlled, from the temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide content of the room, to the colour spectrum, intensity and pattern of the light-dark cycle, and the nutrients the seedlings are exposed to.</p> <p>By tweaking these parameters, and experimenting with different plant varieties, they are investigating the optimal conditions in which to grow these herbs.</p> <p>“You’re taking away the need for sunlight, and creating every environmental parameter perfectly for the plants’ needs. You’re giving them their best time – effectively, two weeks in Barbados, where they’re coming back relaxed – and then you’re harvesting them,” said Lloyd-Jones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/18/gm-soya-beans-greater-yield-global-food-security-boost\">New GM soya beans give 25% greater yield in global food security boost</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s easy to spot which seedlings have hit the jackpot: some of the trays contain lush green carpets of chives; others patchy outcrops.</p> <p>Down the hallway, similar experiments are taking place with coriander and dill, while a 276m<sup>2</sup> strawberry laboratory is being constructed across the corridor.</p> <p>Farming this way could have numerous advantages. “One of the big benefits is that we’re growing in a way that doesn’t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/03/nature-friendly-farming-does-not-reduce-productivity-study-finds\">impact on nature</a>,” said Charlie Guy, cofounder of LettUs Grow, a Bristol-based company that’s developing technology for vertical farms.</p> <p>“It also means we can focus more of our land on things like tree planting. So, from a biodiversity standpoint, there are massive benefits.”</p> <p>Because the nutrient-rich water bathing the plants’ roots is cleaned and re-used up to 30 times, there’s less wastage. There’s also no run-off of pesticides into neighbouring waterways, and no need for herbicides or pesticides, because the plants are shut away indoors.</p> <p>Stacking plants above one another on shelves, and growing them in consistent and optimised conditions, 365 days a year, also means that, in theory, every square metre of land is more productive, compared to conventional farms.</p> <p>Another benefit is consistency in the produce itself. “Vertical farming allows you to grow things with a very consistent appearance and flavour, which means they can be packed more efficiently, and there’s less waste because fewer of the items are unattractive to supermarket buyers,” said Prof Antony Dodd at the John Innes centre, a research hub in Norwich.</p> <p>Even so, as of 2020, only about 30 hectares (75 acres) of operational vertical farmland existed worldwide. A key challenge is that growing crops indoors, 24/7, requires a lot of electricity – to power the lights, heaters, humidifiers and other equipment.</p> <p>JFCo’s solution is investment in renewable energy: The roof of its farm in Lydney – which will eventually provide 1.5 hectares of growing space (equivalent to about 60 tennis courts) – will be entirely covered in solar panels, with space for further panels or a wind turbine on neighbouring land.</p> <p>Guy said: “Energy is always an issue with vertical farms, but when you tie that to renewable energy, then it really is a very sustainable way of growing food, versus importing it from around the world, and the sustainability and supply chain risk issues associated with that.”</p> <p>Companies are also exploring technologies that could reduce the cost of labour, eg by semi-automating the harvesting process: “A bit like a [robotic] Amazon or Ocado pick station, where you do what you need to do with the plant – prune it, pollinate it, take the strawberries off it – and then put it back in its position,” said Lloyd-Jones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcd11f184c904f8450c676e7fb71858875c36621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcd11f184c904f8450c676e7fb71858875c36621/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man tending a lettuce\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A vertical farm in west Java, Indonesia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dasril Roszandi/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To further boost productivity, LettUs Grow is developing aeroponic growth methods, which involves spraying the plant’s roots with a very fine mist of nutrient solution, rather than standing them in it (hydroponics).</p> <p>If the plants have healthy roots, they are going to be able to use energy more efficiently and grow much better. A good analogy is, “if you think about a nice healthy soil, it’s got lots of air pockets in it, it’s got the right amount of nutrients, the right amount of moisture – we can effectively recreate that using aeroponics”, said Guy.</p> <p>Even if these plant pioneers can make vertical farming cost-effective, it is unlikely to replace traditional farming for staple crops, such as wheat, rice or potatoes. These have a longer growing period and require a lot of light, compared with herbs or salad leaves.</p> <p>“A field of wheat also doesn’t sell for as much money as a field of lettuces. There’s a sweet spot in terms of the speed at which things grow, and the amount of energy that needs to go into the system, in order for these facilities to be economically viable,” said Dodd.</p> <p>Where vertical farming could be viable is for crops with shorter growing seasons, such as salad leaves, herbs and soft fruits such as strawberries or blueberries.</p> <p>“It is not the answer to food security, but it’s one of a range of different things that can contribute to producing food in a more sustainable way,” Dodd said.</p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/aug/21/aimen-dean-spy-al-qaida-edinburgh-st-georges-school-daughter-discrimination","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T13:00:09Z","webTitle":"Father who spied on al-Qaida accuses Edinburgh school of discrimination","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/aimen-dean-spy-al-qaida-edinburgh-st-georges-school-daughter-discrimination","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/aimen-dean-spy-al-qaida-edinburgh-st-georges-school-daughter-discrimination","fields":{"headline":"Father who spied on al-Qaida accuses Edinburgh school of discrimination","trailText":"Inquiry opens into St George’s after Aimen Dean claims it singled out his daughter over fears he was a security risk","byline":"Severin Carrell Scotland editor","body":"<p>One of the UK’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/21/aimen-dean-former-mi6-spy-scottish-dream-turned-sour\">leading private schools is under investigation</a> after being accused of discrimination against the daughter of one of the west’s most important spies, a former al-Qaida bomb-maker credited with saving thousands of lives.</p> <p>Aimen Dean, who spied for British intelligence inside the terrorist network for eight years, has made a formal complaint against St George’s School in Edinburgh, claiming it singled out his five-year-old daughter because other parents feared he was a security risk.</p> <p>The Registrar of Independent Schools is investigating whether St George’s failed to adequately safeguard or promote his daughter’s welfare after Dean complained about a “toxic environment” at the school, using powers under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980.</p> <p>If the registrar, Alex O’Neill, finds that St George’s was either “objectionable” or at risk of being objectionable, Scottish ministers could impose stringent conditions on the school, ordering it to improve its policies and governance.

A black and white image of the painting appeared in Blast, the avant garde journal of the vorticists produced shortly before the outbreak of the first world war.</p> <p>Almost all of Saunders’ vorticist paintings are thought to be lost, although drawings survive and will be exhibited at the Courtauld Gallery in London in October.</p> <p>But an investigation of Praxitella, a portrait of the film critic Iris Barry by Wyndham Lewis, the founder of the vorticists, by two Courtauld students revealed it was almost certainly painted on top of Atlantic City.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9342c82e02704054b608ea2f8ab64438e4b3d0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9342c82e02704054b608ea2f8ab64438e4b3d0c/0_0_4064_5608/725.jpg\" alt=\"Praxitella by Wyndham Lewis\" width=\"725\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Praxitella by Wyndham Lewis, who was the founder of the radical and short-lived Vorticist movement.<br><br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of Praxitella’s uneven texture and glimpses of bright red through cracks in the surface paint, scholars had suspected that the 1921 portrait had been painted over another work.</p> <p>The two students, Rebecca Chipkin and Helen Kohn, used X-ray and other imaging technology to investigate the painting. They found an abstract composition beneath the portrait that was eventually identified as the hitherto lost Atlantic City.</p> <p>“We realised that when we turned the image of Atlantic City [in Blast] upside down, it had striking similarities with the composition seen in our X-ray of Praxitella,” Chipkin and Kohn said. “We were flabbergasted. It has taken 100 years to rediscover Atlantic City. It gives hope that there are other hidden vorticist paintings waiting to be found.”</p> <p>Saunders was one of only two women to join the vorticists. “In the prewar years, she was one of the most radical painters and draughtspeople around. There were only a handful of people in Europe producing that type of hard-edged abstract painting and drawing,” said Barnaby Wright, the deputy head of the Courtauld Gallery and a 20th-century specialist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60897606781a3f43fd143d1d0f15b431e36d9a85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60897606781a3f43fd143d1d0f15b431e36d9a85/0_0_420_610/344.jpg\" alt=\"Atlantic City by Helen Saunders.\" width=\"344\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atlantic City by Helen Saunders, who was one of only two women to join the vorticists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vorticism was a literary and artistic movement that was influenced by cubism and futurism and whose artworks typically had bold colours, harsh lines and sharp angles. The poets TS Eliot and Ezra Pound were among the group’s supporters.</p> <p>“Saunders was a really interesting figure, but she was largely overshadowed by her male contemporaries. She and Jessica Dismorr were the backbone of the group,” said Wright.</p> <p>“She became close friends with Wyndham Lewis, they were extremely close emotionally, but after the war he turned his back on her and she found that hard to take. One speculative theory is that Lewis painted over Saunders’ work in a fit of pique. It’s entirely possible.”</p> <p>There was not much of a contemporary market for the vorticists’ work, which may have contributed to the demise of the movement. “It was only later that the radical nature of the work became valued and celebrated,” said Wright.</p> <p>The discovery of Saunders’ lost painting was “thrilling”, he said, and the result of the students’ “research brilliance”. The Courtauld hopes the find will spark renewed interest in the artist’s work.</p> <p>The gallery will show Praxitella, loaned from Leeds Art Gallery, alongside the X-ray and partial colour reconstruction of Atlantic City as part of its exhibition of 18 of Saunders’ drawings and watercolours, tracing her artistic development.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/helen-saunders-modernist-rebel/\">Helen Saunders: Modernist Rebel</a> opens at the Courtauld Gallery on 14 October.</em></p>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2022/aug/21/boxing-oleksandr-usyk-challenges-tyson-fury-after-beating-anthony-joshua","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T12:32:44Z","webTitle":"Oleksandr Usyk challenges Tyson Fury to unification fight after beating Joshua","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/21/boxing-oleksandr-usyk-challenges-tyson-fury-after-beating-anthony-joshua","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/aug/21/boxing-oleksandr-usyk-challenges-tyson-fury-after-beating-anthony-joshua","fields":{"headline":"Oleksandr Usyk challenges Tyson Fury to unification fight after beating Joshua","trailText":"Oleksandr Usyk has urged Tyson Fury to come out of retirement and fight him for the undisputed world heavyweight title","byline":"Sachin Nakrani and PA Media","body":"<p>After defeating Anthony Joshua for the second time, Oleksandr Usyk has thrown down the challenge to Britain’s Tyson Fury to come out of retirement and fight him for the undisputed world heavyweight boxing title.</p> \n<p>The Ukrainian made clear he was only interested in fighting Fury after outpointing Joshua again to retain the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO belts in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/aug/21/oleksandr-usyk-beats-anthony-joshua-by-split-decision-to-retain-world-titles\">Oleksandr Usyk beats Anthony Joshua by split decision to retain world titles</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Fury, the WBC champion, announced in April he had promised his wife he would retire but had also declared a long-standing interest in fighting Joshua.

I kept telling myself, ‘you cannot stop’ … big things were at stake,” Usyk said. “Thank God, the belts are coming back to Ukraine. The victory is with us.”</p> \n<p>Joshua was emotional during his post-fight media duties, and expressed regret that a long-awaited all-British title bout with Fury is no longer on the cards.</p> \n<p>“I wanted to win for Great Britain because I know they want me to fight Tyson Fury,” Joshua said. “I’m a fighter, I’m not a normal person, even though I try to hold it together.

You never had the easy fights because you wanted to complete a résumé. You wanted to fight the elite.</p> \n<p>“I would like to see him get back to enjoying himself, get back to the pressures of working his way back up to the championship belt.” The British fighters Dillian Whyte and Joe Joyce, plus the former WBC world champion Deontay Wilder, are potentially lucrative options. Hearn also paid tribute to Usyk, saying he would have scored the fight 115-113 to the 35-year-old. “He’s too good and there’s no shame in it,” he said.</p> \n<p>Asked how the champion would stack up against Fury, he said: “They are both tremendous fighters. I’m not sure anyone can beat Oleksandr Usyk. Tyson Fury’s a clever man. He had the chance to fight him and chose not to. Will he come out of retirement?

It does so at its own peril","trailText":"Even if Vladimir Putin does eventually falter, Russia’s power structure means another Putin will follow, and then another, says novelist Mikhail Shishkin","byline":"Mikhail Shishkin","body":"<p>“On the front page – war, on the back page – the crossword.” A line from my novel The Light and the Dark sprang to mind as I travelled on a train shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Sitting across from me, a passenger was reading the paper: on the front page, there was the war; on the back page, the crossword. Time has passed since then, and the daily atrocities have started to disappear from the headlines, despite the battles growing more savage each day. But no one in the west wants to hear about war any more – people are tired of horror and solidarity. They want peace, no price rises, a quiet life and a nice holiday.</p> <p>It’s not the first time my writing has sounded the alarm over horrors to come. Before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/18/russia-celebrates-anniversary-crimea-takeover-eyes-second-annexation\">annexation of Crimea</a>, I used an analogy with the Russian folk tale Teremok to describe Europe’s uncertain future. Once upon a time, there were some forest animals who lived together in a cosy little house – a <em>teremok</em>. One day, a frog knocks on the door. “Knock, knock! Who dwells in this <em>teremok</em>? Let me in, I’d like to live here with you.” The animals let the frog in, and everyone agrees that it is a happy and cosy home. They even let in Kyward the hare and Reynard the fox – there is room for everyone in the <em>teremok</em>. But then along comes Bruin the bear. No matter how hard he tries, he can’t fit into the <em>teremok</em>. The bear flies into a rage and sits down on the house. And that’s the end of the <em>teremok</em> – and of the fairytale.</p> <p>But no warnings were heeded. In 2014, shortly after the annexation of Crimea, I wrote, with increasing urgency, that “in the 21st century there is no such thing as a distant, localised war any more. Every war is now a European war. And this European war has already begun.” I warned that Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea would “create a wave of patriotism. Sooner or later, this wave will break, and then Putin will need a fresh wind.” I wrote of how years of chronic instability in the Balkans would create cripplingly high levels of migration to European countries, with an “inconceivably greater wave of refugees from Ukraine”.</p> <p>Back then, there was still a chance to stop the aggressor. Yet European politicians closed their eyes to reality in an effort to curry favour with voters. Voters wanted peace then, too; jobs, no price rises and nice holidays. Corrupt Russian experts insisted that we should understand Putin’s point of view and make concessions. </p> <p>And now, here we are: in the middle of a European war, facing an unprecedented wave of refugees from Ukraine, and wondering how our politicians could have been so blind. No one listens to writers any more. The only true lesson we can draw from history is that history teaches nothing.</p> <p>In Germany, intellectuals have collected <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/keine-waffenlieferung-an-die-ukraine-und-keine-beteiligung-deutschlands-am-krieg\">thousands of signatures</a> on a petition demanding their own government stop delivering weapons to Ukraine, because it could lead to a third world war. “We want a policy of peace, not war,” they write. But the third world war has already begun. It started in 2014. How can you cure someone’s blindness, if they want to be blind?</p> <p>The question now is, how and when will this war end? The war against Nazi Germany didn’t end with Hitler’s death, but with a devastating military defeat. Putin’s death one day is inevitable, but Russia’s defeat is not.</p> <p>The answer boils down to authenticity. Some tsars are real, some are fake. If Holy Russia expands its territory and other peoples bow before the autocrat in Moscow, the vassalled population that toils and struggles and heroically sheds its blood for the sacred fatherland thinks it is a blessing from God. And then it doesn’t matter very much how the tsar came to power or how he rules over his subjects. He can butcher them in their millions, destroy thousands of churches and execute the priests – all that matters is that the tsar is real, for then the enemy will tremble and the Holy Land will extend. That’s how it was with Stalin.</p> <p>Conversely, military failures and the loss of even a small part of the Holy Land will be seen by the tsar’s subjects as a clear sign that the tsar is not blessed – that he is an illegitimate fake. Did he botch the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War\">war with Japan</a>? Did he fail to subjugate the Chechens? If so, that man on the throne is a con artist posing as a tsar. That’s how it was with Nicholas II and Boris Yeltsin.</p> <p>Putin legitimised his presidency by regaining Crimea, but his legitimacy is evaporating with his inability to win against Ukraine. The next tsar will, in turn, have to prove himself by achieving victories in the war against the world. And if, for this Putin, threatening to deploy tactical nuclear weapons is merely one aspect of hybrid warfare, for the next Putin deploying them may become a necessary tool in his effort to secure power.</p> <p>The next Putin, too, will be nothing more than an actor who cannot change his role. His role will be pre-written by the entire Russian power structure, which doesn’t worry about how many people will die in Ukraine or Russia or wherever; it isn’t concerned about the resources it spends, the number of weapons it deploys or the level of military casualties. And if the Russian quality of life deteriorates? So be it – the regime never did care much about the happiness of its own people.</p> <p>Anyone who is part of this power structure is not afraid to attack the west. After all, who should they be scared of? If a rocket lands on a Nato member’s territory, what then? More meetings, statements, declarations, calls for peace? It’s high time the free world realised that it is not fighting a mad dictator but an autonomous and self-regenerating aggressive power system. </p> <p>The Russian autocracy’s ancient social structure has been preserved by the storehouse of history for centuries, and sheds its skin only to return in a new guise: as the Golden Horde’s Khanate or the tsardom of Moscow, as the Romanovs’ empire or Stalin’s communist Soviet Union, and most recently as Putin’s “managed democracy”. And now the Russian Federation is shedding its skin once more. What will emerge from the undisturbed foundations of the undefeated military dictatorship? Could it be a free constitutional democracy that willingly forgoes nuclear weapons? Does this sound likely to you?</p> <p>Before the second world war, too, people wanted peace, no price rises and nice holidays. The voters hoped that their own democratic governments in France and Britain would pursue a policy of peace with Hitler rather than one of war. What followed is history, encompassed in Winston Churchill’s ruthlessly honest and tragic message to voters: “I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.”</p> <p>Sooner or later, similar promises will have to be made – instead of nice holidays, European voters must steel themselves for great sacrifice, struggle and hardship, because that is the price we must pay for peace.</p> <ul> <li><p>Mikhail Shishkin is a novelist.
